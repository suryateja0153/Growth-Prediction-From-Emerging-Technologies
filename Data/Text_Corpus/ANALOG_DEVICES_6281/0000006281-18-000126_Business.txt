These components are classified as either discrete devices, such as individual transistors or ICs, in which a number of transistors and other elements are combined to form a more complicated electronic circuit. ICs may be divided into two general categories, digital and analog.  Digital circuits, such as memory devices and microprocessors, generally process on-off electrical signals, represented by binary digits, “1” and “0.”  In contrast, analog ICs monitor, condition, amplify or transform continuous analog signals associated with physical properties, such as temperature, pressure, weight, light, sound or motion, and play an important role in bridging between real world phenomena and a variety of electronic systems.  Analog ICs also provide voltage regulation and power control to electronic systems.Principal ProductsWe design, manufacture and market a broad line of high-performance ICs that incorporate analog, mixed-signal and digital signal processing technologies. Our ICs are designed to address a wide range of real-world signal processing applications. We sell our ICs to tens of thousands of customers worldwide, many of whom use products spanning our core technologies in a wide range of applications. Our IC product portfolio includes both general-purpose products used by a broad range of customers and applications, as well as application-specific products designed for specific clusters of customers in key target markets. By using readily available, high-performance, general-purpose products in their systems, our customers can reduce the time they need to bring new products to market. Given the high cost of developing more customized ICs, our standard products often provide a cost-effective solution for many low to medium volume applications. We also focus on working with leading customers to design application-specific solutions. We begin with our existing core technologies, which leverage our data conversion, amplification, RF and microwave, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), power management and DSP capabilities, and devise a solution to more closely meet the needs of a specific customer or group of customers. Because we have already developed the core technology platform for our general-purpose products, we can create application-specific solutions quickly.We produce and market a broad range of ICs and operate in one reportable segment based on the aggregation of eight operating segments. The ICs sold by each of our operating segments are manufactured using similar semiconductor manufacturing processes and raw materials in either our own production facilities or by third-party wafer fabricators using proprietary processes.  Our ICs are sold to customers globally through a direct sales force, third-party distributors, independent sales representatives and via our website. Our technology offerings are aligned with the predominant markets served in order to facilitate decision making throughout our organization. Our ten highest revenue products, in the aggregate, accounted for approximately 10% of our revenue for our fiscal year ended November 3, 2018 (fiscal 2018). Analog ProductsOur analog and mixed signal IC technology has been the foundation of our business for over five decades, and we are one of the world’s largest suppliers of high-performance analog ICs. Our analog signal processing ICs are primarily high-performance devices, offering higher dynamic range, greater bandwidth, and other enhanced features. We believe that the principal advantages these products have as compared to competitors’ products include higher accuracy, higher speed, lower cost per function, smaller size, lower power consumption and fewer components, resulting in improved performance and reliability. Our product portfolio includes several thousand analog ICs, any one of which can have as many as several hundred customers. Our analog ICs typically have long product life cycles. Our analog IC customers include original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and customers who build electronic subsystems for integration into larger systems.Converters — We are a leading supplier of data converter products. Data converters translate real-world analog signals into digital data and also translate digital data into analog signals. Data converters remain our largest and most diverse product family and an area where we are continuously innovating to enable our customers to redefine and differentiate their products. Our converter products combine sampling rates and accuracy with the low noise, power, price and small package size required by industrial, automotive, consumer, and communications electronics.Amplifiers/Radio Frequency (RF) and Microwave— We are also a leading supplier of high-performance amplifiers. Amplifiers are used to condition analog signals. High performance amplifiers emphasize the performance dimensions of speed and precision. Within this product portfolio we provide precision, instrumentation, high speed, intermediate frequency/RF/microwave, broadband, and other amplifiers. Our analog product line also includes a broad portfolio of high performance RF and microwave ICs covering the entire RF signal chain, from industry-leading stand-alone RF function blocks such as phase locked loops, frequency synthesizers, mixers, modulators, demodulators, and power detectors, to highly integrated broadband and short-range single chip transceiver solutions. Our high performance RF and microwave ICs support the high performance requirements of cellular infrastructure and a broad range of applications in our target markets, including instrumentation, aerospace and automotive.3Power Management & Reference — Power management and reference products, which include functions such as power conversion, driver monitoring, sequencing and energy management, provide efficient solutions for power management and conversion applications in the automotive, communications, industrial and high-end consumer markets. From portable consumer devices to automobiles to high end data centers, the performance and efficiency of modern electronic products is increasingly limited by their power supply systems. Our high performance power ICs include powerful performance, integration and software design simulation tools to provide fast and accurate power supply designs. Other Analog — Our analog technology portfolio is comprised of sensor and actuator products, including products based on MEMS technology. MEMS technology enables us to build extremely small sensors that incorporate an electromechanical structure and the supporting analog circuitry for conditioning signals obtained from the sensing element. Our MEMS product portfolio includes accelerometers used to sense acceleration, gyroscopes used to sense rotation, inertial measurement units used to sense multiple degrees of freedom combining multiple sensing types along multiple axes, and broadband switches suitable for radio and instrument systems. We offer other high performance sensors, from temperature to magnetic fields that are deployed in a variety of systems. In addition to sensor products, our other analog product category includes isolators that enable designers to implement isolation in designs without the cost, size, power, performance, and reliability constraints found with optocouplers. Our isolators have been designed into hundreds of applications, such as universal serial bus isolation in patient monitors, where it allows hospitals and physicians to adopt the latest advances in computer technology to supervise patient health and wirelessly transmit medical records. In smart metering applications, our isolators provide reliable electrostatic discharge performance that helps reduce meter tampering. Likewise, in satellites, where any malfunction can be catastrophic, our isolators help protect the power system while enabling designers to achieve small form factors.Digital Signal Processing and System ProductsDigital Signal Processing products (DSPs) are optimized for high-speed numeric calculations, which are essential for instantaneous, or real-time, processing of digital data generated, in most cases, from analog to digital signal conversion. Our DSPs are designed to be fully programmable and to efficiently execute specialized software programs, or algorithms, associated with processing digitized real-time, real-world data. Programmable DSPs are designed to provide the flexibility to modify the device’s function quickly and inexpensively using software. Our general-purpose DSP IC customers typically write their own algorithms using software development tools provided by us and third-party suppliers. Our DSPs are designed in families of products that share common architectures and therefore can execute the same software across a range of products. We support these products with easy-to-use development tools, which are designed to reduce our customers’ product development costs and time-to-market. Our customers use our products to solve a wide range of signal processing challenges across our core market and segment focus areas within the industrial, automotive, consumer and communications end markets. In many cases, DSPs are embedded with mixed signal functionality to provide System on Chip (SOC) integrated solutions, combining that analog and digital signal processing circuitry to provide a complete signal chain for demanding applications.

We have a program to file applications for and obtain patents, copyrights, mask works and trademarks in the United States and in selected foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate. We also seek to maintain our trade secrets and confidential information by nondisclosure policies and through the use of appropriate confidentiality agreements. We have obtained a substantial number of patents and trademarks in the United States and in other countries. As of November 3, 2018, we held approximately 3,263 U.S. patents and approximately 581 non-provisional pending U.S. patent applications with expiration dates ranging from 2019 through 2039. There can be no assurance, however, that the rights obtained can be successfully enforced against infringing products in every jurisdiction. While our patents, copyrights, mask works, trademarks and trade secrets provide some advantage and protection, we believe our competitive position and future success is largely determined by such factors as the system and application knowledge, innovative skills, technological expertise and management ability and experience of our personnel; the range and success of new products being developed by us; our market brand recognition and ongoing marketing efforts; and customer service and technical support. It is generally our policy to seek patent protection for significant inventions that may be patented, though we may elect, in certain cases, not to seek patent protection even for significant inventions, if we determine other protection, such as maintaining the invention as a trade secret, to be more advantageous. We also have trademarks that are used in the conduct of our business to distinguish genuine Analog Devices products, and we maintain cooperative advertising programs to promote our brands and identify products containing genuine Analog Devices components.Sales ChannelsWe sell our products globally through a direct sales force, third-party distributors, independent sales representatives and via our website. We have direct sales offices, sales representatives and/or distributors in over 50 countries outside North America.We support our worldwide sales efforts through our website and with extensive promotional programs that include editorial coverage and paid advertising in online and printed trade publications, webinars, social media and communities, promotional and training videos, direct mail programs, technical seminars and participation in trade shows. We publish, share and distribute technical content such as data sheets, application guides and catalogs.  We maintain a staff of field application engineers who aid customers in incorporating our products into their products. In addition, we offer a variety of web-based tools that ease product selection and aid in the design process for our customers.We derived approximately 56% of our fiscal 2018 revenue from sales made through distributors. These distributors typically maintain an inventory of our products. Some of them also sell products that compete with our products, including those for which we are an alternate source. We defer revenue and the related cost of sales on shipments to U.S. distributors and certain international distributors until the distributors resell the products to their customers. We make sales to distributors under agreements that allow certain distributors to receive price adjustment credits and to return qualifying products for credit, as 6determined by us, in order to reduce the amounts of slow-moving, discontinued or obsolete product from their inventory. These agreements limit such returns to a certain percentage of our shipments to that distributor during the prior quarter. In addition, certain distributors are allowed to return unsold products if we terminate the relationship with the distributor. Additional information relating to our sales to distributors is set forth in Note 2n, Revenue Recognition, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.CustomersWe have over 125,000 customers worldwide. During fiscal 2018, no sales to an individual customer accounted for more than 10% of revenue.  Apple Inc. represented approximately 14% and 12% of revenue in the fiscal year ended October 28, 2017 (fiscal 2017) and the fiscal year ended October 29, 2016 (fiscal 2016), respectively. Our customers use hundreds of different types of our products in a wide range of applications spanning the industrial, automotive, consumer and communication markets. Our 20 largest customers accounted for approximately 33% of our fiscal 2018 revenue.SeasonalitySales to customers during our first fiscal quarter may be lower than other quarters due to plant shutdowns at some of our customers during the holiday season. In general, the seasonality for any specific period of time has not had a material impact on our results of operations. In addition, as explained in our risk factors contained in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our revenue is more likely to be influenced on a quarter to quarter basis by cyclicality in the semiconductor industry.Production and Raw MaterialsMonolithic IC components are manufactured in a sequence of semiconductor production steps that include wafer fabrication, wafer testing, dicing the wafer into individual “chips,” or dice, assembly of the dice into packages and electrical testing of the devices in final packaged form. The raw materials used to manufacture these devices include silicon wafers, processing chemicals (including liquefied gases), precious metals laminates, ceramic and plastic used for packaging.We utilize, develop and employ a wide variety of manufacturing processes, primarily based on bipolar and complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) transistors, which are specifically tailored for use in fabricating high-performance analog, DSP and mixed-signal ICs. Devices such as MEMS, iCoupler®isolators and various sensors, are fabricated using specialized processes, which typically use substantially similar equipment as bipolar and CMOS processes.Our IC products are fabricated on proprietary processes at our internal production facilities in Wilmington, Massachusetts, Milpitas, California, Camas, Washington and Limerick, Ireland and also on a mix of proprietary and non-proprietary processes at third-party wafer fabricators. We currently source approximately half of our wafer requirements annually from third-party wafer fabrication foundries, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), Global Foundries, Vanguard, and others, typically where deep-submicron lithography capabilities and/or large manufacturing capacity is required.We operate an assembly and wafer sort facility in Penang, Malaysia, and test facilities in the Philippines and Singapore. We also make extensive use of third-party subcontractors for the assembly and testing of our products.Capital spending was approximately $255 million in fiscal 2018, compared with approximately $204 million in fiscal 2017 and $127 million in fiscal 2016. We expect capital expenditures for the fiscal year ending November 2, 2019 (fiscal 2019) to be approximately 4% of fiscal 2019 revenue.Our products require a wide variety of components, raw materials and external foundry services, most of which we purchase from third-party suppliers. We have multiple sources for many of the components and materials that we purchase and incorporate into our products. If any of our key suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver sufficient quantities of components to us, on the time schedule and of the quality that we require, we may be forced to seek to engage additional or replacement suppliers, which could result in significant expenses and disruptions or delays in manufacturing, product development and shipment of product to our customers. Although we have experienced shortages of components, materials and external foundry services from time to time, these items have generally been available to us as needed.BacklogBacklog at the end of fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 was approximately $1.2 billion. We define backlog as of a particular date to mean firm orders from a customer or distributor with a requested delivery date within thirteen weeks. Backlog is impacted by the tendency of customers to rely on shorter lead times available from suppliers, including us, in periods of depressed demand. In periods of increased demand, there is a tendency towards longer lead times that has the effect of increasing backlog and, in some instances, we may not have manufacturing capacity sufficient to fulfill all orders. As is 7customary in the semiconductor industry, we allow most orders to be canceled or deliveries to be delayed by customers without significant penalty. Accordingly, we believe that our backlog at any time should not be used as an indication of future revenue.We typically do not have long-term sales contracts with our customers. In some of our markets where end-user demand may be particularly volatile and difficult to predict, some customers place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it available for shipment, even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all, or even any, of the product. In other instances, we manufacture product based on forecasts of customer demand. As a result, we may incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales and are subject to the risk of cancellation of orders leading to a sharp reduction of sales and backlog. Further, those orders or forecasts may be for products that meet the customer’s unique requirements so that those canceled orders would, in addition, result in an inventory of unsaleable products, resulting in potential inventory write-offs. As a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for some of our products that are subject to these uncertainties, the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial.Government ContractsLess than 5% of our fiscal 2018 revenue was attributable to sales to the U.S. government and U.S. government contractors and subcontractors. Our government contract business is predominantly in the form of negotiated, firm, fixed-price subcontracts. Most of these contracts and subcontracts contain standard provisions relating to termination at the election of the U.S. government.AcquisitionsAn element of our business strategy involves expansion through the acquisition of businesses, assets, products or technologies that allow us to complement our existing product offerings, expand our market coverage, increase our engineering workforce or enhance our technological capabilities. From time to time, we consider acquisitions that may strengthen our business. On March 10, 2017, we completed the acquisition of Linear. The total consideration paid to acquire Linear was approximately $15.8 billion, consisting of $11.1 billion in cash financed through existing cash on hand, net proceeds from bridge and term loan facilities and proceeds received from the issuance of senior unsecured notes, $4.6 billion from the issuance of our common stock and $0.1 billion of consideration related to the replacement of outstanding equity awards held by Linear employees.Additional information relating to our acquisition activities during fiscal 2018, fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 is set forth in Note 6, Acquisitions, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. CompetitionWe believe that competitive performance in the marketplace for signal processing products depends upon multiple factors, including technological innovation, strength of brand, diversity of product portfolio, product performance, technic
