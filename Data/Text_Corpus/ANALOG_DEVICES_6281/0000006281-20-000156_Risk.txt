RISK FACTORSSet forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are descriptions of certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements in this report.  Risks Related to the Proposed Acquisition of Maxim Integrated Products, Inc.Our ability to complete the acquisition of Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. (Maxim) is subject to various closing conditions, including the receipt of consents and approvals from governmental authorities, which may impose conditions that could adversely affect us or cause the acquisition not to be completed. On July 12, 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement (the Merger Agreement) to acquire Maxim, an independent manufacturer of innovative analog and mixed-signal products and technologies. The merger is subject to a number of conditions to closing as specified in the Merger Agreement.  These closing conditions include, among others, the receipt of required approvals under certain foreign competition laws, and the absence of governmental restraints or prohibitions preventing the consummation of the merger.  No assurance can be given that the required governmental and regulatory consents and approvals will be obtained or that the required conditions to closing will be satisfied, and, if all required consents and approvals are obtained and the required conditions are satisfied, no assurance can be given as to the terms, conditions and timing of such consents and approvals.  Any delay in completing the merger could cause the combined company not to realize, or to be delayed in realizing, some or all of the benefits that we and Maxim expect to achieve if the merger is successfully completed within its expected time frame.Additionally, either we or Maxim may terminate the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances, including, among other reasons, if the merger is not completed by July 12, 2021 (which date may be extended under certain circumstances).  Under certain circumstances, including if the proposed merger is terminated due to a failure to obtain the required regulatory clearances, we may be required to pay Maxim a termination fee of $830.0 million. We can provide no assurance that the various closing conditions will be satisfied and that the necessary approvals will be obtained, or that any required conditions will not materially adversely affect the combined company following the acquisition. In addition, we can provide no assurance that these conditions will not result in the abandonment or delay of the acquisition. The occurrence of any of these events individually or in combination could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and the trading price of our common stock.The termination of the Merger Agreement could negatively impact our business. If the merger is not completed for any reason, our ongoing business may be adversely affected and, without realizing any of the expected benefits of having completed the merger, we would be subject to a number of risks, including the following:  •we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on our stock price; •we may experience negative reactions from our customers, suppliers, distributors and employees; •we will be required to pay our costs relating to the merger, such as financial advisory, legal, financing and accounting costs and associated fees and expenses, whether or not the merger is completed; •the Merger Agreement places certain restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to completion of the merger and such restrictions, the waiver of which is subject to Maxim’s consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), may prevent us from taking certain actions during the pendency of the merger; and •matters relating to the merger (including integration planning) require substantial commitments of time and resources by our management, which could otherwise have been devoted to day-to-day operations or to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to our business.In addition, we could be subject to time-consuming and costly litigation related to the merger.  For example, as previously disclosed, in August and September 2020, three lawsuits were filed against the Company in connection with our proposed acquisition of Maxim.  Two of the lawsuits were brought by purported shareholders against the Company and the members of our board of directors and the third lawsuit was brought by a purported shareholder of Maxim against Maxim, the members of Maxim’s board of directors, the Company and a subsidiary of the Company.  In exchange for certain disclosures that we and Maxim voluntarily made in Current Reports on Form 8-K filed on September 30, 2020, plaintiffs in each of the lawsuits voluntarily dismissed their actions in their entirety, with prejudice as to the named plaintiffs only and without prejudice to any other members of any putative class.From and after the date of the Merger Agreement and prior to completion of the merger, the Merger Agreement restricts us from taking specified actions without Maxim’s consent and requires that our business be conducted in the ordinary course in 10all material respects.  These restrictions may prevent us from making appropriate changes to our business or organizational structure or from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the merger, and could have the effect of delaying or preventing other strategic transactions.  Adverse effects arising from these restrictions during the pendency of the merger could be exacerbated by any delays in consummation of the merger or termination of the Merger Agreement.     Whether or not the merger is completed, the announcement and pendency of the merger could cause disruptions in our business, which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results. Whether or not the merger is completed, the announcement and pendency of the merger could cause disruptions in our business.  Specifically:  •our and Maxim’s current and prospective employees will experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company, which might adversely affect the two companies’ abilities to retain key managers and other employees; •uncertainty regarding the completion of the merger may cause our and Maxim’s customers, suppliers, distributors, vendors, strategic partners or others that deal with us or Maxim to delay or defer entering into contracts with us or Maxim, make other decisions concerning us or Maxim, or seek to change or cancel existing business relationships with us or Maxim, which could negatively affect our respective businesses; •the Merger Agreement restricts us and our subsidiaries from taking specified actions during the pendency of the merger without Maxim’s consent, which may prevent us from pursuing attractive business opportunities or strategic transactions that may arise prior to the completion of the merger; and •the attention of our and Maxim’s management may be directed toward the completion of the merger. We have diverted significant management resources in an effort to complete the merger and are subject to restrictions contained in the Merger Agreement on the conduct of our business.  If the merger is not completed, we will have incurred significant costs, including the diversion of management resources, for which we will have received little or no benefit. We will incur significant acquisition-related costs in connection with the Maxim acquisition, and the combined company could incur substantial expenses related to the integration of Maxim.We have incurred and expect to incur a number of non-recurring costs associated with combining the operations of the two companies, as well as transaction fees and other costs related to the merger.  These costs and expenses include fees paid to financial, legal and accounting advisors, facilities and systems consolidation costs, severance and other potential employment-related costs, including severance payments that may be made to certain Maxim employees, filing fees, printing expenses and other related charges.  We will need to pay some of these costs regardless of whether the merger is completed. The combined company will also incur restructuring and integration costs in connection with the merger.  The costs related to restructuring will be expensed as a cost of the ongoing results of operations of either us or the combined company.  There are a large number of processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems that must be integrated in connection with the merger and the integration of Maxim’s business.  Although we expect that the elimination of duplicative costs, strategic benefits, and additional income, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses, may offset incremental transaction, merger-related and restructuring costs over time, any net benefit may not be achieved in the near term or at all.  We will bear many of these costs even if the merger is not completed.  While we have assumed that certain expenses would be incurred in connection with the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, there are many factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or the timing of the integration and implementation expenses. Combining our business with Maxim’s may be more difficult, costly or time-consuming than expected and the combined company may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger, which may adversely affect the combined company’s business results and negatively affect the value of the combined company’s common stock.  The success of the merger will depend on, among other things, the ability of the two companies to combine their businesses in a manner that facilitates growth opportunities and realizes expected cost savings.  The combined company may encounter difficulties in integrating our and Maxim’s businesses and realizing the anticipated benefits of the merger. The combined company must achieve the anticipated growth and cost savings without adversely affecting current revenues and investments in future growth.  If the combined company is not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected.The merger involves the combination of two companies which currently operate, and until the completion of the merger will continue to operate, as independent public companies. There can be no assurances that our respective businesses can be integrated successfully.  It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees from both 11companies, the loss of customers, the disruption of our, Maxim’s or both companies’ ongoing businesses, inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies, unexpected integration issues, higher than expected integration costs and an overall post-completion integration process that takes longer than originally anticipated. The combined company will be required to devote management attention and resources to integrating its business practices and operations, and prior to the merger, management attention and resources will be required to plan for such integration. Potential difficulties the combined company may encounter in the integration process include the following:  •lost sales and customers as a result of certain of our and/or Maxim's customers deciding not to do business with the combined company, or deciding to decrease their amount of business in order to reduce their reliance on a single company;•integrating personnel from the two companies while maintaining focus on providing consistent, high-quality products and services, especially in the COVID-19 environment which has required employees to work remotely in some locations;•potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses, delays or regulatory conditions associated with the merger; and•our and/or Maxim's performance shortfalls as a result of the diversion of management’s attention caused by completing the merger and integrating the companies’ operations.Any of these factors could result in the combined company failing to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, on the expected timeline or at all. An inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefits of the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, as well as any delays encountered in the integration process, could have an adverse effect upon the revenues, level of expenses and operating results of the combined company, which may adversely affect the value of the common stock of the combined company. In addition, the actual integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses, and the anticipated benefits of the integration plan may not be realized.  Actual growth and cost savings, if achieved, may be lower than what we and Maxim expect and may take longer to achieve than anticipated.  If we and Maxim are not able to adequately address integration challenges, we may be unable to successfully integrate their operations or realize the anticipated benefits of the integration of the two companies. The market value of our common stock could decline if large amounts of our common stock are sold following the Maxim acquisition.If the merger is consummated, it is expected that we will issue a significant number of shares of our common stock to former Maxim stockholders.  Former Maxim stockholders may decide not to hold the shares of our common stock that they will receive in the merger, and our shareholders may decide to reduce their investment in us as a result of the changes to our investment profile as a result of the merger.  Other Maxim stockholders, such as funds with limitations on their permitted holdings of stock in individual issuers, may be required to sell the shares of our common stock that they receive in the merger.  Such sales of our common stock could have the effect of depressing the market price for our common stock.Risks Related to our Global OperationsThe extent to which the novel strain of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic will adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations is uncertain.The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in government authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders, and shutdowns. These measures have adversely impacted and are expected to further adversely impact our workforce and operations, the operations of our customers, and those of our respective vendors and suppliers. We have significant operations worldwide, including in the United States, the Philippines, Ireland, Singapore, Malaysia, China, and India, and each of these countries has been affected by the pandemic and taken measures to try to contain it, resulting in disruptions at some of our manufacturing operations and facilities. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the impact, and expected duration, of such measures and potential future measures, and restrictions on our access to our facilities or on our support operations or workforce, or similar limitations for our vendors and suppliers. Increased restrictions on or disruptions of transportation, such as reduced availability of air transport, port closures, and increased border controls or closures, would limit our capacity to meet customer demand and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.The spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our business practices, including restricting employee travel, modifying employee work locations, and canceling physical participation in meetings, events and conferences, and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, and suppliers. For example, many of our employees are temporarily working remotely, which may impact 12our business operations or customer relationships.  Such actions may result in further disruptions to our supply chain, manufacturing operations and facilities, and workforce. We cannot provide assurance that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by COVID-19, and our ability to perform critical functions could be harmed.The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty and has caused an economic slowdown that is likely to continue and result in a global recession. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to disruption and volatility in the global capital markets, which may adversely affect our and our customers’ and suppliers’ liquidity, cost of capital and ability to access the capital markets. As a result, the continued spread of COVID-19 could cause further disruption in our supply chain and customer demand, and could adversely affect the ability of our customers to perform, including in making timely payments to us, which could further adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.We cannot at this time fully quantify or forecast the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. The degree to which the pandemic impacts our business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain, including the scope and duration of the pandemic, the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, or how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume.Political and economic uncertainty as well as disruptions in global credit and financial markets could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.Continuing political and global macroeconomic uncertainty, including related to the COVID-19 pandemic, trade and political disputes between the United States and China, and the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union, and uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets may lead consumers and businesses to postpone or reduce spending, which may cause our customers to cancel, decrease or delay their existing and future orders for our products and make it difficult for us to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities.  Financial difficulties experienced by our customers could result in nonpayment or payment delays for previously purchased products, thereby increasing our credit risk exposure.  Uncertainty regarding the macroeconomic conditions as well as the future stability of the global credit and financial markets could cause the value of the currency in the affected markets to deteriorate, thus reducing the purchasing power of those customers. Significant disruption to global credit and financial markets may also adversely affect our ability to access external financing sources on acceptable terms.  In addition, financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers, distributors or customers could result in product delays, increased accounts receivable defaults and inventory challenges. If economic conditions deteriorate, we may record additional charges relating to restructuring costs or the impairment of assets and our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.We are exposed to business, economic, political, legal, regulatory and other risks through our significant worldwide operations, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.We have significant operations and manufacturing facilities outside the United States, including in Ireland, the Philippines, Singapore and Malaysia. A significant portion of our revenue is derived from customers in international markets, and we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue in the future.  Risks associated with our international business operations include the following:•political, legal and economic changes, crises or instability and civil unrest in markets in which we do business, including potential macroeconomic weakness related to trade and political disputes between the United States and China, the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union and the implementation of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement;•compliance requirements of U.S. customs and export regulations, including the Export Administration Regulations and the International Traffic and Arms Regulations;•currency conversion risks and exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations, including the potential impact of the transition from LIBOR;•trade policy, commercial, travel, export or taxation disputes or restrictions, government sanctions, import or export tariffs, changes to export classifications or other restrictions imposed by the U.S. government or by the governments of the countries in which we do business, particularly in China; •complex, varying and changing government regulations and legal standards and requirements, particularly with respect to tax regulations, price protection, competition practices, export control regulations and restrictions, customs and tax requirements, immigration, anti-boycott regulations, data privacy, intellectual property, anti-corruption and environmental compliance, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;•economic disruption from terrorism and threats of terrorism and the response to them by the U.S. and its allies;•increased managerial complexities, including different employment practices and labor issues;•changes in immigration laws, regulations and procedures and enforcement practices of various government agencies;13•greater difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights and weaker laws protecting such rights;•natural disasters or public health emergencies, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic;•transportation disruptions and delays and increases in labor and transportation costs;•changes to foreign taxes, tariffs and freight rates;•fluctuations in raw material costs and energy costs;•greater difficulty in accounts receivable collections and longer collection periods; and•costs associated with our foreign defined benefit pension plans.Any of these risks, or any other risks related to international business operations, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Many of these risks are present within our business operations in China.  For example, changes in U.S.-China relations, the political environment or international trade policies and relations could result in further revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement, increased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of import or export duties and tariffs, restrictions on imports or exports, currency revaluations, or retaliatory actions, which have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our business plans and operating results. For example, the U.S. government has recently expanded export restrictions that limit our ability to sell to certain Chinese companies and to third parties that do business with those companies. These restrictions may negatively impact demand for our products, including by causing our current or potential customers to amass large inventories of our products, replace our products with products from another supplier that is not subject to the export restrictions, or focus on building indigenous semiconductor capacity to reduce reliance on U.S. suppliers. Furthermore, if these export restrictions cause our current or potential customers to view U.S. companies as unreliable, we could suffer reputational damage or lose business to foreign competitors who are not subject to such export restrictions, and our business could be materially harmed. We are continuing to evaluate the impact of these restrictions on our business, but these actions may have direct and indirect adverse impacts on our revenues and results of operations in China and elsewhere. In addition, our success in the Chinese markets may be adversely affected by China's continuously evolving policies, laws and regulations, including those relating to antitrust, cybersecurity and data protection, the environment, indigenous innovation and the promotion of a domestic semiconductor industry, and intellectual property rights and enforcement and protection of those rights. If we are unable to address our U.S. cash requirements, it may be necessary for us to consider repatriation of foreign earnings, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.We carry outside basis differences in certain of our subsidiaries, primarily arising from acquisition accounting adjustments and undistributed earnings that are considered indefinitely reinvested. We intend to reinvest these funds in our international operations, and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these earnings to fund our U.S. cash requirements.  We require a substantial amount of cash in the United States for operating requirements, stock repurchases, cash dividends and acquisitions. If we are unable to address our U.S. cash requirements through operations, borrowings under our current revolving credit facility, future debt or equity offerings or other sources of cash obtained at an acceptable cost, it may be necessary for us to consider repatriation of earnings that are indefinitely reinvested, and we may be required to pay additional taxes under current tax laws, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.Risks Related to our Business, Industry and PartnersOur future revenue, gross margins, operating results, net income and earnings per share are difficult to predict and may materially fluctuate.Our future revenue, gross margins, operating results, net income and earnings per share are difficult to predict and may be materially affected by a number of factors, including:•the extent of the impact and the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic;•the effects of adverse economic conditions in the markets in which we sell our products;•changes in customer demand or order patterns for our products and/or for end products that incorporate our products;•the timing, delay, reduction or cancellation of significant customer orders and our ability to manage inventory;•our ability to accurately forecast distributor demand for our products;•our ability to accurately estimate future distributor pricing credits and/or stock rotation rights;•our ability to effectively manage our cost structure in both the short term and over a longer duration;•changes in geographic, product or customer mix;14•changes in our effective tax rates or new or revised tax legislation in the United States, Ireland or worldwide; •the effects of issued, threatened or retaliatory government sanctions, trade barriers or economic restrictions; changes in law, regulations or other restrictions, including executive orders; and changes in import and export regulations, including restrictions on exports to certain companies or to third parties that do business with such companies, export classifications, or duties and tariffs, particularly with respect to China; •the timing of new product announcements or introductions by us, our customers or our competitors and the market acceptance of such products;•pricing decisions and competitive pricing pressures;•fluctuations in manufacturing yields, adequate availability of wafers and other raw materials, and manufacturing, assembly and test capacity;•the ability of our third-party suppliers, subcontractors and manufacturers to supply us with sufficient quantities of raw materials, products and/or components;•a decline in infrastructure spending by foreign governments, including China;•a decline in the U.S. government defense budget, changes in spending or budgetary priorities, a prolonged U.S. government shutdown or delays in contract awards;•any significant decline in our backlog;•our ability to recruit, hire, retain and motivate adequate numbers of engineers and other qualified employees to meet the demands of our customers;•our ability to generate new design opportunities and win competitive bid selection processes;•the increasing costs of providing employee benefits worldwide, including health insurance, retirement plan and pension plan contributions and retirement benefits; •our ability to utilize our manufacturing facilities at efficient levels;•potential significant litigation-related costs or product liability, warranty and/or indemnity claims, including those not covered by our suppliers or insurers;•the difficulties inherent in forecasting future operating expense levels, including with respect to costs associated with labor, utilities, transportation and raw materials;•the costs related to compliance with increasing worldwide government, environmental and social responsibility standards; •new accounting pronouncements or changes in existing accounting standards and practices; and•the effects of public health emergencies, civil unrest, natural disasters, widespread travel disruptions, security risks, terrorist activities, international conflicts and other events beyond our control.In addition, the semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic upturns and downturns. Our business and certain of the end markets we serve are also subject to rapid technological changes and material fluctuations in demand based on end-user preferences.  There can be no assurance (i) that products stocked in our inventory will not be rendered obsolete before we ship them, or (ii) that we will be able to design, develop and produce products in a timely fashion to accommodate changing customer demand. As a result of these and other factors, we may experience material fluctuations in future revenue, gross margins, operating results, net income and earnings per share on a quarterly or annual basis.  Our historical financial performance and results of operations should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance or results.  In addition, if our revenue, gross margins, operating results, net income and earnings per share results or expectations do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, the market price of our common stock may decline.    Increases in our effective tax rate and exposure to additional tax liabilities may adversely impact our results of operations.Our effective tax rate reflects the applicable tax rate in effect in the various tax jurisdictions around the world where our income is earned.  Our effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2020 was below our U.S. federal statutory rate of 21%.  This is primarily due to lower statutory tax rates applicable to our operations in the foreign jurisdictions in which we earn income. A number of factors may increase our future effective tax rate, including: new or revised tax laws or legislation or the interpretation of such laws or legislation by governmental authorities; increases in tax rates in various jurisdictions; variation in the mix of jurisdictions in which our profits are earned and taxed; deferred taxes arising from basis differences in investments in foreign subsidiaries; any adverse resolution of ongoing tax audits or adverse rulings from taxing authorities worldwide, including our current transfer pricing appeal in Ireland; changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including executive compensation subject to the limitations of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code and amortization 15of assets acquired in connection with strategic transactions; decreased availability of tax deductions for stock-based compensation awards worldwide; and changes in available tax credits. In addition, we have a partial tax holiday through July 2025 in Malaysia. The ability to extend such tax holiday beyond its expiration date cannot be assured. In addition, if we fail to meet certain conditions of the tax holiday, we may lose the benefit of the tax holiday and/or be subject to additional taxes and/or penalties. Any significant increase in our future effective tax rate could adversely impact our net income during future periods.Compliance with
