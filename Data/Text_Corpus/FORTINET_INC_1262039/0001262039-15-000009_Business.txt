Technology and ArchitectureOur proprietary FortiASIC hardware architecture, FortiOS operating system and associated security and networking functions combine to form a platform that integrates security features and enables our products to perform sophisticated security processing for networks with high throughput requirements.FortiASICOur proprietary FortiASIC family of Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (“ASICs”) is comprised of three lines of processors: the FortiASIC content processor (“CP”), the FortiASIC network processor (“NP”), and the FortiASIC system-on-a-chip (“SOC”). Our custom ASICs are designed to enhance the sophisticated security processing capabilities implemented in software by accelerating computation-intensive tasks such as firewall policy enforcement or IPS anomaly detection. This architecture provides the flexibility of implementing accelerated processing of new threat detection without requiring a new ASIC. The FortiASIC CP is currently included in most of our entry-level and all of our mid-range and high-end FortiGate appliances. The FortiASIC NP is currently included in some of our mid-range and high-end FortiGate appliances, delivering additional accelerated firewall and VPN performance. Entry-level FortiGate products (FortiGate 20 to 100 series) often use the SOC2. Mid-range FortiGate products (FortiGate 200 to 800 series) use a central processing unit (“CPU”) and include the NP and CP. The high-end FortiGate products (FortiGate 1000 to 5000 series) use multiple CPUs, CPs and NPs. FortiOSOur proprietary FortiOS operating system provides the foundation for the operation of all FortiGate appliances, from the core kernel functions to the security processing feature sets. FortiOS provides (i) multiple layers of security including a hardened kernel layer providing protection for the FortiGate system, (ii) a network security layer providing security for end-customers’ network infrastructures, and (iii) application content protection providing security for end-customers’ workstations and applications. FortiOS directs the operations of processors and ASICs and provides system management functions such as command-line and graphical user interfaces. Key high-level functions and capabilities of FortiOS include:•helping enable FortiGate appliances to be configured into different security environments such as our Internal Network Firewall, Next Generation Firewall, and the Data Center Firewall;•configuration of the physical aspects of the appliance such as ports, Wi-Fi and switching;•key network functions such as routing and deployment modes (network routing, transparent, sniffer, etc.);•implementation of security updates delivering advanced threat protection, such as IPS, antivirus, and application control;•access to cloud-based web and email filtering databases;•security policy objects and enforcement; •data leak prevention and document finger printing; and•real-time reporting and logging.We make updates to FortiOS available through our FortiCare technical support services. FortiOS also enables advanced, integrated routing and switching, allowing end-customers to deploy FortiGate devices within a wide variety of networks, as well as providing a direct replacement solution option for legacy switching and routing equipment.

Manufacturing and SuppliersWe outsource the manufacturing of our security appliance products to a variety of contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers. Our current manufacturing partners include Flextronics International Ltd., Micro-Star International Co., Ltd., Adlink Technology, Inc., Senao Networks, Inc., and a number of Taiwan-based manufacturers. We submit purchase orders to our contract manufacturers that describe the type and quantities of our products to be manufactured, the delivery date and other delivery terms. Once our products are manufactured, they are sent to either our headquarters in Sunnyvale, California, or to our logistics partner in Taoyuan City, Taiwan, where accessory packaging and quality-control testing are performed. We believe that outsourcing our manufacturing and a substantial portion of our logistics enables us to focus resources on our core competencies. Our proprietary FortiASICs, which are the key to the performance of our appliances, are fabricated by contract manufacturers in foundries operated by United Microelectronics Corporation (“UMC”) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (“TSMC”). Faraday Technology Corporation (using UMC’s foundry), Kawasaki Microelectronics America, Inc. (“K-Micro”) (using TSMC’s foundry) and Renesas Electronics Corporation (“Renesas”) (using UMC’s foundry) manufacture our ASICs on a purchase order basis. Accordingly, they are not obligated to continue to fulfill our supply requirements, and the prices we are charged for the fabrication of our ASICs could be increased on short notice.The components included in our products are sourced from various suppliers by us or more frequently by our contract manufacturers. Some of the components important to our business, including specific types of central processing units from Intel Corporation (“Intel”), network chips from Broadcom Corporation (“Broadcom”), Marvell Technology Group Ltd. (“Marvell”) and Intel, and solid-state drives (silicon-based storage device) from OCZ Technology Group, Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., are available from a limited or sole source of supply.We have no long-term contracts related to the manufacturing of our ASICs or other components that guarantee any capacity or pricing terms.Research and DevelopmentWe focus our research and development efforts on developing new products and systems, and adding new features to existing products and systems. Our development strategy is to identify features, products and systems for both software and hardware that are, or are expected to be, important to our end-customers. Our success in designing, developing, manufacturing and selling new or enhanced products will depend on a variety of factors, including the identification of market demand for new products, product selection, timely implementation of product design and development, product performance, effective manufacturing and assembly processes and sales and marketing.Our research and development expense was $122.9 million in fiscal 2014, $102.7 million in fiscal 2013 and $81.1 million in fiscal 2012.Intellectual Property We rely primarily on patent, trademark, copyright and trade secrets laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our technology. As of December 31, 2014, we had 191 issued U.S. and foreign patents and 156 pending U.S.  5Table of Contentsand foreign patent applications. We also license software from third parties for inclusion in our products, including open source software and other software available on commercially reasonable terms.Despite our efforts to protect our rights in our technology, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. We generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, vendors and customers, and generally limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information. However, we cannot provide assurance that the steps we take will prevent misappropriation of our technology. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the United States, and many foreign countries do not enforce these laws as diligently as government agencies and private parties in the United States.Our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Third parties have asserted, are currently asserting, and may in the future assert patent, copyright, trademark or other intellectual property rights against us, our channel partners or our end-customers. Successful claims of infringement by a third party could prevent us from distributing certain products or performing certain services or require us to pay substantial damages (including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed patents or copyrights), royalties or other fees. Even if third parties may offer a license to their technology, the terms of any offered license may not be acceptable and the failure to obtain a license or the costs associated with any license could cause our business, operating results or financial condition to be materially and adversely affected. We typically indemnify our end-customers, distributors and certain resellers against claims that our products infringe the intellectual property of third parties.SeasonalityFor information regarding seasonality in our sales, see the section entitled “—Quarterly Results of Operations—Seasonality, Cyclicality and Quarterly Revenue Trends” in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Competition The markets for our products are extremely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change. The principal competitive factors in our markets include the following: •product performance, features, effectiveness, interoperability and reliability;•our ability to add and integrate new networking and security features and technological expertise;•compliance with industry standards and certifications;•price of products and services and total cost of ownership;•brand recognition;•customer service and support;•sales and distribution capabilities;•size and financial stability of operations; and•breadth of product line.Our competitors include Cisco Systems, Inc. (“Cisco”), Juniper Networks, Inc. (“Juniper”), Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. (“Check Point”), Intel (through its acquisition of McAfee, Inc. (“McAfee”)), F5 Networks, Inc. (“F5 Networks”), Dell Inc. (through its acquisition of SonicWALL, Inc. (“SonicWALL”) , BlueCoat Systems, Inc. (“BlueCoat”), FireEye, Inc. (“FireEye”) and Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (“Palo Alto Networks”), amongst others.We believe we compete favorably based on our products’ performance, reliability and breadth, our ability to add and integrate new networking and security features and our technological expertise. Several competitors are significantly larger, have greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution, customer support and other resources, are more established than we are, and have significantly better brand recognition. Some of these larger competitors have substantially broader product offerings and leverage their relationships based on other products or incorporate functionality into existing products in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products. Based in part on these competitive pressures, we may lower prices or attempt to add incremental features and functionality.Conditions in our markets could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements or continuing market consolidation. The development and market acceptance of alternative technologies could decrease the demand for our products or render them obsolete. Our competitors may introduce products that are less costly, provide superior performance, market their products better, or achieve greater market acceptance than us. In addition, our larger competitors often have broader product lines, are in a better position to withstand any significant reduction in capital spending by end-customers in these markets,  6Table of Contentsand will therefore not be as susceptible to downturns in a particular market. The above competitive pressures are likely to continue to impact our business. We may not be able to compete successfully in the future, and competition may harm our business.EmployeesAs of December 31, 2014, our total headcount was 2,854 full-time equivalent employees. None of our U.S. employees are represented by a labor union; however, our employees in Belgium, Finland, France, Italy, and Spain are represented by collective bargaining agreements. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.Available InformationOur web site is located at www.fortinet.com, and our investor relations web site is located at http://investor.fortinet.com.
