These markets compose the primary building blocks of the IoT.Mobile DevicesIn our largest market, mobile devices, the most significant trend today is the increasing demand for ubiquitous broadband mobile data.  This is driven primarily by video, with data traffic for video exceeding data traffic for web browsing and voice.  Compounding this, consumers want higher resolution screens and access to streaming media, real-time traffic/navigation, GPS, Bluetooth® connectivity and Wi-Fi.  In response, leading smartphone providers are adding 4G LTE and 5G bands of coverage to their flagship devices to reduce development costs and enable larger, more concentrated marketing budgets in support of fewer models.  They are also adding CA technology to enable simultaneous communication over multiple frequency bands.  This helps network operators optimize spectral efficiency and provides an enhanced user experience for consumers.  Both trends expand RF content and drive higher levels of integration, which can increase performance requirements for RF components and narrow the competitive field.  We see these trends continuing, as consumers increasingly expect always-on, ultra-low latency, broadband connectivity and as smartphone manufacturers and network operators seek to enhance performance and the user experience generation-over-generation.5Table of ContentsDefense and AerospaceThe global defense and aerospace industries are sharply focused on balancing cost, RF performance and power consumption.  The trends toward phased arrays and higher frequencies of operation are expanding the market opportunities for monolithic microwave integrated circuits ("MMICs") and discrete PAs, LNAs, passive devices, die level solutions and multichip modules leveraging multiple semiconductor technologies and advanced packaging techniques.  Additionally, as with all RF communications systems, spectrum is becoming increasingly crowded and requires interference-free connections which are addressed by premium filtering solutions.  These factors continue to drive demand for increased reliability and performance to address current and next generation communications for defense and national security capabilities, both domestic and with international partners.CPE Wi-FiIn Wi-Fi markets, consumer and enterprise demand for faster data rates, the growth in connected users and the higher performance requirements of 802.11ac and 802.11ax mandate best-in-class RF solutions.  Wi-Fi is continuing to proliferate within CPE, including routers, access points, set-top boxes and smart televisions, as well as in automobiles.  As spectrum becomes more crowded, the demand for interference-free transmission and reception is expected to drive the demand for high performance filters in RF solutions for Wi-Fi equipment.Cellular Base StationsThe widespread use of data-intensive applications has driven cellular operators to require more power-efficient designs and solutions that enable increased capacity from cellular networks.  To meet network demand, network equipment manufacturers are using techniques such as CA, moving to new RF frequency bands that have wider channel bandwidths and incorporating cloud radio access networks, which use a virtual radio access technology and remote radio heads.  As demand for data-intensive applications continues to grow, the next generation network, called 5G, is forecasted to begin commercial rollout in 2020.  5G networks will continue the progression of operating at much higher frequencies, likely at 28GHz and 39GHz.  In the meantime, operators will continue to evolve the performance of their LTE networks and run field trials to prove out 5G technologies and solutions.  The future trends in the base station market include implementation of Multiple Input Multiple Output ("MIMO") and small cells.Optical The optical market is comprised of traditional long haul, telecom network applications and hyperscale data center applications.  Telecom applications typically involve high-speed networks of fiber optic cable to enable voice and data communications in a transcontinental, regional or city-wide area.  Data center applications support the processing and routing of massive amounts of internet data traffic to, from and within hyperscale facilities used by Web 2.0 participants like Facebook, Google and Amazon in support of their proprietary, cloud-based applications.  High-speed throughput, efficient power consumption and cost efficiency are key attributes of the hyperscale data center market.Automotive ConnectivityThe automobile is becoming a more connected device with the addition of multiple RF based connectivity solutions such as satellite radio, in-car infotainment and LTE connectivity solutions.  Looking forward, new standards are expected to be deployed that will connect the car to other vehicles or to highway infrastructure.  All of these applications create opportunities that will drive the need for RF solutions that will enhance passenger comfort, convenience and safety.  Most of these applications require AEC-Q100 qualified solutions, which is the standard in the automobile industry.  Additionally, in this market most of the communications devices will need to share frequency spectrum with either licensed or unlicensed users. Smart HomeThe smart home is characterized as a dwelling that contains devices such as sensors that detect light, motion or temperature, or whether doors are open, closed, locked or unlocked, and actuators to implement a command such as lowering the temperature or opening your garage door.  Typically, these devices can be controlled via the internet, by a computer or phone or through a direct peer-to-peer connection such as a television remote control.  The solutions often utilize industry open standard technologies like Bluetooth Low Energy ("BLE"), ZigBee, and Thread as well as proprietary solutions to link to a central gateway that connects to the internet.  Other Markets We also participate in several smaller markets including broadband cable, point-to-point radio, Very Small Aperture Terminal ("VSAT") and cellular machine-to-machine ("M2M") applications. 6Table of ContentsProducts and ApplicationsOur semiconductor solutions serve RF, microwave and millimeter-wave applications.

Manufacturing The majority of our products are multi-chip modules utilizing multiple semiconductor and acoustic material processing technologies.  These products have varying degrees of complexity and contain semiconductors and other components that are manufactured in-house or outsourced.  We are a leading supplier of RF solutions and a leading manufacturer of GaAs HBT, GaAs pHEMT, GaN, SAW, TC-SAW and BAW products. We operate wafer fabrication facilities for the production of GaAs, GaN, SAW, TC-SAW and BAW wafers in Apopka, Florida; Greensboro, North Carolina; Hillsboro, Oregon; and Richardson, Texas.  We also use multiple silicon-based process technologies, including SOI, SiGe and CMOS.  We outsource all silicon manufacturing to leading silicon foundries located throughout the world. We have a global supply chain and ship millions of units per day.We have our own flip chip and wafer-level packaging ("WLP") technologies and we also use external suppliers for these and other packaging technologies.  In flip chip packages, the electrical connections are created directly on the surface of the die, which eliminates wirebonds so the die may be attached directly to a substrate or leadframe.  This type of technology provides a higher density interconnection than wirebonded die and enables smaller form factors with improved thermal and electrical performance.  We use WLP technologies for our SAW, TC-SAW and BAW filter products.Once semiconductor wafers are manufactured, they are singulated, or separated, into individual units called die.  Prior to singulation of wafers into die, we regularly conduct wafer level tests which could include electrical validation, RF testing through the designed frequency bands, as well as visual inspection.  For module products, the next step is assembly.  During assembly, the die and other components are placed on high-density interconnect substrates to provide connectivity between the die and the components.  This populated substrate is formed into a microelectronic package.  Next, the products are tested for RF performance and prepared for shipment through a tape and reel process.  We primarily use internal assembly facilities in China, Costa Rica, Germany, and the U.S., and we also utilize external suppliers.  We also manufacture large volumes of WLP die and discrete filters that our customers directly assemble into their products.Manufacturing yields can vary significantly between products, based on a number of factors, including product complexity and the maturity of our manufacturing processes.  To maximize wafer yields and quality, we test products multiple times, maintain continuous reliability monitoring and conduct numerous quality control inspections throughout the production flow. Our internal manufacturing facilities require a high level of fixed costs, consisting primarily of occupancy costs, maintenance, repair, equipment depreciation, and fixed labor costs related to manufacturing and process engineering.ICs and filter products are highly complex and sensitive to contaminants, and semiconductor fabrication requires highly controlled, clean environments.  Wafers can be rejected or die on a wafer can be found to be nonfunctional as a result of minute impurities, variances in the fabrication process or defects in the masks used to transfer circuits onto the wafers.Our manufacturing facilities worldwide are certified to the ISO 9001 quality standard, and select locations are certified to additional automotive (IATF 16949), aerospace (AS 9100) and environmental (ISO 14001) standards.  9Table of ContentsThese stringent standards are audited and certified by third-party auditors in addition to our continuous internal self-audits.  The ISO 9001 standard is based on a number of quality management principles including a strong customer focus, the motivation of top management, the process approach and continual improvement.  IATF 16949 is the highest international quality standard for the global automotive industry and incorporates specific additional requirements for the automotive industry.  AS 9100 is the standardized quality management system for the aerospace industry.  ISO 14001 is an internationally agreed upon standard for an environmental management system.  We require that all of our key vendors and suppliers be compliant with select standards, as applicable.Raw Materials We purchase numerous raw materials, passive components and substrates for our products and manufacturing processes.  For our GaAs and GaN manufacturing operations, we use several raw materials, including GaAs wafers and GaN on SiC wafers.  For our acoustic filter manufacturing operations, we use several raw materials, including wafer starting materials made from quartz, silicon, lithium niobate or lithium tantalite, as well as ceramic or metal packages.  Relatively few companies produce these materials.  Our most significant suppliers of ceramic surface mount packages are based in Japan.For our silicon-based products, we use third-party foundries.  High demand for silicon wafers and wafer starting materials has led to supply constraints from time-to-time, and we have attempted to address this by qualifying multiple silicon foundries and by obtaining supply commitments, in some cases in exchange for purchase or capital commitments by us.Our manufacturing strategy includes a balance of internal and external sites (primarily for assembly and test operations), which helps reduce costs, provides flexibility of supply, and minimizes the risk of supply disruption.  We routinely qualify multiple sources of supply and manufacturing sites to reduce the risk of supply interruptions or price increases and closely monitor suppliers’ key performance indicators.  Our suppliers' and our manufacturing sites are geographically diversified (with our largest volume sources distributed throughout Southern and Eastern Asia).  We believe we have adequate sources for the supply of raw materials, passive components and substrates for our products and manufacturing needs.CustomersWe design, develop, manufacture and market products for leading U.S. and international OEMs and ODMs.  We also collaborate with leading baseband reference design partners located primarily in the U.S. and China.
