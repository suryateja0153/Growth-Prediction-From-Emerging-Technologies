Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business, Industry and Partners - Our revenue may fluctuate while our operating expenses are relatively fixed, which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our results to fall short of expectations.”     Product DefectOur products are complex and may contain defects or experience failures due to any number of issues in design, fabrication, packaging, materials and/or use within a system. If any of our products or technologies contains a defect, compatibility issue or other error, we may have to invest additional research and development efforts to find and correct the issue.  Such efforts could divert our management’s and engineers’ attention from the development of new products and technologies and could increase our operating costs and reduce our gross margin. In addition, an error or defect in new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design wins. Also, we may be required to reimburse customers, including for customers’ costs to repair or replace the products in the field, which could cause our revenue to decline. A product recall or a significant number of product returns could be expensive, damage our reputation and could result in the shifting of business to our competitors. Costs associated with correcting defects, errors, bugs or other issues could be significant and could materially harm our financial results.  As of January 29, 2012, we recorded a total cumulative net charge of $475.9 million, of which $466.4 million has been charged against cost of revenue and the remainder has been charged to sales, general and administrative to cover customer warranty, repair, return, replacement and other costs arising from a weak die/packaging material set in certain versions of our previous generation MCP and GPU products and used in notebook configurations.   Included in the charge are the costs of implementing a settlement with the plaintiffs of a putative consumer class action lawsuit related to this same matter and other related estimated consumer class action settlements.   The previous generation MCP and GPU products that are impacted were included in a number of notebook products that were shipped and sold in significant quantities. Certain notebook configurations of these products are failing in the field at higher than normal rates. Testing suggests a weak material set of die/package combination, system thermal management designs, and customer use patterns are contributing factors for these failures. We have worked with our customers to develop and have made available for download a software driver to cause the system fan to begin operation at the powering up of the system and reduce the thermal stress on these chips. We have also recommended to our customers that they consider changing the thermal management of the products in their notebook system designs. We intend to fully support our customers in their repair and replacement of these impacted products that fail, and their other efforts to mitigate the consequences of these failures. The weak die/packaging material combination is not used in any of our products that are currently in production.Contractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of January 29, 2012:Contractual ObligationsTotal Within 1 Year 2-3 Years 4-5 Years After 5 Years All Other (In thousands)Operating leases$158,903 $34,567 $52,540 $38,699 $33,097 $—Capital lease35,540 4,821 9,813 10,144 10,762 —Purchase obligations (1)561,331 561,331 — — — —Uncertain tax positions, interest and penalties (2)147,819 — — — — 147,819Capital purchase obligations40,503 40,503 — — — —Total contractual obligations$944,096 $641,222 $62,353 $48,843 $43,859 $147,819(1)Represents our inventory purchase commitments as of January 29, 2012.(2)Represents unrecognized tax benefits of $147.8 million which consists of $53.5 million recorded in non-current income taxes payable and $84.8 million reflected as a reduction to the related deferred tax assets, and the related interest and penalties on the non-current income tax payable of $9.5 million as of January 29, 2012.  We are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of any potential tax liability or interest/penalty payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the underlying income tax positions and the timing of the effective settlement of such tax positions.54Table of ContentsOff-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAs of January 29, 2012, we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Regulation S-K 303(a)(4)(ii).Adoption of New and Recently Issued Accounting PronouncementsPlease see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K for a discussion of adoption of new and recently issued accounting pronouncements.
