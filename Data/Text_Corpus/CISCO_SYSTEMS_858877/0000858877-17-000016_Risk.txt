Risk Factors” in this report.We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors because of our intent to return a stated percentage of free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases. We further regard free cash flow as a useful measure because it reflects cash that can be used to, among other things, invest in our business, make strategic acquisitions, repurchase common stock, and pay dividends on our common stock, after deducting capital investments. A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance and liquidity is that the free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the period.  In addition, we have other required uses of cash, including repaying the principal of our outstanding indebtedness. Free cash flow is not a measure calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and should not be regarded in isolation or as an alternative for net income provided by operating activities or any other measure calculated in accordance with such principles, and other companies may calculate free cash flow in a different manner than we do. The following table summarizes the dividends paid and stock repurchases (in millions, except per-share amounts):  DIVIDENDS STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM TOTALYears Ended Per Share Amount Shares Weighted-Average Price per Share Amount AmountJuly 29, 2017 $1.10 $5,511 118 $31.38 $3,706 $9,217July 30, 2016 $0.94 $4,750 148 $26.45 $3,918 $8,668July 25, 2015 $0.80 $4,086 155 $27.22 $4,234 $8,320Any future dividends are subject to the approval of our Board of Directors. Accounts Receivable, Net The following table summarizes our accounts receivable, net (in millions):   July 29, 2017 July 30, 2016 Increase (Decrease)Accounts receivable, net$5,146 $5,847 $(701)Our accounts receivable net, as of July 29, 2017 decreased by approximately 12% compared with the end of fiscal 2016, primarily due to service and product billings being more linear in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.57Table of ContentsInventory Supply Chain  The following table summarizes our inventories and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers (in millions, except annualized inventory turns):   July 29, 2017 July 30, 2016 Increase (Decrease)Inventories$1,616 $1,217 $399Annualized inventory turns12.3 14.6 (2.3)Purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers$4,640 $3,896 $744Inventory as of July 29, 2017 increased by 33% from our inventory balance at the end of fiscal 2016, and for the same period purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers increased by approximately 19%. On a combined basis, inventories and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers increased by 22% compared with the end of fiscal 2016. The increase in inventory was due to an increase in raw materials due to securing memory supply which is currently constrained and higher levels of manufactured finished goods in support of current order activity. The increase in purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers was due to securing memory supply and procuring key components for specific product areas. We believe our inventory and purchase commitments levels are in line with our current demand forecasts.Our finished goods consist of distributor inventory and deferred cost of sales and manufactured finished goods. Distributor inventory and deferred cost of sales are related to unrecognized revenue on shipments to distributors and retail partners as well as shipments to customers. Manufactured finished goods consist primarily of build-to-order and build-to-stock products.We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate component supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements and our commitment to securing manufacturing capacity. A significant portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm, noncancelable, and unconditional commitments. In certain instances, these agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed. Our purchase commitments are for short-term product manufacturing requirements as well as for commitments to suppliers to secure manufacturing capacity.Inventory and supply chain management remain areas of focus as we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility to help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements. We believe the amount of our inventory and purchase commitments is appropriate for our revenue levels.Financing Receivables and Guarantees  The following table summarizes our financing receivables (in millions):   July 29, 2017 July 30, 2016 Increase (Decrease)Lease receivables, net$2,650 $3,070 $(420)Loan receivables, net4,457 3,349 1,108Financed service contracts, net2,487 2,011 476Total, net$9,594 $8,430 $1,164Financing Receivables  Our financing arrangements include leases, loans, and financed service contracts. Lease receivables include sales-type and direct-financing leases. Arrangements related to leases are generally collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets. Our loan receivables include customers financing purchases of our hardware, software and services and also may include additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services. We also provide financing to certain qualified customers for long-term service contracts, which primarily relate to technical support services.  The majority of the revenue from these financed service contracts is deferred and is recognized ratably over the period during which the services are performed.  Financing receivables increased by 14% primarily due to a 33% increase in loan receivables driven by an increase in financing for software arrangements. We expect to continue to expand the use of our financing programs in the near term.Financing Guarantees  In the normal course of business, third parties may provide financing arrangements to our customers and channel partners under financing programs. The financing arrangements to customers provided by third parties are related to leases and loans and typically have terms of up to three years. In some cases, we provide guarantees to third parties for these lease and loan arrangements. The financing arrangements to channel partners consist of revolving short-term financing provided by third parties, generally with payment terms ranging from 60 to 90 days. In certain instances, these financing arrangements result in a transfer of our receivables to the third party. The receivables are derecognized upon transfer, as these transfers qualify as true sales, and we receive payments for the receivables from the third party based on our standard payment terms. 58Table of ContentsThe volume of channel partner financing was $27.0 billion, $26.9 billion, and $25.9 billion in fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. These financing arrangements facilitate the working capital requirements of the channel partners, and in some cases, we guarantee a portion of these arrangements. The balance of the channel partner financing subject to guarantees was $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion as of July 29, 2017 and July 30, 2016, respectively. We could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or end-user customers. Historically, our payments under these arrangements have been immaterial. Where we provide a guarantee, we defer the revenue associated with the channel partner and end-user financing arrangement in accordance with revenue recognition policies, or we record a liability for the fair value of the guarantees. In either case, the deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when the guarantee is removed. As of July 29, 2017, the total maximum potential future payments related to these guarantees was approximately $314 million, of which approximately $134 million was recorded as deferred revenue.BorrowingsSenior Notes  The following table summarizes the principal amount of our senior notes (in millions): Maturity Date July 29, 2017 July 30, 2016 Senior notes:      Floating-rate notes:      Three-month LIBOR plus 0.28%March 3, 2017(1)$— $1,000 Three-month LIBOR plus 0.60%February 21, 2018 1,000 1,000 Three-month LIBOR plus 0.31%June 15, 2018 900 900 Three-month LIBOR plus 0.50%March 1, 2019 500 500 Three-month LIBOR plus 0.34%September 20, 2019(2)500 — Fixed-rate notes:      1.10%March 3, 2017(1)— 2,400 3.15%March 14, 2017(1)— 750 1.40%February 28, 2018 1,250 1,250 1.65%June 15, 2018 1,600 1,600 4.95%February 15, 2019 2,000 2,000 1.60%February 28, 2019 1,000 1,000 2.125%March 1, 2019 1,750 1,750 1.40%September 20, 2019(2)1,500 — 4.45%January 15, 2020 2,500 2,500 2.45%June 15, 2020 1,500 1,500 2.20%February 28, 2021 2,500 2,500 2.90%March 4, 2021 500 500 1.85%September 20, 2021(2)2,000 — 3.00%June 15, 2022 500 500 2.60%February 28, 2023 500 500 2.20%September 20, 2023(2)750 — 3.625%March 4, 2024 1,000 1,000 3.50%June 15, 2025 500 500 2.95%February 28, 2026 750 750 2.50%September 20, 2026(2)1,500 — 5.90%February 15, 2039 2,000 2,000 5.50%January 15, 2040 2,000 2,000 Total  $30,500 $28,400 (1) In March 2017, we repaid senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of $4.15 billion upon maturity.(2) In September 2016, we issued senior notes for an aggregate principal amount of $6.25 billion.Interest is payable semiannually on each class of the senior fixed-rate notes, each of which is redeemable by us at any time, subject to a make-whole premium. Interest is payable quarterly on the floating-rate notes. We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of July 29, 2017.59Table of ContentsCommercial Paper  Effective March 31, 2017, we increased our borrowing capacity under our commercial paper program from $3.0 billion to $10.0 billion. We use the proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper notes for general corporate purposes. We had $3.2 billion and no commercial paper notes outstanding as of July 29, 2017 and July 30, 2016, respectively.Credit Facilities  On May 15, 2015, we entered into a credit agreement with certain institutional lenders that provides for a $3.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that is scheduled to expire on May 15, 2020. Any advances under the credit agreement will accrue interest at rates that are equal to, based on certain conditions, either (i) the highest of (a) the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50%, (b) Bank of America’s “prime rate” as announced from time to time, or (c) LIBOR, or a comparable or successor rate that is approved by the Administrative Agent (“Eurocurrency Rate”), for an interest period of one month plus 1.00%, or (ii) the Eurocurrency Rate, plus a margin that is based on our senior debt credit ratings as published by Standard & Poor’s Financial Services, LLC and Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., provided that in no event will the Eurocurrency Rate be less than zero. We may also, upon the agreement of either the then-existing lenders or additional lenders not currently parties to the agreement, increase the commitments under the credit facility by up to an additional $2.0 billion and/or extend the expiration date of the credit facility up to May 15, 2022.In addition, on March 30, 2017 we entered into a 364-Day credit agreement with certain institutional lenders that provides for a $2.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that is scheduled to expire on March 29, 2018. The credit agreement also provides us the option to, for a fee, convert any borrowings outstanding thereunder on March 29, 2018 to a term loan maturing no later than March 29, 2019. The interest rate applicable to outstanding balances under the credit agreement will be based on either (i) the higher of (a) the rates on overnight Federal Funds transactions with members of the Federal Reserve System (i.e., Federal Funds rate) plus 0.50%, (b) Bank of America’s “prime rate” as announced from time to time or (c) LIBOR for an interest period of one month plus 1.00%, or (ii) LIBOR plus a margin that is based on our senior debt credit ratings as published by S&P Global Rating, a business unit of Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC, and Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. These credit agreements require that we comply with certain covenants, including that we maintain interest coverage ratios as defined in these agreements. As of July 29, 2017, we were in compliance with the required interest coverage ratios and the other covenants, and we had not borrowed any funds under these credit facilities. Deferred Revenue   The following table presents the breakdown of deferred revenue (in millions):   July 29, 2017 July 30, 2016 Increase (Decrease)Service$11,302 $10,621 $681Product:    Deferred revenue related to recurring software and subscription offers4,971 3,308 1,663Other product deferred revenue2,221 2,543 (322)Total product deferred revenue7,192 5,851 1,341    Total$18,494 $16,472 $2,022Reported as:     Current$10,821 $10,155 $666Noncurrent7,673 6,317 1,356    Total$18,494 $16,472 $2,022Total deferred revenue increased 12% in fiscal 2017. Deferred product revenue increased 23% primarily due to increased deferrals related to recurring software and subscription offers. The portion of product deferred revenue related to recurring software and subscription offers grew 50%, to $5.0 billion, as of July 29, 2017. Wireless, Security, and Collaboration were the key product category contributors to this product deferred revenue growth during the fiscal year. Deferred service revenue increased 6% driven by the timing and amount of multiyear arrangements and our focus on contract renewals and service contract attach rates. 60Table of ContentsContractual ObligationsThe impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with the factors that impact our cash flows from operations discussed previously. In addition, we plan for and measure our liquidity and capital resources through an annual budgeting process. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at July 29, 2017 (in millions):  PAYMENTS DUE BY PERIODJuly 29, 2017Total Less than 1 Year 1 to 3 Years 3 to 5 Years More than 5 YearsOperating leases$1,237 $417 $467 $210 $143Purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers4,640 4,620 20 — —Other purchase obligations1,987 750 867 284 86Senior notes30,500 4,750 11,250 5,500 9,000Other long-term liabilities1,179 — 209 99 871Total by period$39,543 $10,537 $12,813 $6,093 $10,100Other long-term liabilities (uncertainty in the timing of future payments)1,521        Total$41,064        Operating Leases   For more information on our operating leases, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Suppliers   We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. A significant portion of our reported estimated purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm, noncancelable, and unconditional commitments. We record a liability for firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory. See further discussion in “Inventory Supply Chain.” As of July 29, 2017, the liability for these purchase commitments was $162 million and is recorded in other current liabilities and is not included in the preceding table.Other Purchase Obligations   Other purchase obligations represent an estimate of all contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business, other than operating leases and commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, for which we have not received the goods or services. Purchase orders are not included in the preceding table as they typically represent our authorization to purchase rather than binding contractual purchase obligations. Long-Term Debt   The amount of long-term debt in the preceding table represents the principal amount of the respective debt instruments. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Other Long-Term Liabilities   Other long-term liabilities primarily include noncurrent income taxes payable, accrued liabilities for deferred compensation, deferred tax liabilities, and certain other long-term liabilities. Due to the uncertainty in the timing of future payments, our noncurrent income taxes payable of approximately $1,250 million and deferred tax liabilities of $271 million were presented as one aggregated amount in the total column on a separate line in the preceding table. Noncurrent income taxes payable include uncertain tax positions (see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).Other CommitmentsIn connection with our acquisitions, we have agreed to pay certain additional amounts contingent upon the achievement of certain agreed-upon technology, development, product, or other milestones or the continued employment with us of certain employees of the acquired entities. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Insieme Networks, Inc. In fiscal 2012, we made an investment in Insieme, an early stage company focused on research and development in the data center market. This investment included $100 million of funding and a license to certain of our technology. During fiscal 2014, we acquired the remaining interests in Insieme, at which time the former noncontrolling interest holders became eligible to receive up to two milestone payments, which were determined using agreed-upon formulas based primarily on revenue for certain of Insieme’s products. The former noncontrolling interest holders earned the maximum amount related to these two milestone payments and were paid approximately $441 million and $389 million during fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively. During fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, we recorded compensation expense of $47 million, $160 million and $207 million, respectively, related to these milestone payments. We do not expect a material amount of future compensation expense or further milestone payments related to this acquisition.61Table of ContentsOther Funding Commitments  We also have certain funding commitments primarily related to our investments in privately held companies and venture funds, some of which are based on the achievement of certain agreed-upon milestones, and some of which are required to be funded on demand. The funding commitments were $216 million as of July 29, 2017, compared with $222 million as of July 30, 2016.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe consider our investments in unconsolidated variable interest entities to be off-balance sheet arrangements. In the ordinary course of business, we have investments in privately held companies including venture funds and provide financing to certain customers. Certain of these investments are considered to be variable interest entities. We evaluate on an ongoing basis our investments in these privately held companies and customer financings, and we have determined that as of July 29, 2017 there were no material unconsolidated variable interest entities.On an ongoing basis, we reassess our investments in privately held companies and customer financings to determine if they are variable interest entities and if we would be regarded as the primary beneficiary pursuant to the applicable accounting guidance. As a result of this ongoing assessment, we may be required to make additional disclosures or consolidate these entities. Because we may not control these entities, we may not have the ability to influence these events.We provide financing guarantees, which are generally for various third-party financing arrangements extended to our channel partners and end-user customers. We could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or end-user customers. See the previous discussion of these financing guarantees under “Financing Receivables and Guarantees.”Securities LendingWe periodically engage in securities lending activities with certain of our available-for-sale investments. These transactions are accounted for as a secured lending of the securities, and the securities are typically loaned only on an overnight basis. The average daily balance of securities lending for fiscal 2017 and 2016 was $0.7 billion and $0.6 billion, respectively. We require collateral equal to at least 102% of the fair market value of the loaned security and that the collateral be in the form of cash or liquid, high-quality assets. We engage in these secured lending transactions only with highly creditworthy counterparties, and the associated portfolio custodian has agreed to indemnify us against collateral losses. As of July 29, 2017 and July 30, 2016, we had no outstanding securities lending transactions. We believe these arrangements do not present a material risk or impact to our liquidity requirements. Liquidity and Capital Resource RequirementsBased on past performance and current expectations, we believe our cash and cash equivalents, investments, cash generated from operations, and ability to access capital markets and committed credit lines will satisfy, through at least the next 12 months, our liquidity requirements, both in total and domestically, including the following: working capital needs, capital expenditures, investment requirements, stock repurchases, cash dividends, contractual obligations, commitments, principal and interest payments on debt, pending acquisitions, future customer financings, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations. There are no other transactions, arrangements, or relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect the liquidity and the availability of, as well as our requirements for, capital resources.
