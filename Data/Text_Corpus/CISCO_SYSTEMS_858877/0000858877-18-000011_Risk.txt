Risk Factors-We may be found to infringe on intellectual property rights of others” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.         13.Shareholders’ Equity (a)Cash Dividends on Shares of Common Stock We declared and paid cash dividends of $1.24, $1.10 and $0.94 per common share, or $6.0 billion, $5.5 billion and $4.8 billion, on our outstanding common stock during fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Any future dividends will be subject to the approval of our Board of Directors. (b)Stock Repurchase ProgramIn September 2001, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program.  On February 14, 2018, our Board of Directors authorized a $25 billion increase to the stock repurchase program.  As of July 28, 2018, the remaining authorized amount for stock repurchases under this program, including the additional authorization, is approximately $19.0 billion, with no termination date. A summary of the stock repurchase activity under the stock repurchase program, reported based on the trade date, is as follows (in millions, except per-share amounts):Years Ended Shares Weighted-Average Price per Share AmountJuly 28, 2018 432 $40.88 $17,661July 29, 2017 118 $31.38 $3,706July 30, 2016 148 $26.45 $3,918There were $180 million, $66 million and $45 million in stock repurchases pending settlement as of July 28, 2018, July 29, 2017 and July 30, 2016, respectively.The purchase price for the shares of our stock repurchased is reflected as a reduction to shareholders’ equity. We are required to allocate the purchase price of the repurchased shares as (i) a reduction to retained earnings and (ii) a reduction of common stock and additional paid-in capital.(c)Restricted Stock Unit WithholdingsWe repurchased approximately 20 million, 20 million and 21 million shares, or $703 million, $619 million and $557 million of common stock in settlement of employee tax withholding obligations due upon the vesting of restricted stock or stock units during fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. (d)Preferred StockUnder the terms of our Articles of Incorporation, the Board of Directors may determine the rights, preferences, and terms of our authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock.101Table of Contents14.Employee Benefit Plans  (a)Employee Stock Incentive PlansStock Incentive Plan Program Description    As of July 28, 2018, we had one stock incentive plan: the 2005 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2005 Plan”). In addition, we have, in connection with our acquisitions of various companies, assumed the share-based awards granted under stock incentive plans of the acquired companies or issued share-based awards in replacement thereof. Share-based awards are designed to reward employees for their long-term contributions to us and provide incentives for them to remain with Cisco. The number and frequency of share-based awards are based on competitive practices, operating results of Cisco, government regulations, and other factors. Our primary stock incentive plan is summarized as follows: 2005 Plan    As of July 28, 2018, the maximum number of shares issuable under the 2005 Plan over its term was 694 million shares, plus shares from certain previous plans that are forfeited or are terminated for any other reason before being exercised or settled. If any awards granted under the 2005 Plan are forfeited or are terminated for any other reason before being exercised or settled, the unexercised or unsettled shares underlying the awards will again be available under the 2005 Plan. In addition, starting November 19, 2013, shares withheld by Cisco from an award other than a stock option or stock appreciation right to satisfy withholding tax liabilities resulting from such award will again be available for issuance, based on the fungible share ratio in effect on the date of grant.Pursuant to an amendment approved by our shareholders on November 12, 2009, the number of shares available for issuance under the 2005 Plan is reduced by 1.5 shares for each share awarded as a stock grant or a stock unit, and any shares underlying awards outstanding from certain previous plans that expire unexercised at the end of their maximum terms become available for reissuance under the 2005 Plan. The 2005 Plan permits the granting of stock options, restricted stock, and RSUs, the vesting of which may be performance-based or market-based along with the requisite service requirement, and stock appreciation rights to employees (including employee directors and officers), consultants of Cisco and its subsidiaries and affiliates, and non-employee directors of Cisco. Stock options and stock appreciation rights granted under the 2005 Plan have an exercise price of at least 100% of the fair market value of the underlying stock on the grant date. The expiration date for stock options and stock appreciation rights shall be no later than 10 years from the grant date.The stock options will generally become exercisable for 20% or 25% of the option shares one year from the date of grant and then ratably over the following 48 months or 36 months, respectively. Time-based stock grants and time-based RSUs will generally vest over a four year term.  The majority of the performance-based and market-based RSUs vests at the end of the three-year requisite service period or earlier if the award recipient meets certain retirement eligibility conditions. Certain performance-based RSUs that are based on the achievement of financial and/or non-financial operating goals typically vest upon the achievement of milestones (and may require subsequent service periods), with overall vesting of the shares underlying the award ranging from six months to three years.  The Compensation and Management Development Committee of our Board of Directors has the discretion to use different vesting schedules. Stock appreciation rights may be awarded in combination with stock options or stock grants, and such awards shall provide that the stock appreciation rights will not be exercisable unless the related stock options or stock grants are forfeited. Stock grants may be awarded in combination with non-statutory stock options, and such awards may provide that the stock grants will be forfeited in the event that the related non-statutory stock options are exercised. (b)Employee Stock Purchase PlanWe have an Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which includes its subplan named the International Employee Stock Purchase Plan (together, the “Purchase Plan”), under which 621 million shares of our common stock have been reserved for issuance as of July 28, 2018. Eligible employees are offered shares through a 24-month offering period, which consists of four consecutive 6-month purchase periods. Employees may purchase a limited number of shares of our stock at a discount of up to 15% of the lesser of the market value at the beginning of the offering period or the end of each 6-month purchase period. The Purchase Plan is scheduled to terminate on January 3, 2020. We issued 22 million, 23 million, and 25 million shares under the Purchase Plan in fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. As of July 28, 2018, 78 million shares were available for issuance under the Purchase Plan.102Table of Contents(c)Summary of Share-Based Compensation ExpenseShare-based compensation expense consists primarily of expenses for stock options, stock purchase rights, restricted stock, and RSUs granted to employees.

The total number of in-the-money stock options exercisable as of July 28, 2018 was 4 million. As of July 29, 2017, 6 million outstanding stock options were exercisable, and the weighted-average exercise price was $5.61.(g)Valuation of Employee Share-Based AwardsTime-based restricted stock units and PRSUs that are based on our financial performance metrics or non-financial operating goals are valued using the market value of our common stock on the date of grant, discounted for the present value of expected dividends. On the date of grant, we estimated the fair value of the total shareholder return (TSR) component of the PRSUs using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The assumptions for the valuation of time-based RSUs and PRSUs are summarized as follows:RESTRICTED STOCK UNITSYears EndedJuly 28, 2018July 29, 2017July 30, 2016Number of shares granted (in millions)434357Grant date fair value per share$35.81$28.38$26.01Weighted-average assumptions/inputs:        Expected dividend yield3.2%3.5%3.2%   Range of risk-free interest rates0.0% – 2.7%0.0% – 1.5%0.0% – 1.2% PERFORMANCE BASED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITSYears EndedJuly 28, 2018 July 29, 2017 July 30, 2016Number of shares granted (in millions)3 7 5Grant date fair value per share$32.69 $28.94 $24.70Weighted-average assumptions/inputs:        Expected dividend yield3.5% 3.4% 3.1%   Range of risk-free interest rates1.0% – 2.7% 0.1% – 1.5% 0.0% – 1.2%   Range of expected volatilities for index12.5% - 82.8% 16.7% – 46.8% 15.3% – 54.3%The PRSUs granted during the fiscal years presented are contingent on the achievement of our financial performance metrics, our comparative market-based returns, or the achievement of financial and non-financial operating goals.  For the awards based on financial performance metrics or comparative market-based returns, generally 50% of the PRSUs are earned based on the average of annual operating cash flow and earnings per share goals established at the beginning of each fiscal year over a three-year performance period. Generally, the remaining 50% of the PRSUs are earned based on our TSR measured against the benchmark TSR of a peer group over the same period. Each PRSU recipient could vest in 0% to 150% of the target shares granted contingent on the achievement of our financial performance metrics or our comparative market-based returns, and 0% to 100% of the target shares granted contingent on the achievement of non-financial operating goals.  105Table of ContentsThe assumptions for the valuation of employee stock purchase rights are summarized as follows: EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE RIGHTSYears EndedJuly 28, 2018 July 29, 2017 July 30, 2016Weighted-average assumptions:        Expected volatility22.1% 24.6% 23.9%   Risk-free interest rate1.3% 0.7% 0.4%   Expected dividend3.1% 3.2% 3.1%   Expected life (in years)1.3 1.3 1.3Weighted-average estimated grant date fair value per share$7.48 $6.52 $5.73The valuation of employee stock purchase rights and the related assumptions are for the employee stock purchases made during the respective fiscal years.  We used third-party analyses to assist in developing the assumptions used in our Black-Scholes model. We are responsible for determining the assumptions used in estimating the fair value of our share-based payment awards. We used the implied volatility for traded options (with contract terms corresponding to the expected life of the employee stock purchase rights) on our stock as the expected volatility assumption required in the Black-Scholes model. The implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates appropriate for the term of our employee stock purchase rights. The dividend yield assumption is based on the history and expectation of dividend payouts at the grant date.(h)Employee 401(k) PlansWe sponsor the Cisco Systems, Inc. 401(k) Plan (the “Plan”) to provide retirement benefits for our employees. As allowed under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, the Plan provides for tax-deferred salary contributions and after-tax contributions for eligible employees. The Plan allows employees to contribute up to 75% of their annual eligible earnings to the Plan on a pretax and after-tax basis, including Roth contributions. Employee contributions are limited to a maximum annual amount as set periodically by the Internal Revenue Code. We match pretax and Roth employee contributions up to 100% of the first 4.5% of eligible earnings that are contributed by employees. Therefore, the maximum matching contribution that we may allocate to each participant’s account will not exceed $12,375 for the 2018 calendar year due to the $275,000 annual limit on eligible earnings imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. All matching contributions vest immediately. Our matching contributions to the Plan totaled $269 million, $265 million, and $262 million in fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.The Plan allows employees who meet the age requirements and reach the Plan contribution limits to make catch-up contributions (pretax or Roth) not to exceed the lesser of 75% of their annual eligible earnings or the limit set forth in the Internal Revenue Code. Catch-up contributions are not eligible for matching contributions. In addition, the Plan provides for discretionary profit-sharing contributions as determined by the Board of Directors. Such contributions to the Plan are allocated among eligible participants in the proportion of their salaries to the total salaries of all participants. There were no discretionary profit-sharing contributions made in fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016.We also sponsor other 401(k) plans as a result of acquisitions of other companies. Our contributions to these plans were not material to Cisco on either an individual or aggregate basis for any of the fiscal years presented.(i)Deferred Compensation PlansThe Cisco Systems, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan (the “Deferred Compensation Plan”), a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, became effective in 2007. As required by applicable law, participation in the Deferred Compensation Plan is limited to a select group of our management employees. Under the Deferred Compensation Plan, which is an unfunded and unsecured deferred compensation arrangement, a participant may elect to defer base salary, bonus, and/or commissions, pursuant to such rules as may be established by Cisco, up to the maximum percentages for each deferral election as described in the plan. We may also, at our discretion, make a matching contribution to the employee under the Deferred Compensation Plan. A matching contribution equal to 4.5% of eligible compensation in excess of the Internal Revenue Code limit for qualified plans for calendar year 2018 that is deferred by participants under the Deferred Compensation Plan (with a $1.5 million cap on eligible compensation) will be made to eligible participants’ accounts at the end of calendar year 2018. The total deferred compensation liability under the Deferred Compensation Plan, together with deferred compensation plans assumed from acquired companies, was approximately $651 million and $622 million as of July 28, 2018 and July 29, 2017, respectively, and was recorded primarily in other long-term liabilities. 106Table of Contents15.Comprehensive Income (Loss)  The components of AOCI, net of tax, and the other comprehensive income (loss), excluding noncontrolling interest, are summarized as follows (in millions): Net Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Available-for-Sale Investments Net Unrealized  Gains (Losses) Cash Flow Hedging Instruments Cumulative Translation Adjustment and Actuarial Gains and Losses Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)BALANCE AT JULY 25, 2015$310 $(16) $(233) $61Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications attributable to Cisco Systems, Inc.151 (66) (399) (314)(Gains) losses reclassified out of AOCI1 20 (6) 15Tax benefit (expense)(49) 3 (42) (88)Total change for the period103 (43) (447) (387)BALANCE AT JULY 30, 2016413 (59) (680) (326)Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications attributable to Cisco Systems, Inc.(164) 22 318 176(Gains) losses reclassified out of AOCI87 79 16 182Tax benefit (expense)37 (10) (13) 14Total change for the period(40) 91 321 372BALANCE AT JULY 29, 2017373 32 (359) 46Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications attributable to Cisco Systems, Inc.(543) 21 (159) (681)(Gains) losses reclassified out of AOCI(287) (68) 7 (348)Tax benefit (expense)93 4 (8) 89Total change for the period(737) (43) (160) (940)Effect of adoption of accounting standard54 — (9) 45BALANCE AT JULY 28, 2018$(310) $(11) $(528) $(849)The net gains (losses) reclassified out of AOCI into the Consolidated Statements of Operations, with line item location, during each period were as follows (in millions):  July 28, 2018 July 29, 2017 July 30, 2016  Comprehensive Income Components Income Before Taxes Line Item in Statements of OperationsNet unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investments $287 $(87) $(1) Other income (loss), net         Net unrealized gains and losses on cash flow hedging instruments        Foreign currency derivatives 52 (59) (15) Operating expensesForeign currency derivatives 16 (20) (5) Cost of sales—service  68 (79) (20)           Cumulative translation adjustment and actuarial gains and losses (7) (16) 6 Operating expenses         Total amounts reclassified out of AOCI $348 $(182) $(15)  107Table of Contents16.Income Taxes(a)Provision for Income TaxesThe provision for income taxes consists of the following (in millions):Years EndedJuly 28, 2018 July 29, 2017 July 30, 2016Federal:     Current$9,900 $1,300 $865Deferred1,156 (42) (93) 11,056 1,258 772State:     Current340 86 78Deferred(232) 56 13 108 142 91Foreign:     Current1,789 1,416 1,432Deferred(24) (138) (114) 1,765 1,278 1,318Total$12,929 $2,678 $2,181Income before provision for income taxes consists of the following (in millions):Years EndedJuly 28, 2018 July 29, 2017 July 30, 2016United States$3,765 $2,393 $2,907International9,274 9,894 10,013Total$13,039 $12,287 $12,920The items accounting for the difference between income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate and the provision for income taxes consist of the following:Years EndedJuly 28, 2018 July 29, 2017 July 30, 2016Federal statutory rate27.0 % 35.0 % 35.0 %Effect of:     State taxes, net of federal tax benefit0.6 1.1 0.5Foreign income at other than U.S. rates(5.2) (13.4) (14.5)Tax credits(2.5) (1.2) (1.7)Domestic manufacturing deduction(0.5) (0.4) (0.6)Stock-based compensation(0.1) 1.4 1.4Tax audit settlement— — (2.8)Impact of the Tax Act80.1 — —Other, net(0.2) (0.7) (0.4)Total99.2 %21.8 % 16.9 %On December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was enacted. The Tax Act significantly revises the U.S. corporate income tax by, among other things, lowering the statutory corporate income tax rate (“federal tax rate”) from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, implementing a modified territorial tax system, and imposing a mandatory one-time transition tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. As a fiscal-year taxpayer, certain provisions of the Tax Act impact Cisco in fiscal 2018, including the change in the federal tax rate and the one-time transition tax, while other provisions will be effective at the beginning of fiscal 2019, including the implementation of a modified territorial tax system and other changes to how foreign earnings are subject to U.S. tax, and elimination of the domestic manufacturing deduction. As a result of the decrease in the federal tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, we have computed our income tax expense for the July 28, 2018 fiscal year using a blended federal tax rate of 27%. The 21% federal tax rate will apply to our fiscal 108Table of Contentsyear ending July 27, 2019 and each year thereafter. We must remeasure our deferred tax assets and liabilities ("DTA") using the federal tax rate that will apply when the related temporary differences are expected to reverse.As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $76 billion in undistributed earnings for certain foreign subsidiaries. These undistributed earnings were subject to the U.S. mandatory one-time transition tax and are eligible to be repatriated to the U.S. without additional U.S. tax under the Tax Act. We have historically asserted our intention to indefinitely reinvest foreign earnings in certain foreign subsidiaries. We have reevaluated our historic assertion as a result of enactment of the Tax Act and no longer consider these earnings to be indefinitely reinvested in our foreign subsidiaries. As a result of this change in assertion, we recorded a $1.2 billion tax expense for foreign withholding tax in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. In fiscal 2018, we repatriated $70 billion of foreign subsidiary earnings to the U.S. (in the form of cash, cash equivalents, or investments), and paid foreign withholding tax of $1.2 billion. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we recorded adjustments to the provisional amounts originally recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 related to the U.S transition tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries and re-measurement of net DTA. These adjustments include an $863 million benefit to the U.S. transition tax provisional amount related to the U.S taxation of deemed foreign dividends in the transition fiscal year. This benefit may be reduced or eliminated in future legislation. If such legislation is enacted, we will record the impact of the legislation in the quarter of enactment.During fiscal 2018, we recorded a provisional tax expense of $10.4 billion related to the Tax Act, comprised of $8.1 billion of U.S. transition tax, $1.2 billion of foreign withholding tax (discussed above), and $1.1 billion re-measurement of net DTA. We plan to pay the transition tax in installments over eight years in accordance with the Tax Act. The $1.2 billion foreign withholding tax was paid in February 2018.In December 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, which addresses how a company recognizes provisional estimates when a company does not have the necessary information available, prepared or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete its accounting for the effect of the changes in the Tax Act. The measurement period ends when a company has obtained, prepared, and analyzed the information necessary to finalize its accounting, but cannot extend beyond one year. The final impact of the Tax Act may differ from the above provisional estimates due to changes in interpretations of the Tax Act, any legislative action to address questions that arise because of the Tax Act, by changes in accounting standard for income taxes and related interpretations in response to the Tax Act, and any updates or changes to estimates used in the provisional amounts. We have determined that the $8.1 billion of tax expense for the U.S. transition tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, the $1.2 billion of foreign withholding tax, and the $1.1 billion of tax expense for DTA re-measurement were each provisional amounts and reasonable estimates for fiscal 2018. Estimates used in the provisional amounts include: the anticipated reversal pattern of the gross DTAs; and earnings, cash positions, foreign taxes and withholding taxes attributable to foreign subsidiaries.During fiscal 2016, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and Cisco settled all outstanding items related to the audit of our federal income tax returns for the fiscal years ended July 26, 2008 through July 31, 2010. As a result of the settlement, we recognized a net benefit to the provision for income taxes of $367 million, which included a reduction of interest expense of $21 million. In addition, the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 reinstated the U.S. federal R&D tax credit permanently. As a result, the tax provision in fiscal 2016 included a tax benefit of $226 million related to the U.S. federal R&D tax credit, of which $81 million was attributable to fiscal 2015.Foreign taxes associated with the repatriation of earnings of foreign subsidiaries were not provided for on a cumulative total of $77 million of undistributed earnings for certain foreign subsidiaries as of the end of fiscal 2018. We intend to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in such foreign subsidiaries. If these earnings were distributed in the form of dividends or otherwise, or if the shares of the relevant foreign subsidiaries were sold or otherwise transferred, we would be subject to additional foreign taxes. The amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liability related to these earnings is approximately $15 million.As a result of certain employment and capital investment actions, our income in certain foreign countries is subject to reduced tax rates.  A portion of these incentives expired at the end of fiscal 2015. The majority of the remaining tax incentives are reasonably expected to expire at the end of fiscal 2019.  The gross income tax benefit attributable to tax incentives was estimated to be $0.9 billion ($0.19 per diluted share) in fiscal 2018. As of the end of fiscal 2017 and 2016, the gross income tax benefits attributable to tax incentives were estimated to be $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion ($0.25 and $0.23 per diluted share) for the respective years. The gross income tax benefits were partially offset by accruals of U.S. income taxes on foreign earnings.  109Table of ContentsUnrecognized Tax Benefits The aggregate changes in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits were as follows (in millions):Years EndedJuly 28, 2018 July 29, 2017 July 30, 2016Beginning balance$1,973 $1,627 $2,029Additions based on tax positions related to the current year251 336 255Additions for tax positions of prior years84 180 116Reductions for tax positions of prior years(129) (78) (457)Settlements(124) (43) (241)Lapse of statute of limitations(55) (49) (75)Ending balance$2,000 $1,973 $1,627As a result of the IRS tax settlement related to the federal income tax returns for the fiscal years ended July 26, 2008 through July 31, 2010, the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits in fiscal 2016 was reduced by approximately $563 million. We also reduced the amount of accrued interest by $63 million.As of July 28, 2018, $1.7 billion of the unrecognized tax benefits would affect the effective tax rate if realized. During fiscal 2018, we recognized $10 million of net interest expense and reduced penalties by less than $1 million. During fiscal 2017, we recognized $26 million of net interest expense and a $4 million reduction in penalties. During fiscal 2016, we recognized a $55 million reduction in net interest expense and a $40 million reduction in penalties. Our total accrual for interest and penalties was $180 million, $186 million, and $154 million as of the end of fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. We are no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax audit for returns covering tax years through fiscal 2010. We are no longer subject to foreign or state income tax audits for returns covering tax years through fiscal 1999, and fiscal 2008, respectively.We regularly engage in discussions and negotiations with tax authorities regarding tax matters in various jurisdictions. We believe it is reasonably possible that certain federal, foreign, and state tax matters may be concluded in the next 12 months.  Specific positions that may be resolved include issues involving transfer pricing and various other matters. We estimate that the unrecognized tax benefits at July 28, 2018 could be reduced by approximately $300 million in the next 12 months.(b)Deferred Tax Assets and LiabilitiesThe following table presents the breakdown for net deferred tax assets (in millions): July 28, 2018 July 29, 2017Deferred tax assets$3,219 $4,239Deferred tax liabilities(141) (271)Total net deferred tax assets$3,078 $3,968110Table of ContentsThe following table presents the components of the deferred tax assets and liabilities (in millions): July 28, 2018 July 29, 2017ASSETS   Allowance for doubtful accounts and returns$285 $443Sales-type and direct-financing leases171 277Inventory write-downs and capitalization289 446Investment provisions54 171IPR&D, goodwill, and purchased intangible assets63 125Deferred revenue1,584 2,057Credits and net operating loss carryforwards1,087 976Share-based compensation expense190 273Accrued compensation370 504Other408 559Gross deferred tax assets4,501 5,831Valuation allowance(374) (244)Total deferred tax assets4,127 5,587LIABILITIES   Purchased intangible assets(753) (1,037)Depreciation(118) (340)Unrealized gains on investments(33) (203)Other(145) (39)Total deferred tax liabilities(1,049) (1,619)Total net deferred tax assets$3,078 $3,968As of July 28, 2018, our federal, state, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were $703 million, $891 million, and $808 million, respectively.
