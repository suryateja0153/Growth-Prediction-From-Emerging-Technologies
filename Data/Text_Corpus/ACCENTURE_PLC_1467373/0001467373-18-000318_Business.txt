BUSINESS Overview Accenture is one of the world’s leading professional services companies with approximately 459,000 people serving clients in a broad range of industries and in three geographic regions: North America, Europe and Growth Markets (Asia Pacific, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East). Our five operating groups, organized by industry, bring together expertise from across the organization in strategy, consulting, digital, technology including application services, and operations to deliver end-to-end services and solutions to clients. Digital-, cloud- and security-related services, which we refer to as “the New,” are increasingly important components of the services we provide. For fiscal 2018, our revenues before reimbursements (“net revenues”) were $39.6 billion. We operate globally with one common brand and business model, providing clients around the world with the same high level of service. Drawing on a combination of industry and functional expertise, technology and innovation capabilities, alliance relationships, and our global delivery resources, we seek to provide differentiated, innovative services that help our clients measurably improve their business performance and create sustainable value for their customers and stakeholders. Our global delivery capability enables us to assemble integrated teams to provide high-quality, cost-effective solutions to our clients.  In fiscal 2018, we continued to implement a strategy focused on industry and technology differentiation, increasingly taking an innovation-led approach to drive value for clients. We serve clients in locally relevant ways, leveraging our global organization as appropriate. As part of our growth strategy in fiscal 2018, we continued to make significant investments—in strategic acquisitions, in assets and offerings, in branding and thought leadership, and in attracting and developing talent—to further enhance our differentiation and competitiveness.  1Table of ContentsOperating Groups  Our five operating groups are Accenture’s reporting segments and primary market channel, organized around 13 industry groups that serve clients globally in more than 40 industries. Our industry focus gives us an understanding of industry evolution, business issues and applicable technologies, enabling us to deliver innovative solutions tailored to each client or, as appropriate, more standardized capabilities to multiple clients. The operating groups assemble integrated client engagement teams, which typically consist of industry experts, capability specialists and professionals with local market knowledge. The operating groups have primary responsibility for building and sustaining long-term client relationships; providing management and technology consulting services; orchestrating our expertise and working synergistically with the other parts of our business to sell and deliver the full range of our services and capabilities; ensuring client satisfaction; and achieving revenue and profitability objectives. The following table shows the current organization of our five operating groups. We do not allocate total assets by operating group, although our operating groups do manage and control certain assets. For certain historical financial information regarding our operating groups (including certain asset information), as well as financial information by geography (including long-lived asset information), see Note 16 (Segment Reporting) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Operating Groups and Industry GroupsCommunications, Media & TechnologyFinancial ServicesHealth & Public ServiceProductsResources •  Communications & Media •  High Tech •  Software & Platforms •  Banking & Capital Markets •  Insurance •  Health •  Public Service •  Consumer Goods, Retail & Travel Services •  Industrial •  Life Sciences •  Chemicals & Natural Resources •  Energy •  UtilitiesCommunications, Media & Technology Our Communications, Media & Technology operating group serves communications, media, high tech, software and platform companies.

Most of our alliances are non-exclusive. These alliances can generate significant revenues from services we provide to implement our alliance partners’ products as well as revenue from the resale of their products. Research and Innovation We are committed to developing leading-edge ideas. Research and innovation, which are components of our overall investment in our business, have been major factors in our success, and we believe they will help us continue to grow in the future. We use our investment in research and development—on which we spent $791 million, $704 million and $643 million in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively—to help create, commercialize and disseminate innovative business strategies and technology solutions. We spend a significant portion of our research and development investment to develop market-ready solutions for our clients. We view innovation as a source of competitive advantage. We seek to generate early insights into how knowledge can be harnessed to create innovative business solutions for our clients and to develop business strategies with significant value.

Our competitors include: •large multinational providers, including the services arms of large global technology providers (hardware, equipment and software), that offer some or all of the services and solutions that we do; •off-shore service providers in lower-cost locations, particularly in India, that offer services globally that are similar to the services and solutions we offer; •accounting firms that provide consulting and other services and solutions in areas that compete with us; •solution or service providers that compete with us in a specific geographic market, industry segment or service area, including digital and advertising agencies and emerging start-ups and other companies that can scale rapidly to focus on or disrupt certain markets and provide new or alternative products, services or delivery models; and •in-house departments of large corporations that use their own resources, rather than engage an outside firm for the types of services and solutions we provide. Our revenues are derived primarily from Fortune Global 500 and Fortune 1000 companies, medium-sized companies, governments, government agencies and other enterprises. We believe that the principal competitive factors in the industries in which we compete include: •skills and capabilities of people; •technical and industry expertise; •innovative service and product offerings; •ability to add business value and improve performance; •reputation and client references; •contractual terms, including competitive pricing; •ability to deliver results reliably and on a timely basis; •scope of services; •service delivery approach; •quality of services and solutions; •availability of appropriate resources; and •global reach and scale, including level of presence in key emerging markets.

We operate our business through subsidiaries of Accenture plc. Prior to our transition to a corporate structure in fiscal 2001, we operated as a series of related partnerships and corporations under the control of our partners. In connection with our transition to a corporate structure, our partners generally exchanged all of their interests in these partnerships and corporations for Accenture Ltd Class A common shares or, in the case of partners in certain countries, Class I common shares of Accenture SCA, a Luxembourg partnership limited by shares and direct subsidiary of Accenture Ltd (“Accenture SCA”), or exchangeable shares issued by Accenture Canada Holdings Inc., an indirect subsidiary of Accenture SCA. Generally, partners who received Accenture SCA Class I common shares or Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares also received a corresponding number of Accenture Ltd Class X common shares, which entitled their holders to vote at Accenture Ltd shareholder meetings but did not carry any economic rights. The combination of the Accenture Ltd Class X common shares and the Accenture SCA Class I common shares or Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares gave these partners substantially similar economic and governance rights as holders of Accenture Ltd Class A common shares. On June 10, 2009, Accenture plc was incorporated in Ireland, as a public limited company, in order to effect moving the place of incorporation of our parent holding company from Bermuda to Ireland. This transaction was completed on September 1, 2009, at which time Accenture Ltd, our predecessor holding company, became a wholly owned subsidiary of Accenture plc and Accenture plc became our parent holding company. Accenture Ltd was dissolved on December 29, 2009. On April 10, 2015, Accenture Holdings plc, then Accenture plc’s subsidiary, was incorporated in Ireland, as a public limited company, in order to further consolidate Accenture’s presence in Ireland. On August 26, 2015, Accenture SCA merged with and into Accenture Holdings plc, with Accenture Holdings plc as the surviving entity. This merger was a transaction between entities under common control and had no effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements.  On March 13, 2018, Accenture Holdings plc merged with and into Accenture plc, with Accenture plc as the surviving entity. As a result, all of the assets and liabilities of Accenture Holdings plc were acquired by Accenture plc, and Accenture Holdings plc ceased to exist. In connection with this internal merger, shareholders of Accenture Holdings plc (other than Accenture entities that held shares of Accenture Holdings plc), who primarily consisted of current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees, received one Class A ordinary share of Accenture plc for each share of Accenture Holdings plc that they owned, and Accenture plc redeemed all Class X ordinary shares of Accenture plc owned by such shareholders. All references to Accenture Holdings plc included in this report with respect to periods prior to August 26, 2015 reflect the activity and/or balances of Accenture SCA (the predecessor of Accenture Holdings plc). The Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the ownership interests in Accenture Holdings plc (for applicable periods) and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. held by certain current and former members of Accenture Leadership as noncontrolling interests. “Accenture Leadership” is comprised of members of our global management committee (our primary management and leadership team, which consists of approximately 20 of our most senior leaders), senior managing directors and managing directors. The noncontrolling ownership interests percentage was less than 1% as of August 31, 2018. Accenture plc Class A and Class X Ordinary Shares Each Class A ordinary share and each Class X ordinary share of Accenture plc entitles its holder to one vote on all matters submitted to a vote of shareholders of Accenture plc. A Class X ordinary share does not, however, entitle its holder to receive dividends or to receive payments upon a liquidation of Accenture plc. As described above under “—Organizational Structure and History,” Class X ordinary shares generally provide the holders of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares with a vote at Accenture plc shareholder meetings that is equivalent to the voting rights held by Accenture plc Class A ordinary shareholders, while their economic rights consist of interests in Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares. Under its memorandum and articles of association, Accenture plc may redeem, at its option, any Class X ordinary share for a redemption price equal to the nominal value of the Class X ordinary share, or $0.0000225 per share. Accenture plc, as successor to Accenture Ltd, has separately agreed with the original holders of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares not to redeem any Class X ordinary share of such holder if the redemption would reduce the number of Class X ordinary shares held by that holder to a number that is less than the number of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares owned by that holder. Accenture plc will redeem Class X ordinary shares upon the redemption or exchange of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares so that the aggregate number of Class X ordinary shares outstanding at any time does not exceed the aggregate number of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares outstanding. Class X ordinary shares are not transferable without the consent of Accenture plc. 7Table of ContentsA transfer of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares effected by transfer of a book-entry interest in The Depository Trust Company will not be subject to Irish stamp duty. Other transfers of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares may be subject to Irish stamp duty (currently at the rate of 1% of the price paid or the market value of the Class A ordinary shares acquired, if higher) payable by the buyer. Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. Exchangeable Shares Holders of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares may exchange their shares for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares at any time on a one-for-one basis. Accenture may, at its option, satisfy this exchange with cash at a price per share generally equal to the market price of an Accenture plc Class A ordinary share at the time of the exchange. Each exchangeable share of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. entitles its holder to receive distributions equal to any distributions to which an Accenture plc Class A ordinary share entitles its holder. The exchange of all of the outstanding Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares would not have a material impact on the equity ownership position of Accenture. 8Table of Contents
