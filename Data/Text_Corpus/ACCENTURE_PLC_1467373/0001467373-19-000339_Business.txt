BUSINESS Overview Accenture is one of the world’s leading professional services companies with approximately 492,000 people serving clients in a broad range of industries and in three geographic regions: North America, Europe and Growth Markets (Asia Pacific, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East). Our five operating groups, organized by industry, bring together expertise from across the organization in strategy, consulting, digital, technology and operations to deliver end-to-end services and solutions to clients. For fiscal 2019, our revenues were $43.2 billion, with the majority in digital-, cloud- and security-related services. We operate globally with one common brand and business model, providing clients around the world with the same high level of service. Drawing on a combination of industry and functional expertise, technology and innovation capabilities, alliance relationships, and our global delivery resources, we seek to provide differentiated, innovative services that help our clients measurably improve their business performance and create sustainable value for their customers and stakeholders. Our global delivery capability enables us to assemble integrated teams to provide high-quality, cost-effective solutions to our clients.  In fiscal 2019, we continued to execute a strategy focused on industry and technology differentiation, increasingly taking an innovation-led approach to drive value for clients. We serve clients in locally relevant ways, leveraging our global organization as appropriate. As part of our growth strategy in fiscal 2019, we continued to make significant investments—in strategic acquisitions, in assets and offerings, in branding and thought leadership, and in attracting and developing talent—to further enhance our differentiation and competitiveness.  1Table of ContentsOperating Groups  Our five operating groups are Accenture’s reporting segments and primary market channel, organized around 13 industry groups that serve clients globally in more than 40 industries.

Our competitors include: •large multinational providers, including the services arms of large global technology providers, that offer some or all of the services and solutions that we do; •off-shore service providers in lower-cost locations, particularly in India, that offer services globally that are similar to the services and solutions we offer; 5Table of Contents•accounting firms that provide consulting and other services and solutions in areas that compete with us; •solution or service providers that compete with us in a specific geographic market, industry segment or service area, including digital and advertising agencies and emerging start-ups and other companies that can scale rapidly to focus on or disrupt certain markets and provide new or alternative products, services or delivery models; and •in-house departments of large corporations that use their own resources, rather than engage an outside firm for the types of services and solutions we provide.

Organizational Structure and History Accenture plc was incorporated in Ireland on June 10, 2009 as a public limited company. We operate our business through subsidiaries of Accenture plc. On March 13, 2018, Accenture Holdings plc, a subsidiary of Accenture plc merged with and into Accenture plc, with Accenture plc as the surviving entity. As a result, all of the assets and liabilities of Accenture Holdings plc were acquired by Accenture plc, and Accenture Holdings plc ceased to exist. In connection with this internal merger, shareholders of Accenture Holdings plc (other than Accenture entities that held shares of Accenture Holdings plc), who primarily consisted of current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees, received one Class A ordinary share of Accenture plc for each share of Accenture Holdings plc that they owned, and Accenture plc redeemed all Class X ordinary shares of Accenture plc owned by such shareholders. In connection with our transition in 2001 from a series of related partnerships and corporations operated under the control of our partners to a corporate structure, partners in certain countries received common shares of Accenture SCA, the predecessor of Accenture Holdings plc, or exchangeable shares issued by Accenture Canada Holdings Inc., an indirect subsidiary of Accenture SCA. Generally, these partners also received a corresponding number of Accenture 6Table of ContentsLtd (our predecessor holding company) Class X common shares, which entitled their holders to vote at Accenture Ltd shareholder meetings but did not carry any economic rights. The Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the ownership interests in Accenture Holdings plc (for applicable periods) and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. held by certain current and former members of Accenture Leadership as noncontrolling interests. “Accenture Leadership” is comprised of members of our global management committee (our primary management and leadership team, which consists of approximately 20 of our most senior leaders), senior managing directors and managing directors. The noncontrolling ownership interests percentage was less than 1% as of August 31, 2019. Accenture plc Class A and Class X Ordinary Shares Each Class A ordinary share and each Class X ordinary share of Accenture plc entitles its holder to one vote on all matters submitted to a vote of shareholders of Accenture plc. A Class X ordinary share does not, however, entitle its holder to receive dividends or to receive payments upon a liquidation of Accenture plc. As described above under “—Organizational Structure and History,” Class X ordinary shares generally provide the holders of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares with a vote at Accenture plc shareholder meetings that is equivalent to the voting rights held by Accenture plc Class A ordinary shareholders, while their economic rights consist of interests in Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares. Under its memorandum and articles of association, Accenture plc may redeem, at its option, any Class X ordinary share for a redemption price equal to the nominal value of the Class X ordinary share, or $0.0000225 per share. Accenture plc, as successor to Accenture Ltd, has separately agreed with the original holders of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares not to redeem any Class X ordinary share of such holder if the redemption would reduce the number of Class X ordinary shares held by that holder to a number that is less than the number of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares owned by that holder. Accenture plc will redeem Class X ordinary shares upon the redemption or exchange of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares so that the aggregate number of Class X ordinary shares outstanding at any time does not exceed the aggregate number of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares outstanding. Class X ordinary shares are not transferable without the consent of Accenture plc. A transfer of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares effected by transfer of a book-entry interest in The Depository Trust Company will not be subject to Irish stamp duty. Other transfers of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares may be subject to Irish stamp duty (currently at the rate of 1% of the price paid or the market value of the Class A ordinary shares acquired, if higher) payable by the buyer. Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. Exchangeable Shares Holders of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares may exchange their shares for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares at any time on a one-for-one basis. Accenture may, at its option, satisfy this exchange with cash at a price per share generally equal to the market price of an Accenture plc Class A ordinary share at the time of the exchange. Each exchangeable share of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. entitles its holder to receive distributions equal to any distributions to which an Accenture plc Class A ordinary share entitles its holder. The exchange of all of the outstanding Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares would not have a material impact on the equity ownership position of Accenture. 7Table of Contents
