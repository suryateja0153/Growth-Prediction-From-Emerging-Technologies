BusinessCompany OverviewSynopsys, Inc. provides software, intellectual property, and services used by designers along the entire silicon to software spectrum, from engineers creating advanced semiconductors to software developers seeking to ensure the quality and security of their applications. We are a global leader in supplying the electronic design automation (EDA) software that engineers use to design and test integrated circuits, also known as chips. We also offer intellectual property (IP) products, which are pre-designed circuits that engineers use as components of larger chip designs rather than designing those circuits themselves. We provide software and hardware used to develop the electronic systems that incorporate chips and the software that runs on them. To complement these offerings, which are sold primarily to semiconductor and electronics companies, we provide technical services to support our solutions and help our customers develop chips and electronic systems. We are also a leading provider of software tools that developers use to improve the quality and security of software code in a wide variety of industries, including electronics, financial services, energy, and industrials.Corporate InformationWe incorporated in 1986 in North Carolina and reincorporated in Delaware in 1987.

The growth of the Internet and cloud computing has provided people with new ways to create, store and share information. At the same time, the increasing use of electronics in cars, buildings, and appliances and other consumer products is creating a connected landscape of “smart” devices. Many thousands of software applications–“apps”–have been developed to expand the possibilities of these connected devices.These developments have been fueled by innovation in the semiconductor and software industries. It is common for a single chip to combine many components (processor, communications, memory, custom logic, input/output) and embedded software into a single System-on-Chip (SoC), necessitating highly complex chip designs. The most complex chips today contain more than a billion transistors, the basic building blocks for integrated circuits, each of which may have features that are less than 1/1,000th the diameter of a human hair. At such small dimensions, the wavelength of light itself can become an obstacle to production, proving too big to create such dense features and requiring creative and complicated new approaches from designers. Designers have turned to new manufacturing techniques, such as multiple-patterning lithography and FinFET transistors, which in turn have introduced new challenges in design and production.In addition to this increasing complexity, due to the popularity of mobile devices and other electronic products, there is increasing demand for integrated circuits and systems with greater functionality and performance, reduced size, and less power consumption. The designers of these products–our customers–are facing intense pressure to deliver innovative products at ever shorter times-to-market, as well as at lower prices. In other words, innovation in chip and system design often hinges on “better,” “sooner,” and “cheaper.”A similar dynamic is at work in the software industry, where the pace of innovation often requires developers–our customers–to deliver high-quality software, which can include millions of lines of code, in increasingly frequent release cycles. Bugs, defects, and security vulnerabilities in code can be difficult to detect and expensive to fix. But at a time when software is prevalent in many industries and an increasing array of smart devices, it can be crucial to do so.2Table of ContentsOur RoleSynopsys’ products support innovators in these industries, from silicon to software, helping them to meet their design and time-to-market challenges. We provide software tools, IP, hardware systems and other technologies that designers use to create chips and systems. We also provide software tools that software developers use to detect critical flaws in their code.The task of the chip and system designer is to determine how best to locate and connect the building blocks of chips, verifying that the resulting design behaves as intended and ensuring that the design can be manufactured efficiently and cost-effectively. This task is a complicated, multi-step process that is both expensive and time-consuming.  We offer a wide range of products that help designers at different steps in the overall design process, both for the design of individual integrated circuits and for the design of larger systems. Our products can increase designer productivity and efficiency by automating tasks, keeping track of large amounts of design data, adding intelligence to the design process, facilitating reuse of past designs and reducing errors. Our IP products offer proven, high-quality pre-configured circuits that are ready-to-use in a chip design, saving customers time and enabling them to direct resources to features that differentiate their products. Our global service and support engineers also provide expert technical support and design assistance to our customers.The task of the software developer is to write code that not only accomplishes the developer's goal as efficiently as possible but also runs securely and free of errors. We offer products that can help developers write better, more secure code by analyzing their code for quality defects and security vulnerabilities, adding intelligence and automation to the software testing process, and helping to eliminate quality and security defects in a systematic manner. To the extent developers make use of third-party components in their code, our products can help developers better manage its composition and security. Our products can enable software developers to catch flaws earlier in the development cycle, when they can be less costly to fix.Products and ServicesRevenue from our products and services is categorized into four groups:•Core EDA, which includes our digital and custom integrated circuit (IC) design software, our verification products, and our field-programmable gate array (FPGA) design software;•IP, Systems and Software Integrity (previously referred to as IP and Software Solutions), which includes our DesignWare® IP portfolio, our system-level design products, and our software quality and security testing solutions; •Manufacturing Solutions; and •Professional Services and Other.Core EDA The process of designing integrated circuits contains many complex steps: architecture definition, register transfer level (RTL) design, functional/RTL verification, logic design or synthesis, gate-level verification, floorplanning, and place and route, to name just a few. Designers use our Core EDA products to automate the integrated circuit design process and to reduce errors. We offer a large number of Core EDA products intended to address the process comprehensively.

Our Saber™ platform models and simulates the behavior of power electronic and mechatronic systems.Escalating software content and complexity in today’s electronic devices are driving the adoption of new tools and methods to accelerate software development and ease hardware-software integration and system validation. Our system-level portfolio includes prototyping technologies that can improve the productivity of both hardware and software development teams. These prototyping technologies are also an important component of our Verification Continuum platform. They include the following: •Our Virtualizer™ tool and broad portfolio of transaction-level models enable the creation of virtual prototypes, fully functional software models of complete systems that enable engineers to start software development up to 12 months earlier than traditional methods. •Our HAPS® FPGA-based prototyping systems integrate high-performance hardware and software tools with real-world interfaces to enable faster hardware-software integration and full system validation. •Our hybrid prototyping solution combines both approaches to prototyping, integrating Virtualizer virtual prototyping with HAPS FPGA-based prototyping.Synopsys also provides a series of tools used in the design of optical systems and photonic devices. Our CODE V® solution enables engineers to model, analyze and optimize designs for optical imaging and communication systems. Our LightTools® design and analysis software allows designers to simulate and improve the performance of a broad range of illumination systems, from vehicle lighting to projector systems.Software Integrity ProductsOur Software Integrity platform includes software quality and security testing tools that help software developers reduce the risk of errors and security defects in their code before it is released. We first began offering software integrity products in fiscal 2014 with our acquisition of Coverity, Inc. Our Coverity® products include our Code Advisor solution, composed of our Quality Advisor™ and Security Advisor™ software tools, which analyze software code to find crash-causing bugs, incorrect program behavior, memory leaks and other performance-degrading flaws, security vulnerabilities, violations of security best practices, and other critical code issues, many of which may be difficult to detect by other means. We continued to expand our software integrity offerings with our acquisitions of Codenomicon OY and the Seeker® interactive application security testing solution from Quotium Technologies SA in fiscal 2015 and our acquisition of Protecode Inc. after the end of fiscal 2015. Our Codenomicon products include the Defensics® security testing platform, which tests for security vulnerabilities in software code, particularly network protocols and file formats, by systematically sending invalid or unexpected inputs to the system under test, sometimes referred to as “fuzz testing.” Our Codenomicon AppCheck™ software tool scans binary code to identify incorporated third-party code and any known security vulnerabilities of such code, while our Protecode technology scans for the use of open source code and helps manage the associated license and security risks. Our AbuseSA™ platform aggregates, contextualizes, and visualizes security threat data from a variety of sources.5Table of ContentsManufacturing SolutionsOur Manufacturing Solutions software products and technologies enable semiconductor manufacturers to more quickly develop new fabrication processes that produce production-level yields.

In many cases, we also provide our customers with limited indemnification with respect to claims that their use of our software products infringes on United States patents, copyrights, trademarks or trade secrets. We have not experienced material warranty or indemnity claims to date.Support for Industry StandardsWe actively create and support standards that help our EDA and IP customers increase productivity, facilitate efficient design flows, improve interoperability of tools from different vendors, and ensure connectivity, functionality and interoperability of IP building blocks. Standards in the electronic design industry can be established by formal accredited organizations, industry consortia, company licensing made available to all, de facto usage, or through open source licensing.Synopsys’ EDA products support more than 35 standards, including the most commonly used hardware description languages: SystemVerilog, Verilog, VHDL, and SystemC. Our products utilize numerous industry standard data formats, application programming interfaces, and databases for the exchange of design data among our tools, other EDA vendors’ products, and applications that customers develop internally. We also comply with a wide range of industry standards within our IP product family to ensure usability and interconnectivity. Our software integrity products support several existing and emerging industry standards for software coding and security, such as the MISRA coding standards for the automotive industry. In addition, our products support multiple 6Table of Contentsmajor programming languages, including Objective C, Javascript and security vulnerability coverage for C#, and are compatible with numerous common industry language compilers, development environments, and data and file formats.Sales, Distribution and BacklogOur EDA and IP customers are primarily semiconductor and electronics systems companies. The customers for our software integrity products include many of these companies as well as companies in a wider array of industries, including financial services, energy, and industrials. We market our products and services principally through direct sales in the United States and principal foreign markets. We typically distribute our software products and documentation to customers electronically, but provide physical media (e.g., DVD-ROMs) when requested by the customer.We maintain sales/support centers throughout the United States. Outside the United States, we maintain sales, support or service offices in Canada, multiple countries in Europe, Israel, Japan, China, Korea, Taiwan and other countries in Asia. Our international headquarters are located in Dublin, Ireland. Our offices are further described under Part I, Item 2, Properties.In fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, an aggregate of 49%, 50% and 52%, respectively, of Synopsys’ total revenue was derived from sales outside of the United States. Geographic revenue, which is based on where individual "seats" or licenses to our products are located, is shown below as a percentage of total revenue for the last three fiscal years.Additional information relating to domestic and foreign operations, including revenue and long-lived assets by geographic area, is contained in Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Risks related to our foreign operations are described in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors.Our backlog was approximately $3.6 billion on October 31, 2015, an increase from backlog of $3.5 billion on October 31, 2014, which resulted primarily from business growth, and to a lesser extent, acquisitions. Backlog represents committed orders that are expected to be recognized as revenue over the following three years. We currently expect that $1.7 billion of our backlog will be recognized after fiscal 2016. Backlog may not be a reliable predictor of our future sales as business conditions may change and technologies may evolve, and customers may 7Table of Contentsseek to renegotiate their arrangements or may default on their payment obligations. For this and other reasons, we may not be able to recognize expected revenue from backlog when anticipated.Revenue attributable to each of our four product categories is shown below as a percentage of total revenue for the last three fiscal years. *Our IP, Systems and Software Integrity category was referred to as IP and Software Solutions in fiscal 2014 and IP and System-Level Solutions in fiscal 2013.Aggregate revenue derived from Intel Corporation and its subsidiaries through multiple agreements accounted for 12.8%, 10.5% and 11.3% of our total revenue in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue during such periods.Product Sales and Licensing AgreementsWe typically license our software to customers under non-exclusive license agreements that transfer title to the media only and restrict use of our software to specified purposes within specified geographical areas. The majority of our licenses are network licenses that allow a number of individual users to access the software on a defined network, including, in some cases, regional or global networks. License fees depend on the type of license, product mix and number of copies of each product licensed.Generally, we provide our customers the right to “re-mix” a portion of the software they initially licensed for other specified Synopsys products. For example, a customer may use our front-end design products for a portion of the license term and then exchange such products for back-end place and route software for the remainder of the term in order to complete the customer’s IC design. This practice helps assure the customer’s access to the complete design flow needed to design its product. The ability to offer this right to customers gives us an advantage over competitors who offer a narrower range of products because customers can obtain more of their design flow from a single vendor. At the same time, because in such cases the customer need not obtain a new license and pay an additional license fee for the use of the additional products, the use of these arrangements could result in reduced revenue compared to licensing the individual products separately without re-mix rights.We currently offer our software products under various license types: renewable TSLs, term licenses and perpetual licenses. For a full discussion of these licenses, see Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates and Results of Operations—Revenue Background.8Table of ContentsWe typically license our DesignWare Core intellectual property products under nonexclusive license agreements that provide usage rights for specific applications. Fees under these licenses are typically charged on a per design basis plus, in some cases, royalties. Royalty arrangements are not material to our total revenue.Our hardware products, which principally consist of our prototyping and emulation systems, are either sold or leased to our customers. Hardware revenue is not material to our total revenue.Finally, our Global Technical Services team typically provides design consulting services to our customers under consulting agreements with statements of work specific to each project.Research and DevelopmentOur future performance depends in large part on our ability to further enhance and extend our design and verification platforms and to expand our IP, system-level, software integrity and manufacturing product offerings. Research and development of existing and new products is primarily conducted within each product group. We also use targeted acquisitions to augment our own research and development efforts.Our research and development expenses were $776.2 million, $718.8 million and $669.2 million in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Our capitalized software development costs were approximately $3.7 million, $3.6 million and $3.6 million in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.CompetitionThe EDA industry is highly competitive. We compete against other EDA vendors and against our customers’ own design tools and internal design capabilities. In general, we compete principally on technology leadership, product quality and features (including ease-of-use), license terms, price and payment terms, post-contract customer support, and interoperability with our own and other vendors’ products. No one factor drives an EDA customer’s buying decision, and we compete on all fronts to capture a higher portion of our customers’ budgets. Our competitors include EDA vendors that offer varying ranges of products and services, such as Cadence Design Systems, Inc. and Mentor Graphics Corporation. We also compete with other EDA vendors, including new entrants to the marketplace, that offer products focused on one or more discrete phases of the IC design process, as well as with customers’ internally developed design tools and capabilities. In the area of IP products, we compete against numerous other IP providers, including Cadence Design Systems, Inc., and our customers' internally developed IP, and we generally compete on the basis of product quality and features, ease of integration with customer designs, compatibility with design tools, license terms, price and payment terms, and customer support. In the area of software integrity products, the market is still developing, and we compete with numerous tool providers, some of which focus on specific aspects of software security or quality analysis, as well as frequent new entrants, which include start-up companies as well as more established software companies.Proprietary RightsSynopsys primarily relies upon a combination of copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws and license and nondisclosure agreements to establish and protect its proprietary rights. We have a diversified portfolio of more than 2,500 United States and foreign patents issued, and we will continue to pursue additional patents in the future. Our issued patents have expiration dates through 2034. Our patents primarily relate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products. Our source code is protected both as a trade secret and as an unpublished copyrighted work. However, third parties may develop similar technology independently. In addition, effective copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries. While protecting our proprietary technology is important to our success, our business as a whole is not significantly dependent upon any single patent, copyright, trademark or license.In many cases, under our customer agreements and other license agreements, we offer to indemnify our customers if the licensed products infringe on a third party’s intellectual property rights. As a result, we may from time to time need to defend claims that our customers’ use of our products infringes on these third-party rights.We license software and other intellectual property from third parties, including, in several instances, for inclusion in our products. Risks related to our use of third-party technology are described in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors.EmployeesAs of October 31, 2015, Synopsys had 10,284 employees, of which 3,760 were based in the United States.9Table of ContentsExecutive Officers of the RegistrantThe executive officers of Synopsys and their ages as of December 14, 2015 were as follows:Name Age PositionAart J. de Geus 61 Co-Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of DirectorsChi-Foon Chan 66 Co-Chief Executive Officer and PresidentTrac Pham 46 Chief Financial OfficerBrian M.
