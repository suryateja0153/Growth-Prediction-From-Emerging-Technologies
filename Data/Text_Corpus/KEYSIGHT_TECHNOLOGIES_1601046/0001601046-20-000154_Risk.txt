Risk Factors.”41Table of Contents            Net Cash Provided by Operating ActivitiesCash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period as working capital needs and the timing of payments for income taxes, restructuring activities, pension funding, variable pay and other items impact reported cash flows.Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,016 million for the year ended October 31, 2020 as compared to $998 million provided in 2019 and $555 million provided in 2018.•Net income in 2020 increased by $6 million as compared to 2019. Non-cash adjustments in 2020 increased $34 million compared to 2019, primarily due to a $43 million increase in deferred tax expense, a $10 million increase in share-based compensation expense, a $10 million increase in amortization expense and an $8 million increase in depreciation expense, partially offset by an adjustment for a $32 million gain from an insurance settlement related to damage from the 2017 northern California wildfires, which is reflected in investing activities, and a $7 million decrease from other miscellaneous non-cash activities.Net income in 2019 increased by $456 million as compared to 2018. Non-cash adjustments in 2019 increased $102 million compared to 2018, driven by a $787 million decrease in deferred tax benefits due to the 2018 impact of U.S. and Singapore tax law changes and the tax impact of goodwill impairment, a $23 million increase in share-based compensation expense, a $19 million reduction in the gain on sales of assets and divestitures and a $5 million increase in amortization expense, partially offset by a $709 million reduction in the goodwill impairment, a $7 million decrease in depreciation expense and a $16 million decrease from other miscellaneous non-cash activities.•The aggregate of accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable used net cash of $31 million during 2020, compared to net cash used of $105 million in 2019 and $128 million in 2018. The amount of cash flow generated from or used by the aggregate of accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable depends on the cash conversion cycle, which represents the number of days that elapse from the day we pay for the purchase of raw materials and components to the collection of cash from our customers and can be significantly impacted by the timing of shipments and purchases, as well as collections and payments in a period.•The aggregate of employee compensation and benefits, income taxes payable, deferred revenue, and other assets and liabilities provided net operating cash of $82 million during 2020 as compared to net cash provided of $107 million and $335 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The difference between 2020 and 2019 activities is primarily due to lower cash inflow from deferred revenue, partially offset by an increase in deferred payroll taxes of $21 million and increase in cash from income taxes payable as compared to the same period last year. The difference between 2019 and 2018 activities is primarily driven by an increase in income taxes payable due to the establishment of a long-term transition tax liability resulting from U.S. tax legislation that was enacted in 2018 and higher variable compensation payments, partially offset by lower cash outflow for fire-related recovery. In 2020, 2019 and 2018, we received insurance proceeds of $5 million, $37 million and $94 million, respectively, associated with recovery from the 2017 northern California wildfires and a 2016 Singapore warehouse fire.•Net cash used for retirement and post-retirement benefits was $108 million, $37 million and $127 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In 2020, we made a $100 million contribution to our U.S. Defined Benefit Plan compared to zero in 2019 and $85 million in 2018. We contributed $10 million to our non-U.S. defined benefit plans in 2020 compared to $26 million in 2019 and $33 million in 2018. We did not contribute to the Keysight Technologies, Inc. Health Plan for Retirees ("U.S. Post-Retirement Benefit Plan") in 2020, 2019 and 2018.Net Cash Used in Investing ActivitiesNet cash used in investing activities was $442 million, $196 million and $108 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Investments in property, plant and equipment were $117 million, $120 million and $132 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Capital spending in 2019 and 2018 includes $7 million and $27 million, respectively, related to recovery from the 2017 northern California wildfires. In 2020 we paid $319 million, net of $11 million of cash acquired, for the acquisition of Eggplant Topco Limited ("Eggplant"), a software test automation platform provider that uses artificial intelligence and analytics to automate test creation and test execution and we used $38 million to acquire two other businesses, partially offset by $32 million of insurance proceeds for property, plant and equipment damaged in the 2017 northern California wildfires. In 2019 we paid $88 million, net of $56 million of cash acquired, for the acquisition of Prisma Telecom Testing, a global provider of radio access network test solutions. We also received $7 million of proceeds from the sale of investments and $2 million from divestitures.

In 2020 we used net cash of $413 million primarily for $411 million of treasury stock purchases, which nearly exhausted our $500 million share repurchase authorization from May 2019, $53 million of tax payments related to net share settlement of equity awards and $7 million repayment of short-term debt, partially offset by proceeds from issuance of common stock under employee stock plans of $58 million.In 2019 we used net cash of $122 million, primarily for a $500 million repayment of short-term debt, $159 million for treasury stock purchases and $26 million of tax payments related to net share settlement of equity awards, partially offset by proceeds from issuance of long-term debt of $496 million, net of issuance costs, and $67 million from issuance of common stock under employee stock plans.In 2018 we used $341 million for financing activities, primarily for a $260 million repayment of term loan borrowings, $120 million for treasury stock purchases, $18 million of tax payments related to net share settlement of equity awards and $6 million for acquisition-related contingent consideration, partially offset by proceeds of $64 million from issuance of common stock under employee stock plans.On November 18, 2020, our board of directors approved a new stock repurchase program authorizing the purchase of up to $750 million of the company’s common stock.

Short-Term DebtRevolving Credit FacilityOn February 15, 2017, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) that replaced our existing $450 million unsecured credit facility dated September 15, 2014.

Contractual CommitmentsOur cash flows from operations are dependent on a number of factors, including fluctuations in our operating results, accounts receivable collections, inventory management, and the timing of tax and other payments. As a result, the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with such factors.The following table summarizes our total contractual obligations at October 31, 2020. The amounts presented in the table do not reflect $144 million of liabilities for uncertain tax positions as of October 31, 2020. We are unable to accurately predict when these amounts will be realized or released. However, it is reasonably possible that there could be significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months due to either the expiration of a statute of limitations or a tax audit settlement.

We have contractual obligations for interest payments on our senior notes. Interest rates and payment dates are detailed above under "Long-term debt."Operating leases.  Commitments under operating leases primarily relates to leasehold property. See Note 16, "Leases" for additional information.Commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers.  We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, we issue purchase orders with estimates of our requirements several months ahead of the delivery dates.The reported open purchase orders represent a commitment to our suppliers. Our agreements with suppliers for common materials provide us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on business needs. We expect to fulfill most of our purchase commitments for inventory within one year or based on mutually agreed terms.As of October 31, 2020, the non-cancellable purchase commitments aggregate to approximately $291 million, of which the majority is for less than one year.In addition to the commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers referenced above, we record a liability for firm, non-cancellable purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with our policy relating to excess inventory. The liability for our excess firm, non-cancellable purchase commitments was $21 million as of both October 31, 2020 and 2019. These amounts are included in other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet.Retirement plans.  Commitments under the retirement plans relate to expected contributions to be made to our non-U.S. defined benefit plans for the next year only. Contributions beyond the next year are impractical to estimate.We also have benefit payments due under our defined benefit retirement plans and post-retirement benefit plan that are not required to be funded in advance, but are paid in the same period that benefits are provided.
