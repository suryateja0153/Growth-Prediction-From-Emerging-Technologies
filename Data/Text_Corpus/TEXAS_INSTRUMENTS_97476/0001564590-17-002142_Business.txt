Business.   We design and make semiconductors that we sell to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world. We began operations in 1930. We are incorporated in Delaware, headquartered in Dallas, Texas, and have design, manufacturing or sales operations in more than 30 countries. We have two reportable segments: Analog and Embedded Processing. We report the results of our remaining business activities in Other. In 2016, we generated $13.37 billion of revenue.   We focus our resources on Analog and Embedded Processing because we believe that these segments’ long product life cycles, intrinsic diversity and need for less capital-intensive manufacturing provide a combination of stability, profitability and strong cash generation. This business model is the foundation of our capital management strategy, which is based on our belief that free cash flow growth is important for maximizing shareholder value over the long term. We also believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business or returned to shareholders. Free cash flow is cash flow from operations less capital expenditures.   Product information   Semiconductors are electronic components that serve as the building blocks inside modern electronic systems and equipment. Semiconductors, generally known as “chips,” combine multiple transistors to form a complete electronic circuit. We have tens of thousands of products that are used to accomplish many different things, such as converting and amplifying signals, interfacing with other devices, managing and distributing power, processing data, canceling noise and improving signal resolution. This broad portfolio includes products that are integral to almost all electronic equipment.   Our segments represent groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements, product characteristics, manufacturing processes and distribution channels. Our segments also reflect how management allocates resources and measures results. Additional information regarding each segment follows.   Analog   Analog generated $8.54 billion of revenue in 2016. Analog semiconductors change real-world signals, such as sound, temperature, pressure or images, by conditioning them, amplifying them and often converting them to a stream of digital data that can be processed by other semiconductors, such as embedded processors. Analog semiconductors also are used to manage power in all electronic equipment by converting, distributing, storing, discharging, isolating and measuring electrical energy, whether the equipment is plugged into a wall or running off a battery. Our Analog products are used in many markets, particularly personal electronics and industrial.    Sales of our Analog products generated about 64 percent of our revenue in 2016. According to external sources, the market for analog semiconductors was about $48 billion in 2016. Our Analog segment’s revenue in 2016 was about 18 percent of this fragmented market, the leading position. We believe we are well positioned to increase our market share over time.   In 2016, our Analog segment included the following major product lines: High Volume Analog & Logic (HVAL), Power Management (Power), High Performance Analog (HPA) and Silicon Valley Analog (SVA).   HVAL HVAL included high-volume integrated products that support applications like automotive safety systems, touchscreen controllers, low-voltage motor drivers and integrated motor controllers.   Power Power included products that help customers manage power in electronic systems. Our broad portfolio of Power products is designed to manage power requirements using battery management solutions, portable power components, power supply controls and point-of-load products.   2    HPA HPA included products that we market to many different customers who use them in manufacturing a wide range of end products. HPA products included high-speed data converters, amplifiers, sensors, high-reliability products, interface products and precision products that are typically used in systems that require high performance. HPA products generally have long life cycles, often more than 10 years.   SVA SVA included a broad portfolio of industrial, high-voltage power management, data converter, interface and operational amplifier products used in manufacturing a wide range of electronic systems. SVA products support applications like video and data interface products, high voltage power conversion, and mobile lighting and display systems. SVA products generally have long life cycles, often more than 10 years. SVA consisted primarily of products that we acquired through our purchase of National Semiconductor Corporation in 2011.   Embedded Processing   Embedded Processing generated $3.02 billion of revenue in 2016. Embedded Processing products are the “brains” of many types of electronic equipment. Embedded processors are designed to handle specific tasks and can be optimized for various combinations of performance, power and cost, depending on the application. Our devices vary from simple, low-cost microcontrollers used in electric toothbrushes to highly specialized, complex devices used in automotive applications such as infotainment systems and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). Our Embedded Processing products are used in many markets, particularly industrial, automotive and communications equipment.   An important characteristic of our Embedded Processing products is that our customers often invest their own research and development (R&D) to write software that operates on our products. This investment tends to increase the length of our customer relationships because many customers prefer to re-use software from one product generation to the next.    Sales of Embedded Processing products generated about 23 percent of our revenue in 2016. According to external sources, the market for embedded processors was about $18 billion in 2016. Our Embedded Processing segment’s revenue in 2016 was about 17 percent of this fragmented market, among the leaders. We believe we are well positioned to increase our market share over time.    In 2016, our Embedded Processing segment included the following major product lines: Processors, Microcontrollers and Connectivity.   Processors Processors included digital signal processors (DSPs) and applications processors. DSPs perform mathematical computations almost instantaneously to process or improve digital data. Applications processors are designed for specific computing activity.   Microcontrollers Microcontrollers included self-contained systems with a processor core, memory and peripherals that are designed to control a set of specific tasks for electronic equipment. Microcontrollers tend to have minimal requirements for memory and program length, with no operating system and low software complexity. Analog components that control or interface with sensors and other systems are often integrated into microcontrollers.   Connectivity Connectivity included products that enable electronic equipment to connect and transfer data wirelessly, with the requirements for speed, data capability, distance, power and security varying depending on the application. Our Connectivity products support many wireless technologies to meet these requirements, including low-power wireless network standards like Sub-1GHz, Zigbee® and other technologies like Bluetooth® and WiFi.   3    Other   We report the results of our remaining business activities in Other, which included operating segments that do not meet the quantitative thresholds for individually reportable segments and cannot be aggregated with other operating segments. Other generated $1.81 billion of revenue in 2016 and included revenue from DLP® products (primarily used in projectors to create high-definition images), calculators, certain custom semiconductors known as application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and royalties received from agreements involving license rights to our patent portfolio.    In Other, we also included items that are not used in evaluating the results of or in allocating resources to our segments. Examples of these items include acquisition charges; restructuring charges; and certain corporate-level items, such as litigation expenses, environmental costs, insurance settlements, and gains and losses from other activities, including asset dispositions.    Financial information with respect to our segments and our operations outside the United States is contained in Note 1 to the financial statements, which is included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Risks attendant to our foreign operations are described in Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” 4    Markets for our products The table below lists the major markets that used our products in 2016 and the estimated percentage of our 2016 revenue that the market represented. The chart also lists, in declining order of our revenue, the sectors within each market.       Market     Sector    Industrial (33% of TI revenue)     Factory automation and control Medical/healthcare/fitness Building automation Grid infrastructure Test and measurement Space/avionics/defense Motor drives Electronic point of sale Appliances Power delivery Display Industrial transportation Lighting Industrial other               Automotive (18% of TI revenue)     Infotainment and cluster Passive safety  Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) Hybrid/electric vehicle and powertrain Body electronics and lighting               Personal electronics (26% of TI revenue)     Mobile phones Personal and notebook computers Storage Portable electronics Tablets Home theater and entertainment Printers and other peripherals TV Wearables (non-medical) Gaming               Communications equipment (13% of TI revenue)     Wireless infrastructure  Telecom infrastructure Enterprise switching Residential               Enterprise systems (6% of TI revenue)     Projectors Servers High-performance computing Multi-function printers Thin client    Other (calculators, royalties and other) (4% of TI revenue)           5    Market characteristics Competitive landscape Despite recent consolidation, the analog and embedded processing markets remain highly fragmented. As a result, we face significant global competition from dozens of large and small companies, including both broad-based suppliers and niche suppliers. Our competitors also include emerging companies, particularly in Asia, that sell products into the same markets in which we operate.    We believe that competitive performance in the semiconductor market generally depends on several factors, including the breadth of a company’s product line, the strength and depth of its channels to market, technological innovation, product development execution, technical support, customer service, quality, reliability, price and scale. The primary competitive factors for our Analog products include design proficiency, a diverse product portfolio to meet wide-ranging customer needs, manufacturing process technologies that provide differentiated levels of performance, applications and sales support, and manufacturing expertise and capacity. The primary competitive factors for our Embedded Processing products are the ability to design and cost-effectively manufacture products, system-level knowledge about targeted end markets, the installed base of software, software expertise, applications and sales support, and a product’s performance, integration and power characteristics.   Product cycle The global semiconductor market is characterized by constant, though generally incremental, advances in product designs and manufacturing processes. Semiconductor prices and manufacturing costs tend to decline over time as manufacturing processes and product life cycles mature.   Market cycle The “semiconductor cycle” refers to the ebb and flow of supply and demand and the building and depleting of inventories. The semiconductor market historically has been characterized by periods of tight supply caused by strengthening demand and/or insufficient manufacturing capacity, followed by periods of surplus inventory caused by weakening demand and/or excess manufacturing capacity. These are typically referred to as upturns and downturns in the semiconductor cycle. The semiconductor cycle could be affected by the significant time and money required to build and maintain semiconductor manufacturing facilities.   We employ several strategies to dampen the effect of the semiconductor cycle on TI. We acquire our manufacturing facilities and equipment ahead of demand, which usually allows us to acquire this capacity at lower costs. We focus our resources on our Analog and Embedded Processing segments, which serve diverse markets and diverse customers. This diversity reduces our dependence on the performance of a single market or small group of customers. Additionally, we utilize consignment inventory programs with our customers and distributors that give us improved insight into customer demand.    Seasonality Our revenue is subject to some seasonal variation. Historically, our sequential revenue growth rate tends to be weaker in the first and fourth quarters when compared to the second and third quarters.   Manufacturing   Semiconductor manufacturing begins with a sequence of photolithographic and chemical processing steps that fabricate a number of semiconductor devices on a thin silicon wafer. Each device on the wafer is packaged and tested. The entire process takes place in highly specialized facilities and requires an average of 12 weeks, with most products completing within 7 to 15 weeks.   The cost and lifespan of the equipment and processes we use to manufacture semiconductors vary by technology. Our Analog products and most of our Embedded Processing products can be manufactured using mature and stable, and therefore less expensive, equipment than is needed for manufacturing advanced logic products, such as some of our processor products.   We own and operate semiconductor manufacturing facilities in North America, Asia, Japan and Europe. These include both wafer fabrication and assembly/test facilities. Our facilities require substantial investment to construct and are largely fixed-cost assets once in operation. We own much of our manufacturing capacity; therefore, a significant portion of our operating cost is fixed and changes in factory loadings can cause short-term variations in profit margins. When factory loadings decrease, our fixed costs are spread over reduced output and, absent other circumstances, our profit margins decrease. Conversely, as factory loadings increase, our fixed costs are spread over increased output and, absent other circumstances, our profit margins increase. Our operating focus is more on  6    maximizing long-term free cash flow than minimizing short-term variations in profit margins caused by factory loadings. To this end, we seek to maximize long-term free cash flow by keeping capital expenditures low through opportunistic purchases of facilities and equipment ahead of demand.   We expect to maintain sufficient internal manufacturing capacity to meet the vast majority of our production needs. To supplement our manufacturing capacity and maximize our responsiveness to customer demand and return on capital, we utilize the capacity of outside suppliers, commonly known as foundries, and subcontractors. In 2016, we sourced about 20 percent of our total wafers from external foundries and about 40 percent of our assembly/test services from subcontractors.   Customers   We estimate that we sell our products to about 100,000 customers. Our customer base is diverse, with more than one-third of our revenue deriving from customers outside our largest 100.   Sales and distribution   We market and sell our semiconductor products through direct sales and distributors, and online. We have sales or marketing offices in more than 30 countries and we continue to expand our online presence. About 60 percent of our sales are fulfilled through distribution channels. Our distributors maintain an inventory of our products and sell directly to a wide range of customers. They also sell products from our competitors.   Inventory   Our inventory practices differ by product, but we generally maintain inventory levels that are consistent with our expectations of customer demand. We carry proportionally more inventory of products with long life cycles and a broad customer base. Additionally, we sometimes maintain product inventory in unfinished wafer form, as well as higher finished-goods inventory of low-volume products, allowing greater flexibility in periods of high demand.   About 60 percent of TI revenue is fulfilled from consignment inventory programs that we have in place for our large customers and distributors. With these programs, we own inventory that is stored at our customers’ and distributors’ locations, and we recognize revenue when the product is pulled from consigned inventory. These consignment programs give us improved insight into demand, allowing us to better manage our factory loadings. About 65 percent of our distributor revenue is generated from sales of consigned inventory.   Backlog   We define backlog as of a particular date as purchase orders with a customer-requested delivery date within a specified length of time. Our backlog at any particular date may not be indicative of revenue for any future period. As customer requirements and industry conditions change, orders may be subject to cancellation or modification of terms such as pricing, quantity or delivery date. Customer order placement practices continually evolve based on customers’ individual business needs and capabilities, as well as industry supply and capacity considerations. Further, our consignment programs do not result in backlog because the order occurs at the same time as delivery, i.e., when the customer pulls the product from consigned inventory. Our backlog of orders was $1.09 billion at December 31, 2016, and $0.95 billion at December 31, 2015.   Acquisitions, divestitures and investments   From time to time we consider acquisitions and divestitures that may strengthen our strategic position. We also make investments directly or indirectly in private companies. Investments are focused primarily on next-generation technologies and markets strategic to us.   Raw materials   We purchase materials, parts and supplies from a number of suppliers. In some cases we purchase such items from sole source suppliers. The materials, parts and supplies essential to our business are generally available at present, and we believe that such materials, parts and supplies will be available in the foreseeable future.    7    Intellectual property   We own many patents, and have many patent applications pending, in the United States and other countries in fields relating to our business. We have developed a strong, broad-based patent portfolio and continually add patents to that portfolio. We also have license agreements, which vary in duration, involving rights to our portfolio or those of other companies. We do not consider our business materially dependent upon any one patent or patent license. We often participate in industry initiatives to set technical standards. Our competitors may participate in the same initiatives. Participation in these initiatives may require us to license certain of our patents to other companies on reasonable and non-discriminatory terms.   We own trademarks that are used in the conduct of our business. These trademarks are valuable assets, the most important of which are “Texas Instruments” and our corporate monogram.   Research and development   Our R&D expense was $1.37 billion in 2016, compared with $1.28 billion in 2015 and $1.36 billion in 2014. Our primary areas of R&D investment are Analog and Embedded Processing products.   We conduct most of our R&D internally. However, we also closely engage with a wide range of third parties, including software suppliers, universities and select industry consortia, and we collaborate with our foundry suppliers on semiconductor manufacturing technology.
