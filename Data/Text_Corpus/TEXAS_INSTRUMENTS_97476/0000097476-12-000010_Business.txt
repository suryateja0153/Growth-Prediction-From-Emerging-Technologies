Business.  Company OverviewAt TI, we design and make semiconductors that we sell to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world.  We began operations in 1930.  We are incorporated in Delaware, headquartered in Dallas, Texas, and have design, manufacturing or sales operations in more than 35 countries.  We have four segments: Analog, Embedded Processing, Wireless and Other.  We expect Analog and Embedded Processing to be our primary growth engines in the years ahead, and we therefore focus our resources on these segments.We were the world’s fourth largest semiconductor company in 2011 as measured by revenue, according to preliminary estimates from an external source.  Additionally, we sell calculators and related products.On September 23, 2011, we completed the acquisition of National Semiconductor Corporation (National).  The acquisition has brought to TI a portfolio of thousands of analog products, strong customer design tools and additional manufacturing capacity, and is consistent with our strategy to grow our Analog business.  The results of National’s operations from the acquisition date are included in our Analog segment under the name Silicon Valley Analog.Financial information with respect to our segments and our operations outside the United States is contained in the note to the financial statements captioned “Segment and geographic area data” in TI’s 2011 annual report to stockholders.  It is incorporated herein by reference to such annual report.  Product InformationSemiconductors are electronic components that serve as the building blocks inside modern electronic systems and equipment.  Semiconductors come in two basic forms: individual transistors and integrated circuits (generally known as “chips”) that combine multiple transistors on a single piece of material to form a complete electronic circuit.  Our products, more than 80,000 in number, are integrated circuits that are used to accomplish many different things, such as converting and amplifying signals, interfacing with other devices, managing and distributing power, processing data, canceling noise and improving signal resolution.  This broad portfolio includes products that are integral to almost all electronic equipment.We sell custom and catalog semiconductor products.  Custom products are designed for a specific customer for a specific application, are sold only to that customer and are typically sold directly to the customer.  The life cycles of custom products are generally determined by end-equipment upgrade cycles and can be as short as 12 to 24 months.  Catalog products are designed for use by many customers and/or many applications and are generally sold through both distribution and direct channels.  They include both proprietary and commodity products.  The life cycles of catalog products are generally longer than for custom products.   Additional information regarding each segment’s products follows. Analog Analog semiconductors change real-world signals — such as sound, temperature, pressure or images — by conditioning them, amplifying them and often converting them to a stream of digital data that can be processed by other semiconductors, such as digital signal processors (DSPs).  Analog semiconductors are also used to manage power distribution and consumption.  Sales to our Analog segment’s more than 90,000 customers generated about 47 percent of our revenue in 2011.  According to external sources, the worldwide market for analog semiconductors was about $43 billion in 2011.  Our Analog segment’s revenue in 2011 was about $6.5 billion, or about 15 percent of this fragmented market, the leading position.  We believe that we are well positioned to increase our market share over time.Our Analog segment includes the following major product lines:  High Volume Analog & Logic (HVAL), Power Management (Power), High Performance Analog (HPA) and Silicon Valley Analog (SVA).HVAL products:  These include both high-volume analog products and logic and standard linear products.  High-volume analog includes products for specific applications, including custom products.  The life cycles of our high-volume analog products are generally shorter than most of our other Analog product lines.  End markets for high-volume analog products include communications, automotive, computing and many consumer electronics products.  Logic and standard linear 3includes commodity products marketed to many different customers for many different applications.Power products:  These include both catalog and custom semiconductors that help customers manage power in any type of electronic system.  We design and manufacture power management semiconductors for both portable devices (battery-powered devices, such as handheld consumer electronics, laptop computers and cordless power tools) and line-powered systems (products that require an external electrical source, such as computers, digital TVs, wireless basestations and high-voltage industrial equipment).HPA products:  These include catalog analog semiconductors, such as amplifiers, data converters and interface semiconductors, that we market to many different customers who use them in manufacturing a wide range of products sold in many end markets, including the industrial, communications, computing and consumer electronics markets.  HPA products generally have long life cycles, often more than 10 years.  SVA products:  These include catalog analog products, particularly in the areas of power management, data converters, interface and operational amplifiers, nearly all of which are complementary to our other Analog products.  This portfolio of thousands of products is marketed to many different customers who use them in manufacturing a wide range of products sold in many end markets.  Many SVA products have long life cycles, often more than 10 years.  Embedded ProcessingOur Embedded Processing products include our DSPs and microcontrollers.  DSPs perform mathematical computations almost instantaneously to process or improve digital data.  Microcontrollers are designed to control a set of specific tasks for electronic equipment.  Sales of Embedded Processing products generated about 15 percent of our revenue in 2011.  According to external sources, the worldwide market for embedded processors was about $18 billion in 2011.  Our Embedded Processing segment’s revenue in 2011 was about $2.0 billion, or about 12 percent of this fragmented market.   We believe we are well positioned to increase our market share over time.  An important characteristic of our Embedded Processing products is that our customers often invest their own research and development (R&D) to write software that operates on our products.  This investment tends to increase the length of our customer relationships because customers prefer to re-use software from one product generation to the next.  We make and sell catalog Embedded Processing products used in many different applications and custom Embedded Processing products used in specific applications, such as communications infrastructure equipment and automotive.  WirelessGrowth in the wireless market is being driven by the demand for smartphones, tablet computers and other emerging portable devices.  Many of today’s smartphones and tablets use an applications processor to run the device’s software operating system and to enable the expanding functionality that has made smartphones and tablets the fastest growing wireless market segments.  Many wireless devices also use other semiconductors to enable wireless connectivity using technologies such as Bluetooth®, WiFi networks, GPS and Near Field Communications (NFC).We design, make and sell products to satisfy each of these requirements.  Wireless products are typically sold in high volumes.  Our Wireless portfolio includes both catalog products and custom products.  Sales of Wireless products generated about $2.5 billion, or about 18 percent of our revenue, in 2011, with a majority of those sales to a single customer.Our Wireless investments are concentrated on our OMAPTM applications processors and our connectivity products, areas we believe offer significant growth opportunities and which will enable us to take advantage of the increasing demand for more powerful and more functional wireless devices.  We no longer invest in development of baseband products (products that allow a cell phone to connect to the cellular network), an area we believe offers far less promising growth prospects.  Almost all of our baseband products are sold to a single customer.  We expect substantially all of our baseband revenue, which was $1.1 billion in 2011, to cease by the end of 2012. OtherOur Other segment includes revenue from our smaller semiconductor product lines and from sales of our handheld graphing and scientific calculators.  It also includes royalties received for our patented technology that we license to other electronics companies and revenue from transitional supply agreements that we may enter into in connection with acquisitions and divestitures.  The semiconductor products in our Other segment include DLP® products (primarily used in 4projectors to create high-definition images) and custom semiconductors known as application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs).  This segment generated about $2.5 billion, or about 20 percent of our revenue, in 2011.Applications for Our ProductsThe table below lists the major end markets that used our products in 2011 and the approximate percentage of our 2011 product revenue that the market represented.

Semiconductor prices and manufacturing costs tend to decline over time as manufacturing processes and product life cycles mature.  Typically, new chips are produced in limited quantities at first and then ramp to high-volume production over time.  Market cycleThe “semiconductor cycle” is an important concept that refers to the ebb and flow of supply.  The semiconductor market historically has been characterized by periods of tight supply caused by strengthening demand and/or insufficient manufacturing capacity, followed by periods of surplus inventory caused by weakening demand and/or excess manufacturing capacity.  This cycle is affected by the significant time and money required to build and maintain semiconductor manufacturing facilities.SeasonalityOur revenue and operating results are subject to some seasonal variation.  Our semiconductor sales generally are seasonally weaker in the first quarter than in other quarters, particularly for products sold into cell phones and other consumer electronics devices, which have stronger sales later in the year as manufacturers prepare for the major holiday selling seasons.  Calculator revenue is tied to the U.S. back-to-school season and is therefore at its highest in the second and third quarters.  Competitive landscapeIn each segment, we face significant global competition from numerous large and small companies, including both broad-based suppliers and niche suppliers.  Our competitors also include emerging companies, particularly in Asia, that sell products into the same markets in which we operate.  We believe that competitive performance in the semiconductor market generally depends on several factors, including the breadth of a company’s product line, the strength and depth of the sales network, technological innovation, technical support, customer service, quality, reliability, price and scale.  The primary competitive factors for our Analog products include design proficiency, a diverse product portfolio to meet wide-ranging customer needs, manufacturing process technologies that provide differentiated levels of performance, applications and sales support, and manufacturing expertise and capacity.  Our primary Analog competitors include Analog Devices, Inc.; Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation; Freescale Semiconductor, Inc.; Infineon Technologies AG; Intersil Corporation; Linear Technology Corporation; Maxim Integrated Products, Inc.; NXP Semiconductors N.V.; Richtek Technology Corporation; and STMicroelectronics NV.The primary competitive factors for our Embedded Processing products are the ability to design and cost-effectively manufacture products, system-level knowledge about targeted end markets, installed base of software, software expertise, applications and sales support, and a product’s performance and power characteristics.  Primary competitors of our Embedded Processing segment include Atmel Corporation; Freescale Semiconductor, Inc.; Microchip Technology, Inc.; NXP Semiconductors N.V.; Renesas Electronics Corporation; and STMicroelectronics NV.The primary competitive factors for our Wireless products are the ability to design and cost-effectively manufacture products, system-level knowledge about targeted end markets, software expertise, applications support and a product’s performance and power characteristics.  Primary Wireless competitors include Broadcom Corp.; CSR plc; Intel Corporation; Marvell Technology Group, Ltd.; NVIDIA Corporation; QUALCOMM Incorporated; Renesas Electronics Corporation; Samsung LSI; and ST-Ericsson. Manufacturing Semiconductor manufacturing begins with a sequence of photo-lithographic and chemical processing steps that fabricate a number of semiconductor devices on a thin silicon wafer.  Each device on the wafer is tested and the wafer is cut into pieces called chips.  Each chip is assembled into a package that then is usually retested.  The entire process typically requires between 12 and 18 weeks and takes place in highly specialized facilities.We own and operate semiconductor manufacturing facilities in North America, Asia and Europe.  These include both 6high-volume wafer fabrication and assembly/test facilities.  Our facilities require substantial investment to construct and are largely fixed-cost assets once in operation.  Because we own much of our manufacturing capacity, a significant portion of our operating cost is fixed.  In general, these fixed costs do not decline with reductions in customer demand or utilization of capacity, potentially hurting our profit margins.  Conversely, as product demand rises and factory utilization increases, the fixed costs are spread over increased output, potentially benefiting our profit margins.  The cost and lifespan of the equipment and processes we use to manufacture semiconductors vary by product.  Our Analog products and most of our Embedded Processing products can be manufactured using older, less expensive equipment than is needed for manufacturing advanced logic products, such as our Wireless products.  Advanced logic wafer manufacturing continually requires new and expensive processes and equipment.  In contrast, the processes and equipment required for manufacturing our Analog products and most of our Embedded Processing products do not have this requirement.      To supplement our internal wafer fabrication capacity and maximize our responsiveness to customer demand and return on capital, our wafer manufacturing strategy utilizes the capacity of outside suppliers, commonly known as foundries.  We source about 25 percent of our wafers from external foundries, with the vast majority of this outsourcing being for advanced logic wafers.  In 2011, external foundries provided about 75 percent of the fabricated wafers for our advanced logic manufacturing needs.  We expect the proportion of our advanced logic wafers provided by foundries will increase over time.  We expect to maintain sufficient internal wafer fabrication capacity to meet the vast majority of our analog production needs.  In addition to using foundries to supplement our wafer fabrication capacity, we selectively use subcontractors to supplement our assembly/test capacity.  We generally use subcontractors for assembly/test of products that would be less cost-efficient to complete in-house (e.g., relatively low-volume products that are unlikely to keep internal equipment fully utilized), or when demand temporarily exceeds our internal capacity.  We believe we often have a cost advantage from maintaining internal assembly/test capacity.  Our internal/external manufacturing strategy reduces the level of our required capital expenditures, and thereby reduces our subsequent levels of depreciation below what it would be if we sourced all manufacturing internally.  Consequently, we experience less fluctuation in our profit margins due to changing product demand, and lower cash requirements for expanding and updating our manufacturing capabilities. InventoryOur inventory practices differ by product, but we generally maintain inventory levels that are consistent with our expectations of customer demand.  Because of the longer product life cycles of catalog products and their inherently lower risk of obsolescence, we generally carry more of those products than custom products.  Additionally, we sometimes maintain catalog-product inventory in unfinished wafer form, as well as higher finished goods inventory of low-volume products, allowing greater flexibility in periods of high demand.  We also have consignment inventory programs in place for our largest customers and some distributors.Design Centers Our design centers provide design, engineering and product application support as well as after-sales customer service.  The design centers are strategically located around the world to take advantage of key technical and engineering talent and proximity to key customers.  Customers Our products are sold to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), original design manufacturers (ODMs), contract manufacturers and distributors.  (An OEM designs and sells products under its own brand that it manufactures in-house or has manufactured by others.  An ODM designs and manufactures products for other companies, which then sell those products under their own brand.)  Our largest single customer in 2011 was an OEM, the Nokia group of companies.  Sales to Nokia were about 13 percent of our revenue in 2011; about two-thirds of the Nokia-related revenue was from baseband products.  Sales and Distribution We market and sell our semiconductor products through a direct sales force, distributors and authorized third-party sales representatives.  We have sales or marketing offices in 35 countries worldwide and have expanded our sales networks in the emerging markets of China, India and Eastern Europe over the last few years.  Distributors located around the world account for about 40 percent of our revenue.  Our distributors maintain an inventory of our products and sell directly to a wide range of 7customers.  They also sell products from our competitors.  Our distribution network holds a mix of distributor-owned and TI-consigned inventory.  Over time, we expect this mix will shift more toward consignment.  We sell our calculator products primarily through retailers and instructional dealers. Acquisitions, Divestitures and Investments From time to time we consider acquisitions and divestitures that may strengthen or better focus our business portfolio.  We also make investments directly or indirectly in private companies.  Investments are focused primarily on next-generation technologies and markets strategic to us.  As discussed above, on September 23, 2011, we completed the acquisition of National Semiconductor for approximately $6.5 billion.  We funded the acquisition with a combination of available cash and the proceeds of debt issuances, including $3.5 billion of debt securities issued in the second quarter of 2011.Backlog We define backlog as of a particular date as firm purchase orders with a customer-requested delivery date within a specified length of time.  As customer requirements and industry conditions change, orders may be, under certain circumstances, subject to cancellation or modification of terms such as pricing, quantity or delivery date.  Customer order placement practices continually evolve based on customers’ individual business needs and capabilities, as well as industry supply and capacity considerations.  Accordingly, our backlog at any particular date may not be indicative of revenue for any future period.  Our backlog of orders was $1.39 billion at December 31, 2011, and $1.75 billion at December 31, 2010.Raw Materials We purchase materials, parts and supplies from a number of suppliers.  In some cases we purchase such items from sole source suppliers.  The materials, parts and supplies essential to our business are generally available at present, and we believe that such materials, parts and supplies will be available in the foreseeable future.  Intellectual Property We own many patents, and have many patent applications pending, in the United States and other countries in fields relating to our business.  We have developed a strong, broad-based patent portfolio and continually add patents to that portfolio.  We also have agreements with numerous companies involving license rights and anticipate that other license agreements may be negotiated in the future.  In general, our license agreements have multi-year terms and may be renewed after renegotiation.Our semiconductor patent portfolio is an ongoing contributor to our revenue.  We do not consider our business materially dependent upon any one patent or patent license, although taken as a whole, our rights and the products made and sold under patents and patent licenses are important to our business.  We often participate in industry initiatives to set technical standards.  Our competitors may also participate in the same initiatives.  Participation in these initiatives may require us to license our patents to other companies.  We own trademarks that are used in the conduct of our business.  These trademarks are valuable assets, the most important of which are “Texas Instruments” and our corporate monogram.  Other valuable trademarks include OMAPTM and DLP®.  Research and Development Our primary areas of R&D investment are Analog, Embedded Processing and Wireless products.  We conduct most of our R&D internally.  However, we also closely engage with a wide range of third parties, including software suppliers, universities and select external industry consortia, and we collaborate with our foundry suppliers on semiconductor manufacturing technology.  From time to time we may terminate R&D projects before completion or decide not to manufacture and sell a developed product.  We do not expect that all of our R&D projects will result in products that are ultimately released for sale, or that our projects will contribute significant revenue until at least a few years following completion.  Our R&D expense was $1.72 billion in 2011, compared with $1.57 billion in 2010 and $1.48 billion in 2009. 8Executive Officers of the RegistrantThe following is an alphabetical list of the names and ages of the executive officers of the company and the positions or offices with the company presently held by each person named: NameAgePositionStephen A.
