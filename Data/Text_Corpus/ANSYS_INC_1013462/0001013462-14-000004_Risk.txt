The Company's revenue included Esterel operations for the full year in 2013 of $18.8 million as compared to five months in 2012 of $3.3 million. The growth was partially influenced by benefits from the Company’s continued investment in its global sales and marketing organization. Annual maintenance contracts that were sold with new perpetual licenses, along with maintenance contracts sold with new perpetual licenses in previous years, contributed to maintenance revenue growth of 12.2%. Revenue from lease licenses increased 6.6% as compared to the prior year due to an increase in Apache-related lease license revenue and growth in sales of other lease licenses. Perpetual license revenue, which is derived entirely from new sales during the period, increased 3.9% as compared to the prior year, due to increased perpetual license sales across most product lines, as well as a full year of Esterel activity in 2013 as compared to five months in 2012. Service revenue increased 12.5% as compared to the prior year due to an increase in engineering consulting projects.With respect to revenue, on average for the year ended December 31, 2013, the U.S. Dollar was 4.0% stronger, when measured against the Company’s primary foreign currencies, than for the year ended December 31, 2012. The net overall strengthening, primarily related to the Japanese Yen, resulted in decreased revenue and operating income during 2013, as compared to 2012, of $17.6 million and $12.2 million, respectively.A substantial portion of the Company’s license and maintenance revenue is derived from annual lease and maintenance contracts. These contracts are generally renewed on an annual basis and typically have a high rate of customer renewal. In addition to the recurring revenue base associated with these contracts, a majority of customers purchasing new perpetual licenses also purchase related annual maintenance contracts. As a result of the significant recurring revenue base, the Company’s license and maintenance revenue growth rate in any period does not necessarily correlate to the growth rate of new license and maintenance contracts sold during that period. To the extent the rate of customer renewal for lease and maintenance contracts is high, incremental lease contracts, and maintenance contracts sold with new perpetual licenses, will result in license and maintenance revenue growth. Conversely, if the rate of renewal for these contracts is adversely affected by economic or other factors, the Company’s license and maintenance growth will be adversely affected over the term that the revenue for those contracts would have otherwise been recognized.International and domestic revenues, as a percentage of total revenue, were 66.1% and 33.9%, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2013, and 66.7% and 33.3%, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2012. The Company derived 25.3% and 26.0% of its total revenue through the indirect sales channel for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.In valuing deferred revenue on the Esterel and Apache balance sheets as of their respective acquisition dates, the Company applied the fair value provisions applicable to the accounting for business combinations, resulting in lower amounts of revenue than Esterel and Apache would have recognized absent the acquisitions. The impact on reported revenue for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $4.6 million. The expected impact on reported revenue is $0.4 million and $1.4 million for the quarter ending March 31, 2014 and the year ending December 31, 2014, respectively.26Table of ContentsCost of Sales and Gross Profit: Year Ended December 31,    2013 2012 Change(in thousands, except percentages)Amount % ofRevenue Amount % ofRevenue Amount %Cost of sales:           Software licenses$28,363 3.3 $24,512 3.1 $3,851 15.7Amortization38,298 4.4 40,889 5.1 (2,591) (6.3)Maintenance and service80,031 9.3 74,115 9.3 5,916 8.0Total cost of sales146,692 17.0 139,516 17.5 7,176 5.1Gross profit$714,568 83.0 $658,502 82.5 $56,066 8.5Software Licenses: The increase in software license costs was primarily due to the following:•Increased salaries and incentive compensation of $2.2 million.•Increased third-party royalties of $0.9 million.•Increased Esterel-related costs of $0.7 million, primarily as a result of a full year of Esterel activity in 2013 as compared to five months of activity in 2012.Amortization: The decrease in amortization expense was primarily due to a net decrease in amortization of acquired technology.Maintenance and Service: The increase in maintenance and service costs was primarily due to the following:•Increased salaries and headcount-related costs of $2.6 million.•Increased third-party technical support of $1.4 million.•Increased Esterel-related costs of $0.6 million, primarily as a result of a full year of Esterel activity in 2013 as compared to five months of activity in 2012.•Increased depreciation expense of $0.5 million.The improvement in gross profit was a result of the increase in revenue offset by a smaller increase in related cost of sales.27Table of ContentsOperating Expenses: Year Ended December 31,    2013 2012 Change(in thousands, except percentages)Amount % ofRevenue Amount % ofRevenue Amount %Operating expenses:           Selling, general and administrative$218,907 25.4 $205,178 25.7 $13,729 6.7Research and development151,439 17.6 132,628 16.6 18,811 14.2Amortization22,359 2.6 26,443 3.3 (4,084) (15.4)Total operating expenses$392,705 45.6 $364,249 45.6 $28,456 7.8Selling, General and Administrative: The increase in selling, general and administrative costs was primarily due to the following:•Increased salaries of $4.9 million.•Increased Esterel-related expenses of $4.5 million, primarily as a result of a full year of Esterel activity in 2013 as compared to five months of activity in 2012.•Increased stock-based compensation of $1.6 million.The Company anticipates that it will continue to make targeted investments in its global sales and marketing organization and its global business infrastructure to enhance major account sales activities and to support its worldwide sales distribution and marketing strategies, and the business in general.Research and Development: The increase in research and development costs was primarily due to the following:•Increased salaries, incentive compensation and other headcount related costs of $11.0 million.•Increased Esterel-related expenses of $3.1 million, primarily as a result of a full year of Esterel activity in 2013 as compared to five months of activity in 2012.•Increased facilities and IT-related maintenance costs of $1.7 million.•Increased stock-based compensation of $1.4 million.•EVEN-related research and development expenses of $1.4 million.The Company has traditionally invested significant resources in research and development activities and intends to continue to make investments in this area, particularly as it relates to expanding the capabilities of its flagship products and other products within its broad portfolio of simulation software, evolution of its ANSYS Workbench platform, expanding its HPC capabilities, robust design and ongoing integration.Amortization: The decrease in amortization expense was primarily due to a net decrease in amortization of acquired intangible assets, including contract backlog and customer lists.Interest Expense: The Company’s interest expense consists of the following: Year Ended December 31,(in thousands)2013 2012Discounted obligations$722 $546Term loan230 1,342Amortization of debt financing costs149 698Other68 75Total interest expense$1,169 $2,661Interest Income: Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $2.8 million as compared to $3.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2012. Interest income decreased as a result of a decrease in the average rate of return on invested cash balances.28Table of ContentsOther Expense, net: The Company recorded other expense of $1.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to $1.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2012. The activity for both years was primarily composed of net foreign currency transaction losses.Income Tax Provision: The Company recorded income tax expense of $77.2 million and had income before income taxes of $322.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, representing an effective tax rate of 23.9%. During the year ended December 31, 2012, the Company recorded income tax expense of $90.1 million and had income before income taxes of $293.5 million, representing an effective tax rate of 30.7%.In December 2013, the Company received notice from the IRS that the Joint Committee on Taxation took no exception to the Company's tax returns that were filed for 2009 and 2010. An $11.0 million tax benefit was recognized in the Company's 2013 financial results as the Company has effectively settled uncertainty regarding the realization of refund claims filed in connection with the 2009 and 2010 returns.In the U.S., which is the largest jurisdiction where the Company receives such a tax credit, the availability of the research and development credit expired at the end of the 2011 tax year. In January 2013, the U.S. Congress passed legislation that reinstated the research and development credit retroactive to 2012. The income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2013 includes approximately $2.3 million related to the reinstated research and development credit for 2012 activity. The 2014 research and development credit is currently not available unless legislation is passed by the U.S. Congress.The decrease in the effective tax rate from the prior year is primarily due to the release of an uncertain tax position mentioned above, the reinstatement of the U.S. research and development credit mentioned above, and cash repatriation activities.  When compared to the federal and state combined statutory rate, the effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 were favorably impacted by lower statutory tax rates in many of the Company’s foreign jurisdictions, the domestic manufacturing deduction and tax benefits associated with the merger of the Company’s Japan subsidiaries in 2010.Net Income: The Company’s net income for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $245.3 million as compared to net income of $203.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. Diluted earnings per share was $2.58 for the year ended December 31, 2013 and $2.14 for the year ended December 31, 2012. The weighted average shares used in computing diluted earnings per share were 95.1 million and 95.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.29Table of ContentsYear Ended December 31, 2012 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2011Revenue: Year Ended December 31, Change(in thousands, except percentages)2012 2011 Amount %Revenue:       Lease licenses$279,283 $218,005 $61,278 28.1Perpetual licenses222,587 207,876 14,711 7.1Software licenses501,870 425,881 75,989 17.8Maintenance275,498 246,546 28,952 11.7Service20,650 19,022 1,628 8.6Maintenance and service296,148 265,568 30,580 11.5Total revenue$798,018 $691,449 $106,569 15.4The Company’s revenue increased 15.4% in 2012 as compared to 2011, including increases in all major revenue categories.  The Company's revenue included Apache operations for the full year in 2012 of $62.0 million as compared to five months in 2011 of $14.5 million. The growth was partially influenced by benefits from the Company’s continued investment in its global sales and marketing organization. Revenue from lease licenses increased 28.1% as compared to the prior year due to an increase in Apache-related lease license revenue and growth in sales of other lease licenses. Annual maintenance contracts that were sold with new perpetual licenses, along with maintenance contracts sold with new perpetual licenses in previous years, contributed to maintenance revenue growth of 11.7%. Perpetual license revenue, which is derived entirely from new sales during the period, increased 7.1% as compared to the prior year.  Esterel-related revenue for the period from the acquisition date (August 1, 2012) through December 31, 2012 was $3.3 million. Service revenue increased 8.6% as compared to the prior year, primarily from increased revenue associated with engineering consulting services.With respect to revenue, on average for the year ended December 31, 2012, the U.S. Dollar was 3.7% stronger, when measured against the Company’s primary foreign currencies, than for the year ended December 31, 2011. The net overall strengthening of the U.S. Dollar resulted in decreased revenue and operating income during 2012, as compared to 2011, of $15.4 million and $7.4 million, respectively.International and domestic revenues, as a percentage of total revenue, were 66.7% and 33.3%, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2012, and 68.8% and 31.2%, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2011.

This legislation, enacted on November 30, 2011, resulted in an additional $4.8 million in deferred tax expense due to the reduction in the value of certain net deferred tax assets of the Company's Japanese subsidiaries.Non-GAAP MeasuresManagement uses non-GAAP financial measures (a) to evaluate the Company's historical and prospective financial performance as well as its performance relative to its competitors, (b) to set internal sales targets and spending budgets, (c) to allocate resources, (d) to measure operational profitability and the accuracy of forecasting, (e) to assess financial discipline over operational expenditures and (f) as an important factor in determining variable compensation for management and its employees. In addition, many financial analysts that follow the Company focus on and publish both historical results and future projections based on non-GAAP financial measures. The Company believes that it is in the best interest of its investors to provide this information to analysts so that they accurately report the non-GAAP financial information. Moreover, investors have historically requested and the Company has historically reported these non-GAAP financial measures as a means of providing consistent and comparable information with past reports of financial results.While management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors, there are limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, are not reported by all of the Company’s competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of the Company’s competitors due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation. The Company compensates for these limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures as supplements to GAAP financial measures and by reviewing the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measures.35Table of ContentsThe adjustments to these non-GAAP financial measures, and the basis for such adjustments, are outlined below:Acquisition accounting for deferred revenue and its related tax impact. Historically, the Company has consummated acquisitions in order to support its strategic and other business objectives. In accordance with the fair value provisions applicable to the accounting for business combinations, acquired deferred revenue is often recorded on the opening balance sheet at an amount that is lower than the historical carrying value. Although this purchase accounting requirement has no impact on the Company’s business or cash flow, it adversely impacts the Company’s reported GAAP revenue in the reporting periods following an acquisition. In order to provide investors with financial information that facilitates comparison of both historical and future results, the Company provides non-GAAP financial measures which exclude the impact of the acquisition accounting adjustment. The Company believes that this non-GAAP financial adjustment is useful to investors because it allows investors to (a) evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making, and (b) compare past and future reports of financial results of the Company as the revenue reduction related to acquired deferred revenue will not recur when related annual lease licenses and software maintenance contracts are renewed in future periods.Amortization of intangibles from acquisitions and its related tax impact. The Company incurs amortization of intangibles, included in its GAAP presentation of amortization expense, related to various acquisitions it has made in recent years. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are fixed at the time of an acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition. Accordingly, management does not consider these expenses for purposes of evaluating the performance of the Company during the applicable time period after the acquisition, and it excludes such expenses when making decisions to allocate resources. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to (a) evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making, and (b) compare past reports of financial results of the Company as the Company has historically reported these non-GAAP financial measures.Stock-based compensation expense and its re
