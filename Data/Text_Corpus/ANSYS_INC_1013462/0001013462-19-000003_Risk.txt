Investments in smart, connected products and 5G by companies around the globe bolstered the high-tech industry during the year. Increased defense spending in both the United States and Europe supported strong performance in aerospace and defense. The industrial equipment sector saw growth due to the continued focus on efficiency and reliability.AcquisitionsIn February 2019, the Company acquired 100% of the shares of Granta Design Limited (Granta Design) and Helic, Inc. (Helic) for a combined purchase price of approximately $261.5 million. The acquisition of Granta Design, the premier provider of materials information technology, expands the Company's portfolio into this important area, giving customers access to material intelligence, including data that is critical to successful simulations. The acquisition of Helic, the industry-leading provider of electromagnetic crosstalk solutions for systems on chips, combined with the Company's flagship electromagnetic and semiconductor solvers, will provide a comprehensive solution for on-chip, 3D integrated circuit and chip-package-system electromagnetics and noise analysis.During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of 100% of the shares of OPTIS, a premier provider of software for scientific simulation of light, human vision and physics-based visualization, for a purchase price of $291.0 million, paid in cash. The acquisition extended the Company's portfolio into the area of optical simulation to provide comprehensive sensor solutions, covering visible and infrared light, electromagnetics and acoustics for camera, radar and lidar. 28Table of ContentsDuring the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company completed various acquisitions to expand its customer base and accelerate the development of new and innovative products to the marketplace while lowering design and engineering costs for customers. The acquisitions were not individually significant. The combined purchase prices of the acquisitions purchased during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were approximately $67.0 million and $10.3 million, respectively.For further information on the Company's business combinations during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.29Table of ContentsResults of OperationsFor purposes of the following discussion and analysis, the table below sets forth certain consolidated financial data for the years 2018, 2017 and 2016.

The growth rate was favorably impacted by the Company’s continued investment in its global sales, support and marketing organizations; continued progress with market segmentation and go-to-market adjustments; and the May 2018 acquisition of OPTIS. Lease license revenue increased 11.8%, or 10.7% in constant currency, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. Perpetual license revenue, which is derived primarily from new sales during the year, increased 3.0%, or 2.0% in constant currency, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. Annual maintenance contracts that were sold with new perpetual licenses, along with maintenance contracts for perpetual licenses sold in previous quarters, contributed to maintenance revenue growth of 13.4%, or 11.6% in constant currency. Service revenue, driven primarily by a focus on service offerings that provide on-site mentorship on simulation best practices, training and expanding simulation adoption, increased 34.3%, or 33.4% in constant currency, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.31Table of ContentsWith respect to revenue, on average for the year ended December 31, 2018, the U.S. Dollar was approximately 2.3% weaker and 2.6% weaker, when measured against the Company’s primary foreign currencies, than for the year ended December 31, 2017 under ASC 606 and ASC 605, respectively. The table below presents the impacts of currency fluctuations on revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. Amounts in brackets indicate a net adverse impact from currency fluctuations. Year Ended December 31, 2018(in thousands)ASC 606 ASC 605Euro$12,498 $11,915Japanese Yen2,088 2,075South Korean Won918 1,182British Pound870 1,083Indian Rupee(1,623) (1,372)Other(129) (36)Total$14,622 $14,847The net overall weaker U.S. Dollar also resulted in increased operating income of $9.6 million and $10.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 under ASC 606 and ASC 605, respectively.A substantial portion of the Company's lease license and maintenance revenue is derived from annual lease and maintenance contracts. These contracts are generally renewed on an annual basis and have a high rate of customer renewal. In addition to the recurring revenue base associated with these contracts, a majority of customers purchasing new perpetual licenses also purchase related annual maintenance contracts. As a result of the significant recurring revenue base, the Company's lease license and maintenance revenue growth rate in any period does not necessarily correlate to the growth rate of new licenses sold during that period under ASC 605. The same is true for maintenance revenue growth under ASC 606. However, under ASC 606, lease license revenue is entirely attributed to license sales completed during the period, resulting in a higher correlation of lease license revenue growth to the growth rate of new lease license sales than that under ASC 605. To the extent the rate of customer renewal for lease and maintenance contracts is high, incremental lease contracts, and maintenance contracts sold with new perpetual licenses, will result in lease license and maintenance growth in constant currency. Conversely, if the rate of renewal for these contracts is adversely affected by economic or other factors, the Company's lease license and maintenance growth will be adversely affected.The Company has been experiencing an increased interest by some of its larger customers in enterprise agreements that often include longer-term, time-based licenses involving a larger number of the Company's software products. While these arrangements typically involve a higher overall transaction price, the revenue from these contracts is typically deferred and recognized over the period of the contract under ASC 605, resulting in increased deferred revenue and backlog. To the extent these types of contracts replace sales of perpetual licenses, there could be a near-term adverse impact on software license and maintenance revenue growth. Under ASC 606, the upfront recognition of license revenue related to these larger, multi-year transactions can result in significantly higher lease license revenue volatility. As software products, across a large variety of applications and industries, become increasingly distributed in software-as-a-service, cloud and other subscription environments in which the licensing approach is time-based rather than perpetual, the Company is also experiencing a shifting preference from perpetual licenses to time-based licenses across a broader spectrum of its customers, particularly in the more mature geographic markets, such as the U.S. and Japan.As a percentage of revenue, the Company's international and domestic revenues, and the Company's direct and indirect revenues, are as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2018(ASC 606) 2018(ASC 605) 2017(ASC 605)International60.9% 60.5% 61.9%Domestic39.1% 39.5% 38.1%      Direct revenue77.6% 76.5% 75.2%Indirect revenue22.4% 23.5% 24.8%In valuing deferred revenue on the balance sheets of the Company's recent acquisitions as of their respective acquisition dates, the Company applied the fair value provisions applicable to the accounting for business combinations, resulting in a reduction 32Table of Contentsof deferred revenue as compared to its historical carrying amount. As a result, the Company's post-acquisition revenue will be less than the sum of what would have otherwise been reported by ANSYS and each acquiree absent the acquisitions. Under ASC 606, the impacts on reported revenue were $9.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The expected impacts on reported revenue, including an estimate for the Granta and Helic acquisitions, are $2.2 million and $6.5 million for the quarter ending March 31, 2019 and the year ending December 31, 2019, respectively. The Company has not yet performed a valuation of the Granta and Helic acquired deferred revenue. Until such valuation is completed, the expected impacts on revenue will remain preliminary estimates that are likely to change. Under ASC 605, the impacts on reported revenue were $15.6 million and $2.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.Cost of Sales and Operating Expenses:The tables below reflect the Company's operating results as presented on the consolidated statements of income, which are inclusive of foreign currency translation impacts. The adoption of ASC 606 resulted in a reclassification of expenses within cost of sales from software licenses to maintenance and service. Amounts included in the discussion that follows are provided in constant currency and do not include the impact of the OPTIS acquisition. The impact of the OPTIS acquisition on each expense line is provided separately, where material. The impact, where material, of foreign exchange translation on each expense line is also provided separately and is inclusive of the OPTIS acquisition.

Tax Reform makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code, including, but not limited to, (1) reducing the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent; (2) requiring companies to pay a one-time federal income tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries (transition tax); (3) generally eliminating U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries; (4) creating a new provision designed to tax global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) which allows for the possibility of using foreign tax credits (FTCs) and a deduction of up to 50 percent to offset the income tax liability (subject to some limitations); (5) repealing the domestic production activity deduction; (6) creating the foreign-derived intangible income deduction; (7) creating the base erosion anti-abuse tax, a new minimum tax; (8) allowing for full expensing of qualified property through bonus depreciation; and (9) creating limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation.The SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 118, which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of Tax Reform. SAB 118 provided a measurement period that was limited to one year from enactment for companies to complete the accounting under ASC 740, Income Taxes. In accordance with SAB 118, throughout the measurement period, a company must reflect the income tax effects of those aspects of Tax Reform for which the accounting under ASC 740 was complete in the financial statements. To the extent that a company’s accounting for certain income tax effects of Tax Reform was incomplete, but a reasonable estimate was able to be made, the company must record a provisional estimate in the financial statements. If a company could not determine a provisional estimate to be included in the financial statements, it should continue to apply ASC 740 on the basis of the tax laws that were in effect immediately before the enactment of Tax Reform.As further discussed below, the Company finalized its provisional Tax Reform calculations as of the end of the measurement period, based on guidance and information available as of the reporting date. The U.S. government has not yet issued final guidance related to the new rules enacted as part of Tax Reform. Subsequent adjustments, if any, will be recorded in the period in which guidance is finalized.The Company’s accounting for the impact of the reduction in the U.S. federal corporate tax rate on the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities is complete. Tax Reform reduced the corporate tax rate to 21 percent, effective January 1, 2018. Consequently, the Company recorded a net adjustment to deferred income tax expense of $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to revalue the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities. No further adjustments were recorded for the year ended December 31, 2018.The Company’s accounting for the transition tax is complete. Reasonable estimates of certain effects were calculated and a provisional adjustment of $16.0 million was recorded in the December 31, 2017 financial statements. To determine the amount of the transition tax, the Company determined, in addition to other factors, the amount of post-1986 earnings and profits (E&P) of the relevant subsidiaries, as well as the amount of non-U.S. income taxes paid on such earnings. Based on revised E&P calculations updated during the measurement period, the Company recognized an additional measurement-period adjustment of $0.9 million to the transition tax obligation and a corresponding adjustment to tax expense, resulting in a total transition tax obligation of $16.9 million. The Company has elected to pay this liability over eight years; however, in accordance with IRS issued guidance, tax overpayments from the year ended December 31, 2017 are required to be applied to the transition tax obligation. Based on this guidance, $15.6 million of the obligation has been paid, with the remaining $1.3 million recorded in other long-term liabilities at December 31, 2018. The Company’s accounting for the indefinite reinvestment assertion is complete. In general, it is the practice and intention of the Company to repatriate previously taxed earnings in excess of working capital needs and to reinvest all other earnings of its non-U.S. subsidiaries. As part of Tax Reform, the Company incurred U.S. tax on substantially all of the earnings of its non-U.S. subsidiaries as part of the transition tax. This tax increased the Company’s previously taxed earnings and allows for the repatriation of the majority of its foreign earnings without any residual U.S. federal tax. The Company does not believe that there is an excess of the financial reporting basis over the tax basis of investments in foreign subsidiaries. Accordingly, any repatriation in excess of previously taxed earnings will be a non-taxable return of basis. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company repatriated $144.3 million of foreign cash. The Company has not made any measurement-period adjustments related to its indefinite reinvestment assertion during the year ended December 31, 2018.35Table of ContentsThe Company’s accounting policy choice for GILTI is complete. Under U.S. GAAP, the Company is allowed to make an accounting policy choice of either (1) treating taxes due on future U.S. inclusions in taxable income related to GILTI as a current-period expense when incurred (the period cost method) or (2) factoring such amounts into the Company’s measurement of its deferred taxes (the deferred method). The Company selected the period cost method and recorded GILTI tax expense of $0.4 million in the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018.The decrease in the effective tax rate from the prior year is primarily due to the reduction in the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent enacted as part of Tax Reform, the additional $15.1 million of transition tax in 2017 when compared to 2018, and a net $6.7 million benefit related to global legal entity restructuring activities. The effective tax rate was also reduced by the foreign-derived intangible income deduction, increased research and development credits and increased stock-based compensation benefits, partially offset by the loss of the domestic manufacturing deduction, which was repealed as part of Tax Reform. When compared to the federal and state combined statutory rate, the effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were favorably impacted by tax benefits from stock-based compensation and research and development credits.

The growth rate was favorably impacted by the Company's continued investment in its global sales, support and marketing organizations. Lease license revenue increased 10.7%, or 10.8% in constant currency, as compared to the prior year. Perpetual license revenue, which is derived primarily from new sales, increased 8.9%, or 7.6% in constant currency, as compared to the prior year. Annual maintenance contracts that were sold with new perpetual licenses, along with maintenance contracts sold with new perpetual licenses in previous years, contributed to maintenance revenue growth of 11.6%, or 11.0% in constant currency.
