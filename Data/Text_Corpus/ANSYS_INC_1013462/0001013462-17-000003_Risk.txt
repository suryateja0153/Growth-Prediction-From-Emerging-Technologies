Risk Factors.AcquisitionsDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company completed various acquisitions to accelerate the development of new and innovative products to the marketplace while lowering design and engineering costs for customers. The acquisitions were not individually significant. The combined purchase prices of the acquisitions were approximately $10.3 million and $49.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.During the year ended December 31, 2014, the combined purchase price for acquisitions was $104.0 million. The acquisitions during 2014 are further described in the table below:Date of Closing Company DetailsApril 30, 2014 SpaceClaim Corporation SpaceClaim, a leading provider of 3-D modeling technology, was acquired for $85.0 million.

The growth rate was favorably impacted by the Company's continued investment in its global sales, support and marketing organizations and was adversely impacted by a recent shift in the licensing preference of certain customers from perpetual licenses to lease licenses. Lease license revenue increased 7.6% as compared to the prior year. Perpetual license revenue, which is derived primarily from new sales, decreased 4.6% as compared to the prior year. Annual maintenance contracts that were sold with new perpetual licenses, along with maintenance contracts sold with new perpetual licenses in previous years, contributed to maintenance revenue growth of 8.3%.With respect to revenue, on average for the year ended December 31, 2016, the U.S. Dollar was 0.5% stronger, when measured against the Company's primary foreign currencies, than for the year ended December 31, 2015. The net overall strengthening resulted in decreased revenue of $2.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The impact on revenue was primarily driven by $5.6 million, $3.9 million, $1.7 million and $0.9 million of adverse impact due to a weaker Euro, British Pound, South Korean Won and Indian Rupee, respectively, partially offset by $10.4 million of favorable impact due to a stronger Japanese Yen. The fluctuations in the U.S. Dollar resulted in increased operating income of $0.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.A substantial portion of the Company's license and maintenance revenue is derived from annual lease and maintenance contracts. These contracts are generally renewed on an annual basis and typically have a high rate of customer renewal. In addition to the recurring revenue base associated with these contracts, a majority of customers purchasing new perpetual licenses also purchase related annual maintenance contracts. As a result of the significant recurring revenue base, the Company's license and maintenance revenue growth rate in any period does not necessarily correlate to the growth rate of new license and maintenance contracts sold during that period. To the extent the rate of customer renewal for lease and maintenance contracts is high, incremental lease contracts, and maintenance contracts sold with new perpetual licenses, will result in license and maintenance revenue growth in constant currency. Conversely, if the rate of renewal for these contracts is adversely affected by economic or other factors, the Company's license and maintenance growth will be adversely affected over the term that the revenue for those contracts would have otherwise been recognized.The Company is starting to experience an increased interest by some of its larger customers in enterprise agreements that often include longer-term, time-based licenses involving a larger number of the Company's software products. While these arrangements typically involve a higher overall transaction price, the revenue from these contracts is typically deferred and recognized over the period of the contract, resulting in increased deferred revenue and backlog. To the extent these types of contracts replace sales of perpetual licenses, there could be a near-term adverse impact on software license and maintenance revenue growth. The Company is similarly experiencing a shifting preference from perpetual licenses to time-based licenses across a broader spectrum of its customers, particularly in the more mature geographic markets, such as the U.S. and Japan. To the extent this shift continues or becomes more prevalent, the result could be a similar and incremental near-term adverse impact on software license and maintenance revenue growth.International and domestic revenues, as a percentage of total revenue, were 62.8% and 37.2%, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2016, and 62.4% and 37.6%, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2015. The Company derived 24.4% and 24.2% of its total revenue through the indirect sales channel for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.29Table of ContentsIn valuing deferred revenue on the balance sheets of the Company's recent acquisitions as of their respective acquisition dates, the Company applied the fair value provisions applicable to the accounting for business combinations, resulting in a reduction of deferred revenue as compared to its historical carrying amount. As a result, the Company's post-acquisition revenue will be less than the sum of what would have otherwise been reported by ANSYS and each acquiree absent the acquisitions. The impacts on reported revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $0.1 million and $1.7 million, respectively.Cost of Sales and Gross Profit:The table below reflects the Company's operating results as presented on the consolidated statements of income, which are inclusive of foreign currency translation impacts.

More specifically, this includes the evolution of its ANSYS Workbench platform, expansion of high-performance computing capabilities, ANSYS AIM immersive user interface, offerings on ANSYS Enterprise Cloud, robust design and ongoing integration of acquired technology.Amortization: The decrease in amortization expense was primarily due to a decrease in the amortization of acquired customer lists that became fully amortized.Interest Income: Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $4.2 million as compared to $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Interest income increased as a result of an increase in both the Company's average invested cash balances and the average rate of return on those balances.31Table of ContentsOther Income, net: The Company's other income consists of the following: Year Ended December 31,(in thousands)2016 2015Foreign currency gains, net$77 $486Other8 96Total other income, net$85 $582Income Tax Provision: The Company recorded income tax expense of $114.7 million and had income before income taxes of $380.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, representing an effective tax rate of 30.2%. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recorded income tax expense of $104.2 million and had income before income taxes of $356.8 million, representing an effective tax rate of 29.2%.The increase in the effective tax rate from the prior year is primarily due to tax benefits related to the merger of the Company's Japan subsidiaries in 2010 recognized in 2015 that did not recur in 2016, partially offset by tax benefits from restructuring activities in 2016. When compared to the federal and state combined statutory rate, the effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were favorably impacted by the domestic manufacturing deduction and research and development credits. The quarterly benefit of approximately $3.1 million associated with the merger of the Company's Japan subsidiaries was fully amortized in the third quarter of 2015. There will be no additional ongoing benefit from this transaction. The rates were also favorably impacted by the recurring item of lower statutory tax rates in many of the Company's foreign jurisdictions.Net Income: The Company's net income for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $265.6 million as compared to net income of $252.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Diluted earnings per share was $2.99 for the year ended December 31, 2016 and $2.76 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The weighted average shares used in computing diluted earnings per share were 89.0 million and 91.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.32Table of ContentsYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014Revenue: Year Ended December 31, Change(in thousands, except percentages)2015 2014 Amount %Revenue:       Lease licenses$316,367 $318,041 $(1,674) (0.5)Perpetual licenses238,738 246,461 (7,723) (3.1)Software licenses555,105 564,502 (9,397) (1.7)Maintenance364,591 346,698 17,893 5.2Service23,057 24,821 (1,764) (7.1)Maintenance and service387,648 371,519 16,129 4.3Total revenue$942,753 $936,021 $6,732 0.7The Company's revenue increased 0.7% during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, while revenue grew 7.8% in constant currency. The growth rate was favorably impacted by the Company's continued investment in its global sales, support and marketing organizations. Annual maintenance contracts that were sold with new perpetual licenses, along with maintenance contracts sold with new perpetual licenses in previous years, contributed to maintenance revenue growth of 5.2%. This growth was primarily due to maintenance contracts sold with electronics products. Perpetual license revenue, which is derived primarily from new sales, decreased 3.1% as compared to the prior year. While lease licenses, perpetual licenses and service revenue declined as compared to the prior year, all were higher in constant currency.With respect to revenue, on average for the year ended December 31, 2015, the U.S. Dollar was 12.5% stronger, when measured against the Company's primary foreign currencies, than for the year ended December 31, 2014. The net overall strengthening resulted in decreased revenue of $65.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The impact on revenue was primarily driven by $42.7 million, $14.6 million, $2.9 million and $2.9 million of adverse impact due to a weaker Euro, Japanese Yen, South Korean Won and British Pound, respectively. The net overall stronger U.S. Dollar also resulted in decreased operating income of $38.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.International and domestic revenues, as a percentage of total revenue, were 62.4% and 37.6%, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2015, and 65.8% and 34.2%, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2014.

In addition, many financial analysts that follow the Company focus on and publish both historical results and future projections based on non-GAAP financial measures. The Company believes that it is in the best interest of its investors to provide this information to analysts so that they accurately report the non-GAAP financial information. Moreover, investors have historically requested and the Company has historically reported these non-GAAP financial measures as a means of providing consistent and comparable information with past reports of financial results.While management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors, there are limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, are not reported by all of the Company's competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of the Company's competitors due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation. The Company compensates for these limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures as supplements to GAAP financial measures and by reviewing the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measures.38Table of ContentsThe adjustments to these non-GAAP financial measures, and the basis for such adjustments, are outlined below:Acquisition accounting for deferred revenue and its related tax impact. Historically, the Company has consummated acquisitions in order to support its strategic and other business objectives. In accordance with the fair value provisions applicable to the accounting for business combinations, acquired deferred revenue is often recorded on the opening balance sheet at an amount that is lower than the historical carrying value. Although this acquisition accounting requirement has no impact on the Company's business or cash flow, it adversely impacts the Company's reported GAAP revenue in the reporting periods following an acquisition. In order to provide investors with financial information that facilitates comparison of both historical and future results, the Company provides non-GAAP financial measures which exclude the impact of the acquisition accounting adjustment. The Company believes that this non-GAAP financial adjustment is useful to investors because it allows investors to (a) evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making, and (b) compare past and future reports of financial results of the Company as the revenue reduction related to acquired deferred revenue will not recur when related annual lease licenses and software maintenance contracts are renewed in future periods.Amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions and its related tax impact. The Company incurs amortization of intangible assets, included in its GAAP presentation of amortization expense, related to various acquisitions it has made. Management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the Company because these costs are fixed at the time of an acquisitio
