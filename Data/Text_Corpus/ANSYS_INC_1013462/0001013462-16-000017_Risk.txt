The growth rate was adversely impacted by 7.0% due to a strengthening U.S. Dollar and would have been 7.8% at currency exchange rates that were in effect for 2014. The growth rate was favorably impacted by the Company's continued investment in its global sales, support and marketing organizations. Annual maintenance contracts that were sold with new perpetual licenses, along with maintenance contracts sold with new perpetual licenses in previous years, contributed to maintenance revenue growth of 5.2%. This growth was primarily due to maintenance contracts sold with electronics products. Perpetual license revenue, which is derived primarily from new sales, decreased 3.1% as compared to the prior year. While lease licenses, perpetual licenses and service revenue declined as compared to the prior year, all were higher in constant currency.With respect to revenue, on average for the year ended December 31, 2015, the U.S. Dollar was 12.5% stronger, when measured against the Company's primary foreign currencies, than for the year ended December 31, 2014. The net overall strengthening resulted in decreased revenue of $65.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The impact on revenue was primarily driven by $42.7 million, $14.6 million, $2.9 million and $2.9 million of adverse impact due to a weakening Euro, Japanese Yen, South Korean Won and British Pound, respectively. The net overall strengthening of the U.S. Dollar also resulted in decreased operating income of $38.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.A substantial portion of the Company's license and maintenance revenue is derived from annual lease and maintenance contracts. These contracts are generally renewed on an annual basis and typically have a high rate of customer renewal. In addition to the recurring revenue base associated with these contracts, a majority of customers purchasing new perpetual licenses also purchase related annual maintenance contracts. As a result of the significant recurring revenue base, the Company's license and maintenance revenue growth rate in any period does not necessarily correlate to the growth rate of new license and maintenance contracts sold during that period. To the extent the rate of customer renewal for lease and maintenance contracts is high, incremental lease contracts, and maintenance contracts sold with new perpetual licenses, will result in license and maintenance revenue growth in constant currency. Conversely, if the rate of renewal for these contracts is adversely affected by economic or other factors, the Company's license and maintenance growth will be adversely affected over the term that the revenue for those contracts would have otherwise been recognized.The Company is starting to experience an increased interest by its customers in enterprise license agreements that often include longer-term, time-based licenses involving a larger number of the Company's software products. While these arrangements typically involve a higher overall transaction price, the revenue from these contracts is typically deferred and recognized over the period of the contract, resulting in increased deferred revenue and backlog. To the extent these types of contracts replace sales of perpetual licenses, there could be a near-term adverse impact on software license and maintenance revenue growth.International and domestic revenues, as a percentage of total revenue, were 62.4% and 37.6%, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2015, and 65.8% and 34.2%, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2014. The Company derived 24.2% and 24.9% of its total revenue through the indirect sales channel for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.In valuing deferred revenue on the balance sheets of the Company's recent acquisitions as of their respective acquisition dates, the Company applied the fair value provisions applicable to the accounting for business combinations, resulting in a reduction of deferred revenue as compared to its historical carrying amount. As a result, the Company's post-acquisition revenue will be 28Table of Contentsless than the sum of what would have otherwise been reported by ANSYS and each acquiree absent the acquisitions. The impact on reported revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $1.7 million.Cost of Sales and Gross Profit:The table below reflects the Company's operating results as presented on the consolidated statements of income, which are inclusive of foreign currency translation impacts.

More specifically, this includes the evolution of its ANSYS Workbench platform, expansion of high-performance computing capabilities, ANSYS AIM immersive user interface, offerings on ANSYS Enterprise Cloud, robust design and ongoing integration of acquired technology.Amortization: The decrease in amortization expense was primarily due to a net decrease in the amortization of acquired customer lists and a cost reduction related to foreign exchange translation.30Table of ContentsOther Income (Expense), net: The Company's other income (expense) consists of the following: Year Ended December 31,(in thousands)2015 2014Foreign currency gains (losses), net$486 $(1,649)Other96 115Total other income (expense), net$582 $(1,534)Income Tax Provision: The Company recorded income tax expense of $104.2 million and had income before income taxes of $356.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, representing an effective tax rate of 29.2%. During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company recorded income tax expense of $93.4 million and had income before income taxes of $348.1 million, representing an effective tax rate of 26.8%.The increase in the effective tax rate from the prior year is primarily due to a decrease in benefits related to legal entity restructuring activities. When compared to the federal and state combined statutory rate, the effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were favorably impacted by the domestic manufacturing deduction, research and development credits and tax benefits associated with the merger of the Company's Japan subsidiaries in 2010. The quarterly benefit of approximately $3.1 million associated with the merger of the Company's Japan subsidiaries was fully amortized in the third quarter of 2015. There will be no additional ongoing benefit from this transaction. The rates were also favorably impacted by the recurring item of lower statutory tax rates in many of the Company's foreign jurisdictions.Net Income: The Company's net income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $252.5 million as compared to net income of $254.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Diluted earnings per share was $2.76 for the year ended December 31, 2015 and $2.70 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The weighted average shares used in computing diluted earnings per share were 91.5 million and 94.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.31Table of ContentsYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013Revenue: Year Ended December 31, Change(in thousands, except percentages)2014 2013 Amount %Revenue:       Lease licenses$318,041 $297,658 $20,383 6.8Perpetual licenses246,461 231,286 15,175 6.6Software licenses564,502 528,944 35,558 6.7Maintenance346,698 309,085 37,613 12.2Service24,821 23,231 1,590 6.8Maintenance and service371,519 332,316 39,203 11.8Total revenue$936,021 $861,260 $74,761 8.7The Company's revenue increased 8.7% during the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, including increases in all major revenue categories. The growth rate was adversely impacted by 0.9% due to a strengthening U.S. Dollar and would have been 9.6% at currency exchange rates that were in effect for 2013. The growth rate was favorably impacted by the Company's continued investment in its global sales and marketing organizations. Revenue from lease licenses increased 6.8% as compared to the prior year due primarily to growth in lease license revenue of power analysis and electronics products. Perpetual license revenue, which is derived primarily from new sales, increased 6.6% as compared to the prior year. Annual maintenance contracts that were sold with new perpetual licenses, along with maintenance contracts sold with new perpetual licenses in previous years, contributed to maintenance revenue growth of 12.2%.With respect to revenue, on average for the year ended December 31, 2014, the U.S. Dollar was 1.6% stronger, when measured against the Company's primary foreign currencies, than for the year ended December 31, 2013. The net overall strengthening resulted in decreased revenue of $7.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. The impact on revenue was primarily driven by $9.8 million of adverse impact due to a weakening Japanese Yen, partially offset by $1.9 million of favorable impact due to a strengthening British Pound. The net overall strengthening of the U.S. Dollar also resulted in decreased operating income of $5.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.International and domestic revenues, as a percentage of total revenue, were 65.8% and 34.2%, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2014, and 66.1% and 33.9%, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2013.

During the year ended December 31, 2013, the Company recorded income tax expense of $77.2 million and had income before income taxes of $322.5 million, representing an effective tax rate of 23.9%.In December 2013, the Company received notice from the IRS that the Joint Committee on Taxation took no exception to the Company's tax returns that were filed for 2009 and 2010. An $11.0 million tax benefit was recognized in the Company's 2013 financial results as the Company had effectively settled uncertainty regarding the realization of refund claims filed in connection with the 2009 and 2010 returns.In the U.S., which is the largest jurisdiction where the Company receives such a tax credit, the availability of the research and development credit expired at the end of the 2011 tax year. In January 2013, the U.S. Congress passed legislation that reinstated the research and development credit retroactive to 2012. The income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2013 includes approximately $2.3 million related to the reinstated research and development credit for 2012 activity. The research and development credit also expired at the end of the 2013 tax year, but the U.S. Congress reinstated the credit in December 2014 for the 2014 tax year.The increase in the effective tax rate from the prior year is primarily due to the release of an uncertain tax position and the reinstatement of the U.S. research and development credit mentioned above impacting the prior year rate.Net Income: The Company's net income for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $254.7 million as compared to net income of $245.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Diluted earnings per share was $2.70 for the year ended December 31, 2014 and $2.58 for the year ended December 31, 2013. The weighted average shares used in computing diluted earnings per share were 94.2 million and 95.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.35Table of ContentsNon-GAAP ResultsThe Company provides non-GAAP revenue, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share as supplemental measures to GAAP regarding the Company's operational performance.

In addition, many financial analysts that follow the Company focus on and publish both historical results and future projections based on non-GAAP financial measures. The Company believes that it is in the best interest of its investors to provide this information to analysts so that they accurately report the non-GAAP financial information. Moreover, investors have historically requested and the Company has historically reported these non-GAAP financial measures as a means of providing consistent and comparable information with past reports of financial results.While management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors, there are limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, are not reported by all of the Company's competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of the Company's competitors due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation. The Company compensates for these limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures as supplements to GAAP financial measures and by reviewing the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measures.37Table of ContentsThe adjustments to these non-GAAP financial measures, and the basis for such adjustments, are outlined below:Acquisition accounting for deferred revenue and its related tax impact. Historically, the Company has consummated acquisitions in order to support its strategic and other business objectives. In accordance with the fair value provisions applicable to the accounting for business combinations, acquired deferred revenue is often recorded on the opening balance sheet at an amount that is lower than the historical carrying value. Although this acquisition accounting requirement has no impact on the Company's business or cash flow, it adversely impacts the Company's reported GAAP revenue in the reporting periods following an acquisition. In order to provide investors with financial information that facilitates comparison of both historical and future results, the Company provides non-GAAP financial measures which exclude the impact of the acquisit
