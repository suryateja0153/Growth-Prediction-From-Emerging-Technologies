Risk Factors.AcquisitionsDuring the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 the Company completed various acquisitions to expand its customer base and accelerate the development of new and innovative products to the marketplace while lowering design and engineering costs for customers. The acquisitions were not individually significant. The combined purchase prices of the acquisitions purchased during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were approximately $67.0 million, $10.3 million and $49.7 million, respectively.For further information on the Company's business combinations, see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.27Table of ContentsResults of OperationsFor purposes of the following discussion and analysis, the table below sets forth certain consolidated financial data for the years 2017, 2016 and 2015. The operating results of the Company's acquisitions have been included in the results of operations since their respective acquisition dates.

The growth rate was favorably impacted by the Company's continued investment in its global sales, support and marketing organizations. Lease license revenue increased 10.7% as compared to the prior year. Perpetual license revenue, which is derived primarily from new sales, increased 8.9% as compared to the prior year. Annual maintenance contracts that were sold with new perpetual licenses, along with maintenance contracts sold with new perpetual licenses in previous years, contributed to maintenance revenue growth of 11.6%. Service revenue, primarily composed of consulting projects, increased 16.9%.With respect to revenue, on average for the year ended December 31, 2017, the U.S. Dollar was 1.0% weaker, when measured against the Company's primary foreign currencies, than for the year ended December 31, 2016. The table below presents the impacts of currency fluctuations on revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017. Amounts in brackets indicate a net adverse impact from currency fluctuations.(in thousands)Year Ended December 31, 2017Euro$6,634South Korean Won1,439Taiwan Dollar886Indian Rupee838Japanese Yen(3,416)British Pound(1,316)Other329Total$5,394The weaker U.S. Dollar also resulted in increased operating income of $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.A substantial portion of the Company's license and maintenance revenue is derived from annual lease and maintenance contracts. These contracts are generally renewed on an annual basis and typically have a high rate of customer renewal. In addition to the recurring revenue base associated with these contracts, a majority of customers purchasing new perpetual licenses also purchase related annual maintenance contracts. As a result of the significant recurring revenue base, the Company's license and maintenance revenue growth rate in any period does not necessarily correlate to the growth rate of new license and maintenance contracts sold during that period. To the extent the rate of customer renewal for lease and maintenance contracts is high, incremental lease contracts, and maintenance contracts sold with new perpetual licenses, will result in license and maintenance revenue growth in constant currency. Conversely, if the rate of renewal for these contracts is adversely affected by economic or other factors, the Company's license and maintenance growth will be adversely affected over the term that the revenue for those contracts would have otherwise been recognized.The Company is starting to experience an increased interest by some of its larger customers in enterprise agreements that often include longer-term, time-based licenses involving a larger number of the Company's software products. While these arrangements typically involve a higher overall transaction price, the revenue from these contracts has been typically deferred 29Table of Contentsunder ASC 605 and recognized over the period of the contract, resulting in increased deferred revenue and backlog. Under ASC 606, which is effective on January 1, 2018, the license component of these arrangements will be recognized up-front, resulting in increased volatility in the Company's reporting of quarterly and annual revenue. The Company is similarly experiencing a shifting preference from perpetual licenses to time-based licenses across a broader spectrum of its customers, particularly in the more mature geographic markets, such as the U.S. and Japan. To the extent this shift continues or becomes more prevalent, the result could be a near-term adverse impact on software license and maintenance revenue growth.International and domestic revenues, as a percentage of total revenue, were 61.9% and 38.1%, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2017, and 62.8% and 37.2%, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2016. The Company derived 24.8% and 24.4% of its total revenue through the indirect sales channel for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.In valuing deferred revenue on the balance sheets of the Company's recent acquisitions as of their respective acquisition dates, the Company applied the fair value provisions applicable to the accounting for business combinations, resulting in a reduction of deferred revenue as compared to its historical carrying amount. As a result, the Company's post-acquisition revenue will be less than the sum of what would have otherwise been reported by ANSYS and each acquiree absent the acquisitions. The impacts on reported revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were $2.9 million and $0.1 million, respectively.Cost of Sales and Gross Profit:The table below reflects the Company's operating results as presented on the consolidated statements of income, which are inclusive of foreign currency translation impacts.

Interest income increased as a result of an increase in both the Company's average invested cash balances and the average rate of return on those balances.Other Expense, net: The Company's other expense consists of the following: Year Ended December 31,(in thousands)2017 2016Foreign currency (losses) gains, net$(1,935) $77Other(61) (213)Total other expense, net$(1,996) $(136)Income Tax Provision: The Company recorded income tax expense of $136.4 million and had income before income taxes of $395.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, representing an effective tax rate of 34.5%. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded income tax expense of $114.7 million and had income before income taxes of $380.3 million, representing an effective tax rate of 30.2%.31Table of ContentsOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Reform). Tax Reform makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code, including, but not limited to, (1) reducing the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent; (2) requiring companies to pay a one-time transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries (Transition Tax); (3) generally eliminating U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries; (4) creating a new provision designed to tax global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) which allows for the possibility of using foreign tax credits (FTCs) and a deduction of up to 50 percent to offset the income tax liability (subject to some limitations); (5) repealing the domestic production activity deduction; (6) creating the base erosion anti-abuse tax, a new minimum tax; (7) allowing for full expensing of qualified property through bonus depreciation; and (8) creating limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation.The SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 118, which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of Tax Reform. SAB 118 provides a measurement period that should not extend beyond one year from enactment for companies to complete the accounting under ASC 740, Income Taxes. In accordance with SAB 118, a company must reflect the income tax effects of those aspects of Tax Reform for which the accounting under ASC 740 is complete in the financial statements. To the extent that a company’s accounting for certain income tax effects of Tax Reform is incomplete, but a reasonable estimate is able to be made, the company must record a provisional estimate in the financial statements. If a company cannot determine a provisional estimate to be included in the financial statements, it should continue to apply ASC 740 on the basis of the tax laws that were in effect immediately before the enactment of Tax Reform.In connection with the Company’s initial analysis of the impact of Tax Reform, a discrete net tax expense of $17.9 million was recorded in the period ending December 31, 2017, primarily consisting of $1.9 million for the revaluation of net deferred tax assets and $16.0 million for the Transition Tax. In addition to the $17.9 million charge, the Company would have recognized a $4.8 million benefit in the fourth quarter related to foreign earnings repatriation, but this benefit was eliminated due to Tax Reform. As further discussed below, the Company was able to complete final or provisional calculations for certain elements of Tax Reform and the amounts and estimates are included in the financial statements. For other elements, the Company was not able to make reasonable estimates and therefore those elements have not been recorded and are accounted for in accordance with ASC 740 on the basis of the tax laws in effect before Tax Reform.The Company’s accounting for the impact of the reduction in the U.S. federal corporate tax rate on the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities is complete. Tax Reform reduces the corporate tax rate to 21 percent, effective January 1, 2018. Consequently, the Company has recorded a net adjustment to deferred income tax expense of $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to revalue the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities. The lower statutory rate of 21% will have a favorable impact on the Company’s effective tax rate in future years.The Company’s accounting for the Transition Tax is incomplete. However, reasonable estimates of certain effects were able to be calculated and, therefore, a provisional adjustment was recorded. The Transition Tax is a tax on the deemed repatriation of previously untaxed accumulated current earnings and profits (E&P) of certain foreign subsidiaries. To determine the amount of the Transition Tax, the Company must determine, in addition to other factors, the amount of post-1986 E&P of the relevant subsidiaries, as well as the amount of non-U.S. income taxes paid on such earnings. The Company was able to make a reasonable estimate of the Transition Tax and recorded a provisional Transition Tax expense of $16.0 million. However, the Company will continue to gather additional information to more precisely compute the final amount. The Company plans to elect to pay this liability over eight years and has recorded $14.5 million of the obligation in other long-term liabilities, with the balance recorded to accrued income taxes. The Company’s accounting for the indefinite reinvestment assertion is incomplete. However, a reasonable estimate of book and tax basis was calculated, and the Company made a provisional assertion. In general, it is the practice and intention of the Company to repatriate previously taxed earnings and to reinvest all other earnings of its non-U.S. subsidiaries. As part of Tax Reform, the Company incurred U.S. tax on substantially all of the earnings of its non-U.S. subsidiaries as part of the Transition Tax. This tax increased the Company’s previously taxed earnings and will allow for the repatriation of the majority of its foreign earnings without any residual U.S. federal tax. The Company does not believe that there is an excess of the financial reporting basis over the tax basis of investments in foreign subsidiaries. Accordingly, any repatriation in excess of previously taxed earnings will be a non-taxable return of basis. This assertion is subject to change as additional information is gathered to precisely compute the book and tax basis of the Company’s non-U.S. subsidiaries.The Company’s accounting for GILTI is incomplete, and reasonable estimates of the effects are not able to be made. Therefore, no provisional adjustments were recorded. Tax Reform creates a new requirement that GILTI earned by controlled foreign corporations (CFCs) must be included currently in the gross income of the CFCs’ U.S. shareholder. GILTI is the excess of the shareholder’s “net CFC tested income” over the net deemed tangible income return which is currently defined as the excess of (1) 10 percent of the aggregate of the U.S. shareholder’s pro rata share of the qualified business asset investment of each CFC  over (2) the amount of certain interest expense taken into account in the determination of net CFC-tested income.32Table of ContentsDue to the complexity of the new GILTI tax rules, the Company is continuing to evaluate this provision of Tax Reform and the application of ASC 740. Under U.S. GAAP, the Company is allowed to make an accounting policy choice of either (1) treating taxes due on future U.S. inclusions in taxable income related to GILTI as a current-period expense when incurred (the “period cost method”) or (2) factoring such amounts into the Company’s measurement of its deferred taxes (the “deferred method”). The Company’s selection of an accounting policy with respect to the new GILTI tax rules will depend, in part, on analyzing global income to determine whether future U.S. inclusions in taxable income related to GILTI are expected and, if so, the expected impact. Whether the Company expects to have future U.S. inclusions in taxable income related to GILTI depends not only on the current structure and estimated future results of global operations, but also on the Company’s intent and ability to modify the structure and/or the business. The Company is not yet able to reasonably estimate the effect of this provision of Tax Reform and therefore has not made any adjustments related to potential GILTI tax in the financial statements. In addition, the Company has not made the accounting policy decision regarding whether to record deferred taxes on GILTI or expense taxes as incurred on GILTI.The increase in the effective tax rate from the prior year is primarily due to tax charges of $17.9 million related to Tax Reform, partially offset by increased tax benefits of $13.1 million related to stock-based compensation in 2017. In addition, the 2016 effective tax rate was reduced by entity structuring and related repatriation benefits of $10.8 million that did not recur in 2017. In the first quarter of 2017, the Company adopted ASU 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which requires excess tax benefits and deficiencies related to stock-based compensation to be reflected in the income statement as a component of the provision for income taxes. Previously, these tax effects were reflected in stockholders' equity.When compared to the federal and state combined statutory rate, the effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were favorably impacted by the domestic manufacturing deduction and research and development credits. The rates were also favorably impacted by the recurring item of lower statutory tax rates in many of the Company's foreign jurisdictions.Net Income: The Company's net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $259.3 million as compared to net income of $265.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Diluted earnings per share was $2.98 for the year ended December 31, 2017 and $2.99 for the year ended December 31, 2016. The weighted average shares used in computing diluted earnings per share were 86.9 million and 89.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.33Table of ContentsYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015Revenue: Year Ended December 31, Change(in thousands, except percentages)2016 2015 Amount %Revenue:       Lease licenses$340,331 $316,367 $23,964 7.6Perpetual licenses227,843 238,738 (10,895) (4.6)Software licenses568,174 555,105 13,069 2.4Maintenance394,745 364,591 30,154 8.3Service25,546 23,057 2,489 10.8Maintenance and service420,291 387,648 32,643 8.4Total revenue$988,465 $942,753 $45,712 4.8The Company's revenue increased 4.8% during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, while revenue grew 5.1% in constant currency. The growth rate was favorably impacted by the Company's continued investment in its global sales, support and marketing organizations and was adversely impacted by a recent shift in the licensing preference of certain customers from perpetual licenses to lease licenses. Lease license revenue increased 7.6% as compared to the prior year. Perpetual license revenue, which is derived primarily from new sales, decreased 4.6% as compared to the prior year. Annual maintenance contracts that were sold with new perpetual licenses, along with maintenance contracts sold with new perpetual licenses in previous years, contributed to maintenance revenue growth of 8.3%.With respect to revenue, on average for the year ended December 31, 2016, the U.S. Dollar was 0.5% stronger, when measured against the Company's primary foreign currencies, than for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Interest income increased as a result of an increase in both the Company's average invested cash balances and the average rate of return on those balances.Other (Expense) Income, net: The Company's other (expense) income consists of the following: Year Ended December 31,(in thousands)2016 2015Foreign currency gains, net$77 $486Other(213) (229)Total other (expense) income, net$(136) $257Income Tax Provision: The Company recorded income tax expense of $114.7 million and had income before income taxes of $380.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, representing an effective tax rate of 30.2%. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recorded income tax expense of $104.2 million and had income before income taxes of $356.8 million, representing an effective tax rate of 29.2%.36Table of ContentsThe increase in the effective tax rate from the prior year is primarily due to tax benefits related to the merger of the Company's Japan subsidiaries in 2010 recognized in 2015 that did not recur in 2016, partially offset by tax benefits from restructuring activities in 2016. When compared to the federal and state combined statutory rate, the effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were favorably impacted by the domestic manufacturing deduction and research and development credits. The quarterly benefit of approximately $3.1 million associated with the merger of the Company's Japan subsidiaries was fully amortized in the third quarter of 2015. There will be no additional ongoing benefit from this transaction. The rates were also favorably impacted by the recurring item of lower statutory tax rates in many of the Company's foreign jurisdictions.Net Income: The Company's net income for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $265.6 million as compared to net income of $252.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.
