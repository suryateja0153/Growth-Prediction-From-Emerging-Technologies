of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Industry Commentary:Our three largest industries — high-tech, automotive, and aerospace and defense (A&D) — remained strong throughout 2019. The high-tech industry was positively impacted by companies' investments in 5G and smart connected products. The automotive industry continued its momentum due to continued investments by our customers to capture the disruptive mobility trends of autonomy and electrification. Defense spending continued to support growth in the aerospace and defense industry.30Table of ContentsAcquisitionsOn November 1, 2019, we completed the acquisition of 100% of the shares of LST, the premier provider of explicit dynamics and other advanced finite element analysis technology, for a purchase price of $777.8 million. The acquisition empowers our customers to solve a new class of engineering challenges, including developing safer automobiles, aircraft and trains while reducing or even eliminating the need for costly physical testing.On February 1, 2019, we completed the acquisition of 100% of the shares of Granta Design, the premier provider of materials information technology, for a purchase price of $208.7 million. The acquisition expands our portfolio into this important area, giving customers access to materials intelligence, including data that is critical to successful simulations.Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2019, we acquired Dynardo, Helic and DfR Solutions to combine the acquired technologies with our existing comprehensive multiphysics portfolio. These acquisitions were not individually significant. The combined purchase price of these acquisitions was $136.2 million.During the year ended December 31, 2018, we completed the acquisition of 100% of the shares of OPTIS, a premier provider of software for scientific simulation of light, human vision and physics-based visualization, for a purchase price of $291.0 million. The acquisition extended our portfolio into the area of optical simulation to provide comprehensive sensor solutions, covering visible and infrared light, electromagnetics and acoustics for camera, radar and lidar. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we completed various acquisitions to expand our customer base and accelerate the development of new and innovative products to the marketplace while lowering design and engineering costs for customers. The acquisitions were not individually significant. The combined purchase price of the acquisitions was approximately $67.0 million.For further information on our business combinations during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.31Table of ContentsResults of OperationsFor purposes of the following discussion and analysis, the table below sets forth certain consolidated financial data for the years 2019, 2018 and 2017.

The growth rate was favorably impacted by our continued investments in our global sales, support and marketing organizations, as well as our 2019 and 2018 acquisitions which contributed incremental revenue of $72.9 million. Lease license revenue increased 47.3%, or 49.4% in constant currency, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, driven primarily by an increase in multi-year lease contracts. Annual maintenance contracts that were sold with new perpetual licenses, maintenance contracts for new perpetual licenses sold in previous years and the maintenance portion of lease license contracts each contributed to maintenance revenue growth of 12.4%, or 14.3% in constant currency. Service revenue, driven primarily by a focus on service offerings that provide on-site mentorship on simulation best practices, training and expanding simulation adoption, increased 39.1%, or 41.5% in constant currency, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. Perpetual license revenue, which is derived primarily from new sales during the year ended December 31, 2019, decreased 2.5%, or 1.1% in constant currency, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.We continue to experience increased interest by some of our larger customers in enterprise agreements that often include longer-term, time-based licenses involving a larger number of our software products. While these arrangements typically involve a higher overall transaction price, the upfront recognition of license revenue related to these larger, multi-year transactions can result in significantly higher lease license revenue and corresponding revenue growth volatility. As software products, across a large variety of applications and industries, become increasingly distributed in software-as-a-service, cloud and other subscription environments in which the licensing approach is time-based rather than perpetual, we are also experiencing a shifting preference from perpetual licenses to time-based licenses across a broader spectrum of our customers.With respect to revenue, on average for the year ended December 31, 2019, the U.S. Dollar was approximately 3.3% stronger, when measured against our primary foreign currencies, than for the year ended December 31, 2018. The table below presents the impacts of currency fluctuations on revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019.

As a result, our post-acquisition revenue will be less than the sum of what would have otherwise been reported by us and each acquiree absent the acquisitions. The impacts on reported revenue were $12.5 million and $9.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The expected impacts on reported revenue are $3.9 million and $8.0 million for the quarter ending March 31, 2020 and the year ending December 31, 2020, respectively.Cost of Sales and Operating Expenses:The tables below reflect our operating results as presented on the consolidated statements of income, which are inclusive of foreign currency translation impacts. Amounts included in the discussions that follow each table are provided in constant currency and are inclusive of costs related to our acquisitions. The impact of foreign exchange translation is discussed separately, where material. The 2019 and 2018 acquisitions contributed $54.7 million to the overall increase in cost of sales and operating expenses with the most significant contributions from the OPTIS (May 2, 2018) and Granta Design (February 1, 2019) acquisitions of $17.3 million and $18.9 million, respectively.

Interest income increased as a result of an increase in the average rate of return on invested cash balances.Interest Expense: Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $3.5 million as compared to $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Interest expense increased as a result of the interest incurred on debt financing obtained in fiscal year 2019.Other Expense, net: Our other expense consisted of the following: Year Ended December 31,(in thousands)2019 2018Foreign currency losses, net$(2,510) $(3,058)Investment gains, net333 2,204Other385 5Total other expense, net$(1,792) $(849)35Table of ContentsIncome Tax Provision: Our income before income tax provision, income tax provision and effective tax rate were as follows: Year Ended December 31,(in thousands, except percentages)2019 2018Income before income tax provision$522,583 $487,085Income tax provision$71,288 $67,710Effective tax rate13.6% 13.9%The decrease in the effective tax rate from the prior year was primarily due to $6.7 million of benefit related to the release of valuation allowance in a foreign jurisdiction and $1.8 million of benefit related to transition tax recorded in 2019. These benefits are offset by $6.7 million of benefit recorded in 2018 related to global legal entity restructuring activities that did not recur in 2019.When compared to the federal and state combined statutory rate for each respective period, the effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were favorably impacted by tax benefits from stock-based compensation, the foreign-derived intangible income deduction, and research and development credits.Net Income: Our net income, diluted earnings per share and weighted average shares used in computing diluted earnings per share were as follows: Year Ended December 31,(in thousands, except per share data)2019 2018Net income$451,295 $419,375Diluted earnings per share$5.25 $4.88Weighted average shares outstanding - diluted85,925 85,91336Table of ContentsYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017Revenue: Year Ended December 31, Change(in thousands, except percentages)2018(ASC 606) 2017(ASC 605) Amount % Constant Currency %Revenue:         Lease licenses$275,619 $376,886 $(101,267) (26.9) (27.4)Perpetual licenses301,098 248,078 53,020 21.4 20.2Software licenses576,717 624,964 (48,247) (7.7) (8.5)Maintenance676,883 440,428 236,455 53.7 51.6Service40,036 29,858 10,178 34.1 33.1Maintenance and service716,919 470,286 246,633 52.4 50.4Total revenue$1,293,636 $1,095,250 $198,386 18.1 16.8The adoption of ASC 606 significantly impacted the timing, allocation and presentation of lease license, perpetual license and maintenance revenue.

Tax Reform made broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code, including, but not limited to, (1) reducing the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent; (2) requiring companies to pay a one-time federal income tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries (transition tax); (3) generally eliminating U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries; (4) creating a new provision designed to tax global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) which allows for the possibility of using foreign tax credits (FTCs) and a deduction of up to 50 percent to offset the income tax liability (subject to some limitations); (5) repealing the domestic production activity deduction; (6) creating the foreign-derived intangible income deduction; (7) creating the base erosion anti-abuse tax, a new minimum tax; (8) allowing for full expensing of qualified property through bonus depreciation; and (9) creating limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation.The SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 118, which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of Tax Reform. SAB 118 provided a measurement period that was limited to one year from enactment for companies to complete the accounting under ASC 740, Income Taxes. In accordance with SAB 118, throughout the measurement period, a company must reflect the income tax effects of those aspects of Tax Reform for which the accounting under ASC 740 was complete in the financial statements. To the extent that a company’s accounting for certain income tax effects of Tax Reform was incomplete, but a reasonable estimate was able to be made, the company must record a provisional estimate in the financial statements. If a company could not determine a provisional estimate to be included in the financial statements, it should continue to apply ASC 740 on the basis of the tax laws that were in effect immediately before the enactment of Tax Reform.As further discussed below, we finalized our provisional Tax Reform calculations as of the end of the measurement period, based on guidance and information available as of the reporting date. The U.S. government has not yet issued final guidance related to a portion of the new rules enacted as part of Tax Reform. Subsequent adjustments, if any, will be recorded in the period in which guidance is finalized.Our accounting for the impact of the reduction in the U.S. federal corporate tax rate on our deferred tax assets and liabilities is complete. Tax Reform reduced the corporate tax rate to 21 percent, effective January 1, 2018. Consequently, we recorded a net adjustment to deferred income tax expense of $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to revalue our deferred tax assets and liabilities. No further adjustments were recorded for the year ended December 31, 2018.Our accounting for the transition tax is complete. Reasonable estimates of certain effects were calculated and a provisional adjustment of $16.0 million was recorded in the December 31, 2017 financial statements. To determine the amount of the transition tax, we determined, in addition to other factors, the amount of post-1986 earnings and profits (E&P) of the relevant subsidiaries, as well as the amount of non-U.S. income taxes paid on such earnings. Based on revised E&P calculations updated during the measurement period, we recognized an additional measurement-period adjustment for the year ended December 31, 2018 of $0.9 million to the transition tax obligation and a corresponding adjustment to tax expense. Our accounting for the indefinite reinvestment assertion is complete. In general, it is our intention to permanently reinvest all earnings in excess of previously taxed amounts. As part of Tax Reform, substantially all of the previous earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries were taxed through the transition tax and current earnings are taxed as part of GILTI tax expense. These taxes increased our previously taxed earnings and allow for the repatriation of the majority of our foreign earnings without any residual U.S. federal tax. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we repatriated $144.3 million of foreign cash. We did not make any adjustments related to our indefinite reinvestment assertion during the year ended December 31, 2018.Our accounting policy choice for GILTI is complete. Under U.S. GAAP, we are allowed to make an accounting policy choice of either (1) treating taxes due on future U.S. inclusions in taxable income related to GILTI as a current-period expense when incurred (the period cost method) or (2) factoring such amounts into the measurement of our deferred taxes (the deferred method). We selected the period cost method and recorded GILTI tax expense of $0.4 million in the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018.The decrease in the effective tax rate from the prior year was primarily due to the reduction in the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent enacted as part of Tax Reform, the additional $15.1 million of transition tax in 2017 when compared to 2018, and a net $6.7 million benefit related to global legal entity restructuring activities. The effective tax rate was also reduced by the foreign-derived intangible income deduction, increased research and development credits and increased stock-based compensation benefits, partially offset by the loss of the domestic manufacturing deduction, which was repealed as part of Tax Reform. When compared to the federal and state combined statutory rate, the effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were favorably impacted by tax benefits from stock-based compensation and research and development credits. 41Table of ContentsNet Income: Our net income, diluted earnings per share and weighted average shares used in computing diluted earnings per share were as follows: Year Ended December 31,(in thousands, except per share data)2018(ASC 606) 2018(ASC 605) 2017(ASC 605)Net income$419,375 $356,851 $259,251Diluted earnings per share$4.88 $4.15 $2.98Weighted average shares outstanding - diluted85,913 85,913 86,85442Table of ContentsNon-GAAP ResultsWe provide non-GAAP revenue, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share as supplemental measures to GAAP regarding our operational performance.
