The growth was partially influenced by benefits from the Company’s continued investment in its global sales and marketing organization. Revenue from lease licenses increased 6.8% as compared to the prior year due primarily to growth in lease license revenue of power analysis and electronics products. Perpetual license revenue, which is derived primarily from new sales, increased 6.6% as compared to the prior year. Annual maintenance contracts that were sold with new perpetual licenses, along with maintenance contracts sold with new perpetual licenses in previous years, contributed to maintenance revenue growth of 12.2%.With respect to revenue, on average for the year ended December 31, 2014, the U.S. Dollar was 1.6% stronger, when measured against the Company’s primary foreign currencies, than for the year ended December 31, 2013. The net overall strengthening resulted in decreased revenue of $7.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. The impact on revenue was primarily driven by $9.8 million of adverse impact due to a weakening Japanese Yen, partially offset by $1.9 million of favorable impact due to a strengthening British Pound. The net overall strengthening of the U.S. Dollar also resulted in decreased operating income of $5.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.A substantial portion of the Company’s license and maintenance revenue is derived from annual lease and maintenance contracts. These contracts are generally renewed on an annual basis and typically have a high rate of customer renewal. In addition to the recurring revenue base associated with these contracts, a majority of customers purchasing new perpetual licenses also purchase related annual maintenance contracts. As a result of the significant recurring revenue base, the Company’s license and maintenance revenue growth rate in any period does not necessarily correlate to the growth rate of new license and maintenance contracts sold during that period. To the extent the rate of customer renewal for lease and maintenance contracts is high, incremental lease contracts, and maintenance contracts sold with new perpetual licenses, will result in license and maintenance revenue growth. Conversely, if the rate of renewal for these contracts is adversely affected by economic or other factors, the Company’s license and maintenance growth will be adversely affected over the term that the revenue for those contracts would have otherwise been recognized.International and domestic revenues, as a percentage of total revenue, were 65.8% and 34.2%, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2014, and 66.1% and 33.9%, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2013. The Company derived 24.9% and 25.3% of its total revenue through the indirect sales channel for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.In valuing deferred revenue on the balance sheets of the Company's recent acquisitions as of their respective acquisition dates, the Company applied the fair value provisions applicable to the accounting for business combinations, resulting in a reduction of deferred revenue as compared to its historical carrying amount. As a result, the Company's post-acquisition revenue will be less than the sum of what would have otherwise been reported by ANSYS and its subsidiaries absent the acquisitions. The impact on reported revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $5.4 million. The expected impact on reported revenue is $1.2 million for the year ending December 31, 2015.29Table of ContentsCost of Sales and Gross Profit: Year Ended December 31,    2014 2013 Change(in thousands, except percentages)Amount % ofRevenue Amount % ofRevenue Amount %Cost of sales:           Software licenses$30,607 3.3 $28,363 3.3 $2,244 7.9Amortization37,653 4.0 38,298 4.4 (645) (1.7)Maintenance and service85,126 9.1 80,031 9.3 5,095 6.4Total cost of sales153,386 16.4 146,692 17.0 6,694 4.6Gross profit$782,635 83.6 $714,568 83.0 $68,067 9.5Software Licenses: The increase in costs of software licenses was primarily due to the following:•SpaceClaim-related costs of software licenses of $0.8 million for the period from the acquisition date (April 30, 2014) through December 31, 2014.•Increased salaries of $0.6 million.Amortization: The decrease in amortization expense was primarily due to a net decrease in amortization of acquired technology, partially offset by an increase in trade name amortization.Maintenance and Service: The increase in maintenance and service costs was primarily due to the following:•Increased salaries of $3.0 million.•Increased third-party technical support of $1.0 million.The improvement in gross profit was a result of the increase in revenue offset by a smaller increase in related cost of sales.30Table of ContentsOperating Expenses: Year Ended December 31,    2014 2013 Change(in thousands, except percentages)Amount % ofRevenue Amount % ofRevenue Amount %Operating expenses:           Selling, general and administrative$246,376 26.3 $218,907 25.4 $27,469 12.5Research and development165,421 17.7 151,439 17.6 13,982 9.2Amortization23,388 2.5 22,359 2.6 1,029 4.6Total operating expenses$435,185 46.5 $392,705 45.6 $42,480 10.8Selling, General and Administrative: The increase in selling, general and administrative costs was primarily due to the following:•Increased salaries, incentive compensation and other headcount-related costs of $9.8 million, primarily due to an increase in headcount.•SpaceClaim-related selling, general and administrative costs of $4.6 million for the period from the acquisition date (April 30, 2014) through December 31, 2014.•Increased severance costs of $3.2 million.•Reaction Design-related selling, general and administrative costs of $2.3 million for the period from the acquisition date (January 3, 2014) through December 31, 2014.•Increased third-party commissions of $2.1 million.The Company anticipates that it will continue to make targeted investments in its global sales and marketing organization and its global business infrastructure to enhance major account sales activities and to support its worldwide sales distribution and marketing strategies, and the business in general.Research and Development: The increase in research and development costs was primarily due to the following:•Increased salaries and other headcount-related costs of $5.9 million, primarily due to an increase in headcount.•SpaceClaim-related research and development costs of $2.3 million for the period from the acquisition date (April 30, 2014) through December 31, 2014.•Reaction Design-related research and development costs of $2.3 million for the period from the acquisition date (January 3, 2014) through December 31, 2014.•Increased stock-based compensation of $1.2 million.The Company has traditionally invested significant resources in research and development activities and intends to continue to make investments in this area, particularly as it relates to expanding the capabilities of its flagship products and other products within its broad portfolio of simulation software, the evolution of its ANSYS® Workbench™ platform, integrated multiphysics, expanding its HPC capabilities, an immersive user interface, robust design and ongoing integration of acquired technology.Amortization: The increase in amortization expense was primarily due to a net increase in amortization of customer lists, partially offset by a net decrease in amortization of contract backlog.31Table of ContentsInterest Expense: The Company’s interest expense consists of the following: Year Ended December 31,(in thousands)2014 2013Discounted obligations$628 $722Term loan— 230Amortization of debt financing costs— 149Other151 68Total interest expense$779 $1,169Interest Income: Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $3.0 million as compared to $2.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2013. Interest income increased as a result of an increase in the Company's average invested cash balances.Other Expense, net: The Company's other expense consists of the following: Year Ended December 31,(in thousands)2014 2013Foreign currency losses, net$(1,649) $(1,115)Other income, net115 69Total other expense, net$(1,534) $(1,046)Income Tax Provision: The Company recorded income tax expense of $93.4 million and had income before income taxes of $348.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, representing an effective tax rate of 26.8%. During the year ended December 31, 2013, the Company recorded income tax expense of $77.2 million and had income before income taxes of $322.5 million, representing an effective tax rate of 23.9%.In December 2013, the Company received notice from the IRS that the Joint Committee on Taxation took no exception to the Company's tax returns that were filed for 2009 and 2010. An $11.0 million tax benefit was recognized in the Company's 2013 financial results as the Company had effectively settled uncertainty regarding the realization of refund claims filed in connection with the 2009 and 2010 returns.In the U.S., which is the largest jurisdiction where the Company receives such a tax credit, the availability of the research and development credit expired at the end of the 2011 tax year. In January 2013, the U.S. Congress passed legislation that reinstated the research and development credit retroactive to 2012. The income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2013 includes approximately $2.3 million related to the reinstated research and development credit for 2012 activity. The research and development credit also expired at the end of the 2013 tax year, but the U.S. Congress reinstated the credit in December 2014 for the 2014 tax year.The increase in the effective tax rate from the prior year is primarily due to the release of an uncertain tax position and the reinstatement of the U.S. research and development credit mentioned above impacting the prior year rate. When compared to the federal and state combined statutory rate, the effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 were favorably impacted by the domestic manufacturing deduction and tax benefits associated with the merger of the Company’s Japan subsidiaries in 2010. The rates were also favorably impacted by the recurring item of lower statutory tax rates in many of the Company's foreign jurisdictions. The relative amount of income earned in foreign jurisdictions is expected to be fairly consistent in the near term.Net Income: The Company’s net income for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $254.7 million as compared to net income of $245.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Diluted earnings per share was $2.70 for the year ended December 31, 2014 and $2.58 for the year ended December 31, 2013. The weighted average shares used in computing diluted earnings per share were 94.2 million and 95.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.32Table of ContentsYear Ended December 31, 2013 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2012Revenue: Year Ended December 31, Change(in thousands, except percentages)2013 2012 Amount %Revenue:       Lease licenses$297,658 $279,283 $18,375 6.6Perpetual licenses231,286 222,587 8,699 3.9Software licenses528,944 501,870 27,074 5.4Maintenance309,085 275,498 33,587 12.2Service23,231 20,650 2,581 12.5Maintenance and service332,316 296,148 36,168 12.2Total revenue$861,260 $798,018 $63,242 7.9The Company’s revenue increased 7.9% in 2013 as compared to 2012, including increases in all major revenue categories. The Company's revenue included Esterel operations for the full year in 2013 of $18.8 million as compared to five months in 2012 of $3.3 million. The growth was partially influenced by benefits from the Company’s continued investment in its global sales and marketing organization. Annual maintenance contracts that were sold with new perpetual licenses, along with maintenance contracts sold with new perpetual licenses in previous years, contributed to maintenance revenue growth of 12.2%. Revenue from lease licenses increased 6.6% as compared to the prior year due to an increase in power-analysis-related lease license revenue and growth in sales of other lease licenses. Perpetual license revenue, which is derived entirely from new sales during the period, increased 3.9% as compared to the prior year, due to increased perpetual license sales across most product lines, as well as a full year of Esterel activity in 2013 as compared to five months in 2012. Service revenue increased 12.5% as compared to the prior year due to an increase in engineering consulting projects.With respect to revenue, on average for the year ended December 31, 2013, the U.S. Dollar was 4.0% stronger, when measured against the Company’s primary foreign currencies, than for the year ended December 31, 2012. The net overall strengthening, primarily related to the Japanese Yen, resulted in decreased revenue and operating income during 2013, as compared to 2012, of $17.6 million and $12.2 million, respectively.International and domestic revenues, as a percentage of total revenue, were 66.1% and 33.9%, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2013, and 66.7% and 33.3%, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2012. The Company derived 25.3% and 26.0% of its total revenue through the indirect sales channel for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.In valuing deferred revenue on the Esterel and Apache Design, Inc. ("Apache") balance sheets as of their respective acquisition dates, the Company applied the fair value provisions applicable to the accounting for business combinations, resulting in lower amounts of revenue than Esterel and Apache would have recognized absent the acquisitions. The impact on reported revenue for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $4.6 million.33Table of ContentsCost of Sales and Gross Profit: Year Ended December 31,    2013 2012 Change(in thousands, except percentages)Amount % ofRevenue Amount % ofRevenue Amount %Cost of sales:           Software licenses$28,363 3.3 $24,512 3.1 $3,851 15.7Amortization38,298 4.4 40,889 5.1 (2,591) (6.3)Maintenance and service80,031 9.3 74,115 9.3 5,916 8.0Total cost of sales146,692 17.0 139,516 17.5 7,176 5.1Gross profit$714,568 83.0 $658,502 82.5 $56,066 8.5Software Licenses: The increase in costs of software licenses was primarily due to the following:•Increased salaries and incentive compensation of $2.2 million.•Increased third-party royalties of $0.9 million.•Increased Esterel-related costs of $0.7 million, primarily as a result of a full year of Esterel activity in 2013 as compared to five months of activity in 2012.Amortization: The decrease in amortization expense was primarily due to a net decrease in amortization of acquired technology.Maintenance and Service: The increase in maintenance and service costs was primarily due to the following:•Increased salaries and headcount-related costs of $2.6 million.•Increased third-party technical support of $1.4 million.•Increased Esterel-related costs of $0.6 million, primarily as a result of a full year of Esterel activity in 2013 as compared to five months of activity in 2012.•Increased depreciation expense of $0.5 million.The improvement in gross profit was a result of the increase in revenue offset by a smaller increase in related cost of sales.34Table of ContentsOperating Expenses: Year Ended December 31,    2013 2012 Change(in thousands, except percentages)Amount % ofRevenue Amount % ofRevenue Amount %Operating expenses:           Selling, general and administrative$218,907 25.4 $205,178 25.7 $13,729 6.7Research and development151,439 17.6 132,628 16.6 18,811 14.2Amortization22,359 2.6 26,443 3.3 (4,084) (15.4)Total operating expenses$392,705 45.6 $364,249 45.6 $28,456 7.8Selling, General and Administrative: The increase in selling, general and administrative costs was primarily due to the following:•Increased salaries of $4.9 million, primarily due to an increase in headcount.•Increased Esterel-related expenses of $4.5 million, primarily as a result of a full year of Esterel activity in 2013 as compared to five months of activity in 2012.•Increased stock-based compensation of $1.6 million.Research and Development: The increase in research and development costs was primarily due to the following:•Increased salaries, incentive compensation and other headcount-related costs of $11.0 million, primarily due to an increase in headcount.•Increased Esterel-related expenses of $3.1 million, primarily as a result of a full year of Esterel activity in 2013 as compared to five months of activity in 2012.•Increased facilities and IT-related maintenance costs of $1.7 million.•Increased stock-based compensation of $1.4 million.•EVEN-related research and development costs of $1.4 million for the period from the acquisition date (April 2, 2013) through December 31, 2013.Amortization: The decrease in amortization expense was primarily due to a net decrease in amortization of acquired intangible assets, including contract backlog and customer lists.Interest Expense: The Company’s interest expense consists of the following: Year Ended December 31,(in thousands)2013 2012Discounted obligations$722 $546Term loan230 1,342Amortization of debt financing costs149 698Other68 75Total interest expense$1,169 $2,661Interest Income: Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $2.8 million as compared to $3.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2012.

MeasuresManagement uses non-GAAP financial measures (a) to evaluate the Company's historical and prospective financial performance as well as its performance relative to its competitors, (b) to set internal sales targets and spending budgets, (c) to allocate resources, (d) to measure operational profitability and the accuracy of forecasting, (e) to assess financial discipline over operational expenditures and (f) as an important factor in determining variable compensation for management and its employees. In addition, many financial analysts that follow the Company focus on and publish both historical results and future projections based on non-GAAP financial measures. The Company believes that it is in the best interest of its investors to provide this information to analysts so that they accurately report the non-GAAP financial information. Moreover, investors have historically requested and the Company has historically reported these non-GAAP financial measures as a means of providing consistent and comparable information with past reports of financial results.While management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors, there are limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, are not reported by all of the Company’s competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of the Company’s competitors due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation. The Company compensates for these limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures as supplements to GAAP financial measures and by reviewing the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measures.38Table of ContentsThe adjustments to these non-GAAP financial measures, and the basis for such adjustments, are outlined below:Acquisition accounting for deferred revenue and its related tax impact. Historically, the Company has consummated acquisitions in order to support its strategic and other business objectives. In accordance with the fair value provisions applicable to the accounting for business combinations, acquired deferred revenue is often recorded on the opening balance sheet at an amount that is lower than the historical carrying value. Although this purchase accounting requirement has no impact on the Company’s business or cash flow, it adversely impacts the Company’s reported GAAP revenue in the reporting periods following an acquisition. In order to provide investors with financial information that facilitates comparison of both historical and future results, the Company provides non-GAAP financial measures which exclude the impact of the acquisition accounting adjustment. The Company believes that this non-GAAP financial adjustment is useful to investors because it allows investors to (a) evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making, and (b) compare past and future reports of financial results of the Company as the revenue reduction related to acquired deferred revenue will not recur when related annual lease licenses and software maintenance contracts are renewed i
