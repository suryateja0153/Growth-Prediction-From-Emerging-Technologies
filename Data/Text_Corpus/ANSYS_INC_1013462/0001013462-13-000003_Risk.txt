Risk Factors.24Table of ContentsAcquisitionsEsterel Technologies, S.A.On August 1, 2012, the Company completed its acquisition of Esterel. Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, ANSYS acquired 100% of Esterel for a purchase price of $58.2 million, which included $13.1 million in acquired cash. The acquisition agreement also includes retention provisions for key members of Esterel's management and employees, which are accounted for outside of the business combination. The Company funded the transaction entirely with existing cash balances. Esterel's software enables software and systems engineers to design, simulate and automatically produce certified embedded software, which is the control code built into the electronics in aircraft, rail transportation, automotive, energy systems, medical devices and other industrial products that have central processing units.  The complementary combination is expected to accelerate development of new and innovative products to the marketplace while lowering design and engineering costs for customers.The operating results of Esterel have been included in the Company's consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition, August 1, 2012. The assets and liabilities of Esterel have been recorded based upon management's estimates of their fair market values as of the acquisition date.

Under the terms of the merger agreement, ANSYS acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of Apache for a purchase price of $314.0 million, which included $31.9 million in acquired cash and short-term investments on Apache’s balance sheet, $3.2 million in ANSYS replacement stock options issued to holders of partially-vested Apache stock options and $9.5 million in contingent consideration that is based on the retention of a key member of Apache’s management. The Company funded the transaction entirely with existing cash balances. The operating results of Apache have been included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition, August 1, 2011.25Table of ContentsThe assets and liabilities of Apache have been recorded based on management’s estimates of their fair market values as of the acquisition date.

Although this acquisition accounting requirement had no impact on the Company’s business or cash flow, the Company’s reported revenue under GAAP, primarily for the first 12 months post-acquisition, will be less than the sum of what would otherwise have been reported by Apache, Esterel and ANSYS absent the acquisitions. Acquired deferred revenue of $10.1 million and $1.1 million were recorded on the opening balance sheets of Apache and Esterel, respectively. Collectively, these amounts were $24.6 million lower than their historical carrying values. The impact on reported revenue for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $9.6 million. The expected impact on reported revenue is $1.8 million and $4.6 million for the quarter ending March 31, 2013 and the year ending December 31, 2013, respectively.26Table of ContentsResults of OperationsFor purposes of the following discussion and analysis, the table below sets forth certain consolidated financial data for the years 2012, 2011 and 2010.

The Company's revenue included Apache operations for the full year in 2012 of $62.0 million as compared to five months in 2011 of $14.5 million. The growth was partially influenced by benefits from the Company’s continued investment in its global sales and marketing organization. Revenue from lease licenses increased 28.1% as compared to the prior year due to an increase in Apache-related lease license revenue and growth in sales of other lease licenses. Annual maintenance contracts that were sold with new perpetual licenses, along with maintenance contracts sold with new perpetual licenses in previous years, contributed to maintenance revenue growth of 11.7%. Perpetual license revenue, which is derived entirely from new sales during the period, increased 7.1% as compared to the prior year.  Esterel-related revenue for the period from the acquisition date (August 1, 2012) through December 31, 2012 was $3.3 million. Service revenue increased 8.6% as compared to the prior year, primarily from increased revenue associated with engineering consulting services.With respect to revenue, on average for the year ended December 31, 2012, the U.S. Dollar was 3.7% stronger, when measured against the Company’s primary foreign currencies, than for the year ended December 31, 2011. The net overall strengthening of the U.S. Dollar resulted in decreased revenue and operating income during 2012, as compared to 2011, of $15.4 million and $7.4 million, respectively.A substantial portion of the Company’s license and maintenance revenue is derived from annual lease and maintenance contracts. These contracts are generally renewed on an annual basis and typically have a high rate of customer renewal. In addition to the recurring revenue base associated with these contracts, a majority of customers purchasing new perpetual licenses also purchase related annual maintenance contracts. As a result of the significant recurring revenue base, the Company’s license and maintenance revenue growth rate in any period does not necessarily correlate to the growth rate of new license and maintenance contracts sold during that period. To the extent the rate of customer renewal for lease and maintenance contracts is high, incremental lease contracts, and maintenance contracts sold with new perpetual licenses, will result in license and maintenance revenue growth. Conversely, if the rate of renewal for these contracts is adversely affected by economic or other factors, the Company’s license and maintenance growth will be adversely affected over the term that the revenue for those contracts would have otherwise been recognized.The Company had a backlog of $55.2 million and $56.3 million of orders received but not invoiced as of December 31, 2012  and 2011, respectively.International and domestic revenues, as a percentage of total revenue, were 66.7% and 33.3%, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2012, and 68.8% and 31.2%, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2011. The Company derived 26.0% and 26.4% of its total revenue through the indirect sales channel for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.In valuing deferred revenue on the Esterel and Apache balance sheets as of their respective acquisition dates, the Company applied the fair value provisions applicable to the accounting for business combinations resulting in lower amounts of revenue than Esterel and Apache would have recognized absent the acquisitions. The impact on reported revenue for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $9.6 million.28Table of ContentsCost of Sales and Gross Profit: Year Ended December 31,    2012 2011 Change(in thousands, except

costs was primarily due to the following:•Increased Apache-related costs of $7.3 million, primarily as a result of a full year of Apache activity in 2012 as compared to five months of activity in 2011.•A $900,000 increase in stock-based compensation.•Esterel-related cost of sales of $600,000 for the period from the acquisition (August 1, 2012) through December 31, 2012.Amortization: The increase in amortization expense was primarily due to the following:•An additional $9.5 million of amortization of acquired Apache software as a result of a full year of Apache activity in 2012 as compared to five months of activity in 2011.•A net $2.8 million decrease in amortization of other acquired software, including Esterel.Maintenance and Service: The increase in maintenance and service costs was primarily due to the following:•Increased salaries and headcount-related costs of $2.3 million.•Increased depreciation expense of $700,000.•Esterel-related maintenance and service expenses of $600,000 for the period from the acquisition (August 1, 2012) through December 31, 2012.The improvement in gross profit was a result of the increase in revenue offset by a smaller increase in

business infrastructure to enhance major account sales activities and to support its worldwide sales distribution and marketing strategies, and the business in general.Research and Development: The increase in research and development costs was primarily due to the following:•Increased Apache-related expenses of $9.2 million, primarily as a result of a full year of Apache activity in 2012 as compared to five months of activity in 2011.•Increased salaries and headcount-related costs of $6.6 million.•Increased stock-based compensation expense of $5.3 million.•Increased depreciation expense

expanding the capabilities of its flagship products and other products within its broad portfolio of simulation software, evolution of its ANSYS® Workbench™ platform, HPC capabilities, robust design and ongoing integration.Amortization: The increase in amortization expense was primarily due to the following:•An additional $9.1 million of amortization of acquired Apache intangible assets, including customer lists, contract backlog and a trade name, as a result of a full year of Apache activity in 2012 as compared to five months of activity in 2011.•A net $500,000 decrease in amortization of other acquired customer lists, including Esterel.30Table of ContentsInterest Expense: The Company’s interest expense consists of the following: Year Ended December 31,(in

year ended December 31, 2012 was $3.4 million as compared to $3.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2011. Interest income increased as a result of both an increase in the average cash balances and the rate of return on those balances.Other Expense, net: The Company recorded other expense of $1.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to $369,000 during the year ended December 31, 2011. The activity for both years was primarily composed of net foreign currency transaction losses on transactions denominated in a currency other than the Company or its subsidiaries' functional currency.Income Tax Provision: The Company recorded income tax expense of $90.1 million and had income before income taxes of $293.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, representing an effective tax rate of 30.7%. During the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company recorded income tax expense of $84.2 million and had income before income taxes of $264.9 million, representing an effective tax rate of 31.8%.When compared to the federal and state combined statutory rate, these rates were favorably impacted by lower statutory tax rates in many of the Company’s foreign jurisdictions, the domestic manufacturing deduction, research and experimentation credits and tax benefits associated with the merger of the Company’s Japan subsidiaries in 2010. In the U.S., which is the largest jurisdiction where the Company receives such a tax credit, the availability of the research and development credit expired at the end of 2011. In January 2013, the U.S. Congress passed legislation that reinstated the research and development credit retroactive to 2012. These rates were also impacted by charges or benefits associated with the Company’s uncertain tax positions.As a result of the 2010 subsidiary merger in Japan, the Company realized a reduction in its 2012 income tax expense of $9.0 million related to tax credits in the U.S. associated with foreign taxes paid in Japan. The Company also expects the 2010 Japan subsidiary merger to reduce future income tax expense by the following amounts: Estimated Reduction inIncome Tax ExpenseFiscal year 2013$8.9 - $9.1 millionFiscal year 2014$8.9 - $9.1 millionFiscal year 2015$6.7 - $6.9 millionRefer to the section titled, “Liquidity and Capital Resources” for the estimated impact of the Japan subsidiary merger on future cash flows.Net Income: The Company’s net income for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $203.5 million as compared to net income of $180.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. Diluted earnings per share was $2.14 for the year ended December 31, 2012 and $1.91 for the year ended December 31, 2011. The weighted average shares used in computing diluted earnings per share were 95.0 million and 94.4 million during the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.31Table of ContentsYear Ended December 31, 2011 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2010Revenue: Year EndedDecember 31, Change(in thousands, except percentages)2011 2010 Amount %Revenue:       Lease licenses$218,005 $184,539 $33,466 18.1Perpetual licenses207,876 166,494 41,382 24.9Software licenses425,881 351,033 74,848 21.3Maintenance246,546 211,465 35,081 16.6Service19,022 17,738 1,284 7.2Maintenance and service265,568 229,203 36,365 15.9Total revenue$691,449 $580,236 $111,213 19.2The Company’s revenue increased 19.2% in 2011 as compared to 2010, including increases in license and maintenance revenue. This strong growth was partially influenced by a modest improvement in the global economy as compared to the prior year, including the effects of these economic improvements on year-end spending patterns in certain geographies, benefits from the Company’s continued investment in its global sales and marketing organization and $14.5 million in revenue related to the acquisition of Apache for the period from the acquisition date (August 1, 2011) through December 31, 2011. Perpetual license revenue, which is derived entirely from new sales during the period, increased 24.9% as compared to the prior year. The annual maintenance contracts that were sold with the new perpetual licenses, along with the renewal of maintenance contracts sold with perpetual licenses in previous years, contributed to maintenance revenue growth of 16.6%. Revenue from lease licenses increased 18.1% as compared to the prior year, due to growth in sales of lease licenses and the addition of Apache-related lease license revenue of $14.0 million. Service revenue increased 7.2% as compared to the prior year.With respect to revenue, on average for the year ended December 31, 2011, the U.S. Dollar was 5.3% weaker, when measured against the Company’s primary foreign currencies, than for the year ended December 31, 2010. The net overall weakening resulted in increased revenue and operating income during 2011, as compared with 2010, of $19.8 million and $12.6 million, respectively.International and domestic revenues, as a percentage of total revenue, were 68.8% and 31.2%, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2011, and 67.5% and 32.5%, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2010. The Company derived 26.4% and 26.7% of its total revenue through the indirect sales channel during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.In accordance with the accounting requirements applicable to deferred revenue acquired in a business combination, acquired deferred revenue was recorded on the Apache opening balance sheet at an amount lower than the historical carrying value. The impact on reported revenue for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $9.6 million, primarily in lease license revenue.As of December 31, 2011, the Company had a backlog of $56.3 million of orders received but not invoiced.32Table of ContentsCost of Sales and Gross Profit: Year Ended December 31, Change2011 2010 (in thousands, except percentages)Amount % ofRevenue Amount % ofRevenue Amount %Cost of sales:           Software licenses$15,884 2.3 $10,770 1.9 $5,114 47.5Amortization33,728 4.9 32,757 5.6 971 3.0Maintenance and service69,402 10.0 57,352 9.9 12,050 21.0Total cost of sales119,014 17.2 100,879 17.4 18,135 18.0Gross profit$572,435 82.8 $479,357 82.6 $93,078 19.4Software Licenses: The increase in software license costs was primarily due to the following:•Apache-related cost of sales of $3.1 million for the period from the acquisition (August 1, 2011) through December 31, 2011.•Increased third-party royalties of $1.2 million.•Increased stock-based compensation of $400,000.•Increased salaries of $300,000.Amortization: The increase in amortization expense was primarily a result of the following:•Amortization of acquired Apache software of $3.8 million.•A $300,000 increase in amortization of a previously acquired trademark.•A $3.1 million decrease in amortization of other acquired software.Maintenance and Service: The increase in maintenance and service costs was primarily due to the following:•Increased salaries and headcount-related costs, including incentive compensation, of $9.5 million.•Increased business travel expenses of $1.1 million.•Decreased third-party technical support costs of $800,000.•Increased office and equipment lease expenses of $600,000.•Increased depreciation of $500,000.The improvement in the gross profit was a result of the increase in revenue offset by a smaller increase in related cost of sales.33Table of ContentsOperating Expenses: Year Ended December 31, Change2011 2010 (in thousands, except percentages)Amount % ofRevenue Amount % ofRevenue Amount %Operating expenses:           Selling, general and administrative$180,357 26.1 $155,096 26.7 $25,261 16.3Research and development108,530 15.7 88,990 15.3 19,540 22.0Amortization17,989 2.6 16,003 2.8 1,986 12.4Total operating expenses$306,876 44.4 $260,089 44.8 $46,787 18.0Selling, General and Administrative: The increase in selling, general and administrative costs was primarily due to the following:•Increased salaries and headcount-related costs, including incentive compensation, of $9.0 million.•Apache-related selling, general and administrative expenses of $8.4 million.•Transaction costs totaling $2.1 million related to the Apache acquisition.•Increased third-party commissions of $1.8 million.•Increased discretionary marketing costs of $1.5 million.•Increased depreciation of $900,000.•Increased business travel expenses and maintenance-related costs, each of $800,000.•Increased stock-based compensation expense of $700,000.•Decreased franchise tax expenses of $1.8 million.•Decreased bad debt expense of $1.4 million.Research and Development: The increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to the following:•Increased salaries and headcount-related costs, including incentive compensation, of $8.0 million.•Apache-related research and development expenses of $6.0 million.•Increased stock-based compensation expense of $2.5 million.•Increased depreciation of $700,000.•Increased facilities and information technology maintenance costs of $600,000.•Increased consulting expenses of $500,000.Amortization: The increase in amortization expense was primarily the result of $1.8 million of acquired Apache intangible assets, including a trademark, customer lists and contract backlog.34Table of ContentsInterest Expense: The Company’s interest expense consisted of the following: Year Ended December  31,(in thousands)2011 2010Bank interest on term loans$1,605 $2,096Amortization of debt financing costs953 1,107Discounted obligations462 334Realized loss on interest rate swap agreement— 864Other312 87Total interest expense$3,332 $4,488The decreased interest expense shown above for 2011 is primarily a result of the June 30, 2010 expiration of the interest rate swap and a lower average outstanding debt balance.

The activity for both years was primarily composed of net foreign currency transaction losses.Income Tax Provision: The Company recorded income tax expense of $84.2 million and had income before income taxes of $264.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. This represents an effective tax rate of 31.8%. During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company recorded income tax expense of $63.3 million and had income before income taxes of $216.4 million, representing an effective tax rate of 29.2%.As a result of a 2010 subsidiary merger in Japan, the Company realized a reduction in its 2011 income tax expense of $9.0 million related to tax credits in the U.S. associated with foreign taxes paid in Japan.In addition, the Company’s tax expense in the year ended December 31, 2011 was unfavorably impacted by reductions to the Japanese corporate tax rate, beginning with the 2013 tax year. This legislation, enacted on November 30, 2011, resulted in an additional $4.8 million in deferred tax expense due to the reduction in the value of certain net deferred tax assets of the Company’s Japanese subsidiaries. The effect of this adjustment increased the 2011 effective tax rate from 30.0% to 31.8%.Net Income: The Company’s net income for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $180.7 million as compared to net income of $153.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Diluted earnings per share was $1.91 for the year ended December 31, 2011 and $1.64 for the year ended December 31, 2010.
