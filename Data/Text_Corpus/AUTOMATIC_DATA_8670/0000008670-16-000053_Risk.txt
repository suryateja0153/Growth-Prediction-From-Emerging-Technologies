As a leader in this industry, we are focused on driving product innovation, enhancing our distribution and service capabilities, and assisting our clients with their HCM needs in the face of ever increasing regulatory complexity.  Highlights from our 2016 fiscal year include:•New business bookings grew 12% from the year ended June 30, 2015 ("fiscal 2015")•Revenue grew 7%; 8% on a constant dollar basis•Pre-tax margin increased 20 basis points to 19.2%; Adjusted EBIT margin increased 60 basis points to 19.5%•Net earnings from continuing operations increased 8%; Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations grew 9%•Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased to $3.25 from $2.89 in the prior year; Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased to $3.26 from $2.89 in the prior year•Enhanced our capital structure by issuing $2 billion of senior notes•Continued our shareholder friendly actions by returning $1.2 billion via share repurchases and over $900 million via dividends, which increased on a per-share basis for the 41st consecutive year •Delivered nearly 10 million Form 1095-Cs to client employees to assist with the Affordable Care Act ("ACA") reporting requirements20During the year ended June 30, 2016 ("fiscal 2016"), we continued to focus on our global HCM strategy and our results reflect the strength of our underlying business model, our success in the market, and our focus on growth.  This focus is evidenced by our investments in product innovation, service, and our sales force, as well as the disposition of the Advanced MD ("AMD") business.  Our focus on product innovation, the high demand for additional HCM solutions (including products that assist businesses in complying with the ACA), investments in and productivity of our salesforce, and continued positive economic growth in the United States of America ("U.S."), led our sales force to deliver strong new business bookings during fiscal 2016.  Our sales force's ability to sell to new and existing clients as well as our implementation team's ability to implement new clients on our solutions and implement new services to existing clients drove solid revenue growth during fiscal 2016.  In the second half of fiscal year 2016, we began to see a contribution to revenue growth from our ACA compliance solutions, as our upfront investments in selling and implementation of these products in late fiscal 2015 and throughout fiscal 2016 began to translate into recurring revenue.This revenue growth was apparent within both of our business segments during fiscal 2016 despite pressure on Employer Services revenues from foreign currency translation.  Revenue retention declined compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to elevated losses on our legacy client platforms.  This metric continues to be a point of internal focus as we upgrade our clients from legacy platforms to our new modern cloud-based solutions and focus on improving the client experience.  Our revenue growth also benefited from the continued increase in our pays per control metric, which we measure as the number of employees on our clients' payrolls as measured on a same-store-sales basis utilizing a representative subset of payrolls ranging from small to large businesses that are reflective of a broad range of U.S. geographic regions. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we incurred a $48 million charge for a broad-based workforce optimization effort undertaken during the period.  Additionally, in July 2016, we announced a multi-year service alignment initiative intended to align our client service operations with our platform simplification strategy.  In connection with this service alignment initiative, we anticipate incurring pre-tax charges of $100 million to $125 million through the year ended June 30, 2018. We have a strong business model with a high percentage of recurring revenues, good margins, the ability to generate consistent, healthy cash flows, strong client retention, and low capital expenditure requirements.  Our financial condition and balance sheet remain solid at June 30, 2016, with cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $3.2 billion.  Additionally, during fiscal 2016, we changed our capital structure via the issuance of $2 billion in senior notes, the proceeds of which we have begun to return to shareholders via share repurchases.  The introduction of long-term debt to our capital structure and the anticipated share repurchases are intended to enhance total shareholder return over the longer term.Fiscal 2016 was another exciting and dynamic year that showcased our agility as we continued to adapt to the evolving needs of our clients and the changing regulatory environment within our HCM industry as evidenced by our ability to respond to the challenges presented by the ACA.  We continue to be pleased with the success of our sales operations, our ability to continuously innovate and offer new and exciting products to our clients, and the ability of our service organization to adapt to these new services and strategic platforms.  Exiting fiscal 2016, we believe that our efforts during the fiscal year, in conjunction with our service alignment initiative announced in July, positions us well as we head into fiscal 2017.    21RESULTS OF OPERATIONSANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONSPrior period amounts have been adjusted to exclude discontinued operations (refer to Note 2 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information).(In millions, except per share amounts)  Years Ended % Change  June 30, As Reported Constant Dollar Basis  2016 2015 2014 2016 2015 2016 2015               Total revenues from continuing operations $11,667.8 $10,938.5 $10,226.4 7% 7% 8% 9%               Costs of revenues:              Operating expenses 6,025.0 5,625.3 5,290.8 7% 6% 9% 8%Systems development and programming costs 603.7 595.4 551.2 1% 8% 4% 11%Depreciation and amortization 211.6 206.9 199.0 2% 4% 5% 6%Total costs of revenues 6,840.3 6,427.6 6,041.0 6% 6% 5% 8%               Selling, general and administrative costs 2,637.0 2,496.9 2,370.3 6% 5% 7% 7%Interest expense 56.2 6.5 6.1 n/m n/m n/m n/mTotal expenses  9,533.5 8,931.0 8,417.4 7% 6% 8% 8%               Other income, net (100.4) (63.2) (70.2) n/m n/m n/m n/m               Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes $2,234.7 $2,070.7 $1,879.2 8% 10% 9% 12%Margin 19.2% 18.9% 18.4%                       Provision for income taxes $741.3 $694.2 $636.6 7% 9% 8% 11%Effective tax rate 33.2% 33.5% 33.9%                       Net earnings from continuing operations $1,493.4 $1,376.5 $1,242.6 8% 11% 10% 12%               Diluted earnings per share ("EPS") from continuing operations $3.25 $2.89 $2.57 12% 12% 13% 14%n/m - not meaningful22Note 1.  Non-GAAP measuresWithin the tables above and below, we use the term "constant dollar basis" so that certain financial measures can be viewed without the impact of foreign currency fluctuations to facilitate period-to-period comparisons of business performance.  The financial results on a "constant dollar basis" are determined by calculating the current year result using foreign exchange rates consistent with the prior year.  We believe "constant dollar basis" provides information that isolates the actual growth of our operations.  Our constant dollar results are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP") and should not be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to the U.S. GAAP measures presented.The following table reconciles our reported results to adjusted results that exclude our provision for income taxes; certain interest amounts; the charges related to our workforce optimization effort; the gain on the sale of a building; and the gain on the sale of our AMD business in fiscal 2016.  We use certain adjusted results, among other measures, to evaluate our operating performance in the absence of certain items and for planning and forecasting of future periods.  We believe that the exclusion of these items helps us reflect the fundamentals of our underlying business model and analyze results against our expectations, against prior period, and to plan for future periods by focusing on our underlying operations.  We believe that these adjusted results provide relevant and useful information for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by management and improves their ability to understand and assess our operating performance.  Generally, the nature of these exclusions are for specific items that are not fundamental to our underlying business operations.  Specifically, we have excluded the impact of certain interest expense (as a result of the issuance of our $2.0 billion fixed-rate notes in September 2015 - refer to Note 8 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information), and interest income from adjusted earnings from continuing operations before interest and income taxes ("Adjusted EBIT") and have also excluded certain interest expense and certain interest income in prior years for comparability.  However, we continue to include the interest income earned on investments associated with our client funds investment strategy and interest expense on borrowings related to our client funds extended investment strategy as we believe these amounts to be fundamental to the underlying operations of our business model.  The amounts included as adjustments in the table below represent the interest income and interest expense that is not related to our client funds extended investment strategy and are labeled as "All other interest expense" and "All other interest income."  The charges related to our workforce optimization effort represent severance charges.  Severance charges have been taken in the past and not included as an adjustment to get to adjusted results.  Unlike severance charges in prior periods, these specific charges relate to a broad-based, company-wide workforce optimization effort.  Since Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted provision for income taxes, Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations, Adjusted diluted earnings per share ("Adjusted diluted EPS") from continuing operations and Adjusted EBIT margin are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, they should not be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to earnings from continuing operations before income taxes, provision for income taxes, net earnings from continuing operations and diluted EPS from continuing operations and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.  23  Years Ended % Change  June 30, As Reported Constant Dollar Basis  2016 2015 2014 2016 2015 2016 2015Net earnings from continuing operations $1,493.4 $1,376.5 $1,242.6 8% 11% 10% 12%Adjustments:              Provision for income taxes 741.3 694.2 636.6        All other interest expense 47.9 1.5 1.6        All other interest income (13.6) (10.7) (10.5)        Gain on sale of AMD (29.1) — —        Gain on sale of building (13.9) — —        Workforce optimization effort 48.2 — —        Adjusted EBIT $2,274.2 $2,061.5 $1,870.3 10% 10% 11% 12%Adjusted EBIT Margin 19.5% 18.8% 18.3%                       Provision for income taxes $741.3 $694.2 $636.6 7% 9% 8% 11%Adjustments:              Gain on sale of AMD (a) (7.3) — —        Gain on sale of building (b) (5.3) — —        Workforce optimization effort (b) 16.4 — —        Adjusted provision for income taxes $745.1 $694.2 $636.6 7% 9% 8% 11%Adjusted effective tax rate (c) 33.3% 33.5% 33.9%                       Net earnings from continuing operations $1,493.4 $1,376.5 $1,242.6 8% 11% 10% 12%Adjustments:              Gain on sale of AMD (29.1) — —        Gain on sale of building (13.9) — —        Workforce optimization effort 48.2 — —        Provision for income taxes on gain on sale of AMD (a) 7.3 — —        Provision for income taxes on gain on sale of building (b) 5.3 — —        Income tax benefit for workforce optimization effort (b) (16.4) — —        Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations $1,494.8 $1,376.5 $1,242.6 9% 11% 10% 12%               Diluted EPS from continuing operations $3.25 $2.89 $2.57 12% 12% 13% 14%Adjustments:              Gain on sale of AMD (0.05) — —        Gain on sale of building (0.02) — —        Workforce optimization effort 0.07 — —        Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations $3.26 $2.89 $2.57 13% 12% 14% 14%(a) - The tax on the gain on the sale of the AMD business was calculated based on the marginal rate in effect during the quarter of the adjustment adjusted for a book vs. tax basis difference primarily due to a previously recorded non tax-deductible goodwill impairment charge.(b) - The tax provision/benefit on the gain on the sale of the building and the workforce optimization effort was calculated based on the marginal rate in effect during the quarter of the adjustment.(c) - The Adjusted effective tax rate is calculated as our Adjusted provision for income taxes divided by our Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations plus our Adjusted provision for income taxes.24Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015 Total RevenuesOur revenues, as reported, increased 7% in fiscal 2016, despite two percentage points of combined pressure from foreign currency translation and the disposition of the AMD business in September 2015, primarily due to new business started during the past twelve months from new business bookings growth.  Refer to “Analysis of Reportable Segments” for additional discussion of the increases in revenue for both of our reportable segments, Employer Services and Professional Employer Organization ("PEO") Services.Total revenues in fiscal 2016 include interest on funds held for clients of $377.3 million, as compared to $377.7 million in fiscal 2015.  The decrease in the consolidated interest earned on funds held for clients resulted from the decrease in the average interest rate earned in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, partially offset by the increase in our average client funds balances of 2.8% to $22,418.7 million in fiscal 2016.Total ExpensesOur total expenses, as reported, increased 7% in fiscal 2016, as compared to the same period in the prior year.  The increase is primarily due to an increase in PEO services pass-through costs as well as an increase in selling and implementation expenses to support our growth in new business bookings as we experienced continued demand for additional HCM solutions, including products that assist businesses in complying with the ACA.  Total expenses also increased due to increased costs to service our client base in support of our growing revenue, and an increase in severance expenses, primarily related to our workforce optimization effort.  These increases were partially offset by the impact of foreign currency translation. Operating expenses, as reported, increased 7% in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015.  PEO Services pass-through costs were $2,336.3 million for fiscal 2016, which included costs for benefits coverage of $1,906.0 million and costs for workers’ compensation and payment of state unemployment taxes of $430.3 million.  These pass-through costs were $2,015.9 million for fiscal 2015, which included costs for benefits coverage of $1,627.1 million and costs for workers’ compensation and payment of state unemployment taxes of $388.8 million.  Additionally, operating expenses increased due to higher costs to implement and service our client base in support of our growing revenue, including products that assist with ACA compliance which contributed to our strong new business bookings over the past several quarters.  These increases were partially offset by the impact of foreign currency translation.Systems development and programming costs, as reported, increased 1% in fiscal 2016, when compared to the same period in the prior year, due to increased investments and costs to develop, support, and maintain our products, partially offset by a higher proportion of capitalized costs of our strategic projects and the impact of foreign currency translation.Selling, general and administrative expenses, as reported, increased 6% in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015.  The increase was primarily related to an increase in selling expenses to support our growth in new business bookings as we experienced continued demand for our HCM products, particularly those that are designed to assist businesses in complying with the ACA.  Selling, general and administrative expenses also increased due to $57.6 million of additional severance charges, of which $48.2 million relate to our workforce optimization effort, and a $10.7 million reversal of reserves in fiscal 2015 related to our former Dealer Services business financing arrangements which were sold to a third party.  These increases were partially offset by the impact of foreign currency translation.Other Income, net(In millions)      Years ended June 30, 2016 2015 $ ChangeInterest income on corporate funds $(62.4) $(56.9) $5.5Realized gains on available-for-sale securities (5.1) (6.8) (1.7)Realized losses on available-for-sale securities 10.1 1.9 (8.2)Gain on sale of notes receivable — (1.4) (1.4)Gain on sale of AMD (29.1) — 29.1Gain on sale of building (13.9) — 13.9Other income, net $(100.4) $(63.2) $37.225Other income, net, increased $37.2 million in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015.  The increase was primarily due to the gain on the sale of the AMD business of $29.1 million and the gain on the sale of a building of $13.9 million.Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income TaxesEarnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased 8% due to increases in revenues and expenses discussed above and includes an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of one percentage point.  Overall margin increased from 18.9% in fiscal 2015 to 19.2% in fiscal 2016 due to the gain on the sale of the AMD business, the gain on the sale of the building and decreased selling expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015.  These increases were offset by an increase in interest expense related to our September 2015 $2.0 billion senior note issuance, investments in implementation and operational resources to support our revenue growth, and the charges related to our workforce optimization effort.  Adjusted EBITAdjusted EBIT, which excludes certain interest amounts, the impact of the AMD business sale, the gain on the sale of a building and the charges related to our workforce optimization effort, increased 10% due to the increases in revenues and expenses discussed above.  Overall Adjusted EBIT margin increased from 18.8% in fiscal 2015 to 19.5% in fiscal 2016 due to lower selling expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015, partially offset by investments in implementation and operational resources to support our revenue growth. Provision for Income TaxesThe effective tax rate in fiscal 2016 and 2015 was 33.2% and 33.5%, respectively.  The decrease in the effective tax rate was due to the usage of foreign tax credits in a repatriation of foreign earnings in fiscal 2016, partially offset by the resolution of certain tax matters in fiscal 2015.Adjusted Provision for Income TaxesThe effective tax rate, adjusted for the impact of the workforce optimization effort, sale of the AMD business, and a gain on the sale of a building, for fiscal 2016 and 2015 was 33.3% and 33.5%, respectively.  The decrease in the Adjusted effective tax rate was due to the usage of foreign tax credits in a repatriation of foreign earnings in fiscal 2016, partially offset by the resolution of certain tax matters during fiscal 2015.Net Earnings from Continuing Operations and Diluted EPS from Continuing OperationsNet earnings from continuing operations increased 8% on higher earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and a lower effective tax rate, as described above.  Net earnings from continuing operations growth was unfavorably impacted one percentage point by foreign currency translation in fiscal 2016.  Diluted EPS from continuing operations increased 12% to $3.25 in fiscal 2016, as compared to $2.89 in fiscal 2015.  Diluted EPS growth was unfavorably impacted one percentage point due to foreign currency translation in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015. In fiscal 2016, our diluted EPS from continuing operations reflects the increase in net earnings from continuing operations and the impact of fewer shares outstanding, resulting from the repurchase of approximately 13.8 million shares in fiscal 2016 and 18.2 million shares in fiscal 2015, partially offset by the issuances of shares under our employee benefit plans.Adjusted Net Earnings from Continuing Operations and Adjusted Diluted EPS from Continuing OperationsAdjusted net earnings from continuing operations increased 9% in fiscal 2016 due to the increase in revenues and expenses described above and the impact of the lower Adjusted effective tax rate when compared to fiscal 2015.For fiscal 2016, our Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations reflects the increase in Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations and the impact of fewer shares outstanding as a result of the repurchase of 13.8 million shares during fiscal 2016 and the repurchase of 18.2 million shares in fiscal 2015, offset by shares issued under our employee benefit plans.26Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014 Total RevenuesDespite pressure from foreign currency translation, our total revenue increased 7% in fiscal 2015, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2014 ("fiscal 2014"), primarily due to new business started during the year from new business bookings growth.  Refer to "Analysis of Reportable Segments" for additional discussion of the increases in revenue for both of our reportable segments, Employer Services and PEO Services.  For fiscal 2015, total revenue was negatively impacted two percentage points by unfavorable foreign currency translation.  Total revenues in fiscal 2015 include interest on funds held for clients of $377.7 million, as compared to $373.4 million in fiscal 2014.  The increase in the consolidated interest earned on funds held for clients resulted from an increase in our average client funds balance of 5% to $21.8 billion in fiscal 2015, partially offset by a decrease in the average interest rate earned to 1.7% in fiscal 2015, as compared to 1.8% in fiscal 2014.  Total interest on funds held for clients was impacted one percentage point from unfavorable foreign currency translation. Total ExpensesTotal expenses increased 6% in fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to increased costs to service our expanding client base and support our growing revenue.  Total expenses also increased due to additional investments in product innovation and expenses directly related to the increase in new business bookings.  For fiscal 2015, our total expense growth decreased two percentage points from foreign currency translation. Operating expenses include the costs directly attributable to servicing our clients.  Additionally, operating expenses include PEO Services pass-through costs that are re-billable and which include costs for benefits coverage, workers' compensation coverage, and state unemployment taxes for worksite employees.  These pass-through costs were $2,015.9 million for fiscal 2015, which included costs for benefits coverage of $1,627.1 million and costs for workers’ compensation and payment of state unemployment taxes of $388.8 million. These pass-through costs were $1,736.0 million for fiscal 2014, which included costs for benefits coverage of $1,383.3 million and costs for workers’ compensation and payment of state unemployment taxes of $352.7 million.   Systems development and programming costs increased $44.2 million, in fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, due to increased costs to develop, support, and maintain our products, partially offset by a higher proportion of capitalized costs of our strategic projects.   Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $126.6 million, due to an increase in selling expenses to support our growth in new business bookings as we experienced traction from our increased focus on product development, high demand for additional HCM solutions, including products that assist businesses in complying with the ACA, improved productivity, and an improving economic backdrop in the U.S., partially offset by the impact of foreign currency translation.

Overall margin increased from 18.4% in fiscal 2014 to 18.9% in fiscal 2015.  This increase was due to our operating costs related to servicing our clients increasing slower than our revenues, partially offset by the impact of higher selling expenses to support our new business bookings.    Adjusted EBITAdjusted EBIT, which excludes certain interest amounts, increased 10% due to the increases in revenues and expenses discussed above.  Overall Adjusted EBIT margin increased to 18.8% in fiscal 2015 from 18.3% in fiscal 2014 due to our operating costs related to servicing our clients increasing slower than our revenues, partially offset by the impact of higher selling expenses to support our new business bookings.    Provision for Income TaxesThe effective tax rates in fiscal 2015 and 2014 were 33.5% and 33.9%, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate was due to adjustments to the tax liability, the usage of foreign tax credits in a planned repatriation of foreign earnings, and a change in tax law during fiscal 2015, partially offset by the resolution of certain tax matters during fiscal 2014.Net Earnings from Continuing Operations and Diluted EPS from Continuing OperationsNet earnings from continuing operations increased 11%, on higher earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and a lower effective tax rate as described above.  Net earnings from continuing operations growth was unfavorably impacted one percentage point by foreign currency translation in fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014. In fiscal 2015, our diluted EPS from continuing operations reflects the increase in net earnings from continuing operations and the impact of fewer shares outstanding resulting from the repurchase of approximately 18.2 million shares in fiscal 2015 and 9.0 million shares in fiscal 2014, partially offset by the issuance of shares under our stock-based compensation programs.ANALYSIS OF REPORTABLE SEGMENTSRevenues from Continuing Operations(In millions)  Years Ended % Change  June 30, As Reported Constant Dollar Basis  2016 2015 2014 2016 2015 2016 2015Employer Services $9,211.9 $8,815.1 $8,437.6 5% 4% 6% 7%PEO Services 3,073.1 2,647.2 2,270.9 16% 17% 16% 17%Other 1.9 69.8 67.5 n/m n/m n/m n/mReconciling item:              Client fund interest (619.1) (593.6) (549.6) n/m n/m n/m n/m  $11,667.8 $10,938.5 $10,226.4 7% 7% 8% 9% 28Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes(In millions)  Years Ended % Change  June 30, As Reported Constant Dollar Basis  2016 2015 2014 2016 2015 2016 2015Employer Services $2,867.9 $2,693.0 $2,521.2 6% 7% 7% 8%PEO Services  371.7 302.8 233.6 23% 30% 23% 30%Other (385.8) (331.5) (326.0) n/m n/m n/m n/mReconciling item:              Client fund interest (619.1) (593.6) (549.6) n/m n/m n/m n/m  $2,234.7 $2,070.7 $1,879.2 8% 10% 9% 12%Employer ServicesFiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015 RevenuesEmployer Services' revenues, as reported, increased 5% in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, despite a negative impact of one percentage point from foreign currency translation.  Revenues increased due to new business started from new business bookings, the impact of price increases, and an increase in the number of employees on our clients’ payrolls as our U.S. pays per control increased 2.5% in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015.  These increases were partially offset by the impact of client losses and foreign currency translation.  Our worldwide client revenue retention rate for fiscal 2016 decreased 100 basis points to 90.5% as compared to our rate for fiscal 2015 primarily due to elevated losses on our legacy platforms.Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income TaxesEmployer Services’ earnings from continuing operations before income taxes, as reported, increased 6% in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015.  The increase was due to increased revenues discussed above, which was partially offset by an increase in expenses of $221.9 million.
