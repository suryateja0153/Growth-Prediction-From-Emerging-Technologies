Lasers provide flexible, non-contact and high-speed ways to process and treat various materials. They are incorporated into manufacturing, medical and other systems by OEMs, system integrators and end users. Also, they are widely used for various medical applications and test and measurement systems and to transmit large volumes of data in optical communications systems. For a wide variety of applications, lasers provide superior performance and a more cost-effective solution than non-laser technologies.Lasers emit an intense light beam that can be focused on a small area, causing metals and other materials to melt, vaporize or change their character. These properties are utilized in applications requiring very high-power densities, such as cutting, welding, marking and engraving, additive manufacturing, ablation, printing, drilling, cladding and other materials processing procedures. Lasers are well-suited for imaging and inspection applications, and the ability to confine laser light to narrow wavelengths makes them particularly effective in medical and sensing applications. A laser works by converting electrical energy to optical energy. In a laser, an energy source excites or pumps a lasing medium, which converts the energy from the source into an emission consisting of particles of light, called photons, at a particular wavelength.Historically, carbon dioxide ("CO2") gas lasers and crystal lasers have been the two principal laser types used in materials processing and many other applications. They are named for the materials used to create the lasing action. A CO2 laser produces light by electrically stimulating a gas-filled tube and delivers the beam through free space using mirrors to provide direction. A crystal laser uses an arc lamp, pulsed flash lamp or diode stack or array to optically pump a special crystal. The most common crystal lasers use yttrium aluminum garnet ("YAG") crystals infused with neodymium or ytterbium. Some crystal lasers also use mirrors in free space to deliver the beam or direct the beam through fiber optics.Fiber LasersFiber lasers use semiconductor diodes as the light source to pump specialty optical fibers, which are infused with rare earth ions. These fibers are called active fibers and are comparable in diameter to a human hair. The laser emission is created within optical fibers and delivered through a flexible optical fiber cable. As a result of their different design and components, 3Table of Contentsfiber lasers are more reliable, efficient, robust, compact and easier to operate than conventional lasers. In addition, fiber lasers free the end users from fine mechanical adjustments and the high maintenance costs that are typical for conventional lasers.Although low-power fiber lasers were introduced four decades ago, their increased adoption in the last decade has been driven primarily by our improvements in their output power levels and cost, as well as their superior performance and lower cost of ownership compared with conventional lasers. We have successfully increased output power levels by developing improved optical components such as diodes and active fibers that have increased their power capacities and improved their performance. Fiber lasers now offer output powers that exceed those of conventional lasers in many categories. Also, semiconductor diodes historically have represented the majority of the cost of fiber lasers. In the past, the high cost of diodes meant that fiber lasers could not compete with conventional lasers on price and limited their use to high value-added applications. Over the last fifteen years, however, our semiconductor diodes have become more affordable and reliable due, in part, to substantial advancements in semiconductor diode technology, packaging design and increased production volumes. As a result, the average cost per watt of output power has decreased dramatically over the last fifteen years. Because of these improvements, our fiber lasers can now effectively compete with conventional lasers over a wide range of output powers and applications, and begin to compete with non-laser technologies in many applications that that did not use lasers historically. As a pioneer in the development and commercialization of fiber lasers, we have contributed to many advancements in fiber laser technology and products.Advantages of Fiber Lasers over Conventional LasersWe believe that fiber lasers provide a combination of benefits that include:•Superior Performance.    Fiber lasers provide uniform beam quality over the entire power range. In most conventional laser solutions, the beam quality is sensitive to output power, while in fiber lasers, the output beam is virtually non-divergent over a wide power range. A non-divergent beam enables higher levels of precision, increased power densities and the ability to deliver the beam over greater distances to where processing can be completed. The superior beam quality and greater intensity of a fiber laser's beam allow tasks to be accomplished more rapidly, with lower-power units and with greater flexibility than comparable conventional lasers.•Lower Cost.    The purchase price for fiber lasers is generally lower than that of YAG lasers and of many CO2 lasers. In addition, fiber lasers are less expensive to operate due to their better energy efficiency, lower required maintenance costs and faster processing speeds. Fiber lasers convert electrical energy to optical energy approximately 2 to 3 times more efficiently than diode-pumped YAG lasers or disc lasers, approximately 3 to 4 times more efficiently than conventional CO2 lasers and approximately 15 to 30 times more efficiently than lamp-pumped YAG lasers. Because fiber lasers are much more energy-efficient and place lower levels of thermal stress on their internal components, they have substantially lower cooling requirements compared to those of conventional lasers, which also improves overall energy efficiency. Fiber lasers have lower maintenance costs due to the high performance and long life of our single-emitter diodes, fiber optics and other optical components. The higher power density of the fiber laser beam also allows for higher processing speeds in many applications, which increases the operating efficiencies on a per-part basis.•Ease of Use.  Numerous features of fiber lasers make them easier to operate, maintain and integrate into laser-based systems as compared to conventional lasers, many of which require mirrors to direct the beam. There are no moving parts in fiber lasers and the beam is contained in a flexible fiber optic cable so they do not require adjustments of internal components or mirrors to direct the beam.•Compact Size.  Fiber lasers are typically smaller and lighter in weight than conventional lasers, saving valuable floor space. While conventional lasers are delicate due to the precise alignment of mirrors, fiber lasers are more durable and able to perform in variable environments.•Choice of Wavelengths and Precise Control of Beam.    The design of fiber lasers generally provides a broad range of wavelength choices, allowing users to select the precise wavelength that best matches their application and materials. As the beam is delivered through a flexible fiber optic cable, it can be directed to the work area over longer distances without loss of beam quality.Fiber amplifiers are similar in design to fiber lasers, use many of the same components, such as semiconductor diodes and specialty optical fibers, and provide many of the same advantages in the applications that require amplification.Notwithstanding the benefits offered by fiber lasers, there remain applications and processes where conventional laser technologies may provide superior performance with respect to particular features. For example, crystal lasers can provide higher peak power pulses necessary in certain applications and fiber lasers cannot now generate the deep ultra-violet light that 4Table of Contentsis used for photolithography in many semiconductor applications. In addition, CO2 lasers operate at wavelengths that are optimal for use on many non-metallic materials, including organic materials like wood.Our Competitive StrengthsWe believe that our key competitive strengths position us to take advantage of opportunities to displace traditional lasers and enable use of fiber lasers in new applications.

Our vertically integrated manufacturing, broad technology expertise and investment in inventory enable us to design, prototype and commence high-volume production of our products rapidly, allowing us to meet customer requests for quick deliveries.Our StrategyOur objective is to maintain and extend our leadership position in our industry by pursuing the following key elements of our strategy:Leverage Our Technology to Increase Sales.    As fiber lasers become more widely accepted, we plan to leverage our position as the leader in fiber lasers and our applications expertise to develop solutions for customers and increase our position in the broader laser market. We believe that our fiber lasers will continue to displace traditional lasers in many existing applications due to their superior performance and value. Over the last few years, our high-power lasers have become widely accepted in two- and three-dimension cutting, one of the largest laser materials processing applications. We plan to continue to leverage our fiber laser technology by pursuing large-scale laser applications where our fiber lasers offer improved customer value and performance. Some of the more significant applications we intend to target include: (i) joining processes 6Table of Contentsincluding laser welding and brazing, (ii) deposition technology (cladding) and additive manufacturing (also called 3D printing); (iii) ablation processes including cleaning and stripping of materials; and (iv) micro-processing, scribing and marking with high-power green lasers, ultra-fast pulsed lasers and ultra-violet ("UV") lasers now under development.Target New Applications for Lasers and Expand into Broader Markets.    We intend to expand the use of fiber lasers into additional applications in which lasers are not widely used. We believe that the advantages of fiber laser technology can overcome many of the limitations that have hindered the broader adoption of conventional lasers. Using our manufacturing scale and technological innovations, we have been successful in reducing the cost of manufacturing with lasers, which we believe has made fiber lasers a more attractive manufacturing alternative as compared to conventional lasers and many non-laser methods. We target applications where the cost, reliability, mobility, quality of the final process and speed can lead customers to adopt fiber lasers instead of non-laser solutions. Certain industry trends such as the use of high-strength steel and aluminum in automotive manufacturing and decreasing the weight of vehicles are driving the use of fiber lasers over other manufacturing methods such as stamping, non-laser welding, riveting and adhesives. Other trends, such as miniaturization of parts and electronics, contribute to the use of lasers because no other tools can work as precisely. Large scale fiber laser applications outside of materials processing are also targeted. We are developing a fiber laser projection technology platform as an alternative to xenon bulb projection platforms in cinemas and other entertainment venues. Also, we are developing new medical applications using our fiber lasers for urological and dental procedures.Expand Our Product Portfolio.    We plan to continue to invest in research and development to add additional wavelengths, power levels and other parameters while also improving beam quality, as well as developing new product lines and laser-based systems. Using our core technologies and breadth of experience, we plan to expand the wavelengths at which our lasers operate. This includes UV, orange, red, green lasers and mid-infrared lasers for fine and micro processing, projection and other novel applications. We are introducing and developing pulsed fiber lasers with ultra-short pulse durations (picosecond and femtosecond), pulsed and QCW lasers with high peak powers and mid infra-red lasers. We have introduced a line of optical processing cutting, welding and scanning heads optimized for use with our laser sources. We have also grown our product portfolio through acquisitions. In 2016, we acquired Menara Networks expanding our telecom product offering to include pluggable optical transceivers. Further, we will continue to expand sales of specialized laser-based systems to meet the specific needs of manufacturing end users whose requirements are not met by standard systems or in certain geographic areas where fiber laser systems are not currently available.Lower Our Costs Through Manufacturing Improvements and Innovation.    We plan to seek further improvements in component manufacturing processes and device assembly as well as innovation in components and device designs to improve performance and decrease the overall cost per watt for our products. As we increase our production volumes, we improve our internal manufacturing economies of scale and we believe we will be able to better negotiate price reductions with certain suppliers. We intend to leverage our technology and operations expertise to manufacture additional components in order to reduce costs, ensure component quality, ensure supply and improve product performance. We continue to manufacture more of our mechanical parts, printed circuit boards and power supplies we use and redesign certain optical components to improve quality and power capacities. We further decreased the manufacturing cost of our packaged diodes and other key components and sub-assemblies. Additionally, we have developed the capability of growing and processing crystals used in certain of our lasers. By reducing the cost per watt of our lasers and maintaining the lower operating cost of our products, we believe that we can increase laser the use of lasers in applications in which conventional lasers could not be used economically and compete well against other types of lasers.Expand Global Reach to Attract Customers Worldwide.    The acceptance of fiber laser technology has expanded in both developed and emerging markets around the world. As a result, we have increased and continue to increase our international sales and service locations to respond to our customer needs. In 2016, we established a new office in Brazil, expanded our sales capabilities in China and continued to expand our facilities in Russia, the United States and Germany to increase manufacturing capacity.ProductsWe design and manufacture a broad range of high-performance optical fiber-based lasers and amplifiers. We also make packaged diodes, direct diode lasers, laser systems and communications components and systems. Many of our products are designed to be used as general-purpose energy or light sources, making them useful in diverse applications and markets.Our products are based on a common proprietary technology platform using many of the same core components, such as semiconductor diodes and specialty fibers, which we configure to our customers' specifications. Our engineers and scientists work closely with OEMs, system integrators and end users to develop and customize our products for their needs. Because of our flexible and modular product architecture, we offer products in different configurations according to the desired 7Table of Contentsapplication, including modules, rack-mounted units and tabletop units. Our engineers and other technical experts work directly with the customer in our application and development centers to develop and configure the optimal solution for each customer's manufacturing requirements. We also manufacture certain complementary products that are used with our lasers, such as optical delivery cables, fiber couplers, beam switches, optical processing heads and chillers.LasersOur laser products include low (1 to 99 watts), medium (100 to 999 watts) and high (1,000 watts and above) output power lasers from 0.3 to 4.5 microns in wavelength. These lasers may be continuous wave ("CW"), quasi-continuous wave ("QCW") or pulsed. Our pulsed line includes nanosecond, picosecond and femtosecond lasers. We offer several different types of lasers, which are defined by the type of gain medium they use. These are ytterbium, erbium and thulium, as well as Raman and hybrid fiber-crystal lasers. We also sell fiber pigtailed packaged diodes and fiber coupled direct diode laser systems that use semiconductor diodes rather than optical fibers as their gain medium. In addition, we offer high-energy pulsed lasers, multi-wavelength lasers, tunable lasers, single-polarization and single-frequency lasers, as well as other versions of our products.We believe that we produce the highest-power solid-state lasers in the industry. Our ytterbium fiber lasers reach power levels of up to 100,000 watts. We also make single-mode and low-mode output ytterbium fiber lasers with power levels of up to 20,000 watts and single-mode, erbium and thulium fiber lasers with power levels of up to 500 watts. Our compact, durable design and integrated fiber optic beam delivery allow us to offer versatile laser energy sources and simple laser integration for complex production processes without compromising quality, speed or power.We also sell laser diode chips and packaged laser diodes operating at 8XX to 9XX nanometers. We sell our own family of high-power optical fiber delivery cables, fiber couplers, beam switches, chillers, scanners and other accessories for our fiber lasers. We are expanding our line of cutting and welding optical processing heads for use with our fiber lasers.We also make active and passive laser materials and tunable lasers in the middle-infrared region.AmplifiersOur amplifier products range from milliwatts to up to 1,500 watts of output power from 1 to 2 microns in wavelength. We offer erbium-doped fiber amplifiers ("EDFAs"), Raman amplifiers and integrated communications systems that incorporate our amplifiers. These products are predominantly deployed in broadband networks such as fiber to the home ("FTTH"), fiber to the curb ("FTTC"), and passive optical networks ("PON"), and dense wavelength division multiplexing ("DWDM") networks. We also offer ytterbium and thulium specialty fiber amplifiers and broadband light sources that are used in advanced applications. In addition, we sell single-frequency, linearly polarized and polarization-maintaining versions of our amplifier products. As with our fiber lasers, our fiber amplifiers offer some of the highest output power levels and highest number of optical outputs in the industry. We believe our line of fiber amplifiers offers the best commercially available output power and performance.TranceiversOur transceivers provide interconnect, coarse wavelength division multiplexing ("CWDM"), DWDM, and tunable-based pluggable interfaces to serve optical transmission needs from 100 meters over multimode fiber to over 1,200 kilometers. A transceiver combines the functions of a transmitter, which uses a laser and modulation to convert electrical signals into optical signals for transmission over optical fiber, and a receiver, which uses photo detectors to convert incoming optical signals into electrical signals, within a single device. These optical subsystems provide the interface for interconnecting electronic equipment including Ethernet switches, IP routers and SONET/SDH optical transport modules within telecommunications, cable multi-system operator ("MSO") and data center networks. Our transceiver product portfolio was acquired with the 2016 acquisition of Menara Networks.SystemsBesides selling laser sources, we also offer integrated laser systems for particular geographic markets or custom-developed for a customer's manufacturing requirements. We offer 2D flat sheet cutter systems and multi-axis systems for fine welding, cutting and drilling. Also we offer a welding seam stepper and picker, which is an automated and integrated fiber laser welding tool providing customers increased processing speeds, better quality and the elimination of certain clamping tools and laser safety enclosures. The seam stepper and picker, an alternative to resistance welding, are used in automotive, appliance and rail car assembly and other sheet metal fabrication. IPG also develops and sells specialized fiber laser systems for unique material processing applications as requested by customers desiring a complete laser-based solution, including orbital welding, pipe welding and remote welding. The platforms include robotic and multi-axis workstations for welding, cutting and cladding, flatbed cutting systems, and diode markers. 8Table of ContentsThe following table lists our principal product lines that generated a substantial majority of our revenues in 2016, and the principal applications markets in which they are used: Product Line Principal Markets Principal Applications   High-Power Ytterbium CW(1,000 — 100,000 Watts) AutomotiveHeavy IndustryGeneral ManufacturingNatural ResourcesAerospace •           Cutting•           Welding•           Annealing•           Drilling•           Cladding•           Brazing•           3D Printing   Mid-Power Ytterbium CW(100 — 999 Watts) General ManufacturingConsumerMedical DevicesPrintingElectronics •           Cutting•           Welding•           Scribing•           Engraving•           3D printing     Pulsed Ytterbium(0.1 to 200 Watts) General ManufacturingSemiconductorMedical DevicesConsumerElectronicsPanel Displays •           Marking•           Engraving•           Scribing•           Drilling•           Coating removal•           Cutting   Pulsed and CWGreen Lasers Microprocessing and SemiconductorSolarGeneral Manufacturing •           Annealing silicon wafers•           Thin film ablation•           Marking plastics     Quasi-CW Ytterbium(100 — 4500 Watts) Medical DeviceComputer ComponentsFine-Processing •           Welding and micro-welding•           Drilling•           Cutting metals and crystals   Erbium Amplifiers Broadband AccessCable TVDWDMInstrumentationScientific Research •           Telephony•           Video on demand•           High-speed internet•           Ultra-long-haul transmission•           Beam combining     Transceivers TelecommunicationsCable TVData Center Networking •           SONET/SDH optical transport•           Ethernet switching•           IP routingOur products are used in a broad range of applications.

Our products also address other applications, including advanced applications (approximately 3% of sales), communications (approximately 3% of sales) and medical (approximately 1% of sales).Our MarketsMaterials ProcessingThe most significant materials processing applications for fiber lasers are cutting, welding and brazing, marking and engraving and additive processes (cladding) and stripping. Other applications include additive manufacturing, micro-processing, surface treatment, drilling, soldering, annealing, hardening, and laser-assisted machining.9Table of ContentsCutting and Welding Applications.    Laser-based cutting technology has several advantages compared to alternative technologies. Laser cutting is fast, flexible and highly precise and can be used to cut complex contours on flat, tubular or three-dimensional materials. The laser source can be programmed to process many different kinds of materials such as steel, aluminum, brass, copper, glass, ceramic and plastic at various thicknesses. Laser cutting technology is a non-contact process that is easy to integrate into an automated production line and is not subject to wear of the cutting medium. We sell low, mid and high-power ytterbium fiber lasers for laser cutting. High electrical efficiency, low maintenance and operating cost, high beam quality, wide operating power range, power stability and small spot size are some of the qualities offered by IPG fiber lasers for many cutting applications, which enable customers to cut a variety of materials faster.Laser welding offers several important advantages compared to conventional welding technology as it is non-contact, easy to automate, provides high process speed and results in narrow-seamed, high-quality welds that generally require little or no post-processing machining. The high beam quality of our fiber lasers coupled with high CW power offer deep penetration welding as well as shallow conduction mode welding. In addition, fiber lasers can be focused to a small spot with extremely long focal lengths, enabling remote welding "on the fly," a flexible method of three-dimensional welding in which the laser beam is positioned by a robot-guided scanner. Such remote welding stations equipped with fiber lasers are used for welding door panels and seat backs, the multiple welding of spot and lap welds over the entire auto body frame, tailor blank welding and welding "body-in-white," which is welding pieces of metal with different thicknesses for automotive applications. Typically, mid to high-power ytterbium fiber lasers and long-pulse QCW ytterbium fiber lasers are used in welding applications. Our products are used also for laser brazing of visible joints in automobiles such as tailgates, roof joints and columns. Brazing is a method of joining sheet metal
