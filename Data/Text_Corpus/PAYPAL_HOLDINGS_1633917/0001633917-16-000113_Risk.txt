The Separation from eBayOn September 30, 2014, eBay Inc. (“eBay”) announced its intent to separate its payments business into an independent, publicly-traded company. To accomplish this separation, in January 2015, eBay incorporated PayPal Holdings, Inc. (“PayPal Holdings”) which is now the parent of PayPal, Inc. and holds directly or indirectly all of the assets and liabilities associated with PayPal, Inc.  In June 2015, the board of directors of eBay approved the separation (the "separation") of eBay's payments business through the distribution (the "distribution") of 100% of the outstanding common stock of PayPal to eBay's stockholders. PayPal Holdings' registration statement on Form 10, as amended, was declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on June 29, 2015. On July 17, 2015 (the "distribution date"), PayPal Holdings became an independent publicly-traded company through the pro rata distribution by eBay of 100% of the outstanding common stock of PayPal Holdings to eBay stockholders. Each eBay stockholder of record as of the close of business on July 8, 2015 received one share of PayPal Holdings common stock for every share of eBay common stock held on the record date. Approximately 1.2 billion shares of PayPal Holdings common stock were distributed on July 17, 2015 to eBay stockholders. PayPal Holdings' common stock began "regular way" trading under the ticker symbol "PYPL" on The NASDAQ Stock Market on July 20, 2015.Prior to the separation, eBay transferred substantially all of the assets and liabilities and operations of eBay's payments business to PayPal Holdings, which was completed in June 2015 (the "capitalization"). The combined financial statements prior to the capitalization were prepared on a stand-alone basis and were derived from eBay's consolidated financial statements and accounting records. The combined financial statements reflect our financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income and cash flows as our business was operated as part of eBay prior to the capitalization. Following the capitalization, our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of PayPal Holdings and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. The combined and consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows as of dates and for periods prior to the separation may not be indicative of what our financial position, results of operations and cash flows would have been as a separate stand-alone entity during the periods presented, nor are they indicative of what our financial position, results of operations and cash flows may be in the future. For additional information, see "Note 1—Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to our combined and consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Unless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires, references to “we,” “our,” “us,” “the Company” and “PayPal” refer to PayPal Holdings and its consolidated subsidiaries or, in the case of information as of dates or for periods prior to the separation, the combined and consolidated entities of the payments business of eBay, including PayPal, Inc. and certain other assets and liabilities that had been historically held at the eBay corporate level but were specifically identifiable and attributable to the payments business.35Table of ContentsOverviewNet revenues increased $1.2 billion, or 15% in 2015 and $1.3 billion, or 19% in 2014. The increase was primarily driven by growth in total payment volume (“TPV”) of 20% in 2015 and 26% in 2014. Operating expenses increased $1 billion and $1.1 billion, or 15% and 20%, in 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in 2015 was primarily due to an increase in transaction expense, customer support and operations expense, and transaction and loan losses. The increase in 2014 was primarily due to an increase in transaction expense, higher expenses due to additional sales and marketing programs and product development initiatives, and an increase in transaction and loan losses.Operating income increased $193 million, or 15%, in 2015 compared to 2014, and $177 million, or 16%, in 2014 compared to 2013. Non-GAAP operating income increased $327 million, or 20%, in 2015 compared to 2014 and $237 million, or 17%, in 2014 compared to 2013. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 21% in 2015,  2014 and 2013. Operating income and non-GAAP operating income increased in 2015 and 2014 primarily as a result of higher net revenues partially offset by increased operating expenses.We recorded net income of $1.2 billion in 2015, $419 million in 2014 and $955 million in 2013. The increase in net income in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily attributable to an increase in operating income of $193 million and a decrease in income tax expense of $582 million primarily resulting from the recognition of deferred tax liabilities in 2014 relating to undistributed foreign earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries for 2013 and prior years. The decrease in net income in 2014 compared to 2013 also was primarily attributable to the recognition of deferred tax liabilities in 2014 relating to undistributed foreign earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries for 2013 and prior years which resulted in an increase in income tax expense in 2014.  We recorded non-GAAP net income of $1.6 billion in 2015, $1.3 billion in 2014 and $1.2 billion in 2013. The increase in non-GAAP net income in 2015 and 2014 was primarily attributable to an increase in operating income in each of these periods. Our diluted net income per share was $1.00 in 2015, $0.34 in 2014 and $0.78 in 2013. Our non-GAAP diluted net income per share was $1.29 in 2015, $1.10 in 2014 and $0.97 in 2013.We generated net cash flows from operations of $2.5 billion in 2015, compared to $2.2 billion and $2.0 billion in 2014 and 2013, respectively. We generated free cash flow of $1.8 billion, $1.7 billion and $1.6 billion in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.The following table provides a summary of our combined and consolidated operating results for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013: Year Ended December 31, Percent Increase/(Decrease) 2015 2014 2013 2015 2014 (In millions, except percentages)Net Revenues$9,248 $8,025 $6,727 15 % 19 %Operating Expenses7,787 6,757 5,636 15 % 20 %Operating Income1,461 1,268 1,091 15 % 16 %Income Tax Expense260 842 129 (69)% 553 %Effective income tax rate17% 67% 12% **  ** Net Income$1,228 $419 $955 193 % (56)%Net income per diluted share(1)(2)$1.00 $0.34 $0.78 192 % (56)%1 On July 17, 2015, the distribution date, eBay stockholders of record as of the close of business on July 8, 2015 received one share of PayPal common stock for every share of eBay common stock held as of the record date.

We believe in providing simple, affordable, secure and reliable financial services and digital payments to help our customers around the world to achieve their financial goals. We strive to increase our relevance for consumers, merchants, friends and family to access and move their money anywhere in the world, anytime, on any platform and through any device (e.g., mobile, tablets, personal computers or wearables). We provide safer and simpler ways for businesses of all sizes to accept payments from merchant websites, mobile devices and applications, and at offline retail locations through a wide range of payment solutions. We also facilitate person to person payments through PayPal, Venmo and Xoom (acquired in November 2015).  Our combined payment solution capabilities, including our PayPal, PayPal Credit, Braintree, Venmo, and Xoom products, comprise our proprietary Payments Platform.We provide merchants and consumers with protection programs on substantially all transactions completed through our Payments Platform, except for transactions using our gateway and Paydiant products. Our gateway products include our Payflow Payments and certain Braintree products. A payment gateway links a merchant's website to their processing network and merchant account. These programs protect both merchants and consumers from loss primarily due to fraud and counterparty non-performance. Our risk management capabilities allow us to provide these protections, which are generally much broader than those protections provided by other participants in the payments industry. Most payments providers do not offer merchant protection in general, and those that do so generally do not provide protection of online or card not present transactions. As a result, merchants may incur losses for chargebacks and other claims on certain transactions when using other payments providers that they would not incur if they had used PayPal’s payments services. PayPal also provides consumer protection against losses on qualifying purchases and accepts claims for 180 days post transaction in the markets that PayPal serves. This protection is generally consistent with, or better than, that offered by other payments providers. We believe that as a result of these programs, consumers can be confident that they will only be required to pay if they receive the product in the condition as described, and merchants can be confident that they will receive payment for the product that they are delivering to the customer.Our Payments Platform and open application programming interfaces (“APIs”) are designed to allow developers to innovate with ease and to offer cutting edge applications to a large ecosystem of merchants and consumers, while at the same time maintaining the security of our customers’ financial information. We provide developers with easy to use, flexible and powerful tools that are designed to leverage our global reach and payment capabilities. Our software developer kits (“SDKs”) are specifically focused on the mobile application market and are designed to remove friction by not requiring a redirect to PayPal.com or an additional login. We are using a true “mobile first” approach to make payments simple and intuitive.37Table of ContentsInformation security risks for global payments and technology companies have significantly increased in recent years. Although we have not experienced any material impacts relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches on our Payments Platform, there can be no assurance that we are immune to these risks and will not suffer such losses in the future. See “Risk Factors-Risk Factors That May Affect Our Business, Results of Operations and Financial Condition-Our business is subject to online security risks, including security and privacy breaches.”We operate globally and in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment characterized by a heightened regulatory focus on all aspects of the payments industry.  That focus continues to become even more heightened as regulators on a global basis focus on such important issues as countering terrorist financing, anti-money laundering, privacy and consumer protection.  Some of the laws and regulations to which we are subject were enacted recently and the laws and regulations applicable to us, including those enacted prior to the advent of digital and mobile payments, are continuing to evolve through legislative and regulatory action and judicial interpretation. Non-compliance with laws and regulations, increased penalties and enforcement actions related to non-compliance, changes in laws and regulations or their interpretation, and the enactment of new laws and regulations applicable to us could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Therefore, we monitor these areas closely to ensure compliant solutions for our customers who depend on us.Impact of Foreign Currency RatesWe have significant operations internationally that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British Pound, Euro, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar, subjecting us to foreign currency risk which may adversely impact our financial results. The strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar versus the British Pound, Euro, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar, as well as other currencies in which we conduct our international operations, impacts the translation of our net revenues and expenses generated in these foreign currencies into the U.S. dollar. We generated approximately 50% of our 2015 net revenues, 52% of our 2014 net revenues and 52% of our 2013 net revenues from merchants or consumers domiciled outside of the United States. Other than the United States, the United Kingdom was the only country where we generated more than 10% of total net revenues in 2015, 2014 and 2013. During each of these periods, we have also generated more than 10% of total net revenues in the Euro zone. Because we have generated substantial net revenues internationally in recent periods, including 2015, 2014 and 2013, we are subject to the risks of doing business in foreign countries as discussed under “Risk Factors—Risk Factors That May Affect Our Business, Results of Operations and Financial Condition.” We calculate the year-over-year impact of foreign currency movements on our business using prior period foreign currency exchange rates applied to current year transactional currency amounts. While changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect our reported results, we have a foreign exchange exposure management program whereby we designate certain foreign currency exchange contracts as cash flow hedges to help minimize the impact on earnings from foreign currency rate movements. Gains and losses from these foreign currency exchange contracts are recognized as a component of transaction revenues in the same period the forecasted transactions impact earnings. In 2015, foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net revenues by approximately $345 million (inclusive of a $182 million favorable impact from hedging activities) and favorably impacted operating expenses by approximately $310 million. In 2014, foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net revenues by approximately $58 million (inclusive of a $36 million negative impact from hedging activities) and favorably impacted operating expenses by approximately $55 million. While we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to minimize the impact on earnings from foreign currency rate movements, it is impossible to predict or eliminate the effects of this exposure.Additionally, in connection with our services in multiple currencies, we set our foreign exchange rates twice per day, and may face financial exposure if we incorrectly set our foreign exchange rates or as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the times that we set our foreign exchange rates. Given that we also have foreign exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries, we have an additional foreign exchange exposure management program whereby we use foreign exchange contracts to offset the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities.  The foreign currency gains and losses on our assets and liabilities are recorded in “Other income (expense), net,” which are offset by the gains and losses on the foreign exchange contracts. These foreign exchange contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. 38Table of ContentsFinancial ResultsNet revenuesRevenue descriptionWe earn revenue primarily by processing customer transactions on our Payments Platform and from other value added services. Our revenues are classified into the following two categories: •Transaction revenues: Net transaction fees charged to consumers and merchants based on the volume of activity processed through our Payments Platform, including our PayPal, PayPal Credit, Venmo, Braintree and Xoom products.•Other value added services: Net revenues derived principally from interest and fees earned on our PayPal Credit loans receivable portfolio, subscription fees, gateway fees, gain on sale of participation interests in certain consumer loans receivable, revenue share we earn through partnerships, interest earned on certain PayPal customer account balances, fees earned through our Paydiant products and other services that we provide to consumers and merchants.Transaction revenues are generated from fees charged to consumers and merchants on the volume of activity we enable (“Total Payments Volume” or “TPV”). We define TPV as the value of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed through our Payments Platform, excluding transactions processed through our gateway and Paydiant products. Growth in TPV is also directly impacted by the payment transactions that we enable on our Payments Platform. Payment transactions are the total number of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed through our Payments Platform, excluding transactions processed through our gateway and Paydiant products. We earn additional fees on transactions settled in foreign currencies when we enable cross-border transactions  (i.e., transactions where the merchant or consumer were in different countries).Our revenues can be significantly impacted by the following: •The mix of merchants, products and services;•Mix between domestic and cross-border transactions;•Geographic region or country in which a transaction occurs; and•The amount of PayPal Credit loans receivable outstanding with consumers and merchants.Net revenues analysisThe significant components of our net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were as follows: Year Ended December 31, Percent Increase/(Decrease) 2015 2014 2013 2015 2014 (In millions, except percentages)Transaction revenues$8,128 $7,107 $5,992 14% 19%Other value added services1,120 918 735 22% 25%Net revenues$9,248 $8,025 $6,727 15% 19%Net revenues from transaction revenues increased by $1.0 billion, or 14%, in 2015 compared to 2014. Net revenues from transaction revenues increased by $1.1 billion, or 19%, in 2014 compared to 2013.  The increase in transaction revenues in 2015 and 2014 was due primarily to the growth in TPV and the growth in total number of payment transactions on our Payments Platform. Acquisitions were not material to total transaction revenue growth in 2015 or 2014. The impact of increases or decreases in prices charged to our customers did not significantly impact revenue growth in 2015 or 2014.39Table of ContentsThe following table provides a summary of our active customer accounts, number of payment transactions, TPV and related metrics: Year Ended December 31, Percent Increase/(Decrease) 2015 2014 2013 2015 2014 (In millions, except percentages*)Active customer accounts(1)179 162 143 11% 13%Number of payment transactions(2)4,928 3,964 3,261 24% 22%Payment transactions per active account(3)27.5 24.5 22.9 12% 7%Total TPV(4)$281,764 $234,635 $185,606 20% 26%Percent of cross-border TPV22% 24% 24% **  ** 1 An active customer account is a registered account that successfully sent or received at least one payment or payment reversal through our Payments Platform, excluding transactions processed through our gateway and Paydiant products, in the past 12 months.2 Payment transactions are the total number of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed through our Payments Platform, excluding transactions processed through our gateway and Paydiant products.3 Number of payment transactions per active customer account reflects the total number of payment transactions within the previous 12 month period, divided by active customer accounts at the end of the period4 Total Payment Volume or “TPV” is the value of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed through our Payments Platform, excluding transactions processed through our gateway and Paydiant products. * All amounts in tables are rounded to the nearest millions, except as otherwise noted. As a result, certain amounts may not recalculate using the rounded amounts provided.** Not MeaningfulThe growth in TPV of 20% in 2015 and 26% in 2014 was driven by growth in active accounts, a higher number of payment transactions driven by the increase in engagement from our customers and growth from our Braintree and Venmo products. TPV growth in 2015 was negatively impacted by foreign currency fluctuations due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. The growth in transaction revenues was lower than the growth in TPV and growth in payment transactions in 2015 and 2014 due to a higher portion of TPV generated by large merchants who generally pay lower rates on higher transaction volume and a lower mix of cross-border transactions. The percent of TPV generated by large merchants increased four percentage points in 2015 and three percentage points in 2014. Cross-border transactions generally provide higher revenues than similar transactions that take place within a single country or market. Net revenues from other value added services increased by $202 million, or 22% in 2015 compared to 2014. Net revenues from other value added services increased by $183 million or 25% in 2014 compared to 2013. The increase in net revenues from other value added services in 2015 was due primarily to interest and fee income earned on loans receivable outstanding from consumers and merchants that used our PayPal Credit products, revenue share earned under our credit program agreement with Synchrony  Financial (formerly GE Capital Retail Bank), and the gain on sale of a participation interest in certain consumer loans receivable that we purchased, as described further below. The increase in net revenues from other value added services in 2014 was due primarily to interest and fee income earned on loans receivable outstanding from consumers and merchants that used our PayPal Credit products. In the third quarter of 2015, we amended the terms of our credit program agreement with Synchrony Financial. As a result of the amendment, we recognized $78 million of additional revenue under the agreement during 2015. In addition, as part of the amended agreement, our obligation to purchase the portfolio of consumer loan receivables relating to the customer accounts arising out of the credit program agreement with Synchrony Financial was terminated. We retain an option to purchase the portfolio at the end of the new contract term. In the second quarter of 2015, we completed an arrangement with certain investors under which we sold participation interests in certain consumer loans and interest receivable related to our PayPal Credit products with a gross book value of approximately $708 million. As a result of the arrangement, the impact to net revenues from other value added services during 2015 was a net decrease of $35 million compared to 2014 due to the reduction in net revenues earned from interest and fees on the participation interests sold, partially offset by the gain recognized on the sale of the participation interest (inclusive of the gain of $26 million recognized on the initial sale of approximately $708 million in certain consumer loans receivable) and servicing fees. 40Table of ContentsOperating ExpensesThe following table summarizes our operating expenses and related metrics we use to assess the trend in each: Year Ended December 31, Percent Increase/(Decrease) 2015 2014 2013 2015 2014 (In millions, except percentages)Transaction expense$2,610 $2,170 $1,835 20 % 18%Transaction and loan losses809 646 502 25 % 29%Customer support and operations1,220 1,055 950 16 % 11%Sales and marketing985 998 791 (1)% 26%Product development947 890 727 6 % 22%General and administrative560 482 378 16 % 28%Depreciation and amortization608 516 453 18 % 14%Restructuring48 — — **  ** Total operating expenses$7,787 $6,757 $5,636 15 % 20%Transaction expense rate10.93% 0.92% 0.99%    Transaction and loan loss rate20.29% 0.28% 0.27%    1 Transaction expense rate is calculated by dividing transaction expense by TPV2 Transaction and loan loss rate is calculated by dividing transaction and loan losses by TPV**Not MeaningfulTransaction expenseTransaction expense is primarily comprised of the costs we incur to accept a customer’s funding source of payment. These costs include fees paid to payment processors and other financial institutions in order to draw funds from a customer’s credit or debit card, bank account or other funding source they have stored in their digital wallet. Transaction expense also includes fees paid to disbursement partners for processing and disbursement costs to enable a transaction and interest expense on borrowings incurred to finance our portfolio of loans receivable arising from our PayPal Credit funding option. We refer to the allocation of funding sources used by our consumers as our “funding mix.” The cost of funding a transaction with a credit or debit card is generally more costly than the cost of funding a transaction from a bank or through internal sources such as a PayPal account balance or PayPal Credit. As we expand the availability of alternative funding sources to our customers, a change in funding mix can increase or decrease our transaction expense rate. The cost of funding a transaction is also impacted by the geographic region or country in which a transaction occurs because we generally pay lower rates for transactions funded with credit cards outside the U.S. than in the U.S. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, approximately 45%, 48%, and 48% of TPV, respectively, was generated outside of the U.S. Transaction expense increased $440 million, or 20%, in 2015 compared to 2014. The increases in transaction expense in 2015  was primarily attributable to an increase in TPV, offset by favorable foreign currency fluctuations due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.  Transaction expense increased by $335 million, or 18%, in 2014 compared to 2013, due primarily to an increase in TPV. The impact from acquisitions was not material to our total transaction expense growth in 2015 or 2014.Our transaction expense rate in 2015 increased compared to 2014 due to higher assessments charged by payments processors and other financial institutions when we draw funds from a customer’s credit or debit card, bank account or other funding sources partially offset by cost efficiencies from our Payments Platform and a favorable funding mix. Our transaction expense rates in 2014 decreased compared to 2013 due to cost efficiencies from our Payments Platform, a favorable funding mix and a larger share of TPV in countries where we pay lower rates for transactions funded with credit cards than in the U.S. Interest expense on borrowings incurred to finance our portfolio of loans receivable, included in transaction expense, was $3 million, $7 million and $14 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.Transaction and loan lossesTransaction losses include the expense associated with our customer protection programs, fraud, and chargebacks. Loan losses include the losses associated with our loans receivable balances. We expect our transaction and loan losses to fluctuate depending on many factors, including TPV, macroeconomic conditions, the extent of our customer protection programs, the impact of regulatory changes, and the credit quality of loans receivable arising from transactions funded with our PayPal Credit products and working capital advances to selected merchant sellers. Additionally, prior to the distribution we recovered certain amounts 41Table of Contentsfrom eBay related to customer protection programs offered on eligible eBay purchases made with PayPal. These costs include the actual amount of protection losses associated with eBay's customer protection programs that we administer and fund on behalf of eBay, which are included as a reduction of transaction and loan losses. Recoveries associated with protection  losses incurred on eligible eBay purchases during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were $27 million, $43 million and $48 million, respectively. Following the distribution, we no longer administer eBay's customer protection programs or recover amounts from eBay associated with protection losses incurred on eligible eBay purchases; instead, we and eBay each independently administer our own customer protection programs. Further, our customer protection programs extend to customers’ eligible purchases on eBay and therefore we have incurred and expect to continue to incur related incremental costs associated with our customer protection programs following the distribution.Transaction and loan losses increased  $163 million or 25% in 2015 compared to 2014, and increased $144 million or 29% in 2014 compared to 2013. Transaction losses were $511 million in 2015, $408 million in 2014 and $310 million in 2013, reflecting an increase of 25% in 2015 compared to 2014, and an increase of 32% in 2014 compared to 2013. The increase in each of these periods was predominately attributable to higher TPV. Our transaction loss rate in 2015 increased compared to 2014 due to lower recoveries in 2015 associated with transaction losses incurred on eligible eBay purchases offset by improved consumer loss performance and a higher provision in the prior year from actual losses incurred. Our transaction loss rate in 2014 increased compared to 2013 due to a higher provision in 2014 from actual losses incurred.Loan losses relating to our loans receivable portfolio were $298 million in 2015, $238 million in 2014
