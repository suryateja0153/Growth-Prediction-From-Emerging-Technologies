See “Non-GAAP Financial Information” for further information on the Special Items, the impact of foreign currency and the reconciliation to GAAP reported amounts.  Key highlights for 2017 were as follows:•Net revenue increased 16%, or 15% on a currency-neutral basis, in 2017 versus 2016, primarily driven by:ØSwitched transaction growth of 17%ØCross border growth of 15% on a local currency basisØAn increase of 10% in gross dollar volume, on a local currency basis and adjusted for the impact of the 2016 EU regulation changeØAcquisitions contributed 2 percentage points of growth37ØThese increases were partially offset by higher rebates and incentives•Operating expenses increased 17% in 2017 versus 2016.  Excluding the impact of Special Items, adjusted operating expenses increased 16%, both as adjusted and on a currency-neutral basis, in 2017 versus 2016.  The impact of acquisitions contributed 6 percentage points of growth for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017.  Other factors contributing to the increase were continued investments in strategic initiatives as well as foreign exchange related charges. •The effective income tax rate increased 11.9 percentage points to 40.0% in 2017 versus 28.1% in 2016, primarily due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TCJA”).  Excluding the impact of the TCJA and other Special Items, the 2017 adjusted effective income tax rate improved by 1.3 percentage points to 26.8% from 28.1% in 2016 primarily due to a more favorable geographical mix of taxable earnings, partially offset by a lower U.S. foreign tax credit benefit. Other financial highlights for 2017 were as follows:•We generated net cash flows from operations of $5.6 billion in 2017, versus $4.5 billion in 2016.•We repurchased 30 million shares of our common stock for $3.8 billion and paid dividends of $942 million in 2017.•We acquired businesses for total consideration of $1.5 billion in 2017, the largest of which was VocaLink Holdings Limited (“Vocalink”), which expanded our capability, among other things, to process real-time account-based payment transactions.•The TCJA, enacted in 2017, will reduce the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018, imposes a one-time deemed repatriation tax on accumulated foreign earnings (the “Transition Tax”) and puts into effect the migration towards a territorial tax system.  While the enactment of the TCJA resulted in additional tax expense of $873 million in 2017, it is expected to have a favorable impact on our effective tax rate in future periods.  See Note 17 (Income Taxes) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for further discussion of the TCJA impact. Non-GAAP Financial InformationNon-GAAP financial information is defined as a numerical measure of a company’s performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different than the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”).  These non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of the following special items (“Special Items”).  We excluded these Special Items as management monitors significant changes in tax law, litigation judgments and settlements related to interchange and regulation, and significant one-time items separately from ongoing operations and evaluates ongoing performance without these amounts.•In 2017, due to the passage of the TCJA, we incurred additional tax expense of $873 million, $0.81 per diluted share, which includes $825 million of provisional charges attributable to the Transition Tax, the remeasurement of our net deferred tax asset balance in the U.S. and the recognition of a deferred tax liability related to a change in assertion regarding reinvestment of foreign earnings, as well as $48 million in additional tax expense related to a foregone foreign tax credit benefit on current year repatriations (collectively the “Tax Act Impact”).  See Financial Results of this section and Note 17 (Income Taxes) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for further discussion of the TCJA. •In 2017, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $167 million ($108 million after tax, or $0.10 per diluted share) in general and administrative expenses related to the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan subsidiaries (the “Venezuela Charge”).  See Impact of Foreign Currency of this section and Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for further discussion of the Venezuela Charge. •In 2017, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $15 million ($10 million after tax, or $0.01 per diluted share) in provision for litigation settlements expense, related to a litigation settlement with Canadian merchants (the “Canadian Merchant Litigation Provision”).  In 2016 and 2015, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $117 million ($85 million after tax, or $0.08 per diluted share) and $61 million ($45 million after tax, or $0.04 per diluted share), respectively, in provision for litigation settlements expense, related to separate litigations with merchants in the U.K.  (collectively the “U.K. Merchant Litigation Provision”).  See Note 18 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for further discussion of the Canadian Merchant Litigation Provision and the U.K. Merchant Litigation Provision. •In 2015, we recorded a settlement charge of $79 million ($50 million after tax, or $0.04 per diluted share) in general and administrative expenses, relating to the termination of our qualified U.S. defined benefit pension plan (the “U.S. 38Employee Pension Plan Settlement Charge”).  See Note 11 (Pension, Postretirement and Savings Plans) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for further discussion of the U.S. Employee Pension Plan Settlement Charge.In addition, we present growth rates adjusted for the impact of foreign currency, which is a non-GAAP financial measure.  For 2017 and 2016, we present currency-neutral growth rates, which are calculated by remeasuring the prior period’s results using the current period’s exchange rates for both the translational and transactional impacts on operating results.  The impact of foreign currency translation represents the effect of translating operating results where the functional currency is different than our U.S. dollar reporting currency.  The impact of the transactional foreign currency represents the effect of converting revenue and expenses occurring in a currency other than the functional currency.  Our management believes the presentation of the impact of foreign currency provides relevant information.Our management believes that the non-GAAP financial measures presented facilitate an understanding of our operating performance and provide a meaningful comparison of our results between periods.  Our management uses non-GAAP financial measures to, among other things, evaluate our ongoing operations in relation to historical results, for internal planning and forecasting purposes and in the calculation of performance-based compensation.Net revenue, operating expenses, operating margin, effective income tax rate, net income and diluted earnings per share, adjusted for Special Items and/or the impact of foreign currency, are non-GAAP financial measures and should not be relied upon as substitutes for measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.  The following tables reconcile our as-reported financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP to the respective non-GAAP adjusted financial measures.Year ended December 31, 2017 Operating expensesOperating marginEffective income tax rate Net income Diluted earnings per share($ in millions, except per share data)Reported - GAAP$5,87553.0%40.0 %$3,915$3.65Tax Act Impact****(13.4)%8730.81Venezuela Charge(167)1.3%0.2 %1080.10Canadian Merchant Litigation Provision(15)0.1%— %100.01Non-GAAP$5,69354.4%26.8 %$4,906$4.58 Year ended December 31, 2016  Operating expenses Operating margin Effective income tax rate  Net income  Diluted earnings per share ($ in millions, except per share data)Reported - GAAP$5,015 53.5% 28.1% $4,059 $3.69U.K. Merchant Litigation Provision(117) 1.0% —% 85 0.08Non-GAAP$4,898 54.5% 28.1% $4,144 $3.77 Year ended December 31, 2015  Operating expenses Operating margin Effective income tax rate  Net income  Diluted earnings per share ($ in millions, except per share data)Reported - GAAP$4,589 52.5% 23.2% $3,808 $3.35U.S. Employee Pension Plan Settlement Charge(79) 0.8% 0.1% 50 0.04U.K. Merchant Litigation Provision(61) 0.6% 0.1% 45 0.04Non-GAAP$4,449 54.0% 23.4% $3,903 $3.4339The following tables represent the reconciliation of our growth rates reported under GAAP to our Non-GAAP growth rates, adjusted for Special Items and foreign currency: Year Ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016 Increase/(Decrease) Net revenue  Operating expenses Operating margin Effective income tax rate  Net income  Diluted earnings per shareReported - GAAP16 % 17 % (0.5) ppt 11.9 ppt (4)% (1)%Tax Act Impact** ** ** (13.4) ppt 21 % 22 %Venezuela Charge** (3)% 1.3 ppt 0.2 ppt 3 % 3 %Canadian Merchant Litigation Provision** — % 0.1 ppt – ppt — % — %U.K. Merchant Litigation Provision** 3 % (1.1) ppt – ppt (2)% (3)%Non-GAAP16 % 16 % (0.1) ppt (1.3) ppt 18 % 21 %Foreign currency 1(1)% (1)% (0.1) ppt  – ppt (1)% 1 %Non-GAAP - currency-neutral15 % 16 % (0.2) ppt (1.3) ppt 17 % 21 % Year Ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2015 Increase/(Decrease) Net revenue  Operating expenses Operating margin Effective income tax rate  Net income  Diluted earnings per shareReported - GAAP11% 9 % 0.9 ppt 4.9 ppt 7 % 10 %U.K. Merchant Litigation Provision** (1)% 0.5 ppt (0.1) ppt 1 % 1 %U.S. Employee Pension Plan Settlement Charge** 2 % (0.8) ppt (0.2) ppt (1)% (1)%Non-GAAP11% 10 % 0.6 ppt 4.6 ppt 6 % 10 %Foreign currency 11% 1 %  – ppt 0.1 ppt 1 % 1 %Non-GAAP - currency-neutral13% 12 % 0.6 ppt 4.7 ppt 7 % 11 %Note: Tables may not sum due to rounding.** Not meaningful.1 Represents the foreign currency translational and transactional impact.Impact of Foreign Currency RatesOur overall operating results are impacted by foreign currency translation, which represents the effect of translating operating results where the functional currency is different than our U.S. dollar reporting currency.  Our operating results can also be impacted by transactional foreign currency.  The impact of the transactional foreign currency represents the effect of converting revenue and expense transactions occurring in a currency other than the functional currency.  Changes in foreign currency exchange rates directly impact the calculation of gross dollar volume (“GDV”) and gross euro volume (“GEV”), which are used in the calculation of our domestic assessments, cross-border volume fees and volume-related rebates and incentives. In most non-European regions, GDV is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to U.S. dollars using average exchange rates for the period.  In Europe, GEV is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to euros using average exchange rates for the period.  As a result, our domestic assessments, cross-border volume fees and volume-related rebates and incentives are impacted by the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar versus non-European local currencies and the strengthening or weakening of the euro versus other European local currencies.  For example, our billing in Australia is in the U.S. dollar, however, consumer spend in Australia is in the Australian dollar.  The foreign currency transactional impact of converting Australian dollars to our U.S. dollar billing currency will have an impact on the revenue generated. The strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar is evident when GDV growth on a U.S. dollar-converted basis is compared to GDV growth on a local currency basis.  In 2017, GDV on a U.S. dollar-converted basis increased 8.7%, while GDV on a local currency basis increased 8.6% versus 2016.  In 2016, GDV on a U.S. dollar-converted basis increased 5.5%, while GDV on a local currency basis increased 9.1% versus 2015.  Further, the impact from transactional foreign currency occurs in transaction 40Table of Contentsprocessing revenue, other revenue and operating expenses when the local currency of these items are different than the functional currency.In addition, we incur foreign currency gains and losses from remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities that are in a currency other than the functional currency and from remeasuring foreign exchange derivative contracts (“Foreign Exchange Activity”).  The impact of Foreign Exchange Activity has not been eliminated in our currency-neutral results (see “Non-GAAP Financial Information”) and is recorded in general and administrative expenses.  We attempt to manage foreign currency balance sheet remeasurement and cash flow risk through our foreign exchange risk management activities, which are discussed further in Note 20 (Foreign Exchange Risk Management) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II,
