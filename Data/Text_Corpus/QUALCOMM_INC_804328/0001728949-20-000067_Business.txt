Business” of this Annual Report. Seasonality. Many of our products and much of our intellectual property are incorporated into consumer wireless devices, which are subject to seasonality and other fluctuations in demand. Our revenues have historically fluctuated based on consumer demand for devices, as well as on the timing of customer/licensee device launches and/or innovation cycles (such as the transition to the next generation of wireless technologies). This has resulted in fluctuations in QCT revenues in advance of and during device launches incorporating our products and in QTL revenues when the related royalties were recognized, which prior to fiscal 2019 was when licensees reported their sales and beginning in fiscal 2019 when the licensees’ sales occurred. Our historical trends were impacted by our prior dispute with Apple and its contract manufacturers (which was settled in April 2019). Looking forward, we expect QCT revenues to be impacted by seasonal trends related to product launch timing for sales made to Apple under our multi-year chipset supply agreement. These trends may or may not continue in the future and have been impacted by the decline in consumer demand resulting from COVID-19. Further, the trends for QTL have been, and may in the future be, impacted by disputes and/or resolutions with licensees and/or governmental investigations or proceedings, including the lawsuit filed against us by the FTC.Results of OperationsRevenues (in millions)2020201920182020 vs. 2019 Change2019 vs. 2018 ChangeEquipment and services$16,298 $14,611 $17,400 $1,687 $(2,789)Licensing7,233 9,662 5,211 (2,429)4,451 $23,531 $24,273 $22,611 $(742)$1,662 2020 vs. 2019The decrease in revenues in fiscal 2020 was primarily due to:-    $4.7 billion in licensing revenues recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 resulting from the settlement with Apple and its contract manufacturers (which were not allocated to our segment results)-    $116 million in lower equipment and services revenues from our QSI segment+    $1.8 billion in licensing revenues from Huawei recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 resulting from amounts due under the settlement agreement and royalties for sales made in the March 2020 and June 2020 quarters under the new global patent license agreement (which were not allocated to our segment results)+    $1.8 billion in higher equipment and services revenues from our QCT segment+    $437 million in higher licensing revenues from our QTL segment2019 vs. 2018The increase in revenues in fiscal 2019 was primarily due to:+    $4.7 billion in licensing revenues recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 resulting from the settlement with Apple and its contract manufacturers-    $2.7 billion in lower equipment and services revenues from our QCT segment-    $451 million in lower licensing revenues from our QTL segmentCosts and Expenses (in millions, except percentages)2020201920182020 vs. 2019 Change2019 vs. 2018 ChangeCost of revenues$9,255 $8,599 $10,244 $656 $(1,645)Gross margin 61 %65 %55 %2020 vs. 2019The decrease in margin percentage in fiscal 2020 was primarily due to:-    lower licensing revenues resulting from the settlement with Apple and its contract manufacturers in fiscal 2019+    higher licensing revenues from Huawei recorded in fiscal 2020 resulting from amounts due under the settlement agreement and royalties for sales made in the March 2020 and June 2020 quarters under the new global patent license agreement2019 vs. 2018The increase in margin percentage in fiscal 2019 was primarily due to:+    higher licensing revenues resulting from the settlement with Apple and its contract manufacturers in fiscal 2019 392020201920182020 vs. 2019 Change2019 vs. 2018 ChangeResearch and development$5,975 $5,398 $5,625 $577 $(227)% of revenues25 %22 %25 %2020 vs. 2019The increase in research and development expenses in fiscal 2020 was primarily due to:+     $426 million increase driven by higher costs related to the development of wireless and integrated circuit technologies, including 5G and application processor technologies, partially offset by lower employee cash incentive program costs +    $148 million in higher share-based compensation expense2019 vs. 2018The decrease in research and development expenses in fiscal 2019 was primarily due to:-    $221 million decrease primarily driven by actions taken under our Cost Plan that concluded in fiscal 2019, partially offset by higher share-based compensation expense and higher employee cash incentive program costsIn fiscal 2018, all of the costs ($474 million) related to pre-commercial research and development of 5G technologies were included in unallocated corporate research and development expenses. Beginning in fiscal 2019, all research and development costs associated with 5G technologies were included in segment results. Additionally, beginning in fiscal 2019, certain research and development costs associated with early research and development that were historically included in our QCT segment were allocated to our QTL segment. The net effect of these changes negatively impacted QTL’s EBT by $489 million in fiscal 2019 and positively impacted QCT’s EBT by $160 million in fiscal 2019.2020201920182020 vs. 2019 Change2019 vs. 2018 ChangeSelling, general and administrative$2,074 $2,195 $2,986 $(121)$(791)% of revenues9 %9 %13 %2020 vs. 2019The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2020 was primarily due to:-    $167 million in lower litigation costs, primarily resulting from the settlement of our prior dispute with Apple and its contract manufacturers in April 2019+  $44 million in higher patent costs, primarily resulting from 5G patent filings 2019 vs. 2018The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2019 was primarily due to:-    $287 million in lower professional fees and costs, primarily driven by Broadcom’s withdrawn takeover proposal in fiscal 2018 and our then proposed acquisition of NXP Semiconductors N.V.

A significant portion of the impairment losses related to our investment in OneWeb who filed for bankruptcy in the second quarter of fiscal 2020. The decrease in interest and dividend income in fiscal 2020 was primarily driven by lower interest rates earned on interest-bearing securities. The decrease in net gains on marketable securities in fiscal 2020 was primarily driven by prior year gains resulting from the initial public offering of certain non-marketable equity investments in fiscal 2019.In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we implemented a stock repurchase program to repurchase up to $30 billion of our outstanding common stock. Stock repurchases made under this program significantly reduced the amount of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, resulting in a decrease to interest and dividend income in fiscal 2019. The increase in net gains on marketable securities in fiscal 2019 was primarily driven by gains resulting from the initial public offering of certain non-marketable equity investments.41Income Tax Expense (in millions, except percentages)The following table summarizes the primary factors that caused our annual tax provision to differ from the expected income tax provision at the U.S. federal statutory rate:202020192018Expected income tax provision at federal statutory tax rate$1,201 $1,571 $97 State income tax provision, net of federal benefit7 10 2 Benefit from foreign-derived intangible income (FDII) deduction(381)(419)— Benefit related to the research and development tax credit(125)(110)(136)Excess tax benefit associated with share-based awards(83)(27)(20)Benefit from foreign income taxed at other than U.S. rates(11)(54)(834)Derecognition of deferred tax asset on distributed intellectual property— 2,472 — Benefit from establishing new U.S. net deferred tax assets— (570)— Nondeductible charges (reversals) related to the EC, KFTC and TFTC investigations— 51 (119)Toll Charge from U.S. tax reform— — 5,236 Valuation allowance on deferred tax asset related to the NXP termination fee— — 494 Remeasurement of deferred taxes due to changes in the statutory rate due to U.S. tax reform— — 443 Other(87)171 193 Income tax expense$521 $3,095 $5,356 Effective tax rate9 %41 %N/MN/M - Not meaningfulThe 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Legislation) was enacted in fiscal 2018, which, among other things, lowered the corporate income tax rate to 21%, and as a fiscal-year taxpayer, certain provisions of the Tax Legislation became effective for us at the beginning of fiscal 2019, including FDII (foreign-derived intangible income). In response to the Tax Legislation and to better align our profits with our activities, we implemented certain tax restructuring in fiscal 2018 and 2019. As a result, beginning in fiscal 2019, substantially all of our income is in the U.S., of which a significant portion qualifies for preferential treatment as FDII at a 13% effective tax rate. Our annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 reflected a blended federal statutory rate of approximately 25%.In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, the United States Treasury Department issued final regulations on deductions for FDII, which are retroactive to fiscal 2019. As a result of these regulations, our fiscal 2020 annual effective tax rate increased by approximately 1%. In the first quarter of fiscal 2021, the United States Treasury Department issued final regulations on the foreign tax credit, which we anticipate will adversely affect our effective tax rate. The impact of these regulations, which are retroactive to fiscal 2019, has not been included in our fiscal 2020 effective tax rate. While we continue to evaluate these new regulations, we currently do not expect the adverse impact to fiscal 2019 and 2020 to be significant.As a result of the Tax Legislation, in fiscal 2019, several of our foreign subsidiaries made tax elections to be treated as U.S. branches for federal income tax purposes (commonly referred to as “check-the-box” elections) effective beginning in fiscal 2018 and 2019. As a result of making these check-the-box elections, we recorded a tax benefit of $570 million in fiscal 2019. Additionally, in fiscal 2019, the United States Treasury Department issued new temporary regulations that resulted in a change to the deductibility of dividend income received by a U.S. stockholder from a foreign corporation. As a result of this change, pursuant to an agreement with the Internal Revenue Service, we relinquished the federal tax basis step-up of intellectual property that was distributed in fiscal 2018 by one of our foreign subsidiaries to a U.S. subsidiary. Therefore, the related deferred tax asset was derecognized, resulting in a $2.5 billion charge to income tax expense in fiscal 2019.In fiscal 2018, as a result of the Tax Legislation, we recorded a charge of $5.7 billion to income tax expense, comprised of $5.2 billion related to the estimated one-time repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings and profits of U.S.-owned foreign subsidiaries (the Toll Charge) and $438 million resulting from the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities that existed at the end of fiscal 2017 at a lower enacted corporate income tax rate, which included a $135 million tax benefit in fiscal 2018 related to the remeasurement of a U.S. deferred tax liability that was established as a result of a change in one of our positions due to the Tax Legislation. Unrecognized tax benefits were $1.9 billion and $1.7 billion at September 27, 2020 and September 29, 2019, respectively. The increase in unrecognized tax benefits in fiscal 2020 was primarily due to our decision in fiscal 2019 to request a refund of Korean withholding taxes as licensees in Korea continue to withhold taxes on payments due under their licensing agreements at a rate higher than we believe is owed (which had an insignificant impact to our income tax provision). If successful, the refund will result in a corresponding reduction in U.S. foreign tax credits. We are subject to 42income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions and are currently under examination by various tax authorities worldwide, primarily related to transfer pricing. These examinations are at various stages with respect to assessments, claims, deficiencies and refunds. We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, income taxes payable and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts give rise to a revision become known. As of September 27, 2020, we believe that adequate amounts have been reserved for based on facts known. However, the final determination of tax audits and any related legal proceedings could materially differ from amounts reflected in our income tax provision and the related accruals. Segment ResultsThe following should be read in conjunction with the fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 results of operations for each reportable segment included in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 8.

Equipment and services revenues are predominantly related to sales of products used in mobile devices and mostly relate to sales of Mobile Station Modem (MSM™), radio frequency (RF), power management (PM) and wireless connectivity integrated chipsets. MSM integrated circuits include our stand-alone Mobile Data Modems and Snapdragon platforms, which include processors and modems. Approximately 575 million, 650 million and 855 million MSM integrated circuits were sold during fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Through fiscal 2020, we provided the volume of MSM integrated circuit shipments to allow management and investors to, in part, evaluate, assess and benchmark our QCT segment’s performance. Beginning in fiscal 2021, we will no longer provide MSM integrated circuit shipments since such measure is becoming increasingly less meaningful in understanding and evaluating the performance of our QCT segment, which can be impacted by other factors including changes in mix and average selling price of our MSM integrated circuits and revenues generated from products other than MSM integrated circuits, such as RFFE products, among others.2020 vs. 2019The increase in QCT equipment and services revenues was primarily due to:+    $1.6 billion in higher revenues per MSM and accompanying RF, PM and wireless connectivity chipset shipments, primarily driven by a favorable mix due to an increase in demand for 5G products+    $864 million in higher RFFE product revenues, primarily driven by an increase in demand for 5G products-    $764 million in lower MSM and accompanying chipset shipments, primarily driven by a decrease in demand due to COVID-19, lower legacy MDM sales to Apple and lower sales to Huawei, partially offset by an increase in shipments to Apple under the multi-year chipset supply agreement and an increase in demand for IoT productsQCT EBT as a percentage of revenues increased in fiscal 2020 primarily due to:+    higher revenues and gross margin, primarily driven by a favorable shift in product mix due to an increase in demand for 5G products-    higher operating expenses, primarily driven by higher research and development costsQCT accounts receivable increased by 53% in fiscal 2020 from $908 million to $1.39 billion, primarily driven by an increase in revenues. QCT inventories increased by 86% in fiscal 2020 from $1.40 billion to $2.60 billion, primarily driven by the ramp in 5G demand.2019 vs. 2018The decrease in QCT equipment and services revenues was primarily due to:-    $2.7 billion in lower MSM and accompanying unit shipments, primarily driven by lower modem sales to Apple and a decline in demand from OEMs in China-    $515 million in lower connectivity product revenues, primarily driven by a decline in demand for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth products from OEMs in China+    $552 million in higher revenues per MSM and accompanying unit shipment, primarily driven by a favorable shift in mix related to our premium-tier productsQCT EBT as a percentage of revenues decreased in fiscal 2019 primarily due to:-    lower QCT revenues43+    decrease in operating expenses, primarily driven by a decrease in the amount of research and development expense allocated to QCT in fiscal 2019 and actions under our Cost PlanQTL Segment (in millions, except percentages)2020201920182020 vs. 2019 Change2019 vs. 2018 ChangeLicensing revenues$5,028 $4,591 $5,042 $437 $(451)EBT$3,442 $2,954 $3,404 $488 $(450)EBT as a % of revenues68 %64 %68 %4 %(4 %)QTL results in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 reflected the adoption of new revenue recognition guidance that requires us to estimate and recognize QTL royalties in the period in which the associated sales occur, resulting in an acceleration of royalty revenues by one quarter as compared to fiscal 2018. QTL results in fiscal 2018 have not been adjusted for the adoption of the new accounting guidance.As a result of the settlement with Apple and its contract manufacturers in April 2019, QTL results for fiscal 2020 and the second half of fiscal 2019 included royalties from Apple and its contract manufactures. Revenues in the first six months of fiscal 2019 and all of fiscal 2018 did not include royalties from sales of Apple or other products by Apple’s contract manufacturers due to our prior dispute. Revenues of $4.7 billion recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 resulting from the settlement with Apple and its contract manufacturers were not allocated to our segment results.QTL revenues for fiscal 2020 included royalties from Huawei for sales made in the September 2020 quarter under the new long-term, global patent license agreement. QTL revenues in fiscal 2019 included $450 million of royalties due under a second interim agreement with Huawei that concluded in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. Due to our prior dispute that was resolved in July 2020, we did not record any revenues in the first three quarters of fiscal 2020 or the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 for royalties due on the sales of Huawei’s consumer wireless products. QTL revenues in fiscal 2018 included $600 million paid under an interim agreement with Huawei. Revenues of $1.8 billion recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 resulting from the settlement agreement with Huawei and royalties for sales made in the March 2020 and June 2020 quarters under the new global patent license agreement with Huawei were not allocated to our segment results. 2020 vs. 2019The increase in QTL licensing revenues in fiscal 2020 was primarily due to:+    $906 million increase in estimated sales of 3G/4G/5G-based multimode products, primarily due to new license agreements with Apple and Huawei signed in April 2019 and July 2020, respectively, partially offset by the negative impact of COVID-19 on demand for licensees’ products that incorporate our intellectual property+    $110 million increase in royalty revenues recognized related to devices sold in prior periods-    $450 million in licensing revenues recorded in fiscal 2019 resulting from the second interim agreement with Huawei -    $129 million in lower estimated revenues per unit, in part reflecting licensees entering into new 5G multimode license agreements with rights to our cellular standard-essential patents only (compared to previous licenses that also included rights to certain other non-cellular essential patents) and decreases in our per unit royalty capsQTL EBT as a percentage of revenues increased in fiscal 2020 primarily due to:+    higher QTL revenues+    lower selling, general and administrative expenses, primarily from lower litigation costs-    higher research and development expensesQTL accounts receivable increased by 4% in fiscal 2020 from $1.54 billion to $1.60 billion, primarily driven by an increase in estimated royalties for the September 2020 quarter (in part due to the new license agreement with Huawei), partially offset by scheduled payments received from Oppo and vivo for amounts due under agreements reached in fiscal 2020 related to license agreements that expired on March 31, 2020 (for which payments were withheld while good faith negotiations occurred).2019 vs. 2018QTL licensing revenues in fiscal 2019, which primarily related to royalties due on sales made by our licensees in the December 2018, March 2019, June 2019 and September 2019 quarters, decreased compared to licensing revenues in fiscal 2018, which primarily related to royalties due on sales made by our licensees in the September 2017, December 2017, March 2018 and June 2018 quarters, primarily due to:-    $757 million in lower estimated revenues per unit compared to revenues per reported unit, in part reflecting licensees entering into new 5G multimode license agreements with rights to our cellular standard-essential patents only (compared to previous licenses that also included rights to certain other non-cellular essential patents), and decreases in our per unit royalty caps-    $150 million in lower royalty revenues from Huawei under the interim agreements+    $484 million increase in estimated sales of 3G/4G/5G-based multimode products compared to reported sales of 3G/4G-based products, primarily due to the April 2019 license agreement with Apple, partially offset by a decline in unit demand and a shift in OEM share towards Huawei44QTL EBT as a percentage of revenues decreased in fiscal 2019 primarily due to:-    higher research and development costs due to an increase in the amount of research and development expense allocated to QTL in fiscal 2019-    lower QTL revenues+    lower selling, general and administrative expenses, primarily from lower litigation costs and lower bad debt expense QSI Segment (in millions)2020201920182020 vs. 2019 Change2019 vs. 2018 ChangeEquipment and services revenues$36 $152 $100 $(116)$52 EBT$(11)$344 $24 $(355)$320 2020 vs. 2019The decrease in QSI EBT in of fiscal 2020 was primarily due to:-     $248 million increase in impairment losses on other investments, of which a significant portion related to our investment in OneWeb-     $116 million decrease in revenues associated with certain development contracts with OneWeb -     $60 million decrease in net gains on investments, primarily driven by a gain in fiscal 2019 resulting from the initial public offering of certain of our non-marketable equity investments+     $50 million decrease in our share of equity method investee lossesQSI segment assets, which primarily consist of marketable and non-marketable equity investments, decreased by 20% in fiscal 2020 from $1.71 billion to $1.37 billion, primarily due to impairments of certain non-marketable investments and sale of marketable securities.2019 vs. 2018The increase in QSI EBT in fiscal 2019 was primarily due to:+     $270 million increase in net gains on investments, primarily driven by gains resulting from the initial public offering of certain non-marketable equity investments+    $91 million increase resulting from higher revenues and lower costs associated with certain development contracts with OneWeb-     $41 million increase in impairment losses on investments, primarily related to our investment in OneWebLooking ForwardIn the coming years, we expect new consumer demand for 3G/4G/5G multimode and 5G products and services to ramp around the world as we transition from 3G/4G multimode and 4G products and services. We believe that 5G will drive growth and transformation in emerging device categories and industries that will create new business models and new services, resulting from the expanding adoption of certain technologies that are already commonly used in smartphones by industry segments or applications beyond mobile, such as automotive and IoT. We believe it is important that we remain a leader in 5G technology development, standardization, intellectual property creation and licensing of 5G technologies, and to be a leading developer and supplier of 5G integrated circuit products in order to sustain and grow our business long term.As we look forward to the next several months and beyond, we expect our business to be impacted by the following key items:•The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant economic uncertainty and has led to a global recession. We expect the pandemic will continue to have a negative impact on QTL and QCT revenues in the near term based on a reduction in consumer demand for smartphones and other products. We have not experienced, and we currently do not anticipate a material adverse impact on our ability, or our suppliers’ ability, to manufacture and test our products or on our ability to provide our products to our customers. Workforce changes that we implemented in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 are expected to remain in effect in the near term. The degree to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain. See “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report, specifically the Risk Factor entitled “The recent coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has had an adverse effect on our business and results of operations, and we expect its impact will continue, at least in the near term.”•In May 2019, in United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC) v. QUALCOMM Incorporated, the district court issued an Order ruling against us and imposing certain injunctive relief. On August 11, 2020, on appeal, the Ninth Circuit reversed the district court’s judgment, vacated its injunction and vacated its partial grant of summary judgment. On September 25, 2020, the FTC filed a Petition for Rehearing En Banc. On October 28, 2020, the Ninth Circuit denied the FTC’s petition. Regulatory authorities in certain other jurisdictions are investigating and/or have investigated our business practices and instituted proceedings against us, and they or other regulatory authorities may do so in the future. Unfavorable resolutions of one or more of these matters have had and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our business, revenues, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. See “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies” and “Risk Factors” in 45this Annual Report, including the Risk Factor entitled “Changes in our patent licensing practices, whether due to governmental investigations or private legal proceedings challenging those practices, or otherwise, could adversely impact our business and results of operations.”•We have not been the sole supplier of modems for iPhone products beginning with products that launched in September 2016, and Apple is not utilizing our modems for iPhone products that launched in September 2019. We expect QCT revenues to be favorably impacted in the near-term as we anticipate a ramp in volume of shipments to support Apple’s 2020 iPhone product launches. •We expect our research and development costs will increase in the near-term primarily due to increased investment towards advancements in 5G and application processor technologies and certain other long-term initiatives, as well as an increase in share-based compensation expense.•We expect increased demand in the December quarter from certain Chinese OEMs as they position to gain device share, particularly in China. Since it will take time for us to adapt our supply chain process, we do not expect to realize the full benefit from this increased demand from OEMs.•We expect continued intense competition, particularly in China, as our competitors expand their product offerings and/or reduce the prices of their products as part of a strategy to attract new and/or retain existing customers;•Current U.S./China trade relations and/or national security protection policies may negatively impact our business, growth prospects and results of operations. See “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report, including the Risk Factor entitled “A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions.”•Commercial 5G network deployments and device launches will continue into calendar 2021 and beyond. In addition to the foregoing business and market-based matters, we continue to devote resources to working with and educating participants in the wireless value chain and governments as to the benefits of our licensing program and our extensive technology investments in promoting a highly competitive and innovative wireless industry. However, we expect that certain companies may continue to be dissatisfied with the need to pay reasonable royalties for the use of our technology and not welcome the success of our licensing program in enabling new, highly cost-effective competitors to their products. Accordingly, such companies, and/or governments or regulators, may continue to challenge our business model in various forums throughout the world.Further discussion of risks related to our business is provided in “Part I,
