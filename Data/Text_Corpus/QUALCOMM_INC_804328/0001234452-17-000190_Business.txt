Business” of this Annual Report. Seasonality. Many of our products and/or intellectual property are incorporated into consumer wireless devices, which are subject to seasonality and other fluctuations in demand. As a result, QCT has tended historically to have stronger sales toward the end of the calendar year as manufacturers prepare for major holiday selling seasons; and because QTL recognizes royalty revenues when royalties are reported by licensees, QTL has tended to record higher royalty revenues in the first calendar quarter when licensees report their sales made in the fourth calendar quarter. We have also experienced fluctuations in revenues due to the timing of conversions and expansions of 3G and 4G networks by wireless operators and the timing of launches of flagship wireless devices that incorporate our products and/or intellectual property. These trends may or may not continue in the future. These seasonal trends for QTL may be impacted by disputes and/or resolutions with licensees. Results of OperationsRevenues (in millions)      2017 2016 2015 2017 vs. 2016 Change 2016 vs. 2015 ChangeEquipment and services$16,647 $15,467 $17,079 $1,180 $(1,612)Licensing5,644 8,087 8,202 (2,443) (115) $22,291 $23,554 $25,281 $(1,263) $(1,727)The increase in equipment and services revenues in fiscal 2017 is primarily due to an increase in QCT revenues of $1.13 billion and an increase in QSI revenues of $66 million. The decrease in equipment and services revenues in fiscal 2016 was primarily due to a decrease in QCT revenues of $1.76 billion, partially offset by increases in revenues of one of our nonreportable segments and our QSI segment of $56 million and $43 million, respectively. The decrease in licensing revenues in fiscal 2017 was primarily due to the decrease in QTL revenues, the reduction to licensing revenues of $962 million related to the BlackBerry arbitration and a $103 million decrease in revenues of one of our nonreportable segments. The decrease in licensing revenues in fiscal 2016 was primarily due to the decrease in QTL revenues, partially offset by a $143 million increase in revenues of one our nonreportable segments. In fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, revenues from suppliers to Apple Inc. and from Samsung Electronics each comprised more than 10% of consolidated revenues. Combined revenues from GuangDong OPPO Mobile Telecommunications Corp. Ltd. and vivo Communication Technology Co., Ltd., and their respective affiliates, also comprised more than 10% of consolidated revenues in fiscal 2017. QCT and QTL segment revenues related to the products of these customers/licensees comprised 51%, 49% and 47% of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  41Revenues from customers in China (including Hong Kong) and South Korea comprised 65% and 16%, respectively, of total consolidated revenues for fiscal 2017, compared to 57% and 17%, respectively, for fiscal 2016, and 53% and 16%, respectively, for fiscal 2015. We report revenues from external customers by country based on the location to which our products or services are delivered, which for QCT is generally the country in which our customers manufacture their products, or for licensing revenues, the invoiced addresses of our licensees. As a result, the revenues by country presented herein are not necessarily indicative of either the country in which the devices containing our products and/or intellectual property are ultimately sold to consumers or the country in which the companies that sell the devices are headquartered. For example, China revenues would include revenues related to shipments of integrated circuits to a company that is headquartered in South Korea but that manufactures devices in China, which devices are then sold to consumers in Europe and/or the United States.Costs and Expenses (in millions)      2017 2016 2015 2017 vs. 2016 Change 2016 vs. 2015 ChangeCost of revenues$9,792 $9,749 $10,378 $43 $(629)Gross margin 56% 59% 59%    The margin percentage decreased in fiscal 2017 primarily due to the decrease in higher margin QTL licensing revenues as a proportion of total revenues, partially offset by an increase in QCT margin percentage. The margin percentage in fiscal 2017 was also negatively impacted by the reduction to licensing revenues related to the BlackBerry arbitration. The margin percentage in fiscal 2016 remained flat primarily due to the effect of $163 million in additional charges related to the amortization of intangible assets and the recognition of the step-up of inventories to fair value primarily related to the acquisition of CSR plc in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, offset by the impact of higher-margin segment mix primarily related to QTL. Our margin percentage may continue to fluctuate in future periods depending on the mix of segment results as well as products sold, competitive pricing, new product introduction costs and other factors, including disputes and/or resolutions with licensees. 2017 2016 2015 2017 vs. 2016 Change 2016 vs. 2015 ChangeResearch and development$5,485 $5,151 $5,490 $334 $(339)% of revenues25% 22% 22%    Selling, general, and administrative$2,658 $2,385 $2,344 $273 $41% of revenues12% 10% 9%    Other$1,742 $(226) $1,293 $1,968 $(1,519)The dollar increase in research and development expenses in fiscal 2017 was primarily attributable to an increase of $372 million in costs related to the development of integrated circuit technologies, including 5G technology and RFFE technologies from our recently formed RF360 Holdings joint venture, and related software products, partially offset by cost decreases driven by actions initiated under our Strategic Realignment Plan, which was substantially completed by the end of fiscal 2016. The dollar decrease in research and development expenses in fiscal 2016 was primarily attributable to a decrease of $228 million in cost related to the development of integrated circuit technologies and related software products. Such decrease was primarily driven by actions initiated under the Strategic Realignment Plan, partially offset by increased research and development costs resulting from acquisitions. The decrease in research and development expenses in fiscal 2016 also included decreases of $67 million in development costs of display technologies and $45 million in share-based compensation expense.The dollar increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2017 was primarily attributable to increases of $136 million in professional services fees, primarily related to third-party acquisition and integration services resulting from the proposed acquisition of NXP, $70 million in costs related to litigation and other legal matters and $33 million in employee-related expenses, primarily related to our recently formed RF360 Holdings joint venture, which closed in February 2017. The dollar increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2016 was primarily attributable to increases of $65 million in costs related to litigation and other legal matters, $39 million in employee-related expenses and $27 million in depreciation and amortization expense, partially offset by decreases of $36 million in share-based compensation expense, $21 million in selling and marketing expenses, $19 million in professional services and $17 million in patent-related costs.  42Other expenses in fiscal 2017 consisted of a $927 million charge related to the KFTC fine, including related foreign currency losses, a $778 million charge related to the TFTC fine and $37 million in restructuring and restructuring-related charges related to our Strategic Realignment Plan. Other income in fiscal 2016 was attributable to a $380 million gain on the sale of wireless spectrum, partially offset by net charges related to our Strategic Realignment Plan, which included $202 million in restructuring and restructuring-related charges, partially offset by a $48 million gain on the sale of our business that provided augmented reality applications. Other expenses in fiscal 2015 were attributable to a $975 million charge resulting from the resolution reached with the NDRC, charges of $255 million and $11 million for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, respectively, related to our content and push-to-talk services and display businesses and $190 million in restructuring and restructuring-related charges related to our Strategic Realignment Plan, partially offset by $138 million in gains on sales of certain property plant and equipment.

The increase in net realized gains on marketable securities in fiscal 2017 was primarily attributable to certain marketable securities that we sold to fund, in part, our proposed acquisition of NXP. The net losses on foreign currency transactions in fiscal 2017 were primarily attributable to the impact of currency exchange rate movements on certain monetary assets and liabilities of our recently formed RF360 Holdings joint venture.The increase in interest expense in fiscal 2016 was primarily due to the issuance of an aggregate principal amount of $10.0 billion of unsecured floating- and fixed-rate notes in May 2015.Income Tax Expense (in millions)      2017 2016 2015 2017 vs. 2016 Change 2016 vs. 2015 ChangeIncome tax expense$555 $1,131 $1,219 $(576) $(88)Effective tax rate18% 17% 19% 1% (2%) 43The following table summarizes the primary factors that caused our annual effective tax rates to be less than the United States federal statutory rate: 2017 2016 2015Expected income tax provision at federal statutory tax rate35% 35% 35%Benefits from foreign income taxed at other than U.S. rates(32%) (16%) (14%)Benefits related to the research and development tax credits(3%) (2%) (2%)Worthless stock deduction of domestic subsidiary— (1%) —Nondeductible charges related to the KFTC and TFTC investigations12% — —Impact of changes in tax reserves and audit settlements for prior year tax positions4% — (1%)Other2% 1% 1%Effective tax rate18% 17% 19%In fiscal 2017, we recorded charges of $927 million and $778 million related to the fines imposed by the KFTC and the TFTC, respectively, which are not deductible for tax purposes and are each attributable to both the United States and a foreign jurisdiction. Additionally, the effective tax rate of 18% for fiscal 2017 was impacted by lower United States revenues primarily related to decreased royalty revenues from Apple’s contract manufacturers and the BlackBerry arbitration. The effective tax rate of 18% for fiscal 2017 also reflected the increase in our Singapore tax rate as a result of the expiration of certain of our tax incentives in March 2017, which was substantially offset by tax benefits resulting from the increase in our Singapore tax rate that will be in effect when certain deferred tax assets are scheduled to reverse. The effective tax rate for our state income tax provision, net of federal benefit, was negligible for all years presented.The effective tax rate of 17% for fiscal 2016 reflected a $101 million tax benefit recorded discretely in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 resulting from a worthless stock deduction on a domestic subsidiary of one of our former display businesses and a $79 million benefit recorded discretely in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 related to fiscal 2015 resulting from the retroactive and permanent reinstatement of the United States federal research and development tax credit.During fiscal 2015, the NDRC imposed a fine of $975 million, which was not deductible for tax purposes and was substantially attributable to a foreign jurisdiction. Additionally, during fiscal 2015, we recorded a tax benefit of $101 million related to fiscal 2014 resulting from the retroactive reinstatement of the United States federal research and development tax credit to January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2014. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 also reflected the United States federal research and development tax credit generated through December 31, 2014, the date on which the credit expired and a $61 million tax benefit as a result of a favorable tax audit settlement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) related to Qualcomm Atheros, Inc.’s pre-acquisition 2010 and 2011 tax returns.The effective tax rate for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 also reflected tax benefits for certain tax incentives obtained in Singapore that commenced in March 2012, including a tax exemption for the first five years, provided that we meet specified employment and other criteria. Our Singapore tax rate increased in fiscal 2017 as a result of the expiration of certain of these incentives and will increase again in fiscal 2027 upon the expiration of the remaining incentives.Unrecognized tax benefits were $372 million and $271 million at September 24, 2017 and September 25, 2016, respectively. The increase in unrecognized tax benefits in fiscal 2017 was primarily due to tax positions related to transfer pricing. We believe that it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits at September 24, 2017 may increase or decrease in the next 12 months.We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions and are currently under examination by various tax authorities worldwide, most notably in countries where we earn a routine return and tax authorities believe substantial value-add activities are performed. These examinations are at various stages with respect to assessments, claims, deficiencies and refunds. We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjusts the income tax provision, income taxes payable and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts give rise to a revision become known. As of September 24, 2017, we believe that adequate amounts have been reserved for based on facts known. However, the final determination of tax audits and any related legal proceedings could materially differ from amounts reflected in our income tax provision and the related accruals.  44Our Segment ResultsThe following should be read in conjunction with the fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 results of operations for each reportable segment included in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 8. Segment Information.”(in millions)2017 2016 2015Revenues     QCT$16,479 $15,409 $17,154QTL6,445 7,664 7,947QSI113 47 4EBT (1)     QCT$2,747 $1,812 $2,465QTL5,175 6,528 6,882QSI65 386 (74)EBT as a % of revenues     QCT17% 12% 14%QTL80% 85% 87%(1)Earnings (loss) before taxes.QCT Segment. QCT revenues increased in fiscal 2017 and decreased in fiscal 2016 due to corresponding fluctuations in equipment and services revenues. Equipment and services revenues, mostly related to sales of MSM and accompanying RF, Power Management (PM) and wireless connectivity integrated circuits, were $16.31 billion, $15.18 billion and $16.95 billion in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Approximately 804 million, 842 million and 932 million MSM integrated circuits were sold during fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Equipment and services revenues increased in fiscal 2017 primarily due to an increase in revenues related to RFFE products, including $676 million from the formation of our RF360 Holdings joint venture, a $492 million increase resulting from higher shipments of connectivity products primarily related to adjacent industry segments outside of traditional cellular industries and a $469 million increase resulting from the net impact of higher-priced product mix and lower average selling prices. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $553 million primarily related to lower MSM and accompanying RF and PM unit shipments driven primarily by a decline in share at Apple, partially offset by higher demand from OEMs in China. The decrease in equipment and services revenues in fiscal 2016 resulted primarily from decreases of $1.35 billion related to lower MSM and accompanying RF and PM unit shipments and $1.14 billion from lower average selling prices and lower-priced product mix, partially offset by a net increase of $753 million in revenues related to other products, primarily related to higher connectivity shipments resulting from the acquisition of CSR in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.QCT EBT as a percentage of revenues increased in fiscal 2017 primarily due to an increase in gross margin percentage, partially offset by a combined increase of 1% in research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses primarily from our RF360 Holdings joint venture. QCT gross margin percentage increased in fiscal 2017 primarily as a result of higher-margin product mix and lower average unit costs, partially offset by lower average selling prices and higher excess inventory charges. QCT EBT as a percentage of revenues decreased in fiscal 2016 primarily due to the impact of lower revenues relative to operating expenses. QCT gross margin percentage remained flat in fiscal 2016 primarily as a result of lower average selling prices and lower-margin product mix, offset by lower average unit costs and lower excess inventory charges.QCT accounts receivable increased by 24% in fiscal 2017 from $1.46 billion to $1.81 billion, primarily due to the accounts receivable related to our RF360 Holdings joint venture and increased revenues related to integrated circuits. QCT inventories increased by 31% in fiscal 2017 from $1.54 billion to $2.02 billion due to inventories relating to our RF360 Holdings joint venture and an increase in the overall quantity of units on hand, partially offset by lower average unit costs.QTL Segment. QTL results were negatively impacted by actions taken by Apple and its contract manufacturers as well as the previously disclosed dispute with another licensee, who did not report or pay royalties due in the third or fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Revenues related to the products of Apple’s contract manufacturers and the other licensee in dispute comprised a total of approximately $1.35 billion in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2016. Additionally, QTL revenues were negatively impacted by an estimated amount in excess of $150 million related to the dispute with the other licensee who  45underpaid royalties due in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. In addition to the above, the decrease in QTL revenues during fiscal 2017 was also attributable to the recognition of revenues in fiscal 2016 relating to the termination of an infrastructure license agreement resulting from the merger of two licensees and decreased recognition of unearned license fees, partially offset by an increase in revenues per unit and higher royalty revenues recognized related to devices sold in prior periods. QTL EBT as a percentage of revenues decreased in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to the decrease in QTL revenues. QTL revenues and EBT in fiscal 2016 and 2017 also continued to be impacted negatively by units that we believe are not being reported by certain other licensees and sales of certain unlicensed products. While we have reached agreements with many licensees, negotiations with certain other licensees and unlicensed companies are ongoing, particularly in emerging regions, including China, and additional litigation may become necessary if negotiations fail to resolve the relevant issues.The decrease in QTL revenues in fiscal 2016 of $283 million was primarily attributable to decreases in revenues per reported unit and recognition of unearned license fees, partially offset by an increase in reported sales of CDMA-based products (including multimode products that also implement OFDMA) and $266 million in licensing revenues recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 due to the termination of an infrastructure license agreement resulting from the merger of two licensees. QTL accounts receivable increased by more than 100% in fiscal 2017 from $644 million to $1.74 billion, primarily due to the short payment of royalties reported in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 by, and deemed collectible from, Apple’s contract manufacturers and the timing of the collection of payments from certain of our other licensees.QSI Segment. The decrease in QSI EBT in fiscal 2017 of $321 million was primarily due to the effect of a $380 million gain on the sale of wireless spectrum recorded in fiscal 2016, partially offset by the net impact of $41 million resulting from higher revenues and costs associated with certain development contracts with one of our equity method investees. The increase in QSI EBT in fiscal 2016 of $460 million was primarily due to a $380 million gain on the sale of wireless spectrum, an increase of $47 million in net realized gains on investments and a decrease of $21 million in impairment losses on investments. Looking ForwardWe expect continued growth in the coming years in consumer demand for 3G, 3G/4G multimode and 4G products and services around the world, driven primarily by smartphones. We also expect growth in new device categories and industries, driven by the expanding adoption of certain technologies that are already commonly used in smartphones by industry segments outside traditional cellular industries, such as automotive, IoT and networking. As we look forward to the next several months and beyond, we expect our business to be impacted by the following key items:•On October 27, 2016, we announced a definitive agreement under which Qualcomm River Holdings, an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of QUALCOMM Incorporated, will acquire NXP. Pursuant to the definitive agreement, Qualcomm River Holdings has commenced a tender offer to acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares of NXP for $110 per share in cash, for estimated total cash consideration to be paid to NXP’s shareholders of $38 billion. NXP is a leader in high-performance, mixed-signal semiconductor electronics in automotive, broad-based microcontrollers, secure identification, network processing and RF power products. The transaction is subject to receipt of regulatory approvals in various jurisdictions and other closing conditions, including the tender of at least 80% of the issued and outstanding common shares of NXP in the offer (provided that the minimum tender threshold may be reduced to a percentage not less than 70% with the prior written consent of NXP). While we continue to work to close by the end of calendar 2017, the transaction may close in early 2018. We intend to fund the transaction with cash generated from our recent debt offering as well as cash held by our foreign entities and use of a Term Loan, which we expect to draw on at close. We expect that this acquisition will continue to require us to devote significant resources and management time and attention and utilize a substantial portion of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.•Regulatory authorities in certain jurisdictions continue to investigate our business practices, and other regulatory authorities may do so in the future. Unfavorable resolutions of one or more of these matters have had and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our business with remedies that include, among others, injunctions, monetary damages or fines or other orders to pay money, and the issuance of orders to cease certain conduct and/or modify our business practices. Additionally, certain of our direct and indirect customers and licensees, including BlackBerry Limited and Apple Inc., have pursued, and others may in the future pursue, litigation or arbitration against us related to our business. Unfavorable resolutions of one or more of these matters have had and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our business, including monetary damages. These activities have required and we expect that they will continue to require the investment of significant management time and attention, and  46have resulted and we expect that they will continue to result in increased legal costs. See “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies” included in this Annual Report.•We are currently in dispute with Apple surrounding what we believe is an attempt by Apple to reduce the amount of royalties that its contract manufacturers are required to pay to us for use of our intellectual property. QTL revenues and EBT in fiscal 2017 were negatively impacted as a result of actions taken by Apple and its contract manufacturers. Such contract manufacturers did not fully report and did not pay royalties due on sales of Apple products for a portion of the fiscal year. We have taken action against Apple’s contract manufacturers to compel such licensees to pay the required royalties, and against Apple. Additionally, QTL revenues and EBT in fiscal 2017 were negatively impacted by the previously disclosed dispute with another licensee, who did not fully report or fully pay royalties due in the last three quarters of fiscal 2017. We expect these companies will continue to take such actions in the future, resulting in increased legal costs and negatively impacting our future revenues, as well as our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows until the respective disputes are resolved. •We continue to believe that certain licensees, particularly in China, are not fully complying with their contractual obligations to report their sales of licensed products to us, and certain companies, including unlicensed companies, particularly in emerging regions, including China, are delaying execution of new license agreements. We have made substantial progress in reaching agreements with many companies, primarily in China. However, negotiations with certain licensees and unlicensed companies are ongoing. We believe that the conclusion of new agreements with these companies will result in improved reporting by these licensees, including with respect to sales of three-mode devices (i.e., devices that implement GSM, TD-SCDMA and LTE-TDD) sold in China. Additionally, we believe our increased efforts in the areas of compliance will improve reporting, but will also result in increased costs to the business. Litigation and/or other actions, such as those recently taken against Apple and its contract manufacturers, may be necessary to compel licensees to report and pay the required royalties for sales they have not previously reported and/or to compel unlicensed companies to execute licenses. Such litigation or other actions would result in increased legal costs.•We expect our business, particularly QCT, to continue to be impacted by industry dynamics, including:•Concentration of device share among a few companies within the premium tier, resulting in significant supply chain leverage for those companies;•Decisions by companies to utilize their own internally-developed integrated circuit products and/or sell such products to others, including by bundling with other products, increasing competition;•Decisions by certain companies to utilize our competitors’ integrated circuit products in all or a portion of their devices. For example, commencing with the iPhone 7 (which was released in September 2016), we are no longer the sole supplier of modems for new iPhone product launches, as Apple utilizes modems from one of our competitors in a portion of such devices. We expect that in the future Apple will utilize our competitors’ modems in a portion of (or potentially all) iPhones. Accordingly, QCT revenues from modem sales for iPhones declined in fiscal 2017 and may continue to decline in the future, in part depending on the extent of Apple’s utilization of competitors’ modems and the mix of the various versions that are sold. Overall QCT revenues, as well as profitability, may similarly decline unless offset by sales of integrated circuit products to other customers, including those outside of traditional cellular industries, such as automotive, IoT and networking. Apple’s dual sourcing does not impact our licensing revenues since our licensing revenues from Apple products are not dependent upon whether such products include our chipsets;•Intense competition, particularly in China, as our competitors expand their product offerings and/or reduce the prices of their products as part of a strategy to attract new and/or retain existing customers; and•Lengthening replacement cycles in developed regions, where the smartphone industry is mature, premium-tier smartphones are common and consumer demand is increasingly driven by new product launches and/or innovation cycles, and from increasing consumer demand in emerging regions where premium-tier smartphones are less common and replacement cycles are on average longer than in developed regions.•Consumer demand for 3G/4G smartphone products is increasing in emerging regions driven by availability of lower-tier 3G/4G devices. We expect the ongoing rollout of 4G services in emerging regions will encourage competition and growth, bringing the benefits of 3G/4G LTE multimode to consumers.•We continue to invest significant resources toward advancements in 4G LTE and 5G technologies, OFDM-based WLAN technologies, wireless baseband chips, our converged computing/communications (Snapdragon) chips, radio  47RFFE, connectivity, power management, graphics, audio and video codecs, multimedia products and software, which contribute to the expansion of our intellectual property portfolio. We are also investing in targeted opportunities that leverage our existing technical and business expertise to deploy new business models and enter and/or expand into new industry segments, such as products for automotive, IoT (including the connected home, smart cities, wearables, voice and music and robotics), data center, networking, computing and machine learning, among others.In addition to the foregoing business and market-based matters, we continue to devote resources to working with and educating participants in the wireless value chain and governments as to the benefits of our business model and our extensive technology investments in promoting a highly competitive and innovative wireless industry. However, we expect that certain companies may continue to be dissatisfied with the need to pay reasonable royalties for the use of our technology and not welcome the success of our business model in enabling new, highly cost-effective competitors to their products. We expect that such companies, and/or governments or regulators, will continue to challenge our business model in various forums throughout the world.Further discussion of risks related to our business is presented in “Part I,
