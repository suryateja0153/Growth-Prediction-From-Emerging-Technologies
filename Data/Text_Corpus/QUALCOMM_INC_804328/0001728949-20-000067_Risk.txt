Risk Factors” in this Annual Report. Contractual Obligations/Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe have no significant contractual obligations not fully recorded on our consolidated balance sheets or fully disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. We have no material off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Regulation S-K 303(a)(4)(ii).The following table summarizes the payments due by fiscal period for our outstanding contractual obligations at September 27, 2020 (in millions):Total20212022-20232024-2025Beyond2025NoExpirationDatePurchase obligations (1)$6,060 $5,468 $539 $53 $— $— Operating lease obligations (2)578 141 196 91 150 — Finance lease obligations (2)130 14 20 16 80 — Equity funding and financing commitments (3)185 103 1 — — 81 Long-term debt (4)22,057 476 3,890 3,067 14,624 — Other long-term liabilities (5) (6)2,807 220 472 862 631 622 Total contractual obligations$31,817 $6,422 $5,118 $4,089 $15,485 $703 (1)Purchase obligations primarily relate to integrated circuit product inventory obligations, which represent purchase commitments for raw materials, semiconductor die, finished goods and manufacturing services, such as wafer bump, probe, assembly and final test. Under our manufacturing relationships with our foundry suppliers and assembly and test service providers, cancellation of outstanding purchase commitments is generally allowed but requires payment of costs incurred through the date of cancellation, and in some cases, incremental fees related to capacity underutilization. (2)Amounts represent future lease payments. Operating and finance lease obligations include the related current portions. Operating and finance lease liabilities were included in other current liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at September 27, 2020.(3)Certain of these commitments do not have fixed funding dates and are subject to certain conditions and have, therefore, been presented as having no expiration date. Commitments represent the maximum amounts to be funded under these arrangements; actual funding may be in lesser amounts or not at all.(4)Amounts represent contractual payments of principal and interest.(5)Amounts represent contractual payments of amounts recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. Certain long-term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet, such as unearned revenues, are not presented in this table because they do not require cash settlement in the future. Other long-term liabilities as presented in this table include the related current portions, as applicable. These amounts do not include the EC fines recorded as current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. For further information regarding these fines, refer to “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.”48(6)Our consolidated balance sheet at September 27, 2020 included $1.8 billion in other noncurrent liabilities for uncertain tax positions, which primarily relate to a reduction of U.S. foreign tax credits that will occur if we are successful in our claim for a refund of Korean withholding tax (for which a $1.6 billion receivable was recorded at September 27, 2020). If we are successful in our claim for a refund, the majority of this liability will be payable when we receive the Korean tax refund, with the remainder payable over periods up to and including the last payment of the Toll Charge in January 2026. The future payments related to uncertain tax positions recorded as other noncurrent liabilities have not been presented in the table above due to the uncertainty of the amounts and timing of cash settlement with the taxing authorities.Additional information regarding our financial commitments at September 27, 2020 is provided in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 3. Income Taxes,” “Note 6. Debt” and “Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.”Critical Accounting EstimatesThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, including assumptions as to future events. By their nature, estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Although we believe that our estimates and the assumptions supporting our assessments are reasonable, actual results that differ from our estimates could be material to our consolidated financial statements. Refer to “Note 1. Significant Accounting Policies” and “Note 2. Composition of Certain Financial Statement Items” included in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for further information on our critical accounting estimates and policies, which are as follows. In addition, if the impact of changes in our critical accounting estimates are material or considered necessary to understand our results of operations for the periods presented, then such information is disclosed within this Annual Report in “
