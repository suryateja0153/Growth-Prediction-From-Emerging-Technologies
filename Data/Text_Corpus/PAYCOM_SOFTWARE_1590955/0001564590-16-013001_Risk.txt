Risk Factors  The risk factors noted in this section and other factors noted throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including those risks identified in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” describe examples of risks, uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement. If one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or if underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual outcomes may vary materially from those included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Risks Related to Our Business and Industry Our business depends substantially on our clients’ continued use of our applications, their purchases of additional applications from us and our ability to add new clients. Any decline in our clients’ continued use of our applications or purchases of additional applications could adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition. In order for us to maintain or improve our operating results, it is important that our current clients continue to use our applications and purchase additional applications from us, and that we add new clients. Our clients have no obligation to continue to use our applications, and may choose not to continue to use our applications at the same or higher level of service, if at all. In the past, some of our clients have elected not to continue to use our applications. Moreover, our clients generally have the right to cancel their agreements with us for any or no reason by providing 30 days’ prior written notice. Our client retention rates may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including the level of client satisfaction with our applications, pricing, the prices of competing products or services, mergers and acquisitions affecting our client base, reduced hiring by our clients or reductions in our clients’ spending levels. If our clients do not continue to use our applications, renew on less favorable terms or fail to purchase additional applications, or if we fail to add new clients, our revenues may decline and our business, operating results or financial condition could be adversely affected. The market in which we participate is highly competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our business, operating results or financial condition could be adversely affected. The market for HCM software is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and fragmented. We expect competition to intensify in the future with the introduction of new technologies and market entrants. Many of our current and potential competitors are larger and have greater brand name recognition, longer operating histories, more established relationships in the industry and significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. As a result, some of these competitors may be able to:        ·  adapt more rapidly to new or emerging technologies and changes in client requirements;        ·  develop superior products or services, gain greater market acceptance and expand their product and service offerings more efficiently or rapidly;        ·  bundle products and services that we may not offer or in a manner that provides our competitors with a price advantage;        ·  take advantage of acquisition and other opportunities for expansion more readily;        ·  maintain a lower cost basis;        ·  adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote greater resources to the promotion, marketing and sales of their products and services; and        ·  devote greater resources to the research and development of their products and services. Some of our principal competitors offer their products or services at a lower price, which has resulted in pricing pressures. Similarly, some competitors offer different billing terms, which has resulted in pressures on our billing terms. If we are unable to maintain our pricing levels and our billing terms, our operating results would be negatively impacted. In addition, pricing pressures and increased competition generally could result in reduced sales, reduced margins, losses or the failure of our solution to maintain widespread market acceptance, any of which could adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition. We compete with firms that provide HCM solutions by various means. Many providers continue to deliver legacy enterprise software, but as demand for greater flexibility and access to information grows, we believe there will be increased competition in the delivery of HCM cloud-based solutions by other SaaS providers. Our competitors offer HCM solutions that overlap with one, several or all categories of applications that we offer. Our talent acquisition and talent management applications compete primarily with Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc., Oracle Corporation, SAP SE and Workday, Inc. Our payroll applications, including payroll processing, compete primarily with ADP, Ceridian, Concur Technologies, Inc., Intuit Inc., Paychex, Inc., Paylocity Holding Corporation and The Ultimate Software Group, Inc. Our HR management applications compete primarily with ADP, Ceridian, Oracle Corporation,  13    Paychex, Inc., Paylocity Holding Corporation, SAP SE, and Workday, Inc. Our time and labor management applications compete primarily with ADP, Ceridian, Paylocity Holding Corporation and The Ultimate Software Group, Inc. Most of our larger competitors compete with us across multiple application categories. In addition, our HCM solution continues to face competition from in-house payroll and HR systems and departments as well as HR systems and software sold by third-party vendors. Competition in the HCM solutions market is primarily based on service responsiveness, application quality and reputation, breadth of service and product offering and price. Many of our competitors have established marketing relationships, access to larger client bases and major distribution agreements with consultants, software vendors and distributors. In addition, some competitors may offer software that addresses one or a limited number of HCM functions at a lower price point or with greater depth than our solution. Further, some potential clients, particularly large enterprises, may elect to develop their own internal solutions. If we are unable to compete effectively, our business, operating results or financial condition could be adversely affected. We have historically derived a majority of our revenues from payroll processing and our efforts to increase the use of our other HCM applications may not be successful and may reduce our revenue growth rate. To date, we have derived a majority of our revenues from payroll processing. Compared to payroll processing, our participation in other HCM applications markets is relatively new, and it is uncertain whether our revenue from other HCM applications will continue to grow. The relatively limited extent to which our other HCM applications have been adopted by our clients, and the uncertainty regarding the adoption of any new applications beyond our existing applications, may make it difficult to evaluate our business because the potential market for such applications remains uncertain. Our HCM solution may not achieve and sustain the high level of market acceptance that is critical for the success of our business. The failure to increase the use of our HCM applications and any new applications developed by us may reduce our revenue growth rate, which could adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition. If our security measures are breached, or unauthorized access to our clients’ or their employees’ sensitive data is otherwise obtained, our solution may not be perceived as being secure, clients may reduce the use of or stop using our solution, our ability to attract new clients may be harmed and we may incur significant liabilities. Our solution involves the collection, storage and transmission of clients’ and their employees’ confidential and proprietary information, including personal or identifying information, as well as financial and payroll data.  HCM software is increasingly being targeted in cyber-attacks, including computer viruses, worms, phishing attacks, malicious software programs and other information security breaches, which could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of our clients’ sensitive data or otherwise disrupt our clients’ or other third parties’ business operations.  If cybercriminals are able to circumvent our security measures, or if we are unable to detect an intrusion into our systems and contain such intrusion in a reasonable amount of time, our clients’ sensitive data may be compromised. Certain of our employees have access to sensitive information about our clients’ employees.  While we conduct background checks of our employees and limit access to systems and data, it is possible that one or more of these individuals may circumvent these controls, resulting in a security breach.   Although we have security measures in place to protect client information and prevent data loss and other security breaches, these measures could be breached as a result of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently, we may not be able to anticipate these techniques and implement adequate preventative or protective measures. While we currently maintain a cyber liability insurance policy, cyber liability insurance may be inadequate or may not be available in the future on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, our cyber liability insurance policy may not cover all claims made against us, and defending a suit, regardless of its merit, could be costly and divert management’s attention. Any actual or perceived breach of our security could damage our reputation, cause existing clients to discontinue the use of our solution, prevent us from attracting new clients, or subject us to third-party lawsuits, regulatory fines or other actions or liabilities, which could adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition. If the SaaS market develops more slowly than we expect or declines, our growth may slow or stall, and our business could be adversely affected. The SaaS market is not as mature as the market for on premise enterprise software, and it is uncertain whether SaaS will achieve and sustain high levels of demand and market acceptance. Our success depends not only on strong demand for HCM services in general, but also to a substantial extent on the widespread adoption of SaaS. Many companies have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to integrate traditional enterprise software into their businesses, and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to  14    migrate to SaaS. It is difficult to predict client adoption rates and demand for our solution, the future growth rate and size of the SaaS market or the entry of competitive products. The expansion of the SaaS market depends on a number of factors, including the cost, performance and perceived value associated with SaaS, as well as the ability of SaaS providers to address security and privacy concerns. If other SaaS providers experience security incidents, loss of client data, disruptions in delivery or other problems, the market for SaaS applications as a whole, including our solution, may be negatively affected. If there is a reduction in demand for SaaS caused by a lack of client acceptance, technological challenges, weakening economic conditions, security or privacy concerns, competing technologies and products, decreases in corporate spending or otherwise, our growth may slow or stall, and our business could be adversely affected. Any interruption or failure of our data centers could impair our ability to effectively provide our solution and adversely affect our business. We serve all of our clients from our two data centers located in Oklahoma and Texas. These locations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from severe weather, tornados, terrorist attacks, earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses or cyber-attacks. They are also subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and other misconduct. Our solution depends on the continuing operation of our data centers and any damage to or failure of our data centers could result in interruptions in our services. Any interruption in our service, including adverse changes in service levels at our data centers, could damage our reputation and, consequently, our ability to attract new clients, cause our clients to terminate their use of our solution and prevent us from gaining new or additional business from current clients, which could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. Any significant disruption in our SaaS network infrastructure could harm our reputation and expose us to significant costs. Our SaaS network infrastructure is a critical part of our business operations. Our clients access our solution through standard web browsers, smart phones, tablets and other web-enabled devices, and depend on us for fast and reliable access to our solution. In the future, we may experience disruptions in our computing and communications infrastructure. Factors that may cause such disruptions include:        ·  human error;        ·  security breaches;        ·  telecommunications failures or outages from third-party providers;        ·  computer viruses or cyber-attacks;        ·  acts of terrorism, sabotage or other intentional acts of vandalism;        ·  unforeseen interruption or damages;        ·  tornados, fires, earthquakes, floods and other natural disasters; and        ·  power loss. If our SaaS network infrastructure or our clients’ ability to access our solution is interrupted, client and employee data from recent transactions may be permanently lost and we could be exposed to significant claims by clients, particularly if the access interruption is associated with problems in the timely delivery of funds due to employees. Any significant instances of system downtime could negatively affect our reputation and ability to retain clients and sell our solution, which would adversely impact our revenues. We have also experienced significant growth in the number of clients and transactions and the amount of client and employee data that our network infrastructure supports. We seek to maintain sufficient excess capacity in our network infrastructure to meet the needs of all of our clients and their employees and to facilitate the rapid provision of new client deployments and the expansion of existing client deployments. Any errors, defects, disruptions or other performance problems with our network infrastructure could adversely affect our reputation and may result in lengthy interruptions in the availability of our solution. Any interruptions in the availability of our solution might reduce our revenues, cause us to issue refunds to clients or adversely affect our retention of existing clients, which could have a negative impact on our business or financial condition. 15    If our solution fails to perform properly, our reputation could be adversely affected and our market share could decline. Our solution is inherently complex and may in the future contain, or develop, undetected defects or errors. Any defects in our applications could adversely affect our reputation, impair our ability to sell our applications in the future and result in significant costs to us. The costs incurred in correcting any application defects may be substantial and could adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition. Any defects in functionality or that cause interruptions in the availability of our applications could result in:        ·  loss or delayed market acceptance and sales of our applications;        ·  termination of service agreements or loss of clients;        ·  credits or refunds to clients, including reimbursements for any fees or penalties assessed by regulatory agencies;        ·  breach of contract, breach of warranty or indemnification claims against us, which may result in litigation;        ·  diversion of development and service resources; and        ·  injury to our reputation. Because of the large amount of data that we collect and manage, it is possible that hardware failures or errors in our systems could result in data loss or corruption, or cause the information that we collect to be incomplete or contain inaccuracies that our clients regard as significant. Our clients might assert claims against us in the future alleging that they suffered damages due to a defect, error, or other failure of our solution. Our errors and omissions insurance may be inadequate or may not be available in the future on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, our policy may not cover all claims made against us, and defending a suit, regardless of its merit, could be costly and divert management’s attention.  Any failures in the performance of our solution could harm our reputation and our ability to retain existing clients and attract new clients, which would have an adverse impact on our business, operating results or financial condition. If we do not effectively expand and train our sales force and our support teams, we may be unable to add new clients and retain existing clients. We need to continue to expand our sales force and support team members in order to grow our client base and increase our revenues. To continue to execute our growth strategy, we must also attract and retain qualified sales, marketing and operational personnel capable of supporting a larger and more diverse client base.  Identifying and recruiting qualified personnel and training them in the use of our applications requires significant time, expense and attention and it can take a substantial amount of time before our sales representatives and support team members are fully-trained and productive. We may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the markets where we currently, or intend in the future to do business, and our recent hires and planned hires may not achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time or become as productive as we expect. If our expansion efforts are unsuccessful or do not generate a corresponding increase in revenues, our business, operating results or financial condition could be adversely affected. If we are not able to develop enhancements and new applications, keep pace with technological developments or respond to future disruptive technologies, we might not remain competitive and our business could be adversely affected. Our future success will depend on our ability to adapt and innovate. To attract new clients and increase revenues from existing clients, we need to enhance, add new features to and improve our existing applications and introduce new applications. The success of any enhancements or new features and applications depends on several factors, including timely completion, introduction and market acceptance. We may expend significant time and resources developing and pursuing sales of a particular enhancement or application that may not result in revenues in the anticipated time frame or at all, or may not result in revenue growth sufficient to offset increased expenses. If we are unable to successfully develop enhancements, new features or new applications to meet client needs, our business and operating results could be adversely affected. In addition, because our applications are designed to operate on a variety of network, hardware and software platforms using Internet tools and protocols, we will need to continuously modify and enhance our applications to keep pace with changes in Internet-related hardware, software, communication, browser and database technologies. If we are unable to respond in a timely and cost-effective manner to these rapid technological developments, our current and future applications may become less marketable and less competitive or even obsolete. Our success is also subject to the risk of future disruptive technologies. If new technologies emerge that are able to deliver HCM solutions at lower prices, more efficiently or more conveniently, such technologies could adversely impact our ability to compete. 16    The market for our solution among large companies may be limited if these companies demand customized features and functions that we do not offer. Prospective clients, especially larger companies, may require customized features and functions unique to their business processes that we do not offer. In order to ensure we meet these requirements, we may devote a significant amount of support and services resources to larger prospective clients, increasing the cost and time required to complete sales with no guarantee that these prospective clients will adopt our solution. Further, we may not be successful in implementing any customized features or functions. If prospective clients require customized features or functions that we do not offer, or that would be difficult for them to deploy themselves, the market for our solution will be more limited and our business could be adversely affected. Our business and operations are experiencing rapid growth and organizational change. If we fail to manage such growth and change effectively, we may be unable to execute our business plan, maintain high levels of service or adequately address competitive challenges. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, rapid growth in our headcount and operations, which has placed, and may continue to place, significant demands on our management, operational and financial resources. For example, our headcount has grown from 523 employees as of December 31, 2011 to 1,461 employees as of December 31, 2015 and we have expanded from 20 sales teams as of December 31, 2011 to 42 sales teams as of January 31, 2016. We have also experienced significant growth in the number of clients and transactions and the amount of client and employee data that our infrastructure supports. Finally, our organizational structure and recording systems and procedures are becoming more complex as we improve our operational, financial and management controls. Our success will depend in part on our ability to manage this growth and organizational change effectively. To manage the expected growth of our headcount and operations, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures. Our ability to add additional offices may be constrained by the willingness and availability of qualified personnel to help staff and manage any new offices. The failure to effectively manage growth could result in difficulties or delays in obtaining clients, selling additional applications to our clients, declines in quality or client satisfaction of our applications, increases in costs, and difficulties in introducing new applications or other operational difficulties, any of which could adversely affect our business by impairing our ability to retain and attract clients or sell additional applications to our existing clients. We may encounter long sales cycles with larger prospective clients, which could adversely affect our operating results in a given period. We believe larger employers represent a substantial opportunity to increase the number of clients we serve and to increase our revenue per client. To further capitalize on this opportunity, we intend to pursue larger businesses opportunistically within our target client size range where our current sales model is effective. As we target our sales efforts at larger clients, we will face longer sales cycles and less predictability in completing some of our sales. In the large enterprise market, the clients’ decision to use our applications may be an enterprise-wide decision and, therefore, these types of sales will require us to provide greater levels of education regarding the use and benefits of our applications. In addition, our target clients may prefer to purchase applications that are critical to their business from one of our larger, more established competitors. Our typical sales cycles are 30 to 90 days and we expect that this sales cycle may continue or increase as we pursue larger clients. Longer sales cycles could cause our operating and financial results to suffer in a given period. Our business, operating results or financial condition could be adversely affected if our clients are not satisfied with our deployment or technical support services. Our business depends on our ability to satisfy our clients, both with respect to our applications and the technical support provided to help clients use the applications that address the needs of their businesses. We use our in-house deployment personnel to implement and configure our solution and provide support to our clients. If a client is not satisfied with the quality of our solution or the applications delivered or the support provided, we could incur additional costs to address the situation, our profitability might be negatively affected, and the client’s dissatisfaction with our deployment service could damage our ability to sell additional applications to that client. In addition, our sales process is highly dependent on the reputation of our solution and applications and on positive recommendations from our existing clients. Any failure to maintain high-quality technical support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality technical support, could adversely affect our reputation, our ability to sell our applications to existing and prospective clients, and, as a result, our business, operating results or financial condition. 17    If we fail to retain key employees and recruit qualified personnel, our business could be adversely affected. We believe that our success depends on the continued services of our senior management and other key employees, including Chad Richison, Craig E. Boelte, Jeffrey D. York, William X. Kerber III and Stacey Pezold. In addition, because our future success is dependent on our ability to continue to enhance and introduce new applications, we are heavily dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified software developers and IT personnel with the requisite education, background and industry experience. The loss of the services of a significant number of our developers could be disruptive to our development efforts or business relationships. In addition, if any of our key employees joins a competitor or decides to otherwise compete with us, we may experience a material disruption of our operations and development plans, which may adversely affect our business by causing us to lose clients, increase operating expenses or divert management’s attention to recruit replacements for the departed key employees. Our financial results may fluctuate due to many factors, some of which may be beyond our control. Our results of operations, including the levels of our revenues, costs of revenues, administrative expenses, operating income, cash flow and deferred revenue, may vary significantly in the future and the results of any one period should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Fluctuations in our financial results may negatively impact the value of our common stock.  Our financial results may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, and as a result, may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business. Factors that may cause our financial results to fluctuate from period to period include, without limitation:        ·  our ability to attract new clients or sell additional applications to our existing clients;        ·  the number of new clients and their employees, as compared to the number of existing clients and their employees in a particular period;        ·  the mix of clients between small, mid-sized and large organizations;        ·  the extent to which we retain existing clients and the expansion or contraction of our relationships with them;        ·  the mix of applications sold during a period;        ·  changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors;        ·  seasonal factors affecting payroll processing, demand for our applications or potential clients’ purchasing decisions;        ·  the amount and timing of operating expenses, including those related to the maintenance and expansion of our business, operations and infrastructure;        ·  the timing and success of new applications introduced by us and the timing of expenses related to the development of new applications and technologies;        ·  the timing and success of current and new competitive products and services by our competitors;        ·  economic conditions affecting our clients, including their ability to outsource HCM solutions and hire employees;        ·  other changes in the competitive dynamics of our industry, including consolidation among competitors or clients;        ·  our ability to manage our existing business and future growth, including expenses related to our data centers and the expansion of such data centers and the addition of new offices;        ·  the effects and expenses of acquisition of third-party technologies or businesses and any potential future charges for impairment of goodwill resulting from those acquisitions;        ·  network outages or security breaches; and        ·  general economic, industry and market conditions. Certain of our operating results and financial metrics are difficult to predict as a result of seasonality. We have historically experienced seasonality in our revenues because a significant portion of our recurring revenues relate to the annual processing of payroll forms such as Form W-2 and Form 1099. Because these forms are typically processed in the first quarter of the year, first quarter revenues are generally higher than subsequent quarters. We also anticipate that ACA-related filings, which will generally be due in the first quarter of the year, will amplify the seasonal nature of our revenues.  We expect this seasonality to continue in the future, which may cause fluctuations in certain of our operating results and financial metrics, and thus make such results and metrics difficult to predict. 18    If we fail to adequately protect our proprietary rights, our competitive advantage could be impaired and we may lose valuable assets, generate reduced revenue or incur costly litigation to protect our rights. Our success is dependent in part upon our intellectual property. We rely on a combination of copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to establish and to protect our intellectual property rights. However, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may be inadequate. We will not be able to protect our intellectual property if we are unable to enforce our rights or if we do not detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property. Despite our precautions, it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy our applications and use information that we regard as proprietary to create products or services that compete with ours. We may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property. We have been involved in litigation in the past and litigation may be necessary in the future to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights and to protect our trade secrets. Such litigation could be costly, time-consuming and distracting to management and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property. Furthermore, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. We may not be able to secure, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights or control access to, and the distribution of, our solution and proprietary information, which could affect our business. We may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights. Considerable intellectual property development activity exists in our industry, and we expect that software developers will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of applications
