Business Unless we state otherwise or the context otherwise requires, the terms “Paycom,” “we,” “us,” “our” and the “Company” refer to Paycom Software, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries.   Overview We are a leading provider of a comprehensive, cloud-based HCM software solution delivered as SaaS. We provide functionality and data analytics that businesses need to manage the complete employment life cycle from recruitment to retirement. Our solution requires virtually no customization and is based on a core system of record maintained in a single database for all HCM functions, including talent acquisition, time and labor management, payroll, talent management and human resources (“HR”) management applications. Our user-friendly software allows for easy adoption of our solution by employees, enabling self-management of their HCM activities in the cloud, which reduces the administrative burden on employers and increases employee productivity. Organizations need sophisticated, flexible and intuitive applications that can quickly adapt to their evolving HCM requirements, streamline their HR processes and systems and enable them to control costs. We believe that the HCM needs of most organizations are currently served either by multiple providers in an attempt to replicate a comprehensive SaaS product or, to a lesser extent, by legacy providers offering outdated on-premise products.  These approaches often result in challenges with system integration and data integrity, low scalability, high costs, extended delivery times and large up-front capital requirements. Because our solution was developed in-house and is based on a single platform, there is no need to integrate, update or access multiple databases, which are common issues with competitor offerings that use multiple third-party systems in order to link together their HCM offerings. Additionally, our solution maintains data integrity for accurate, actionable and real-time analytics and business intelligence and helps clients minimize the risk of compliance errors due to inaccurate or missing information. We deliver feature-rich applications while maintaining excellence in information security and quality management standards as evidenced by our International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) certifications.  We sell our solution directly through our internally trained, client-focused and highly skilled sales force based in offices across the United States. As a part of our client retention effort, a specialist within a dedicated team is assigned to each client to provide industry-leading, personalized service. We have over 20,000 clients, none of which constituted more than one-half of one percent of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017. We believe that as a result of our focus on client retention, we enjoy high client satisfaction as evidenced by an annual revenue retention rate of 91% from existing clients for each of the three years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. We believe our revenue retention rate understates our client loyalty because this rate also includes former clients that were acquired or otherwise ceased operations. 1      We were founded in 1998. Since our founding, we have focused on providing an innovative SaaS HCM solution. As of December 31, 2017, we had 2,548 employees across the United States. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, our revenues were $433.0 million, $329.1 million and $224.7 million, respectively, representing year-over-year growth in revenues of approximately 32% and 47%, respectively. We currently derive the majority of our revenues from payroll processing. We are able to determine revenues from payroll processing because all of our clients are required to utilize our payroll application in order to access our other applications. We generally do not separately track our revenues across our other applications because we often sell applications in various groupings and configurations for a single price. We realized net income of $66.8 million, $43.8 million and $20.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Paycom Solution We offer an end-to-end SaaS HCM solution that provides our clients and their employees with immediate access to accurate and secure information and analytics at any time from any location where internet is available. We believe that our solution delivers the following benefits: Comprehensive HCM Solution Our solution offers functionality that manages the entire employment life cycle for employers and employees, from recruitment to retirement. Our user-friendly applications streamline client processes and provide clients and their employees with the ability to directly access and manage administrative processes, including applications that identify candidates, on-board employees, manage time and labor, administer payroll deductions and benefits, manage performance, terminate employees and administer post-termination health benefits such as COBRA. The widespread employee usage of our applications helps further integrate our solution into the administrative processes of our clients. Our solution also has the advantage of being built in-house by our highly trained and skilled team of software developers, thereby minimizing data integrity issues across applications. Core System of Record Our solution is based on a core system of record that contains payroll and HR information in one convenient database, thereby reducing costs and eliminating the need for multiple software products and vendors and the maintenance of employee data in numerous databases. This core system of record enables our clients to input employee data one time and enjoy seamless functionality across our applications. When a revision is made to the file of an employee, all appropriate personnel have access to the change in real time. In addition, our core system of record helps clients minimize the risk of compliance errors due to inaccurate or missing information that results from maintaining multiple databases. Through accurate tracking and management of employee payroll and other HR data, such information can be compiled for comprehensive and consistent reporting for our clients. Data Analytics and Business Intelligence Our solution’s core system of record allows clients to strategically analyze comprehensive and accurate employee information to make informed business decisions based upon actionable, real-time analytics provided through our client dashboard. This functionality helps our clients operate with a more complete and accurate picture of their organization, as our solution’s embedded analytics capture the content and context of everyday business events, facilitating fast and informed decision-making from any location. These tools help clients reduce administrative and operational costs and better manage talent. Enhanced Employee Experience  The employees of our clients also benefit from our HCM applications. As workforces transition from technology-savvy to technology-dependent, employees expect mobile technology and the resources necessary to readily access information and control their professional development. Through our employee self-service technology, employees can view real-time HR information, including pay stubs, W-2s and benefits information, as well as manage their schedules and vacation time and update W-4 contact information. Our mobile apps – available on both the App Store and Google Play – make it easier for employees to access their self-service information.  Our apps have fingerprint and facial recognition capabilities, aiding employers in their efforts to engage technology-savvy workers.  Our system also allows employers to engage their workforce through learning management courses and training paths, surveys and performance goals and reviews. Personalized Support Provided by Trained Personnel Our applications are supported by one-on-one personal assistance from trained specialists. Service specialists are assigned to specific clients and are trained across all of our applications, ensuring they provide comprehensive, expert-level service. Our client service is ISO 9001:2008 certified on the basis of its quality and consistency. We strive to provide our clients with high levels of service and support to ensure their continued use of our solution for all of their HCM needs. We have maintained high client satisfaction, as evidenced by an annual revenue retention rate of 91% from existing clients for each of the three years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. 2      Software-as-a-Service Delivery Model Our SaaS delivery model allows clients with geographically dispersed and mobile workforces to operate more efficiently, and allows these clients to implement, access and use our client-oriented internet solution on demand and remotely through standard web browsers, smart phones, tablets and other web-enabled devices. Our SaaS solution reduces the time, risk, headcount and costs associated with installing and maintaining applications for on-premise products within the information technology (“IT”) infrastructure of our clients. Secure Cloud-Based Architecture Our cloud-based architecture allows our solution to be implemented remotely with minimal client interaction. Updates such as software enhancements and newly developed applications can be deployed without client interaction, disruption or involvement, allowing our clients to make a smaller investment in hardware, personnel, implementation time and consulting. Additionally, we own and maintain all of the infrastructure technology to host our solution and to maximize system availability for clients. Our focus and investment in technology and data security has been recognized with ISO/IEC 27001:2013 certified security standards that provide our clients with a “best-in-class” level of data security. Scalability to Grow with our Clients Our solution is highly scalable. We serve a diversified client base ranging in size from one employee to many thousands of employees, although our target client size range is 50 to 2,000 employees. We calculate the number of clients’ employees based on parent company grouping. Our clients are able to use the same solution while their businesses grow by deploying applications as-needed in real-time. Pricing is determined by employee headcount and the number of applications utilized, enabling our clients to align HCM spending with their evolving HCM needs as compared to traditional HCM products that require clients to migrate to new software as they grow but retain fixed costs even if the client shrinks in size. Efficient and Productive Research and Development We believe that we benefit from a competitive advantage with our research and development investments, people and processes. Early investments in our proprietary, cloud-based architecture enable us to develop and deploy applications in a timely and cost-effective manner. We have also chosen to base our research and development team in Oklahoma and Texas, which we believe provides us with high-quality talent at a lower cost compared to other locations in the United States where there is more competition for technology talent. These strategic decisions have enabled us to have a highly productive research and development function. Our Strategy for Growth Our strategy is to continue to establish our solution as the HCM industry standard by increasing our presence in existing markets and expanding into additional markets.  We intend to open 10 to 14 new sales offices over the next two years as well as potentially expand over the longer term into international markets.  We will also execute our strategy for growth by targeting larger clients, as well as strengthening and extending our solution. Increase Our Presence in Existing Markets We believe a significant market opportunity exists to increase our presence within markets where we currently have a sales office.  Each sales office is typically staffed with one sales team, with each team comprised of a sales manager and approximately six to eight other sales professionals.  Although we have a sales office in 35 of the 50 largest metropolitan statistical areas (“MSAs”) in the United States based on July 2016 U.S. Census Bureau estimates, only five of these MSAs are currently served by multiple Paycom sales teams.  In addition to expanding into new markets, we plan to further penetrate and more effectively capture existing markets by adding sales offices and increasing the number of sales teams in such markets.  Since our initial public offering (“IPO”) in April 2014, we have expanded our presence within three MSAs that were already served by at least one Paycom sales team by opening new sales offices in Brooklyn, Chicago, Long Island and Pasadena.   Expand Into Additional Markets We plan to continue expanding our sales capability by opening sales offices in certain metropolitan areas where we currently have no sales teams. Since our IPO in April 2014, we have expanded into eleven new markets by opening new sales offices in Cincinnati, Cleveland, Kansas City, Milwaukee, Nashville, Pittsburgh, Richmond, Sacramento, Salt Lake City, San Antonio, and Stamford.  We have historically selected new locations based on potential client and employee demographics as well as business density. When opening a new sales office, we typically relocate a proven sales manager from an existing territory who then recruits a team of high performing sales representatives. It typically takes a new sales office 24 months to reach maturity.  3      Enlarge our Existing Client Relationships We dedicate our resources to helping our clients facilitate their goals, whether through helping them execute better hiring decisions, manage compensation more effectively or simply operate more efficiently. We believe a significant growth opportunity exists in selling additional applications to our current clients. Many clients have subsequently deployed additional applications as they recognize the benefits of our comprehensive solution. As we extend and enhance the functionality of our solution, we will continue to invest in initiatives to increase the adoption of our solution and maintain our high levels of client satisfaction. Target Larger Clients The average size of our clients has grown significantly as we have organically grown our operations and increased the number of applications we offer. Based on our total revenues, we have grown at an approximately 42% CAGR from January 1, 2013 through December 31, 2017. Our solution requires no adjustment to serve larger clients. We believe larger employers represent a substantial opportunity to increase the number of clients and to increase our revenues per client, with limited incremental cost to us. To further capitalize on this opportunity, we intend to continue targeting larger businesses opportunistically where our current sales model is effective. Maintain Our Leadership in Innovation by Strengthening and Extending our Solution Our ability to develop and deploy new applications and updates rapidly and cost-effectively has been integral to the results that we have achieved to date. We intend to continue extending the functionality and range of our solution in the future. Our development efforts are performed exclusively in-house and are heavily based upon proactive research and client input. We are focusing our investments on the development of new applications, enhancements and learning courses that are responsive to the needs of our clients, which are garnered through ongoing client interaction and collaboration. Our Applications  Our HCM solution offers a full suite of applications that generally fall within the following categories: talent acquisition, time and labor management, payroll, talent management and HR management. Talent Acquisition            Applicant Tracking. Our applicant tracking application simplifies the recruiting processes needed to hire the most qualified employees. By using our all-in-one system, our clients can move candidates from the application process through new employee on-boarding without re-keying data.                 Candidate Tracker. Our candidate tracker application enables recruiters to track and stay connected to potential talent through an online database of top candidates. This application helps clients fill future positions faster without the cost of professional recruiting firms.                 Background Checks. Our background check application helps to ensure that prospective new hires are qualified candidates. We provide clients with the tools for authorizing background checks, creating pre-adverse and adverse action letters and securely store results as required by the Fair Credit Reporting Act.                 On-Boarding. Our on-boarding application streamlines the hiring and termination processes for employees of our clients by creating online checklists of tasks to be assigned to an employee or group of employees.           E-Verify ®. Our E-Verify ® application automates employment verification and reduces our clients’ exposure to audits and penalties that could result from I-9 violations.                 Tax Credit Services. Our tax credit services application helps employers process and calculate the available federal tax credits associated with hiring employees who meet various qualifications.   4      Time and Labor Management            Time and Attendance. Our time and attendance application allows our clients to accurately and efficiently manage when, where and how employees report their hours worked. Clients can apply customized rules, use batch editing and use timecard management tools to manage complex time and attendance needs. Our Web Time Clock feature allows employees to clock in and out online, which automatically updates the payroll application when approved, eliminating the need to manually calculate timesheets and re-key information into payroll systems. We also offer several different types of hardware that are ideal for single or multi-terminal environments.                 Scheduling/Schedule Exchange. Our scheduling application helps managers with employee scheduling through automated functionality that provides for a seamless workflow with the payroll and time and attendance applications. Our schedule exchange application allows employees and managers access to their schedules at any time and employees can approve, decline or swap their schedules and see what shifts are available for pickup.                               Time-Off Requests. Our time-off requests application automates and standardizes the time-off request procedure and helps employers remain effectively staffed. Managers can view an online time-off calendar to easily monitor and approve or deny time-off requests. Our employee self-service tool allows employees to view the time-off they have available, submit requests and view blackout dates, the status of requests and any manager comments.                 Labor Allocation. Our labor allocation application simplifies the process of setting up and tracking employee hours based on the job the employee is working.                 Labor Management Reports/Push Reporting. Our labor management reports application provides clients with access to up-to-the-minute reports on the information they need to better manage their labor force, such as overtime and labor distribution. Our push reporting application also gives clients the ability to set up recurring reports and to schedule them to be run automatically and sent to users on a daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly or yearly basis.                    Geofencing/Geotracking. Enhancing our time and attendance solution, Paycom’s geofencing and geotracking location-based technology assist our clients in managing the whereabouts of employees while on the job.  Geofencing allows employers to establish geographical boundaries within which their employees are authorized to clock in and out when using our Web Time Clock on smartphones, tablets or other electronic devices.  Once enabled, this time-theft-combatting tool supersedes IP address restrictions, meaning the system first checks for authorized geographical locations, rather than authorized IP addresses.  In addition, the geotracking tool empowers clients to track employees’ geographical locations upon clocking in and out.  The coordinates collected by the application can be entered into and viewed on a Google® display map.   5      Payroll                     Payroll and Tax Management. Our payroll application is the foundation of our solution and all of our clients are required to utilize this application in order to access our other applications. Our payroll application is automatically updated with changes in employee information and offers other time saving functionality such as batch editing and effective dating. Enhanced payroll grid functionality allows clients to automate and delegate payroll functions to accelerate the processes and build additional controls.  The application can be accessed at any time to make changes, run payroll and generate custom reports. We also help our clients by handling their payroll taxes and deposits, regulatory correspondence and amendments as well as assisting with penalty and interest disputes.                 Paycom Pay. Our Paycom Pay application eliminates the tedious job of check reconciliation by issuing checks to our clients’ employees that clear from a Paycom bank account, which helps clients eliminate potential liability and simplifies the reconciliation process.                 Expense Management. Our expense management application eliminates the manual, paper-based processes associated with employee expense reimbursement and allows employers to control and monitor expenses by setting clearly defined rules and parameters for employee reimbursement. Employees can upload receipts when submitting their expenses and access an expense dashboard where they can view the status of their submitted expenses.  Our native mobile app includes mileage tracker capability, allowing employers to more accurately track and manage employees’ mileage reimbursements that are then automatically updated within our expense management application.                 Garnishment Management. Our garnishment management application allows clients to handle communications with garnishment payees and agencies and to calculate and track garnishment payments.                    GL Concierge.  Our GL Concierge application offers organizations more control and transparency into their payroll general ledger and gives finance professionals intuitive reporting, enriched audit trails, customizable file layouts and real-time alerts.  Clients of all sizes can utilize a wide variety of general ledger maps along with an action-item alert system that improves the dynamics of their daily operations.   Talent Management            Employee Self-Service. Our employee self-service application improves employee engagement by empowering employees to self-manage certain transactions, obtain quick answers to frequent payroll and HR questions, access their pay history and view performance goals and reviews and total compensation reports to review their compensation and benefits package. Benefits information and paid time-off accruals also give employees the ability to make informed decisions regarding their benefit selections and time-off requests.                 Compensation Budgeting. Our compensation budgeting application provides compensation and performance information in one system, providing clients valuable workforce insight to help manage and formulate salary budgets and establish merit-based compensation increases.                    Performance Management. Our performance management application allows employees to set standardized pay grades and performance goals for positions across an organization. It also helps streamline the performance review process with online facilitation of the review process.                 Executive Dashboard. Our executive dashboard offers powerful workforce insight for executives to access information on demand in a variety of report formats. Because we offer an all-in-one solution in a single database, the comprehensive report data provides the workforce intelligence needed to drive human capital decisions at an executive level.                 Paycom Learning and Course Content. Our learning management application formalizes and standardizes our clients’ training processes. Employers can create customized content utilizing videos, presentations, quizzes and surveys. It provides employees with “anytime, anywhere” access to a central knowledge base where the employee can access content, share expertise and measure his or her professional development progress. In addition to providing the ability to create and upload custom content, we created and launched our own proprietary eLearning content.  Paycom Learning clients have immediate access to a library of Paycom-created learning courses, which  allow employers to educate their managers and employees quickly and consistently on foundational topics such as workplace violence, discrimination and harassment prevention.     6      HR Management            Document and Task Management. Our document and task management application is designed to manage employee files and allows employees to digitally sign and view company documents. We securely store client records to meet retention requirements and protect documents from unauthorized access and other disasters that can threaten businesses. In addition, clients can assign checklists to employees for the completion of certain tasks associated with processes such as on-boarding and off-boarding.                 Government and Compliance. Our government and compliance application helps clients reduce exposure to violations, audits and penalties with respect to the employment laws impacting their business, such as the Family Medical Leave Act, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and other state and federal regulations. A single database keeps our clients’ employee data consistent and enhances reporting capabilities by providing better accuracy and real-time insight.                 Benefits Administration/Benefits to Carrier. Our benefits administration application allows clients to customize benefit plan setup, deduction amounts, enrollment dates and new-hire waiting periods. Employers are provided census and reconciliation reports to ensure they do not overpay for benefits.  Employers can also update deduction amounts for all employees or groups of employees at once and automatically updates all insurance carriers for any changes. This application also provides employees with online enrollment and helps educate them and drive informed enrollment decisions for greater employee satisfaction.                 COBRA Administration. Our COBRA administration application protects employers from COBRA violations and the associated fines and penalties by automatically initiating compliance measures upon entry of qualifying events into the application. This application also tracks important dates, collects and remits premiums and reports on all COBRA activity.                 Personnel Action Forms. Our personnel action forms application helps our clients reduce the amount of time and paperwork required with employee changes such as pay rate, position and title changes by allowing managers to complete and approve online personnel action forms.                 Surveys. Our surveys application allows clients to create employee surveys to help identify and resolve workplace matters that otherwise may remain undisclosed. Clients can analyze results by the demographics of the workforce and compare how results change over time.                    Enhanced ACA.  Our Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) application provides clients with access to a dashboard that tracks employee count, employee status, health care plan affordability and ACA periods all from one convenient location and enables Paycom to file IRS Forms 1094/1095-B or –C.  Clients utilizing this application also have access to additional real-time compliance reports and alerts.   Our Clients We serve a diverse client base in terms of size and industry. We have over 20,000 clients, or approximately 11,000 clients based on parent company grouping, none of which constituted more than one-half of one percent of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017. We stored data for nearly 3.3 million persons employed by our clients during the year ended December 31, 2017. Many small to mid-sized companies can typically make the decision to adopt our solution more quickly than larger companies, which we believe results in a shorter sales cycle and more closely corresponds to our target sales cycle of 30 to 90 days. As a result of the nature and size of our clientele, we maintain a diversified client base and very low revenue concentration among our clients. We believe, however, that larger employers represent a substantial opportunity to increase the number of clients and to increase our revenues per client with limited incremental cost.  As we attract clients at the higher end of our target client size range, we may face longer sales cycles and less predictability in completing some of our sales. Competition The market for HCM solutions is rapidly evolving, highly competitive and subject to changing technology, shifting client needs and frequent introduction of new products and services. Our competitors range from small, regional firms to large, well-established international firms with multiple product offerings. We compete with firms that provide HCM solutions by various means. Many providers continue to deliver legacy enterprise software, but as demand for greater flexibility and access to information grows, we believe there will be increased competition in the delivery of HCM cloud-based solutions by other SaaS providers. Our competitors offer HCM solutions that may overlap with one,  7      several or all categories of applications offered by our solution. Our talent acquisition and talent management applications compete primarily with Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc., Oracle Corporation, SAP SE and Workday, Inc. Our payroll applications, including payroll processing, compete primarily with Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (“ADP”), Ceridian HCM, Inc. (“Ceridian”), Concur Technologies, Inc., Intuit Inc., Paychex, Inc., Paylocity Holding Corporation and The Ultimate Software Group, Inc. Our HR management applications compete primarily with ADP, Ceridian, Oracle Corporation, Paychex, Inc., Paylocity Holding Corporation, SAP SE and Workday, Inc.   Our time and labor management applications compete primarily with ADP, Ceridian, Kronos Incorporated, Paylocity Holding Corporation and The Ultimate Software Group, Inc. Our larger competitors compete with us across multiple segments. In addition, our HCM solution continues to face competition from in-house payroll and HR systems and departments as well as HR systems and software sold by third-party vendors. Competition in the HCM solutions market is primarily based on service responsiveness, product quality and reputation, breadth of service, application offering and price. The importance of these factors depends on the size of the business. Price tends to be the most important factor of competition for smaller businesses with fewer employees, while the scope of features and customization is more important to larger businesses. Regardless of a company’s size, another important factor is the implementation experience, as all organizations are seeking a streamlined and simplified process.   Sales and Marketing We sell our solution exclusively through our captive sales force, substantially all of whom have a four-year college degree. We typically recruit sales candidates who have sales experience in non-HCM industries or, with respect to candidates recruited directly from colleges and universities, who have demonstrated an aptitude for sales.  Our sales force is comprised of inside sales and field sales personnel, who are organized geographically, and client relations representatives (“CRRs”), who sell additional applications to existing clients. As of the filing of this Form 10-K, we have 46 sales teams located in 26 states and plan to open additional sales offices to further expand our presence in the U.S. market. We provide our sales force with an intensive six-week training course that includes at least one week of training at our headquarters in Okl
