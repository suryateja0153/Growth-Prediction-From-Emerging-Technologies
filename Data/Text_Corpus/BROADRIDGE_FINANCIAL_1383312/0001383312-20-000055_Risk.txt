Internal growth was slightly positive with positive growth in our Global Technology and Operations segment driven by higher trading volumes resulting from market volatility, partially offset by negative internal growth in our Investor Communication Solutions segment.•Event-driven fee revenues decreased $66.5 million, or 27%, primarily due to decreased activity in mutual fund proxy, equity special meetings, and equity contests. •Distribution revenues decreased $8.6 million, or 1%, to $1,451.2 million primarily due to the decrease in Event-driven fee revenues.•Currencies negatively impacted revenues by $34.0 million due to a combination of foreign acquisitions, continued international revenue growth, and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies. Total operating expenses. Operating expenses increased $194.7 million, or 5%, to $3,904.1 million from $3,709.5 million as a result of:•Cost of revenues - The increase of $133.2 million in cost of revenues primarily reflected higher operating costs from acquisitions and related amortization expense and charges associated with the IBM Private Cloud Agreement, partially offset by certain lower operational expenses.•Selling, general and administrative expenses - The increase of $61.5 million in selling, general, and administrative expenses primarily reflected the impact of acquisitions and higher compensation expense. •Currencies positively impacted total operating expenses by $31.3 million due to a combination of foreign acquisitions, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies, and continued international operating expense growth.Operating income margin of 13.8% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 declined 120 bps from 15.0% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 partly due to charges associated with the IBM Private Cloud Agreement. However, Adjusted Operating income margin of 17.5% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 increased 40 bps on higher recurring revenues from 17.1% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, which excludes certain charges associated with the IBM Private Cloud Agreement and certain other Non-GAAP adjustments. See “Explanation and Reconciliation of the Company’s Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” Interest expense, net. Interest expenses, net, was $58.8 million, an increase of $17.0 million from $41.8 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019. The increase of $17.0 million was primarily due to an increase in interest expense from higher borrowings primarily related to acquisitions.Other non-operating income (expenses), net. Other non-operating income, net for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 was $13.4 million, an increase of $17.1 million, compared to $3.7 million of Other non-operating expenses, net for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019. The increase of $17.1 million was primarily due to higher investment gains as compared to the prior year period.Provision for income taxes. •Effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 - 20.2%.•Effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 - 20.6%.The decrease in the effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 was primarily driven by higher discrete tax benefits, partially offset by lower excess tax benefits of $15.6 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 compared to $19.3 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019.ANALYSIS OF REPORTABLE SEGMENTSBroadridge has two reportable business segments: (1) Investor Communication Solutions and (2) Global Technology and Operations. The primary component of “Other” are certain gains, losses, corporate overhead expenses and non-operating expenses that have not been allocated to the reportable segments, such as interest expense. Foreign currency exchange is a reconciling item between the actual foreign currency exchange rates and the constant foreign currency exchange rates used for internal management reporting.Certain corporate expenses, as well as certain centrally managed expenses, are allocated based upon budgeted amounts in a reasonable manner. Because the Company compensates the management of its various businesses on, among other factors, segment profit, the Company may elect to record certain segment-related operating and non-operating expense items in Other rather than reflect such items in segment profit.43In connection with an organizational change made in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020, in order to further align and enhance our portfolio of services, the results for the Company’s wealth management Advisor Solutions services that were previously reported in our Investor Communication Solutions reportable segment are now reported within the Global Technology and Operations reportable segment. As a result, our prior period segment results for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 have been revised to reflect this change, which resulted in transferring $42.8 million of revenues and $2.2 million of earnings before income taxes between reportable segments, respectively.Revenues Years Ended June 30,20202019Change$%  ($ in millions)Investor Communication Solutions$3,491.3  $3,468.3  $23.0  1  Global Technology and Operations1,174.2  996.3  177.9  18  Foreign currency exchange(136.4) (102.4) (34.0) NM       Total$4,529.0  $4,362.2  $166.9  4   NM - Not meaningfulEarnings Before Income Taxes Years Ended June 30,20202019Change$%  ($ in millions)Investor Communication Solutions$464.1  $506.2  $(42.1) (8) Global Technology and Operations245.0  212.5  32.5  15  Other(146.3) (130.9) (15.4) 12  Foreign currency exchange16.8  19.4  (2.7)  NM       Total$579.5  $607.3  $(27.7) (5) NM - Not meaningfulInvestor Communication SolutionsFiscal Year 2020 Compared to Fiscal Year 2019 Revenues increased $23.0 million to $3,491.3 million from $3,468.3 million, and earnings before income taxes decreased $42.1 million to $464.1 million from $506.2 million as a result of:44 Years Ended June 30,20202019Change$% ($ in millions)RevenuesRecurring fee revenues$1,862.0  $1,764.0  $98.0  6  Event-driven fee revenues178.0  244.5  (66.5) (27) Distribution revenues1,451.2  1,459.8  (8.6) (1)        Total$3,491.3  $3,468.3  $23.0  1  Earnings before Income TaxesEarnings before income taxes$464.1  $506.2  $(42.1) (8) Pre-tax Margin13.3 %14.6 %Points of GrowthNet New BusinessInternal GrowthAcquisitionsTotalRecurring fee revenue Growth Drivers4pts-1pt2pts6 %For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020:•Recurring fees grew 6% driven by Organic growth and growth from acquisitions.

Explanation and Reconciliation of the Company’s Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures The Company’s results in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP except where otherwise noted. In certain circumstances, results have been presented in Non-GAAP measures. These Non-GAAP measures are Adjusted Operating income, Adjusted Operating income margin, Adjusted Net earnings, Adjusted earnings per share, and Free cash flow. These Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the Company’s reported results.The Company believes our Non-GAAP financial measures help investors understand how management plans, measures and evaluates the Company’s business performance. Management believes that Non-GAAP measures provide consistency in its financial reporting and facilitates investors’ understanding of the Company’s operating results and trends by providing an additional basis for comparison. Management uses these Non-GAAP financial measures to, among other things, evaluate our ongoing operations, for internal planning and forecasting purposes and in the calculation of performance-based compensation. In addition, and as a consequence of the importance of these Non-GAAP financial measures in managing our business, the Company’s Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors incorporates Non-GAAP financial measures in the evaluation process for determining management compensation.46Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Income Margin, Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Earnings Per ShareThese Non-GAAP measures reflect Operating income, Operating income margin, Net earnings, and Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted to exclude the impact of certain costs, expenses, gains and losses and other specified items that management believes are not indicative of our ongoing operating performance. These adjusted measures exclude the impact of: (i) Amortization of Acquired Intangibles and Purchased Intellectual Property, (ii) Acquisition and Integration Costs, (iii) IBM Private Cloud Charges, (iv) the Gain on Sale of a Joint Venture Investment, and (v) Covid-19 Related Expenses. Amortization of Acquired Intangibles and Purchased Intellectual Property represents non-cash amortization expenses associated with the Company's acquisition activities. Acquisition and Integration Costs represent certain transaction and integration costs associated with the Company’s acquisition activities. IBM Private Cloud Charges represent a charge on the hardware assets to be transferred to IBM and other charges related to the IBM Private Cloud Agreement. The Gain on Sale of a Joint Venture Investment represents a non-operating, cash gain on the sale of one of the Company’s joint venture investments. Covid-19 Related Expenses represents certain non-recurring expenses associated with the Covid-19 pandemic.We exclude IBM Private Cloud Charges, Gain on Sale of a Joint Venture Investment, and Covid-19 Related Expenses from our Adjusted Operating income and other earnings measures because excluding such information provides us with an understanding of the results from the primary operations of our business and these items do not reflect ordinary operations or earnings. We also exclude the impact of Amortization of Acquired Intangibles and Purchased Intellectual Property, as these non-cash amounts are significantly impacted by the timing and size of individual acquisitions and do not factor into the Company's capital allocation decisions, management compensation metrics or multi-year objectives. Furthermore, management believes that this adjustment enables better comparison of our results as Amortization of Acquired Intangibles and Purchased Intellectual Property will not recur in future periods once such intangible assets have been fully amortized. Although we exclude Amortization of Acquired Intangibles and Purchased Intellectual Property from our adjusted earnings measures, our management believes that it is important for investors to understand that these intangible assets contribute to revenue generation. Amortization of intangible assets that relate to past acquisitions will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized. Any future acquisitions may result in the amortization of additional intangible assets.Free Cash FlowsIn addition to the Non-GAAP financial measures discussed above, we provide Free cash flow information because we consider Free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated that could be used for dividends, share repurchases, strategic acquisitions, other investments, as well as debt servicing. Free cash flow is a Non-GAAP financial measure and is defined by the Company as Net cash flows provided by operating activities less Capital expenditures as well as Software purchases and capitalized internal use software.Set forth below is a reconciliation of such Non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures (unaudited):  Years ended June 30, 20202019 (in millions)Operating income (GAAP)$624.9  $652.7  Adjustments: Amortization of Acquired Intangibles and Purchased Intellectual Property122.9  87.4  Acquisition and Integration Costs12.5  6.4  IBM Private Cloud Charges32.0  —  Covid-19 Related Expenses2.4  —  Adjusted Operating income (Non-GAAP)$794.8  $746.5  Operating income margin (GAAP)13.8 %15.0 %Adjusted Operating income margin (Non-GAAP)17.5 %17.1 %47 Years ended June 30, 20202019 (in millions)Net earnings (GAAP)$462.5  $482.1  Adjustments: Amortization of Acquired Intangibles and Purchased Intellectual Property122.9  87.4  Acquisition and Integration Costs12.5  6.4  IBM Private Cloud Charges32.0  —  Covid-19 Related Expenses2.4  —  Gain on Sale of a Joint Venture Investment(6.5) —        Taxable adjustments163.4  93.8  Tax impact of adjustments (a)(37.4) (22.3) Adjusted Net earnings (Non-GAAP)$588.5  $553.6   Years ended June 30,  20202019 Diluted earnings per share (GAAP)$3.95  $4.06  Adjustments:Amortization of Acquired Intangibles and Purchased Intellectual Property1.05  0.74  Acquisition and Integration Costs0.11  0.05  IBM Private Cloud Charges0.27  —  Covid-19 Related Expenses0.02  —  Gain on Sale of a Joint Venture Investment(0.06) —        Taxable adjustments1.40  0.79  Tax impact of adjustments (a)(0.32) (0.19) Adjusted earnings per share (Non-GAAP)$5.03  $4.66  (a) Calculated using the GAAP effective tax rate, adjusted to exclude $15.6 million of excess tax benefits (“ETB”) associated with stock-based compensation for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020, and $19.3 million of ETB associated with stock-based compensation for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019.

Total stockholders’ equity was $1,346.5 million and $1,127.5 million at June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. At the current time, and in future periods, we expect cash generated by our operations, together with existing cash, cash equivalents, and borrowings from the capital markets, to be sufficient to cover cash needs for working capital, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, dividends and common stock repurchases. Given the volatility in the rapidly changing market and economic conditions related to the Covid-19 pandemic, we will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on our business and financial position.We expect existing domestic cash, cash equivalents, cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as regular quarterly dividends, debt repayment schedules, and material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. In addition, we expect existing foreign cash, cash equivalents, cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity to continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities, such as material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. If these funds are needed for our operations in the U.S., we may be required to pay additional foreign taxes to repatriate these funds. However, while we may do so at a future date, the Company does not need to repatriate future foreign earnings to fund U.S. operations.49Outstanding borrowings and available capacity under the Company’s borrowing arrangements were as follows:ExpirationDatePrincipal amount outstanding at June 30, 2020Carrying value at June 30, 2020Carrying value at June 30, 2019UnusedAvailableCapacity Fair Value at June 30, 2020(in millions)Current portion of long-term debtFiscal 2014 Senior Notes (a)September 2020$400.0  $399.9  $—  —  $402.1  Total$400.0  $399.9  $—  —  $402.1  Long-term debt, excluding current portionFiscal 2019 Revolving Credit Facility:U.S. dollar trancheMarch 2024$—  $—  $360.0  $1,100.0  $—  Multicurrency trancheMarch 2024149.8  149.8  215.7  250.2  149.8  Total Revolving Credit Facility$149.8  $149.8  $575.7  $1,350.2  $149.8  Fiscal 2014 Senior Notes (a)September 2020—  —  399.2  —  —  Fiscal 2016 Senior NotesJune 2026500.0  496.1  495.5  —  554.3  Fiscal 2020 Senior NotesDecember 2029750.0  741.7  —  —  803.6  Total Senior Notes$1,250.0  $1,237.8  $894.7  $—  $1,357.8  Total long-term debt$1,399.8  $1,387.6  $1,470.4  $1,350.2  $1,507.7  Total debt$1,799.8  $1,787.5  $1,470.4  $1,350.2  $1,909.7  _________(a) The Fiscal 2014 Senior Notes were reclassified from Long-term debt to Current portion of long-term debt in September 2019 to reflect the remaining maturity of less than a year.Future principal payments on the Company’s outstanding debt are as follows:Years ending June 30,20212022202320242025ThereafterTotal(in millions)$400.0  $—  $—  $149.8  $—  $1,250.0  $1,799.8  The Company has a $1.5 billion five-year revolving credit facility (the “Fiscal 2019 Revolving Credit Facility”), which is comprised of a $1.1 billion U.S. dollar tranche and a $400.0 million multicurrency tranche. Borrowings under the Fiscal 2019 Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at LIBOR plus 101.5 basis points. In addition, the Fiscal 2019 Revolving Credit Facility has an annual facility fee equal to 11.0 basis points on the entire facility.The Fiscal 2019 Revolving Credit Facility and senior notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and are ranked equally in right of payment. Interest on the senior notes due 2020 is payable semiannually on March 1st and September 1st of each year based on a fixed per annum rate equal to 3.95%. Interest on the senior notes due June 2026 is payable semiannually on June 27th and December 27th of each year based on a fixed per annum rate equal to 3.40%. Interest on the senior notes due 2029 is payable semiannually on June 1st and December 1st each year based on a fixed per annum rate equal to 2.90%.Our liquidity position may be negatively affected by changes in general economic conditions, regulatory requirements and access to the capital markets, which may be limited if we were to fail to renew any of the credit facilities on their renewal dates or if we were to fail to meet certain ratios.Please refer to Note 13, “Borrowings” to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion.50Cash FlowsFiscal Year 2020 Compared to Fiscal Year 2019  Years Ended June 30, 20202019$ Change (in millions) Net cash flows provided by operating activities$598.2  $617.0  $(18.7) Net cash flows used in investing activities$(441.7) $(433.5) $(8.1) Net cash flows provided by (used in) financing activities$51.2  $(173.1) $224.3  The decrease in cash provided by operating activities of $18.7 million primarily reflects increased scaling of client-related platform implementation and development, partially offset by cash flows from higher revenues, cash collections and working capital.  The increase in cash used in investing activities of $8.1 million primarily reflects an increase in capital expenditures and software purchases, partially offset by lower acquisition spend in fiscal year 2020.The increase in cash provided by financing activities of $224.3 million primarily reflects a decrease in the repurchase of common stock, partially offset by a decrease in net proceeds from borrowings and an increase in dividends paid.Income TaxesThe Company, headquartered in the U.S., is routinely examined by the IRS and is also routinely examined by the tax authorities in the U.S. states and foreign countries in which it conducts business. The tax years under audit examination vary by tax jurisdiction. The Company regularly considers the likelihood of assessments in each of the jurisdictions resulting from examinations. To the extent the Company determines it has potential tax assessments in particular tax jurisdictions, the Company has established tax reserves which it believes are adequate in relation to the potential assessments. Once established, reserves are adjusted when there is more information available, when an event occurs necessitating a change to the reserves or the statute of limitations for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position has expired. The resolution of tax matters should not have a material effect on the financial condition of the Company or on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Earnings for a particular future period.51Defined Benefit Pension PlansThe Company sponsors a Supplemental Officer Retirement Plan (the “SORP”). The SORP is a nonqualified ERISA defined benefit plan pursuant to which the Company will pay supplemental pension benefits to certain key officers upon retirement based upon the officers’ years of service and compensation. The SORP was closed to new participants beginning in fiscal year 2015. The Company also sponsors a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the “SERP”). The SERP is also a nonqualified ERISA defined benefit plan pursuant to which the Company will pay supplemental pension benefits to certain key executives upon retirement based upon the executives’ years of service and compensation. The SERP was closed to new participants beginning in fiscal year 2015.The SORP and SERP are effectively funded with assets held in a Rabbi Trust. The assets invested in the Rabbi Trust are to be used in part to fund benefit payments to participants under the terms of the plans. The Rabbi Trust is irrevocable and no portion of the trust funds may be used for any purpose other than the delivery of those assets to the participants, except that assets held in the Rabbi Trust would be subject to the claims of the Company’s general creditors in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency of the Company. The SORP and SERP are nonqualified plans for federal tax purposes and for purposes of Title I of ERISA. The Rabbi Trust assets had a value of $54.5 million at June 30, 2020 and $41.9 million at June 30, 2019 and are included in Other non-current assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
