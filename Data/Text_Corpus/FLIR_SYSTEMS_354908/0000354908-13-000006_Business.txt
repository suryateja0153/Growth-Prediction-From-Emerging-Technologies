International revenue accounted for approximately 49 percent, 48 percent and 47 percent of our revenue in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant percentage of revenue in the future. We have exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations and changing dynamics of foreign competitiveness based on variations in the value of the United States dollar relative to other currencies. Factors contributing to this variability include significant manufacturing activity in Europe, significant sales denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar, and cross currency fluctuations between such currencies as the United States dollar, euro, Swedish kroner and British pound sterling. The impact of those fluctuations is reflected throughout our consolidated financial statements, but in the aggregate, did not have a material impact on our results of operations.We experience fluctuations in orders and sales due to seasonal variations and customer sales cycles, such as the seasonal pattern of contracting by the United States and certain foreign governments, the desire of customers to take delivery of equipment prior to fiscal year ends due to funding considerations, and the tendency of commercial enterprises to fully utilize annual capital budgets prior to expiration. Such events have resulted and could continue to result in fluctuations in quarterly results in the future. As a result of such quarterly fluctuations in operating results, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance.We expect that the challenging world-wide economic conditions that impacted revenue performance in 2012 will continue to impact our business going forward.   More specifically, reduced spending by United States and Middle East government agencies, the continuing Eurozone crisis, the impact in the United States of the year-end 2012 expiration of income and payroll tax cuts, and, in the absence of action by the United States Congress to the contrary, potential material reductions in federal spending resulting from the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other global economic developments, all present challenges for us and render predictions regarding future performance difficult to make.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesThis discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, bad debts, inventories, goodwill, warranty obligations, contingencies and income taxes on an on-going basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these estimates with the Audit Committee of our 27Board of Directors. We believe the following critical accounting policies and the related judgments and estimates affect the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.Revenue recognition.    The majority of our revenue is recognized upon shipment of the product to the customer at a fixed or determinable price and with a reasonable assurance of collection, passage of title to the customer as indicated by the shipping terms and fulfillment of all significant obligations.We design, market and sell our products primarily as commercial, off-the-shelf products. Certain customers request different system configurations, generally based on standard options or accessories that we offer. In general, our revenue arrangements do not involve acceptance provisions based upon customer specified acceptance criteria. In those limited circumstances when customer specified acceptance criteria exist, revenue is deferred until customer acceptance if we cannot demonstrate that the system meets those specifications prior to shipment. For any contracts with multiple elements (i.e., training, installation, additional parts, etc.) we allocate revenue among the deliverables primarily based upon objective and reliable evidence of fair value of each element in the arrangement.  If objective and reliable evidence of fair value of any element is not available, we use an estimated selling price for purposes of allocating the total arrangement consideration among the elements. In addition, judgments are required in evaluating the credit worthiness of our customers. Credit is not extended to customers and revenue is not recognized until we have determined that collectability is reasonably assured.Allowance for doubtful accounts.    Our policy is to maintain allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. Credit limits are established through a process of reviewing the financial history and stability of each customer. Where appropriate, we obtain credit rating reports and financial statements of the customer when determining or modifying their credit limits. We regularly evaluate the collectability of our trade receivable balances based on a combination of factors. When a customer’s account balance becomes past due, we initiate dialogue with the customer to determine the cause. If it is determined that the customer will be unable to meet its financial obligation to us, such as in the case of a bankruptcy filing, deterioration in the customer’s operating results or financial position or other material events impacting their business, we record a specific allowance to reduce the related receivable to the amount we expect to recover given all information presently available. Actual write-offs during the past three years have not been material to our results of operations.We also record an allowance for all other customers based on certain other factors including the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience with individual customers. As of December 31, 2012, our accounts receivable balance of $335.2 million is reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts of $6.6 million. We believe our reported allowances at December 31, 2012, are adequate. If the financial conditions of those customers were to deteriorate, however, resulting in their inability to make payments, we may need to record additional allowances that would result in additional selling, general and administrative expenses being recorded for the period in which such determination is made.Inventory.    Our policy is to record inventory write-downs when conditions exist that indicate that our inventories are likely to be in excess of anticipated demand or are obsolete based upon our assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions. We regularly evaluate the ability to realize the value of our inventories based on a combination of factors including the following: historical usage rates, forecasted sales or usage, product end of life dates, estimated current and future market values and new product introductions. Purchasing requirements and alternative usages are evaluated within these processes to mitigate inventory exposure. When recorded, our write-downs are intended to reduce the carrying value of our inventories to their net realizable value and establish a new cost basis. As of December 31, 2012, our inventories of $381.4 million are stated net of inventory write-downs. If actual demand for our products deteriorates or market conditions are less favorable than those that we project, additional inventory write-downs may be required in the future.Goodwill.    We have recorded goodwill in connection with our business acquisitions. We review goodwill in June of each year, or on an interim basis if required, for impairment to determine if events or changes in business conditions indicate that the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable. Such reviews assess the fair value of the assets based upon our estimates of the future cash flows we expect the assets to generate within the boundaries of the applicable business segments of the Company. Our current review indicates that no adjustments are necessary for the goodwill assets, which have a carrying value of $503.1 million as of December 31, 2012.Product warranties.    Our products are sold with warranty provisions that require us to remedy deficiencies in quality or performance of our products over a specified period of time, generally twelve to twenty-four months, at no cost to our customers. Our policy is to establish warranty reserves at levels that represent our estimate of the costs that will be incurred to fulfill those warranty requirements at the time that revenue is recognized. We believe that our recorded liability of $16.2 million at December 31, 2012 is adequate to cover our future cost of materials, labor and overhead for the servicing of our products sold through that date. If actual product failures or material or service delivery costs differ from our estimates, our warranty liability would need to be revised accordingly.28Contingencies.    We are subject to the possibility of loss contingencies arising in the normal course of business. We consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted.Income taxes.    We record our deferred tax assets when the benefits are more likely than not to be recognized. Valuation allowances against deferred tax assets are recorded when a determination is made that the deferred tax assets are not more likely than not to be realized in the future. In making that determination, on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis, we estimate our future taxable income based upon historical operating results and external market data. Future levels of taxable income are dependent upon, but not limited to, general economic conditions, competitive pressures and other factors beyond our control. As of December 31, 2012, we have determined that a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets of $9.3 million is required. If we should determine that we may be unable to realize our deferred tax assets to the extent reported, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be recorded in the period such determination is made.Consolidated Operating ResultsThe following table sets forth for the indicated periods certain items as a percentage of revenue: Year Ended December  31,(1) 2012 2011 2010Revenue100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 %Cost of goods sold48.0 46.3 45.0Gross profit52.0 53.7 55.0Operating expenses:     Research and development9.8 9.5 8.4Selling, general and administrative20.7 23.8 20.6Total operating expenses30.5 33.4 29.0Earnings from operations21.6 20.3 26.0Interest expense0.8 0.4 0.2Interest income(0.1) (0.1) (0.1)Other income, net0.1 (0.1) (0.3)Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes20.8 20.1 26.1Income tax provision4.7 5.7 8.2Earnings from continuing operations16.0 14.4 17.9Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax(0.2) (0.1) (0.0)Net earnings15.8 % 14.3 % 17.9 %_______________ (1)Totals may not recompute due to roundingThe following discussion of operating results provides an overview of our operations by addressing key elements in our Consolidated Statements of Income. The “Segment Operating Results” section that follows describes the contributions of each of our business segments to our consolidated revenue and earnings from operations for 2012, 2011 and 2010. Given the nature of our business, we believe revenue and earnings from operations (including operating margin percentage) are most relevant to an understanding of our performance at a segment level. Additionally, at the segment level we disclose backlog, which represents orders received for products or services for which a sales agreement is in place and delivery is expected within twelve months.The operating results for 2012 do not include any amounts for either Lorex or Traficon as any such amounts were not significant.Revenue.    Revenue for 2012 totaled $1,405.4 million, a decrease of 9.0 percent from 2011 revenue of $1,544.1 million. Each    of our operating segments, except Integrated Systems, reported decreases in year over year revenues due to continued reductions in demand for our products from United States government and Middle East government agencies and weaker world-wide economic conditions resulting in lower demand for many of our commercial product lines.  The decline of $138.7 million in year over year revenue included a decline of $71.3 million from United States government customers.29Revenue for 2011 totaled $1,544.1 million, an increase of 11.2 percent over 2010 revenue of $1,388.4 million. The increase was primarily due to increased revenue from our Thermal Vision and Measurement segment, and a full year of revenues reported by Raymarine Holdings, Ltd. (“Raymarine”) which was acquired on May 14, 2010, and ICx Technologies, Inc. (“ICx”) which was acquired on October 4, 2010.  Excluding revenue from Raymarine and ICx, revenue for the year ended December 31, 2011 was flat compared to the same period in 2010 as revenue from our Thermal Vision and Measurement segment increased by 14.9 percent in 2011 compared to the same period in 2010, while revenue from our Surveillance segment declined by 14.0 percent in 2011 compared to the same period in 2010.International revenue in 2012 totaled $687.5 million, representing 48.9 percent of revenue. This compares with international revenue in 2011 which totaled $740.6 million, representing 48.0 percent of revenue and $653.7 million in 2010, representing 47.1 percent of revenue. While the sales mix between United States and international sales may fluctuate from year to year, we expect revenue from customers outside the United States to continue to comprise a significant portion of our total revenue on a long-term basis.Cost of goods sold.  Cost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2012 and 2011was $674.0 million and $715.5 million, respectively.  The year over year decrease in cost of goods sold primarily relate to the lower year over year revenues and changes in product mix.  In the year ended December 31, 2012, costs of goods sold included restructuring charges of $3.8 million, primarily for work force reductions in our Thermal Vision and Measurement and Detection segments; in the year ended December 31, 2011, costs of goods sold included restructuring charges of $0.9 million.  For the year ended December 31, 2011, costs of goods sold included charges of $7.3 million for the amortization of fair value adjustments on inventory acquired through the acquisition of ICx in 2010.Cost of goods sold in 2011 of $715.5 million was an increase of $90.7 million, or 14.5 percent, over cost of goods sold of $624.8 million in 2010.  The increase was primarily due to the increase in revenues year over year as discussed above.  For the year ended December 31, 2010, cost of goods sold included charges of $3.6 million for the amortization of fair value adjustments on inventory of ICx.Cost of goods sold includes materials, labor and overhead costs incurred in the manufacturing of products and services sold in the period as well as warranty costs. Material costs include raw materials, purchased components and sub-assemblies, outside processing and inbound freight costs. Labor and overhead costs consist of direct and indirect manufacturing costs, including wages and fringe benefits, operating supplies, depreciation and amortization, occupancy costs, and purchasing, receiving and inspection costs.Gross profit.    Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $731.4 million compared to $828.6 million in 2011.  Gross margin, defined as gross profit divided by revenue, decreased from 53.7 percent in 2011 to 52.0 percent in 2012.  The decrease in gross profit in 2012 was primarily due to the lower revenue year over year and a lower consolidated gross margin. Gross margin decreased  in 2012 from 2011 primarily due to a shift in product mix in both our Thermal Vision and Measurement and Surveillance segments and reduced absorption of fixed costs due to lower revenues, partially offset by the elimination of 2011 amortization expenses related to fair value adjustments on inventory of ICx. Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $828.6 million compared to $763.6 million in 2010.   Gross margin decreased from 55.0 percent in 2010 to 53.7 percent in 2011.  The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to a higher percentage of revenue from Raymarine and ICx business units, both of which have historically lower gross margins than our other business segments, as well as a change in the product mix in our Surveillance segment.  These effects were partially offset by the continued production efficiencies realized from increased volumes in our Thermal Vision and Measurement segment.  Excluding Raymarine and the ICx business units, gross margins were 57.4 percent in 2011, up slightly from 56.8 percent in 2010.Research and development.    Research and development expenses were $137.8 million, or 9.8 percent of revenue in 2012, compared to $147.2 million, or 9.5 percent of revenue, in 2011, and $116.6 million, or 8.4 percent of revenue, in 2010. The decrease in research and development expenses in 2012 from 2011 was primarily due to cost containment efforts in light of the decrease in revenue.  The increase in research and development expenses in 2011 over 2010 was due to increased investment in new product development as well as the research and development activity conducted by newly acquired companies. We believe that spending levels are sufficient to support the development of new products and the continued growth of the business. We expect research and development expenses to be approximately 8 to 10 percent of revenue on a long-term basis.30Selling, general and administrative expenses.    Selling, general and administrative expenses were $290.3 million, or 20.7 percent of revenue in 2012 compared to $368.2 million, or 23.8 percent of revenue, in 2011 and $286.7 million, or 20.6 percent of revenue, in 2010. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses from 2011 to 2012 was primarily due to the payment of a $39.0 million litigation settlement in 2011, cost control efforts taken in 2012 in light of the revenue decline and lower annual incentive expenses.  The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses from 2010 to 2011 was primarily due to the operating expenses related to businesses acquired during 2010 which represented $46.1 million of the increase and the $39.0 million litigation settlement in 2011.   While selling, general and administrative expenses may be affected in the future by acquisitions with different cost structures, we anticipate selling, general and administrative expenses to increase at a slower rate than revenue in our existing businesses.Interest expense.    Interest expense totaled $11.7 million, $5.5 million and $2.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Interest expense in 2012 and 2011 is primarily attributable to the interest expense associated with the $250 million aggregate principal amount of 3.75 percent senior unsecured notes due September 1, 2016 that were issued in August 2011 and the amortization of the costs related to the issuance of the notes.  Interest expense in 2010 is primarily attributable to interest on the convertible notes that were issued in June 2003, the amortization of the discounts recorded on the notes and the costs related to the issuance of the notes. The convertible notes were fully converted by June 2010.Income taxes.    Our income tax provision was $66.6 million, $88.4 million and $114.3 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The effective tax rates for 2012, 2011 and 2010 were 22.8 percent, 28.4 percent and 31.5 percent, respectively. The mix in taxable income between our United States and international operations has a significant impact on our annual income tax provision and effective tax rates. Our effective tax rate is lower than the United States federal tax rate of 35 percent because of lower foreign tax rates, the effect of foreign, federal and state tax credits and other one-time items such as amended tax filings and business dispositions.  For 2012, the effective tax rate decrease was primarily due to the impact of a multi-year agreement, effective August 1, 2012, with a European jurisdiction, the effect of amended state tax filings, and the impact of revaluations of deferred tax assets and liabilities due to changes in certain foreign statutory tax rates.  We expect the effective tax rate for 2013 to be approximately 25 percent excluding discrete items. At December 31, 2012, the Company had United States tax net operating loss carry-forwards totaling approximately $57.9 million which expire between 2018 and 2031. In addition, the Company has various state net operating loss carry-forwards totaling approximately $79.5 million which expire between 2018 and 2031. The federal and state net operating losses were generated by ICx Technologies, Inc. prior to being acquired by us in 2010. Finally, the Company has various foreign net operating loss carry-forwards totaling approximately $93.5 million which expire between 2018 and 2033.Tax benefits as described above are recorded as assets when the benefits are more likely than not to be recognized. To the extent that we assess the realization of such assets to not be more likely than not, a valuation allowance is required to be recorded. We believe that the net deferred tax assets of $55.2 million reflected on the December 31, 2012 Consolidated Balance Sheet are materially realizable based on future forecasts of taxable income over a relatively short time horizon, but we have determined that a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets of $9.3 million is required, primarily related to certain acquired net operating losses. A valuation allowance is required when it is more-likely-than-not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets may not be realized. A review of all available positive and negative evidence is considered, including past and future performance, the market environment in which the Company operates, utilization of tax attributes in the past, length of carryback and carryforward periods, and evaluation of potential tax planning strategies when evaluating whether the deferred tax assets will be realized.Discontinued operations.   In 2010, in connection with the acquisition of ICx, we began to pursue the sale of certain business units of ICx and the results of operations for such business units were reported as discontinued operations until their respective dispositions. During the second quarter of 2012, we sold the remaining two business units reported as discontinued operations.  The operating losses of those operations, including insignificant associated losses recognized subsequent to their disposal, and the net losses on the sales of the units, net of tax are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2012. 31Segment Operating ResultsAs of January 1, 2011, we merged the Thermography and Commercial Vision Systems operating segments into the Thermal Vision and Measurement operating segment.  Raymarine was acquired on May 14, 2010, creating the Raymarine operating segment.  Finally, ICx was acquired on October 4, 2010 and the ICx operating results for the period from acquisition through December 31, 2010 was reported as a separate segment.  Effective as of January 1, 2011, ICx results are reported as our Detection and Integrated System segments, and a portion is reported in our Surveillance segment. Beginning January 1, 2011, the former Government Systems operating segment is also included in the Surveillance operating segment.Thermal Vision and MeasurementThermal Vision and Measurement operating results are as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010Revenue$628.0 $660.3 $574.9Earnings from operations171.3 194.7 163.7Operating margin27.3% 29.5% 28.5%Backlog158 136 135Thermal Vision and Measurement revenue decreased by 4.9 percent in 2012 compared to 2011, primarily due to lower revenues in the cores and components product line and the premium thermography product lines. Revenue declined in all geographies due to world-wide economic weaknesses which were particularly significant in our Europe, Middle East and Africa regions.  United States revenue was adversely impacted by lower revenue from cores and components customers. Earnings from operations decreased by 12.0 percent due to the flow through of lower revenues and lower absorption of factory costs partially offset by a 5.5 percent reduction in operating expenses.Revenue increased by 14.9 percent in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to increased unit deliveries from several of the segment’s product lines including thermography, cores and components, and maritime. Earnings from operations increased by 18.9 percent due to the increase in revenue and manufacturing efficiencies resulting from higher production volumes and lower material costs on new products.RaymarineRaymarine operating results are as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010Revenue$158.2 $171.5 $104.1Earnings from operations11.2 11.9 8.3Operating margin7.1% 6.9% 8.0%Backlog6 5 11Raymarine segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2012 decreased by 7.8 percent, compared to 2011, primarily due to weak market conditions in Europe.   Earnings from operations in 2012 decreased by 5.9 percent compared to 2011 primarily due to lower revenue resulting in lower gross profit, largely offset by a 9.9 percent reduction in operating expenses.Operating results for 2010 are for the period from May 14, 2010 through December 31, 2010.  Raymarine earnings from operations include the impact of the amortization of intangible assets of $3.5 million in 2012, $3.8 million in 2011 and $2.1 million in 2010.SurveillanceSurveillance operating results are as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010Revenue$486.4 $577.6 $671.3Earnings from operations160.2 208.5 256.2Operating margin32.9% 36.1% 38.2%Backlog261 247 33332Surveillance segment revenue decreased by 15.8 percent in 2012 compared to 2011, primarily due to a 26.6 percent decrease in revenue from US government customers.  Earnings from operations declined by 23.2 percent due to lower revenues, lower gross margins resulting from a change in segment product mix, partially offset by a 10.5 percent decrease in operating expenses. Revenue decreased by 14.0 percent in 2011 compared to 2010, primarily due to decreases in revenue from U.S. government agencies, partially offset by revenue of $8.8 million from ICx business units, which were acquired on October 4, 2010.  Lower revenue and increased segment operating expenses caused the decline in earnings from operations and operating margin from 2010 to 2011.  The decline in backlog from 2010 to 2011 was primarily due to the reduction in procurement activity by our U.S. government customers. DetectionDetection operating results are as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010Revenue$63.3 $79.9 $23.6Earnings (loss) from operations1.1 (5.6) (2.5)Operating margin1.7% (7.0)% (10.8)%Backlog24 25 20Detection segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2012 decreased by 20.8 percent compared to the same period of 2011, primarily due to two significant program deliveries in 2011 and to lower research and development contract revenues pursuant to the segment's strategy to reduce its customer-paid research and development activity. The loss from operations in 2011included the amortization of fair value adjustments on inventory of $4.2 million. The elimination of the fair value inventory adjustment and a 27.9 percent reduction in operating expenses partially offset by lower revenues were the main factors contributing to the improvement in operating results for 2012 compared to 2011.Operating results for 2010 are for the period from October 4, 2010 through December 31, 2010. The earnings from operations include the impact of the amortization of fair value adjustments on inventory of $4.2 million and $2.1 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively.  The fair value adjustment on inventory related to purchase price accounting and the adjustment was fully amortized in 2011.Integrated SystemsIntegrated Systems operating results are as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010Revenue$69.5 $54.8 $14.7Earnings from operations5.2 1.7 0.0Operating margin7.4% 3.0% 0.2%Backlog71 42 36Integrated Systems segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased by 26.7 percent over 2011, primarily due to an increase in large program revenue recognized year over year.  Backlog at December 31, 2012 reflects an increase due to several large program contracts booked during 2012.Operating results for 2010 are for the period from October 4, 2010 through December 31, 2010. The earnings from operations include the impact of the amortization of fair value adjustments on inventory of $0.5 million and $0.2 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively.  The fair value adjustment on inventory related to purchase price accounting and the adjustment was fully amortized in 2011.33Liquidity and Capital ResourcesAt December 31, 2012, we had a total of $321.7 million in cash and cash equivalents, $150.3 million of which was in the United States and $171.4 million at our foreign subsidiaries, compared to cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2011 of $440.8 million, of which $263.6 million was in the United States and $177.3 million at our foreign subsidiaries.  The decrease in cash and cash equivalents in 2012 was primarily due to the repurchase of 10.5 million shares of our common stock for $214.2 million, business acquisitions of $105.9 million, capital expenditures of $58.1 million and dividends paid of $42.5 million, partially offset by cash provided from operations.Cash provided by operating activities in 2012 totaled $285.5 million compared to $243.9 million in 2011 and $255.3 million in 2010. The increase in cash provided from operating activities in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily due to a year over year reduction in cash used for certain working capital components, particularly inventories and income tax related assets and liabilities. The decrease in cash provided from operating activities in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to the decrease in net earnings partially offset by  a year over year reduction in cash used for certain working capital components.Cash used for investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2012 totaled $167.0 million, primarily consisting of the acquisition of Lorex Technology Inc. for $61.2 million and Traficon International NV for $46.3 million and capital expenditures of $58.2 million.  Capital expenditures in 2012 included building improvements for our facilities in Nashua, New Hampshire, Taby, Sweden and Croissy-Beaubourg, France and equipment requirements for existing and future product lines.  Cash used for investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2011 totaled $67.1 million, primarily consisting of the acquisition of Aerius Photonics, LLC for $27.0 million and capital expenditures of $42.0 million.  Capital expenditures in 2011 included the purchase of a building in Fareham, United Kingdom and building improvements for our facilities in Nashua, New Hampshire and Taby, Sweden. Cash used for investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2010 totaled $465.4 mill
