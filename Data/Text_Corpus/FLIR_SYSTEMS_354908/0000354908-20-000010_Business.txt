BUSINESS GENERALFLIR Systems, Inc. (“FLIR,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is a world leader in developing technologies that enhance perception and awareness. We design, develop, market, and distribute solutions that detect people, objects and substances that may not be perceived by human senses and improve the way people interact with the world around them. We bring these innovative technologies into daily life in ways that help save lives and livelihoods. FLIR technologies include thermal imaging systems, visible-light imaging systems, locater systems, measurement and diagnostic systems, and advanced threat-detection solutions.Founded in 1978 as an Oregon corporation, FLIR is a pioneer in advanced sensors and integrated sensor systems that enable the gathering, measurement, and analysis of critical information through a wide variety of applications in industrial, government, and commercial markets worldwide. We offer the broadest range of infrared, also known as thermal, imaging solutions in the world, with products that range from professional-use thermal camera smartphone accessories to highly advanced aircraft-mounted imaging systems for military and search and rescue applications, with products in between serving a multitude of markets, customers, and applications. As the cost of thermal imaging technology has declined, our opportunities to increase the adoption of thermal technology and create new markets for the technology have expanded. In order to better serve the customers in these markets, we have augmented our thermal product offerings with complementary sensing technologies, such as visible imaging, radar, laser, sonar, chemical sensing, and environmental sensing technologies.Our goal is to both enable our customers to benefit from the valuable information produced by advanced sensing technologies and to deliver sustained superior financial performance for our shareholders. We create value for our customers by improving personal and public safety and security, providing advanced intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and tactical defense capabilities, facilitating air, ground, and maritime-based situational awareness, detecting electrical, mechanical and building envelope problems, displaying process irregularities, detecting volatile organic gas emissions, and enhancing advanced driver-assistance systems ("ADAS") and autonomous driving solutions, as well as a variety of other uses of thermal and other sensing technologies.Our business model and range of solutions allow FLIR to sell products to various end markets, including industrial, original equipment manufacturing ("OEM"), military, homeland security, enterprise, infrastructure, and environmental. We sell off-the-shelf products in configurations to suit specific customer requirements in an efficient, timely, and affordable manner, and support those customers with training and ongoing support and services. Centered on the design of products for low-cost manufacturing and high-volume distribution, our commercial operating model has been developed over time and provides us with a unique ability 1to adapt to market changes and meet our customers’ needs. Because we aggregate product demand and production across these markets, we can generate significant volume; this volume drives down cost, which then increases demand, enabling a virtuous cycle of lower prices and higher unit volumes. Our manufacturing and supply processes are vertically integrated, minimizing lead times, facilitating prompt delivery, controlling costs and ensuring that components satisfy our high quality standards.We have evolved our product suite over time, expanding our reach into markets that are adjacent to thermal imaging, with the intent of expanding the adoption and channel development for thermal imaging technology. Examples of this evolution include our entrance into the visible-image security and surveillance market, the industrial machine vision market, and the traffic monitoring and signal control market. We intend to maintain this evolution as we continue to lower the cost of advanced sensing products. As the cost to own thermal technology continues to decline, the application of these sensors is expanding beyond imaging to areas such as data acquisition where thermal sensors can provide important data that can be used for a wide variety of applications.We believe that the FLIR brand is known for quality, innovation and trust and that customers are drawn to us for products and solutions that are effective, innovative, easy to use, and sold at competitive market prices. We intend to: continue to reduce the cost of thermal technology through higher volumes and new product and process improvements; innovate new applications and form-factors for our technology based on customer feedback; improve the customer experience through improved user-interface, ease-of-use, and software; increase customer loyalty and trust by providing world-class product warranties and support; and improve operational processes to realign resources to be nimble in response to customers’ needs and market trends.Industrial:  The Industrial business unit develops and manufactures thermal and visible-spectrum imaging camera cores and components that are utilized by third parties to create thermal, industrial, and other types of imaging systems.
