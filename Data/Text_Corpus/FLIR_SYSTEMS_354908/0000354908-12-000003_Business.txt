International revenue accounted for approximately 48 percent, 47 percent and 41 percent of our revenue in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant percentage of revenue in the future. We have exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations and changing dynamics of foreign competitiveness based on variations in the value of the United States dollar relative to other currencies. Factors contributing to this variability include significant manufacturing activity in Europe, significant sales denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar, and cross currency fluctuations between such currencies as the United States dollar, euro, Swedish kroner and British pound sterling. The impact of those fluctuations is reflected throughout our consolidated financial statements, but in the aggregate, did not have a material impact on our results of operations.We experience fluctuations in orders and sales due to seasonal variations and customer sales cycles, such as the seasonal pattern of contracting by the United States and certain foreign governments, the desire of customers to take delivery of equipment prior to fiscal year ends due to funding considerations, and the tendency of commercial enterprises to fully utilize annual capital budgets prior to expiration. Such events have resulted and could continue to result in fluctuations in quarterly results in the future. As a result of such quarterly fluctuations in operating results, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesThis discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, bad debts, inventories, goodwill, warranty obligations, contingencies and income taxes on an on-going basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. We believe the following critical accounting policies and the related judgments and estimates affect the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.Revenue recognition.    The majority of our revenue is recognized upon shipment of the product to the customer at a fixed or determinable price and with a reasonable assurance of collection, passage of title to the customer as indicated by the shipping terms and fulfillment of all significant obligations.26We design, market and sell our products primarily as commercial, off-the-shelf products. Certain customers request different system configurations, generally based on standard options or accessories that we offer. In general, our revenue arrangements do not involve acceptance provisions based upon customer specified acceptance criteria. In those limited circumstances when customer specified acceptance criteria exist, revenue is deferred until customer acceptance if we cannot demonstrate that the system meets those specifications prior to shipment. For any contracts with multiple elements (i.e., training, installation, additional parts, etc.) we allocate revenue among the deliverables primarily based upon objective and reliable evidence of fair value of each element in the arrangement.  If objective and reliable evidence of fair value of any element is not available, we use an estimated selling price for purposes of allocating the total arrangement consideration among the elements. In addition, judgments are required in evaluating the credit worthiness of our customers. Credit is not extended to customers and revenue is not recognized until we have determined that collectability is reasonably assured.Allowance for doubtful accounts.    Our policy is to maintain allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. Credit limits are established through a process of reviewing the financial history and stability of each customer. Where appropriate, we obtain credit rating reports and financial statements of the customer when determining or modifying their credit limits. We regularly evaluate the collectability of our trade receivable balances based on a combination of factors. When a customer’s account balance becomes past due, we initiate dialogue with the customer to determine the cause. If it is determined that the customer will be unable to meet its financial obligation to us, such as in the case of a bankruptcy filing, deterioration in the customer’s operating results or financial position or other material events impacting their business, we record a specific allowance to reduce the related receivable to the amount we expect to recover given all information presently available. Actual write-offs during the past three years have not been material to our results of operations.We also record an allowance for all other customers based on certain other factors including the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience with individual customers. As of December 31, 2011, our accounts receivable balance of $325.4 million is reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts of $5.6 million. We believe our reported allowances at December 31, 2011, are adequate. If the financial conditions of those customers were to deteriorate, however, resulting in their inability to make payments, we may need to record additional allowances that would result in additional selling, general and administrative expenses being recorded for the period in which such determination is made.Inventory.    Our policy is to record inventory write-downs when conditions exist that indicate that our inventories are likely to be in excess of anticipated demand or are obsolete based upon our assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions. We regularly evaluate the ability to realize the value of our inventories based on a combination of factors including the following: historical usage rates, forecasted sales or usage, product end of life dates, estimated current and future market values and new product introductions. Purchasing requirements and alternative usage avenues are explored within these processes to mitigate inventory exposure. When recorded, our write-downs are intended to reduce the carrying value of our inventories to their net realizable value and establish a new cost basis. As of December 31, 2011, our inventories of $336.1 million are stated net of inventory write-downs. If actual demand for our products deteriorates or market conditions are less favorable than those that we project, additional inventory write-downs may be required in the future.Goodwill.    We have recorded goodwill in connection with our business acquisitions. We review goodwill in June of each year, or on an interim basis if required, for impairment to determine if events or changes in business conditions indicate that the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable. Such reviews assess the fair value of the assets based upon our estimates of the future cash flows we expect the assets to generate within the boundaries of the applicable business segments of the Company. Our current review indicates that no adjustments are necessary for the goodwill assets, which have a carrying value of $498.3 million as of December 31, 2011.Product warranties.    Our products are sold with warranty provisions that require us to remedy deficiencies in quality or performance of our products over a specified period of time, generally twelve to twenty-four months, at no cost to our customers. Our policy is to establish warranty reserves at levels that represent our estimate of the costs that will be incurred to fulfill those warranty requirements at the time that revenue is recognized. We believe that our recorded liability of $16.0 million at December 31, 2011 is adequate to cover our future cost of materials, labor and overhead for the servicing of our products sold through that date. If actual product failures or material or service delivery costs differ from our estimates, our warranty liability would need to be revised accordingly.Contingencies.    We are subject to the possibility of loss contingencies arising in the normal course of business. We consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted.27Income taxes.    We record our deferred tax assets when the benefits are more likely than not to be recognized. Valuation allowances against deferred tax assets are recorded when a determination is made that the deferred tax assets are not more likely than not to be realized in the future. In making that determination, on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis, we estimate our future taxable income based upon historical operating results and external market data. Future levels of taxable income are dependent upon, but not limited to, general economic conditions, competitive pressures and other factors beyond our control. As of December 31, 2011, we have determined that a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets of $6.7 million is required. If we should determine that we may be unable to realize our deferred tax assets to the extent reported, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be recorded in the period such determination is made.Consolidated Operating ResultsThe following table sets forth for the indicated periods certain items as a percentage of revenue: Year Ended December  31,(1) 2011 2010(2) 2009Revenue100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 %Cost of goods sold46.3 45.0 42.6Gross profit53.7 55.0 57.4Operating expenses:     Research and development9.5 8.4 8.0Selling, general and administrative23.8 20.6 19.2Total operating expenses33.4 29.0 27.1Earnings from operations20.3 26.0 30.3Interest expense0.4 0.2 0.6Interest income(0.1) (0.1) (0.2)Other income, net(0.1) (0.3) 0.2Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes20.1 26.1 29.7Income tax provision5.7 8.2 9.6Earnings from continuing operations14.4 17.9 20.1Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax(0.1) (0.0) —Net earnings14.3 % 17.9 % 20.1 %_______________ (1)Totals may not recompute due to rounding(2)Amounts have been adjusted for the reclassification of certain discontinued operations to continuing operations.The following discussion of operating results provides an overview of our operations by addressing key elements in our Consolidated Statements of Income. The “Segment Operating Results” section that follows describes the contributions of each of our business segments to our consolidated revenue and earnings from operations for 2011, 2010 and 2009. Given the nature of our business, we believe revenue and earnings from operations (including operating margin percentage) are most relevant to an understanding of our performance at a segment level. Additionally, at the segment level we disclose backlog, which represents orders received for products or services for which a sales agreement is in place and delivery is expected within twelve months.Revenue.    Revenue for 2011 totaled $1,544.1 million, an increase of 11.2 percent over 2010 revenue of $1,388.4 million. The increase was primarily due to increased revenue from our Thermal Vision and Measurement segment, revenues reported by Raymarine Holdings, Ltd. (“Raymarine”) which was acquired on May 14, 2010, and ICx Technologies, Inc. (“ICx”) which was acquired on October 4, 2010.  Excluding revenue from Raymarine and ICx, revenue for the year ended December 31, 2011 was flat compared to the same period in 2010.  Revenue from our Thermal Vision and Measurement segment increased by 14.9 percent in 2011 compared to the same period in 2010, while revenue from our Surveillance segment declined by 14.0 percent in 2011 compared to the same period in 2010.Revenue for 2010 totaled $1,388.4 million, an increase of 21.0 percent over 2009 revenue of $1,147.1 million. The increase was primarily due to a 16.9 percent increase in Thermal Vision and Measurement revenue, and the revenue reported by Raymarine and ICx. Revenues from the dates of acquisition for those businesses totaled $150.2 million. Excluding Raymarine and ICx, revenue for 2010 increased by 7.9 percent from 2009.International revenue in 2011 totaled $740.6 million, representing 48.0 percent of revenue. This compares with international revenue in 2010 which totaled $653.7 million, representing 47.1 percent of revenue and $474.8 million in 2009, representing 41.4 percent of revenue. While the sales mix between United States and international sales may fluctuate from year to year, we expect revenue from customers outside the United States to continue to comprise a significant portion of our total revenue on a long-term basis.28Gross profit.    Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $828.6 million compared to $763.6 million in 2010.  Gross margin, defined as gross profit divided by revenue, decreased slightly from 55.0 percent in 2010 to 53.7 percent in 2011.  The decrease in gross margin in 2011 was primarily due to lower gross margins at Raymarine and ICx business units  (which have historically lower gross margins than our other business segments) and the product mix in our Surveillance division, partially offset by the continued production efficiencies realized from increased volumes in our Thermal Vision and Measurement segment.  Excluding Raymarine and the ICx business units, gross margins were 57.4 percent and 56.8 percent in 2011 and 2010, respectively.Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $763.6 million compared to $658.5 million in 2009.   Gross margin decreased from 57.4 percent in 2009 to 55.0 percent in 2010.  The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to gross margins at Raymarine and ICx and the product mix in our Surveillance division, partially offset by production efficiencies related to increased volumes and lower production costs in our Thermal Vision and Measurement manufacturing facilities. Excluding Raymarine and ICx, gross margin was 56.8 percent of revenue in 2010.Cost of goods sold includes materials, labor and overhead costs incurred in the manufacturing of products and services sold in the period as well as warranty costs. Material costs include raw materials, purchased components and sub-assemblies, outside processing and inbound freight costs. Labor and overhead costs consist of direct and indirect manufacturing costs, including wages and fringe benefits, operating supplies, depreciation and amortization, occupancy costs, and purchasing, receiving and inspection costs.Research and development.    Research and development expenses were $147.2 million, or 9.5 percent of revenue in 2011, compared to $116.6 million, or 8.4 percent of revenue, in 2010, and $91.3 million, or 8.0 percent of revenue, in 2009. The increase in research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue in 2011 over 2010 and 2009 was due to increased investment in new product development as well as the research and development activity conducted by the acquired companies. We believe that spending levels are sufficient to support the development of new products and the continued growth of the business. We expect research and development expenses to be approximately 8 to 10 percent of revenue on a long-term basis.Selling, general and administrative expenses.    Selling, general and administrative expenses were $368.2 million, or 23.8 percent of revenue in 2011 compared to $286.7 million, or 20.6 percent of revenue, in 2010 and $219.9 million, or 19.2 percent of revenue, in 2009. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses from 2010 to 2011 was primarily due to the operating expenses related to businesses acquired during 2010 which represented $46.1 million of the increase, the payment of a $39 million litigation settlement in the second quarter of 2011, and increased spending in each of our business segments to drive future growth.  The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses from 2009 to 2010 was primarily due to increased spending in each of our business segments to support future growth, as well as the operating expenses of businesses acquired during 2009 and 2010, acquisition related costs incurred in 2010 of $9.2 million and a $3.0 million litigation settlement recorded in the third quarter of 2010. We anticipate selling, general and administrative expenses in the future to increase at a slower rate than revenue.Interest expense.    Interest expense totaled $5.5 million, $2.9 million and $6.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Interest expense in 2011 is primarily attributable to the interest expense associated with the $250 million aggregate principal amount of 3.75 percent senior unsecured notes due September 1, 2016 that were issued in August 2011 and the amortization of the costs related to the issuance of the notes.  Interest expense in 2010 is primarily attributable to interest on the convertible notes that were issued in June 2003, the amortization of the discounts recorded on the notes and the costs related to the issuance of the notes. The convertible notes were fully converted by June 2010.Interest income.    Interest income was $1.3 million, $1.3 million and $1.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The decrease in interest income in 2011 and 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily due to lower interest rates and less invested cash.Other income, net.    We reported other income of $2.1 million in 2011, $4.0 million in 2010 and other expense of $1.8 million in 2009. The other income in 2011 and 2010 is primarily currency transaction gain and rental income. The other expense in 2009 is primarily currency transaction losses offset by investment gains.Income taxes.    Our income tax provision was $88.4 million, $114.3 million and $110.2 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The effective tax rates for 2011, 2010 and 2009 were 28.4 percent, 31.5 percent and 32.4 percent, respectively. The mix in taxable income between our United States and international operations impacted the income tax provisions in each of these years. Our effective tax rate is lower than the United States federal tax rate of 35 percent because of lower foreign tax rates, the effect of foreign tax credits and other federal and state tax credits.At December 31, 2011, the Company had United States tax net operating loss carry-forwards totaling approximately $77.7 million which expire between 2025 and 2030. In addition, the Company has various state net operating loss carry-forwards totaling approximately $67.5 million which expire between 2012 and 2030. The federal and state net operating losses were generated by 29ICx Technologies, Inc. prior to being acquired by us in 2010.Tax benefits as described above are recorded as assets when the benefits are more likely than not to be recognized. To the extent that we assess the realization of such assets to not be more likely than not, a valuation allowance is required to be recorded. We believe that the net deferred tax assets of $41.8 million reflected on the December 31, 2011 Consolidated Balance Sheet are materially realizable based on future forecasts of taxable income over a relatively short time horizon, but we have determined that a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets of $6.7 million is required, primarily related to certain acquired net operating losses. A valuation allowance is required when it is more-likely-than-not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets may not be realized. A review of all available positive and negative evidence is considered, including past and future performance, the market environment in which the Company operates, utilization of tax attributes in the past, length of carryback and carryforward periods, and evaluation of potential tax planning strategies when evaluating the realizability of deferred tax assets.Discontinued operations.    Certain operations that were included in the acquisition of ICx have been identified as available for sale and their results are reported as discontinued operations.  In December 2011, we sold two of the ICx business units reported as discontinued operations.  In addition, we have written down the net assets to estimated market value of the two remaining business units classified as discontinued operations.  The net loss of $0.7 million on the sale, the write down of $3.0 million, and the operating losses of $1.3 million for the year have been included in the loss from discontinued operations, net of cumulative tax benefits of $3.8 million, on the Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2011. Segment Operating ResultsAs of January 1, 2011, we merged the Thermography and Commercial Vision Systems operating segments into the Thermal Vision and Measurement operating segment.  Raymarine was acquired on May 14, 2010, creating the Raymarine operating segment.  Finally, ICx was acquired on October 4, 2010 and the ICx operating segment that was reported through December 31, 2010 has since been separated into the Surveillance, Detection and Integrated Systems operating segments. As of January 1, 2011, the former Government Systems operating segment is also included in the Surveillance operating segment.Thermal Vision and MeasurementThermal Vision and Measurement operating results are as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009Revenue$660.3 $574.9 $491.8Earnings from operations194.7 163.7 122.2Operating margin29.5% 28.5% 24.9%Backlog136 135 111Revenue increased by 14.9 percent in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to increased unit deliveries from several of the segment’s product lines including thermography, cores and components, and maritime product lines. Earnings from operations increased by 18.9 percent due to the increase in revenue and manufacturing efficiencies resulting from higher production volumes and lower material costs on new products.Revenue increased by 16.9 percent in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to increased unit sales in our security, transportation and maritime product lines and the introduction in 2010 of the personal night vision systems products. Earnings from operations increased by 33.9 percent due to the increase in revenue and manufacturing efficiencies resulting from higher production volumes and lower material costs on new products.RaymarineRaymarine operating results are as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010Revenue$171.5 $104.1Earnings from operations11.9 8.3Operating margin6.9% 8.0%Backlog5 11Raymarine was acquired on May 14, 2010 and the operating results are for the period since the acquisition.

Lower revenue and increased segment operating expenses caused the decline in earnings from operations and operating margin from 2010 to 2011.  The earnings from operations include the impact of the amortization of intangible assets of $2.4 million and $0.6 million, and  the fair value adjustments on inventory of $2.6 million and $1.3 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively.  The fair value adjustment on inventory related to purchase price accounting and the adjustment was fully amortized in 2011. The decline in backlog from 2010 to 2011 was primarily due to the continued reduction in procurement activity by our U.S. government customers in 2011. Revenue increased by 2.4 percent in 2010 compared to 2009. Higher deliveries of ground-based products and the revenue from a business acquired in October 2009 was offset by decreases in revenue from airborne and maritime products as spending by U.S. government agencies declined in 2010. The change in product mix and increased operating expenses of the segment resulted in the decline in earnings from operations and operating margin from 2009 to 2010. The decline in backlog from 2009 to 2010 was primarily due to deliveries on U.S. government programs that were booked in prior years and the reduced procurement activity by our U.S. government customers in 2010.DetectionDetection operating results are as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010Revenue$79.9 $23.6Earnings from operations(5.6) (2.5)Operating margin(7.0)% (10.8)%Backlog25 20ICx was acquired on October 4, 2010 and the operating results are for the period since the acquisition.

The fair value adjustment on inventory related to purchase price accounting and the adjustment was fully amortized in 2011.31Liquidity and Capital ResourcesAt December 31, 2011, we had a total of $440.9 million in cash and cash equivalents, $263.6 million of which was in the United States and $177.3 million at our foreign subsidiaries compared to $77.9 million in the United States and $115.3 million at our foreign subsidiaries at December 31, 2010.  The increase in cash and cash equivalents in 2011was primarily due to the net proceeds of $247.7 million from the issuance of $250 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.75 percent senior unsecured notes due September 1, 2016 (the “Notes”), cash provided from operations and cash proceeds from our stock-based compensation programs, partially offset by capital expenditures, repurchases of our common stock, dividends paid during the period and business acquisitions.Cash provided by operating activities in 2011 totaled $243.9 million compared to $255.3 million in 2010 and $271.8 million in 2009. The decrease in cash provided from operating activities in 2011 was primarily due to the decrease in net earnings partially offset by the non-cash income charges for depreciation and amortization. The decrease in cash provided from operating activities in 2010 was primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable, inventories, and deferred tax assets, offset by an increase in net earnings compared to 2009.Cash used for investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2011 totaled $67.1 million, primarily consisting of the acquisition of Aerius Photonics, LLC for $27.0 million and capital expenditures of $42.0 million.  Capital expenditures in 2011 included the purchase of the building in Fareham, United Kingdom and building improvements for our facilities in Nashua, New Hampshire and Arninge, Sweden.  Cash used for investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2010 totaled $465.4 million, primarily consisting of the acquisitions of Raymarine for $174.7 million and ICx for $228.0 million and capital expenditures of $66.0 million. Capital expenditures in 2010 included the purchase of two buildings for $36.2 million. Cash used for investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2009 totaled $107.7 million, primarily consisting of the acquisitions of Salvador, OmniTech, and Directed Perception and capital expenditures of $41.9 million which include the purchase of a building for $9.7 million.Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2011 totaled $75.4 million, primarily consisting of the net proceeds of $247.7 million from the issuance of the Notes and cash provided from our stock-based compensation plans partially offset by the payment of dividends and repurchase of approximately 6.1 million shares of our common stock. Cash used from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2010 totaled $6.5 million, primarily consisting of the repurchase of approximately 1.3 million shares of our common stock, offset by proceeds from shares issued for, and tax benefits recognized from, our stock-based compensation plans. Cash provided from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2009 totaled $43.5 million, primarily consisting of the repurchase of approximately 3.2 million shares of our common stock, offset by proceeds from shares issued for, and tax benefits recognized from, our stock-based compensation plans.On October 6, 2006, we signed a Credit Agreement (“2006 Credit Agreement”) with Bank of America, N.A., Union Bank of California, N.A., U.S. Bank National Association and other Lenders. The 2006 Credit Agreement provided for a $300 million, five-year revolving line of credit. At December 31, 2010, we had no amounts outstanding under the 2006 Credit Agreement and had $6.5 million of letters of credit outstanding which reduced the total available credit. This credit facility was terminated on February 8, 2011.On July 7, 2010, we entered into an uncommitted letter of credit agreement with Bank of America to support letters of credit whose expiration would extend beyond the 2006 Credit Agreement.  At December 31, 2011 and 2010 the total value of the letters of credit outstanding under this facility was $0.6 million and $8.6 million, respectively.On February 8, 2011, we signed a new Credit Agreement (“Credit Agreement”) with Bank of America, N.A., U.S. Bank National Association, JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. and other Lenders. The Credit Agreement provides for a $200 million, five-year revolving line of credit. We have the right, subject to certain conditions including approval of additional commitments by qualified lenders, to increase the line of credit by an additional $150 million until February 8, 2016. The Credit Agreement allows us and certain designated subsidiaries to borrow in United States dollars, euro, kroner, pound sterling and other agreed upon currencies. The Credit Agreement requires us to pay a commitment fee on the amount of unused credit at a rate, based on the Company’s leverage ratio, which ranges from 0.25 percent to 0.40 percent. The Credit Agreement contains two financial covenants that require the maintenance of certain leverage ratios with which we were in compliance at December 31, 2011. The five-year revolving line of credit available under the Credit Agreement is unsecured.At December 31, 2011, we had no amounts outstanding under the  Credit Agreement and the commitment fee on the amount of unused credit was 0.25 percent.  We had $15.8 million of letters of credit o
