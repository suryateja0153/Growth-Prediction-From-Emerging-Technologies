International revenue accounted for approximately 50 percent, 50 percent and 49 percent of our revenue in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. We anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant percentage of revenue in the future. We have exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations and changing dynamics of foreign competitiveness based on variations in the value of the United States dollar relative to other currencies. Factors contributing to this variability include significant manufacturing activity in Europe, significant sales denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar, and cross currency fluctuations between such currencies as the United States dollar, euro, Swedish kronor and British pound sterling. The impact of those fluctuations is reflected throughout our consolidated financial statements, but in the aggregate, did not have a material impact on our results of operations in 2014.We experience fluctuations in orders and sales due to seasonal variations and customer sales cycles, such as the seasonal pattern of contracting by the United States and certain foreign governments, the desire of customers to take delivery of equipment prior to fiscal year ends due to funding considerations, and the tendency of commercial enterprises to fully utilize annual capital budgets prior to expiration. Such events have resulted and could continue to result in fluctuations in quarterly results in the future. As a result of such quarterly fluctuations in operating results, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance.We expect that macroeconomic factors, including reduced spending by United States government agencies and economic weaknesses in certain geographic markets, will continue to present challenges for us and render predictions regarding future performance difficult to make.Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates This discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, bad debts, inventories, goodwill, warranty obligations, contingencies and income taxes on an on-going basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. We believe the following critical accounting policies and the related judgments and estimates affect the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.30Revenue recognition.  The majority of our revenue is recognized upon shipment of the product to the customer at a fixed or determinable price and with a reasonable assurance of collection, passage of title to the customer as indicated by the shipping terms and fulfillment of all significant obligations.We design, market and sell our products primarily as commercial, off-the-shelf products. Certain customers request different system configurations, generally based on standard options or accessories that we offer. In general, our revenue arrangements do not involve acceptance provisions based upon customer specified acceptance criteria. In those circumstances when customer specified acceptance criteria exist, revenue is deferred until customer acceptance if we cannot demonstrate that the system meets those specifications prior to shipment. For any contracts with multiple elements (i.e., training, installation, additional parts, etc.) we allocate revenue among the deliverables primarily based upon objective and reliable evidence of fair value of each element in the arrangement. If objective and reliable evidence of fair value of any element is not available, we use an estimated selling price for purposes of allocating the total arrangement consideration among the elements. In addition, judgments are required in evaluating the credit worthiness of our customers. Credit is not extended to customers and revenue is not recognized until we have determined that collectability is reasonably assured.Allowance for doubtful accounts.  Our policy is to maintain allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. Credit limits are established through a process of reviewing the financial history and stability of each customer. Where appropriate, we obtain credit rating reports and financial statements of the customer when determining or modifying their credit limits. We regularly evaluate the collectability of our trade receivable balances based on a combination of factors. When a customer’s account balance becomes past due, we initiate dialogue with the customer to determine the cause. If it is determined that the customer will be unable to meet its financial obligation to us, such as in the case of a bankruptcy filing, deterioration in the customer’s operating results or financial position or other material events impacting their business, we record a specific allowance to reduce the related receivable to the amount we expect to recover given all information presently available. Actual write-offs during the past three years have not been material to our results of operations.We also record an allowance for all other customers based on certain other factors including the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience with individual customers. As of December 31, 2014, our accounts receivable balance of $354.7 million is reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts of $8.0 million. We believe our reported allowances at December 31, 2014, are adequate. If the financial conditions of those customers were to deteriorate, however, resulting in their inability to make payments, we may need to record additional allowances that would result in additional selling, general and administrative expenses being recorded for the period in which such determination is made.Inventory.  Our policy is to record inventory write-downs when conditions exist that indicate that our inventories are likely to be in excess of anticipated demand or are obsolete based upon our assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions. We regularly evaluate the ability to realize the value of our inventories based on a combination of factors including the following: historical usage rates, forecasted sales or usage, product end of life dates, estimated current and future market values and new product introductions. Purchasing requirements and alternative usages are evaluated within these processes to mitigate inventory exposure. When recorded, our write-downs are intended to reduce the carrying value of our inventories to their net realizable value and establish a new cost basis. As of December 31, 2014, our inventories of $320.6 million are stated net of inventory write-downs. If actual demand for our products deteriorates or market conditions are less favorable than those that we project, additional inventory write-downs may be required in the future.Goodwill.  Goodwill represents the excess purchase price of an acquired enterprise or assets over the estimated fair value of identifiable net assets acquired. We assess goodwill for potential impairment at the reporting unit level during the third quarter of each year, or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets exceeds their fair value. We may assess qualitative factors to make this determination, or bypass such a qualitative assessment and proceed directly to testing goodwill for impairment using a two-step process. Qualitative factors we may consider include, but are not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry conditions, the competitive environment, changes in the market for our products and services, regulatory and political developments and entity specific factors such as strategies and financial performance.  If there are indicators that goodwill has been impaired we proceed to a two-step impairment test, whereby the first step is comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value, goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is performed. The second step is performed if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. If the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment loss equal to the difference is recorded. Our impairment test in the current year did not indicate an impairment of goodwill in any of our reporting units.31Product warranties.  Our products are sold with warranty provisions that require us to remedy deficiencies in quality or performance of our products over a specified period of time, generally twelve to twenty-four months, at no cost to our customers. Our policy is to record warranty liabilities at levels that represent our estimate of the costs that will be incurred to fulfill those warranty requirements at the time that revenue is recognized. We believe that our recorded liability of $16.2 million at December 31, 2014 is adequate to cover our future cost of materials, labor and overhead for the servicing of our products sold through that date. If actual product failures or material or service delivery costs differ from our estimates, our warranty liability would need to be revised accordingly.Contingencies.  We are subject to the possibility of loss contingencies arising in the normal course of business. We consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted.Income taxes.  We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of the assets and liabilities measured using the enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances against deferred tax assets are recorded when a determination is made that the deferred tax assets are not more likely than not to be realized in the future. In making that determination, on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis, we estimate our future taxable income based upon historical operating results and external market data. Future levels of taxable income are dependent upon, but not limited to, general economic conditions, competitive pressures and other factors beyond our control. As of December 31, 2014, we have determined that a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets of $13.3 million is required. If we should determine that we may be unable to realize our deferred tax assets to the extent reported, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be recorded in the period such determination is made.32Consolidated Operating ResultsThe following table sets forth for the indicated periods certain items as a percentage of revenue: Year Ended December 31,(1) 2014 2013 2012Revenue100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 %Cost of goods sold51.0 50.7 47.7Gross profit49.0 49.3 52.3Operating expenses:     Research and development9.3 9.9 9.8Selling, general and administrative21.7 21.6 20.8Restructuring expenses1.1 1.7 0.1Total operating expenses32.1 33.2 30.7Earnings from operations16.9 16.1 21.6Interest expense1.0 0.9 0.8Interest income(0.1) (0.1) (0.1)Other (income) expense, net(0.2) (0.1) 0.1Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes16.3 15.3 20.8Income tax provision3.2 3.5 4.7Earnings from continuing operations13.1 11.8 16.0Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax— — (0.2)Net earnings13.1 % 11.8 % 15.8 %_______________ (1)Totals may not recompute due to rounding.The following discussion of operating results provides an overview of our operations by addressing key elements in our Consolidated Statements of Income. The “Segment Operating Results” section that follows describes the contributions of each of our business segments to our consolidated revenue and earnings from operations for 2014, 2013 and 2012. Given the nature of our business, we believe revenue and earnings from operations (including operating margin percentage) are most relevant to an understanding of our performance at a segment level. Additionally, at the segment level we disclose backlog, which represents orders received for products or services for which a sales agreement is in place and delivery is expected within twelve months.33Revenue.  Revenue for 2014 totaled $1,530.7 million, an increase of 2.3 percent from 2013 revenue of $1,496.4 million. Year over year revenue growth was primarily due to increases in our commercially-oriented segments of Instruments, OEM and Emerging Markets, Maritime and Security offset by declines in our Surveillance and Detection segments. Continued reductions in demand for certain products from United States government agencies resulted in decreased revenues in our Surveillance and Detection segments. Revenue from United States government customers declined by $44.5 million from 2013 to 2014.Revenue for 2013 totaled $1,496.4 million, an increase of 6.5 percent over 2012 revenue of $1,405.4 million. Most of our operating segments reported increases in year over year revenues.  Revenue in 2013 also included revenue from our December 2012 acquisitions of Lorex and Traficon. Revenue from the United States government customers declined by $18.6 million from 2012 to 2013.International revenue in 2014 totaled $766.7 million, representing 50.1 percent of revenue. This compares with international revenue in 2013 which totaled $740.7 million, representing 49.5 percent of revenue, and $687.5 million in 2012, representing 48.9 percent of revenue. While the sales mix between United States and international sales may fluctuate from year to year, we expect revenue from customers outside the United States to continue to comprise a significant portion of our total revenue on a long-term basis.Cost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 was $780.3 million and $759.4 million, respectively. The increase is primarily due to the increase in revenues year over year as discussed above and changes in product mix. For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, cost of goods sold included $0.6 million and $1.7 million, respectively, of inventory write downs related to our restructuring activities.Cost of goods sold in 2013 was $759.4 million, compared to cost of goods sold of $670.2 million in 2012. The year over year increase in cost of goods sold primarily relates to the higher year over year revenues and changes in product mix. Cost of goods sold includes materials, labor and overhead costs incurred in the manufacturing of products and services sold in the period as well as warranty costs. Material costs include raw materials, purchased components and sub-assemblies, outside processing and inbound freight costs. Labor and overhead costs consist of direct and indirect manufacturing costs, including wages and fringe benefits, operating supplies, depreciation and amortization, occupancy costs, and purchasing, receiving and inspection costs.Gross profit.  Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $750.4 million compared to $737.0 million in 2013. Gross margin, defined as gross profit divided by revenue, decreased slightly from 49.3 percent in 2013 to 49.0 percent in 2014. Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $737.0 million compared to $735.2 million in 2012.  Gross margin decreased from 52.3 percent in 2012 to 49.3 percent in 2013. The decrease in gross margin in 2013 was primarily due to the unfavorable product mix in our Surveillance and Instruments segments and the inclusion of lower gross margin revenues from our acquisition of Lorex.Research and development.  Research and development expenses were $142.8 million, or 9.3 percent of revenue, in 2014, compared to $147.7 million, or 9.9 percent of revenue, in 2013, and $137.4 million, or 9.8 percent of revenue, in 2012. The increase in research and development expenses in 2013 was partially due to the costs associated with the development of several new products primarily in our Instruments and OEM and Emerging Markets segments and the operations of Lorex and Traficon.We believe that spending levels are sufficient to support the development of new products and the continued growth of the business. We expect research and development expenses to be approximately 8 to 10 percent of revenue on a long-term basis.Selling, general and administrative expenses.  Selling, general and administrative expenses were $332.0 million, or 21.7 percent of revenue, in 2014 compared to $322.7 million, or 21.6 percent of revenue, in 2013 and $292.5 million, or 20.8 percent of revenue, in 2012. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2014 was primarily due to increases in marketing spending and a $13.8 million increase in corporate expenses largely related to higher legal expenses incurred for litigation matters in the ordinary course of business and anticipated costs of a regulatory settlement, partially offset by costs savings arising as a result of our restructuring activities.  The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2013 was primarily due to higher compensation expense and the inclusion of expenses of Lorex and Traficon. While selling, general and administrative 34expenses may be affected in the future by acquisitions with different cost structures, we anticipate selling, general and administrative expenses to increase at a slower rate than revenue in our existing businesses.Restructuring expenses. During the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we recorded net pre-tax restructuring expenses totaling $17.0 million, $27.5 million and $2.0 million, respectively. Of the restructuring expenses recorded in 2014, $16.4 million was recorded in operating expenses and $0.6 million was recorded in costs of goods sold.  Of the restructuring expenses recorded in 2013, $25.8 million was recorded in operating expenses and $1.7 million was included in costs of goods sold. In the fourth quarter of 2013, we initiated a realignment plan that included closing six not-to-scale sites in the United States and Europe and a transfer of those operations to larger facilities. We also consolidated our optics and laser manufacturing businesses to better realize the benefits of vertical integration in these areas. The total costs expected to be incurred related to the realignment plan is approximately $45 million and we expect to complete the majority of the actions and recognize the remaining expenses of approximately $0.7 million during the year ending December 31, 2015.In 2012, we also recorded restructuring expenses associated with the relocation of one of our manufacturing facilities in Europe to an existing facility in the United States. Interest expense.  Interest expense totaled $14.6 million, $14.1 million and $11.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Interest expense is primarily attributable to the $250 million aggregate principal amount of 3.75 percent senior unsecured notes due September 1, 2016 that were issued in August 2011 and the amortization of the costs related to the issuance of the notes and the $150 million term loan that was drawn on April 5, 2013.Income taxes.  Our income tax provision was $49.3 million, $52.0 million and $66.6 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The effective tax rates for 2014, 2013 and 2012 were 19.7 percent, 22.7 percent and 22.8 percent, respectively. The mix in taxable income between our United States and international operations has a significant impact on our annual income tax provision and effective tax rates. Our effective tax rate is lower than the United States federal tax rate of 35 percent because of lower foreign tax rates, the effect of foreign, federal and state tax credits and other discrete items such as the release of previously recorded tax reserves related to tax positions that are no longer required due to closure of statute or audit settlements and amended tax filings. The decrease in the effective tax rate from 2013 to 2014 was primarily due to a larger amount of favorable discrete items recognized in 2014.  We expect the effective tax rate for 2015 to be approximately 24 percent excluding discrete items. At December 31, 2014, we had United States tax net operating loss carry-forwards totaling approximately $16.9 million which expire between 2018 and 2031. In addition, we have various state net operating loss carry-forwards totaling approximately $49.6 million which expire between 2015 and 2033. The federal and state net operating losses were primarily generated by ICx Technologies, Inc. prior to being acquired by us in 2010. Finally, we have various foreign net operating loss carry-forwards totaling approximately $74.5 million which expire between 2018 and 2033.Tax benefits as described above are recorded as assets when the benefits are more likely than not to be recognized. To the extent that we assess the realization of such assets to not be more likely than not, a valuation allowance is required to be recorded. As of December 31, 2014, we have determined that a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets of $13.3 million is required, primarily related to certain acquired net operating losses. A review of all available positive and negative evidence is considered, including past and future performance, the market environment in which we operate, utilization of tax attributes in the past, length of carryback and carryforward periods, and evaluation of potential tax planning strategies, when evaluating whether the deferred tax assets will be realized.Discontinued operations.  In 2010, in connection with the acquisition of ICx, we began to pursue the sale of certain business units of ICx and the results of operations for such business units were reported as discontinued operations until their respective dispositions. During the second quarter of 2012, we sold the remaining two business units reported as discontinued operations. The operating losses of those operations, including insignificant associated losses recognized subsequent to their disposal, and the net losses on the sales of the units, net of tax are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2012. 35Segment Operating ResultsEffective January 1, 2014, we realigned our business which resulted in the elimination of our former divisional structure and the formation of six reportable operating segments.  The results for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 have been reclassified to conform to the presentation for the year ended December 31, 2014.  The following discusses the operating results of each segment for that three year period.SurveillanceSurveillance operating results are as follows (in millions, except percentages): Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012   (as reclassified) (as reclassified)Revenue$492.2 $531.3 $560.2Earnings from operations113.0 122.1 170.0Operating margin23.0% 23.0% 30.4%Backlog295 282 332Surveillance revenue decreased by 7.4 percent in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to the continued reductions in demand from U.S. government funded customers. Earnings from operations decreased by 7.4 percent primarily due to the decrease of revenue partially offset by cost savings generated as a result of restructuring activities.Revenue decreased by 5.1 percent in 2013 compared to 2012, primarily due to the reductions in demand from U.S. government funded customers.  Earnings from operations decreased by 28.2 percent due to lower revenues, lower gross margins resulting from changes in product mix and restructuring charges of $5.4 million.  The backlog decline in 2013 was also a result of reduced U.S. government procurement activity.InstrumentsInstruments operating results are as follows (in millions, except percentages): Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012   (as reclassified) (as reclassified)Revenue$354.1 $337.5 $339.0Earnings from operations99.0 81.1 87.1Operating margin27.9% 24.0% 25.7%Backlog35 27 31Instruments segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased by 4.9 percent compared to 2013. The year over year increase in revenue is primarily due to increased deliveries in most geographic regions and across most product lines, particularly for products introduced late in 2013 and in 2014.  The increase in earnings from operations for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013 is primarily due to higher revenues, lower restructuring expenses and cost savings generated from those restructuring activities.  Instruments segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2013 decreased slightly by 0.4 percent, compared to 2012, primarily due to weak market conditions in Europe.  Earnings from operations in 2013 decreased by 7.0 percent compared to 2012 primarily due to lower revenue resulting in lower gross profit and $15.5 million of restructuring expenses recorded in 2013.36OEM and Emerging MarketsOEM and Emerging Markets operating results are as follows (in millions, except percentages): Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012   (as reclassified) (as reclassified)Revenue$226.9 $207.2 $195.0Earnings from operations64.4 52.7 62.0Operating margin28.4% 25.4% 31.8%Backlog132 129 126OEM and Emerging Markets segment revenue increased by 9.5 percent in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to increased deliveries to customers in the U.S., particularly of uncooled camera cores and newly introduced mobile accessories.  Earnings from operations increased by 22.2 percent due to the increase in  revenues and cost savings from restructuring activities.Revenue increased by 6.3 percent in 2013 compared to 2012, primarily due to the inclusion of revenue of Traficon in 2013. Earnings from operations declined by 15.0 percent due to lower gross margins resulting from a change in segment product mix.MaritimeMaritime operating results are as follows (in millions, except percentages): Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012   (as reclassified) (as reclassified)Revenue$192.6 $189.1 $178.3Earnings from operations24.5 22.3 18.5Operating margin12.7% 11.8% 10.4%Backlog17 11 6Maritime segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased by 1.9 percent compared to 2013, which was primarily due to higher deliveries in Europe and year over year unit volume increases from Raymarine-branded product lines.Maritime segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased by 6.0 percent compared to the same period of 2012, primarily due to increased deliveries in the Americas and Europe, partially related to new product introductions.  The increase in earnings from operations in 2013 was primarily due to realizing the benefit in 2013 of cost containment efforts taken during 2012 and higher revenues in 2013.SecuritySecurity operating results are as follows (in millions, except percentages): Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012   (as reclassified) (as reclassified)Revenue$179.1 $141.0 $52.0Earnings from operations24.9 17.3 15.1Operating margin13.9% 12.3% 29.1%Backlog18 10 137Security segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased by 27.0 percent. The increase was primarily due  to increased deliveries in all product families and expanded distribution.  The increase of earnings from operations of 43.4 percent was primarily due to the increase in year over year revenues, partially offset by increased marketing, customer technical support and product development expenses.  The increase in backlog was primarily due to an increase in orders from international customers which often have longer delivery times.  Security segment revenue and earnings from operations for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased by 171.1 percent and 14.6 percent over 2012, respectively, primarily due to the inclusion of the operating results of Lorex in 2013.DetectionDetection operating results are as follows (in millions, except percentages): Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012   (as reclassified) (as reclassified)Revenue$85.7 $90.2 $80.9Earnings from operations11.0 8.9 0.6Operating margin12.8% 9.9% 0.7%Backlog51 30 24Detection segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 decreased by 5.0 percent. The decline in year over year revenue in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to reduced deliveries to U.S. customers across most product lines.  The increase in earnings from operations in 2014 was primarily due to realizing the benefit in 2014 from restructuring measures taken in 2013.  The increase in backlog was due to a large contract with a U.S. customer that calls for deliveries in 2015.Detection segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased by 11.6 percent over 2012, primarily due to $5.5 million of deliveries on a major program in 2013.38Liquidity and Capital ResourcesAt December 31, 2014, we had a total of $531.4 million in cash and cash equivalents, $164.1 million of which was in the United States and $367.3 million at our foreign subsidiaries, compared to cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2013 of $542.5 million, of which $221.0 million was in the United States and $321.5 million at our foreign subsidiaries. We intend to indefinitely reinvest the cash at our foreign subsidiaries in operations and other activities outside the United States. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents in 2014 was primarily due to cash from operations of $226.2 million being offset primarily by $139.2 million spent for the repurchase of shares of our common stock, $61.3 million spent on capital expenditures, and dividends paid of $56.5 million during 2014.Cash provided by operating activities in 2014 totaled $226.2 million compared to $355.0 million in 2013 and $285.5 million in 2012. The decrease in cash provided from operations in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to lower net collections of accounts receivable. The increase in cash provided from operations in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to higher net collections of accounts receivable and a decrease in our inventories. Cash used for investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 totaled $49.3 million, primarily consisting of capital expenditures of $61.3 million, partially offset by $12.0 million of proceeds from the sale of certain tangible assets and intellectual property related to the design and manufacturing of non-thermal micro-optics.  Cash used for investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 totaled $72.1 million, primarily consisting of capital expenditures of $52.1 million and the acquisition of Marine and Remote Sensing Solutions, Ltd. for $3.2 million and the acquisition of certain tangible assets and intellectual property related to the design and manufacturing of wafer-level optics from DigitalOptics Corporation East for $14.9 million. Capital expenditures in 2013 included equipment purchases in the OEM & Emerging Markets segment related to the development of our new Lepton camera core. Capital expenditures of $58.1 million in 2012 included building improvements for our facilities in Nashua, New Hampshire, Taby, Sweden and Croissy-Beaubourg, France and equipment requirements for existing and future product lines. Cash used by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 totaled $152.0 million, primarily consisting of the repur
