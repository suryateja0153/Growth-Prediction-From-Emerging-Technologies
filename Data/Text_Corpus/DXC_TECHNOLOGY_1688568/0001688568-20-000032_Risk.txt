Risk Factors "Our credit rating and ability to manage working capital, refinance and raise additional capital for future needs, could adversely affect our liquidity, capital position, borrowing, cost and access to capital markets."See Note 22 - "Commitments and Contingencies" for a discussion of the general purpose of guarantees and commitments. The anticipated sources of funds to fulfill such commitments are listed below.LiquidityWe expect our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to meet our normal operating requirements for the next 12 months. We expect to continue using cash generated by operations as a primary source of liquidity; however, should we require funds greater than that generated from our operations to fund discretionary investment activities, such as business acquisitions, we have the ability to raise capital through the issuance of capital market debt instruments such as commercial paper, term loans, and bonds. In addition, we currently utilize, and will further utilize, our cross currency cash pool for liquidity needs. However, there is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain debt financing, if required, on terms and conditions acceptable to us, if at all, in the future.Our exposure to operational liquidity risk is primarily from long-term contracts which require significant investment of cash during the initial phases of the contracts. The recovery of these investments is over the life of the contract and is dependent upon our performance as well as customer acceptance.48The following table summarizes our total liquidity:  As of(in millions) March 31, 2020Cash and cash equivalents $3,679Available borrowings under our revolving credit facility 2,500Total liquidity  $6,179During March 2020 as the evolving global COVID-19 pandemic crisis resulted in increasing government actions to shut down economic activity and enforce stay-at-home orders, global capital markets were disrupted and became tumultuous, including the near shut down of commercial paper markets for issuers such as the Company as short-term fixed income investors prepared for potential redemptions. On March 24, 2020, the Company announced the draw-down of $1.5 billion from its Revolving Credit Facility due 2025 in order to increase cash on hand and eliminate the reliance on commercial paper markets along with the suspension of the Company’s Euro and USD commercial paper program until the Company deems such capital markets stabilized and reliable. As a result, the Company’s commercial paper outstanding was reduced to $542 million as of March 31, 2020, and another $318 million is scheduled to mature during the quarter ending June 30, 2020, which the Company currently expects to fund such maturing Euro commercial paper from its cash on hand. While central bank actions have improved liquidity in commercial paper markets overall, there is no assurance that the Company, at its commercial program ratings of P2/F2, will have reliable access in the future or if accessible, at reasonable costs.On April 6, 2020 subsequent to the fiscal period end, the Company drew the entire $2.5 billion remaining availability under its Revolving Credit Facilities, in order to secure liquidity as additional cash on hand to support the Company’s liquidity resources during the COVID pandemic crisis and to mitigate the uncertainties caused by volatile capital markets, changing governmental policies, and evolving impact on world economies.Subsequent to the end of the fiscal period, the Company issued $1.0 billion in principal amount of Senior Notes in the form of $500 million principal amount of 4.0% Senior Notes due 2023 and $500 million principal amount of 4.125% Senior Notes due 2025. All the net proceeds from the Notes offerings were applied towards the early prepayment of the Company’s term loan facilities, including prepayment of €500 million of Euro Term Loan due fiscal 2022, £150 million of GBP Term Loan due fiscal 2022, A$300 million of AUD Term Loan due fiscal 2022, and $100 million of USD Term Loan due fiscal 2025.On May 15, 2020, the Company agreed with its lenders and modified the definition of Leverage Ratio to be measured on a “net of cash” basis across all of the Company’s bank credit and term loan facilities, and for such newly defined Leverage Ratio limitation of Total Consolidated Net Indebtedness to Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization, as defined in such credit and term loan facilities, currently at 3.0x, to be reduced to 2.25x thereafter beginning the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022 (with the first quarterly measurement date as of June 30, 2021). The net effect of such adjustment to the Leverage Ratio definition in the Company’s credit and term loan facilities is to allow the Company the flexibility to maintain elevated cash balances going forward both during current circumstances and thereafter, without constraining the Company’s strategy of maintaining strong access to liquidity during the COVID pandemic crisis. The Company’s credit and term loan facilities that were modified include: $4.0 billion Revolving Credit Facilities due fiscal year 2025 (including a $70 million sub-tranche due fiscal 2024), €250 million Euro Term Loan due fiscal year 2022 (a substantial portion was extended to mature in fiscal year 2023 pursuant to the Euro Term Loan Extension, see below), €750 million Euro Term Loan due fiscal year 2023 (a substantial portion was extended to mature in fiscal year 2024 pursuant to the Euro Term Loan Extension, see below), £300 million in GBP Term Loan due fiscal year 2022, A$500 million in AUD Term Loan due fiscal year 2022, and approximately $382 million in outstanding USD Term Loan due fiscal year 2025.49On May 15, 2020, the Company initiated elective extension amendments in accordance with the terms of the aggregate €1.0 billion principal amount of Euro Term Loans outstanding. Accordingly, €216.7 million out of €250 million Euro Term Loan due fiscal year 2022 agreed to extend maturity 12-months to mature fiscal year 2023, and €700 million out of total €750 million Euro Term Loan due fiscal year 2023 agreed to extend maturity 12-months to mature fiscal year 2024. Margin would increase during the 12-month extension terms to Euribor + 125bps and Euribor + 175bps respectively, for the Euro Term Loans originally due fiscal years 2022 and 2023, which would be an increase from the current applicable margin of Euribor + 65bps, and Euribor + 80 bps, respectively. There is no change to current margin or terms through the original maturity term of the Euro Term Loans.The debt maturity chart below summarizes the future maturities of long-term debt principal taking into effect borrowings and prepayments as mentioned above, for fiscal years subsequent to May 15, 2020, and excludes maturities of borrowings for assets acquired under long-term financing and capitalized lease liabilities.Share RepurchasesDuring fiscal 2018, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2.0 billion of our common stock and during fiscal 2019, we announced that our Board of Directors had approved an incremental $2.0 billion share repurchase authorization. An expiration date has not been established for this repurchase plan. During fiscal 2020, we repurchased 15,933,651 shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $736 million. See Note 15 - "Stockholders' Equity" for more information.DividendsDuring fiscal 2020, our Board of Directors declared aggregate cash dividends to our stockholders of $0.84 per share, or approximately $219 million. To enhance our financial flexibility under current uncertain market conditions, we have elected to suspend payment of a quarterly dividend. This decision will be reevaluated by the Board of DXC Technology as market conditions stabilize.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsIn the normal course of business, we are a party to arrangements that include guarantees, the receivables securitization facility and certain other financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk, such as letters of credit and surety bonds. We also use performance letters of credit to support various risk management insurance policies. No liabilities related to these arrangements are reflected in balance sheets. See Note 5 - "Receivables" and Note 22 - "Commitments and Contingencies" for additional information regarding these off-balance sheet arrangements. 50Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations as of March 31, 2020, were as follows:(in millions) Less than 1 year 2-3 years 4-5 years More than5 years TotalDebt(1) $290 $3,698 $2,870 $1,458 $8,316Capitalized lease liabilities 444 510 92 — 1,046Operating Leases(2)  508 645 325 221 1,699Purchase Obligations(3) 1,911 1,180 286 — 3,377U.S. Tax Reform - Transition Tax(4) 24 46 102 73 245Interest and preferred dividend payments(5) 253 441 325 159 1,178Total(6) $3,430 $6,520 $4,000 $1,911 $15,861        (1) Amounts represent scheduled principal payments of long-term debt and mandatory redemption of preferred stock of a consolidated subsidiary.(2) Amounts represent present value of operating leases including imputed interests. See Note 6 - "Leases" for more information.(3) Includes long-term purchase agreements with certain software, hardware, telecommunication and other service providers and exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty. If we do not meet the specified service minimums, we may have an obligation to pay the service provider a portion of or the entire shortfall.(4) The transition tax resulted in recording a total transition tax obligation of $288 million, of which $290 million was recorded as income tax liability and $2 million recorded as a reduction in our unrecognized tax benefits, which has been omitted from this table. The transition tax is payable over eight years; 8% of net tax liability in each of years 1-5, 15% in year 6, 20% in year 7, and 25% in year 8. We have made our first two payments. See Note 12 - "Income Taxes" for additional information about the transition tax. See Note 12 - "Income Taxes" for additional information about the estimated liability related to unrecognized tax benefits, which has been omitted from this table.(5) Amounts represent scheduled interest payments on long-term debt and scheduled dividend payments associated with the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock of a consolidated subsidiary excluding contingent dividends associated with the participation and variable appreciation premium features. Also included are scheduled interest payments of $246 million on new borrowings from our credit facility agreement subsequent to period end. See Note 23 - "Subsequent Events" for more information.(6) See Note 14 - "Pension and Other Benefit Plans" for the estimated liability related to estimated future benefit payments under our Pension and OPEB plans that have been omitted from this table.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements, in accordance with GAAP, requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. These estimates may change in the future if underlying assumptions or factors change. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from our estimates under different assumptions, judgments or conditions. We consider the following policies to be critical because of their complexity and the high degree of judgment involved in implementing them: revenue recognition, income taxes, business combinations, defined benefit plans and valuation of assets. We have discussed the selection of our critical accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors.51Revenue RecognitionMost of our revenues are recognized based on objective criteria and do not require significant estimates that may change over time. However, some arrangements may require significant estimates, including contracts which include multiple performance obligations.Contracts with Multiple performance obligationsMany of our contracts require us to provide a range of services or performance obligations to our customers, which may include a combination of services, products or both. As a result, significant judgment may be required to determine the appropriate accounting, including whether the elements specified in contracts with multiple performance obligations should be treated as separate performance obligations for revenue recognition purposes, and, when considered appropriate, how the total transaction price should be allocated among the performance obligations and the timing of revenue recognition for each. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the contract’s transaction price to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract. Other than software sales involving multiple performance obligations, the primary method used to estimate standalone selling price is the expected cost plus a margin approach, under which we forecast our expected costs of satisfying a performance obligation and then add an appropriate margin for that distinct good or service. Certain of our contracts involve the sale of DXC proprietary software, post contract customer support and other software-related services. The standalone selling price generally is determined for each performance obligation using an adjusted market assessment approach based on the price charged where each deliverable is sold separately. In certain limited cases (typically for software licenses) when the historical selling price is highly variable, the residual approach is used. This approach allocates revenue to the performance obligation equal to the difference between the total transaction price and the observable standalone selling prices for the other performance obligations. These methods involve significant judgments and estimates that we assess periodically by considering market and entity-specific factors, such as type of customer, features of the products or services and market conditions.Once the total revenues have been allocated to the various performance obligations, revenues for each are recognized based on the relevant revenue recognition method for each. Estimates of total revenues at contract inception often differ materially from actual revenues due to volume differences, changes in technology or other factors which may not be foreseen at inception.Costs to obtain contracts with customersAccounting for the costs to obtain contracts with customers requires significant judgments and estimates with regards to the determination of sales commission payments that qualify for deferral of costs and the related amortization period. Most of our sales commission plans are quota-based and payments are made by achieving targets related to a large number of new and renewed contracts. Certain sales commissions earned by our sales force are considered incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a customer. We defer and amortize these costs on a straight-line basis over an average period of benefit of five years, which is determined and regularly assessed by considering the length of our customer contracts, our technology and other factors. Significant changes in these estimates or impairment may result if material contracts terminate earlier than the expected benefit period, or if there are material changes in the average contract period.Income TaxesWe are subject to income taxes in the United States (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, analyzing our income tax reserves, the determination of the likelihood of recoverability of deferred tax assets and any corresponding adjustment of valuation allowances. In addition, our tax returns are routinely audited, and settlements of issues raised in these audits sometimes affect our tax provisions.  As a global enterprise, our ETR is affected by many factors, including our global mix of earnings among countries with differing statutory tax rates, the extent to which our non-U.S. earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S., changes in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, changes in tax regulations, acquisitions, dispositions and the tax characteristics of our income. We cannot predict what our ETR will be in the future because there is uncertainty regarding these factors. 52The majority of unremitted earnings has been taxed in the U.S. through the transition tax and global intangible low tax income tax in connection with 2017 U.S. tax reform. The Company was not permanently reinvested in all jurisdictions with the exception of India as of March 31, 2019. As a result of the issuance of new U.S. Treasury regulations in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company changed its permanent reinvestment assertion in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 with respect to certain foreign corporations, reducing the amount that will ultimately be repatriated to the U.S. by approximately $492 million. However, as of March 31, 2020, the Company anticipates that future earnings in India will not be indefinitely reinvested. This change resulted from the Company's determination that it is now efficient to repatriate earnings in India as a result of the enactment of India Finance Act, 2020 on March 27, 2020 and change in cash needs resulting from the economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect a significant portion of the cash held by our foreign subsidiaries will no longer be subject to U.S. federal income tax upon repatriation to the U.S., however, a portion of this cash may still be subject to foreign and U.S. state tax consequences when remitted.Considerations impacting the recoverability of deferred tax assets include the period of expiration of the tax asset, planned use of the tax asset and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction to which the tax asset relates. In determining whether the deferred tax assets are realizable, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, taxable income in prior carryback years, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. We recorded a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets of approximately $2.2 billion as of March 31, 2020 due to uncertainties related to the ability to utilize these assets. However, valuation allowances are subject to change in future reporting periods due to changes in various factors. Recent enactment of the CARES Act or changes in tax laws resulting from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s multi-jurisdictional plan of action to address “base erosion and profit shifting” could impact our effective tax rate. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex changing tax regulations. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the CARES Act. The CARES Act makes a technical correction to the 2017 U.S. tax reform to provide a 15-year recovery period for qualified improvement property ("QIP"). This correction makes QIP eligible for bonus depreciation and is effective as if enacted as part of the 2017 U.S. tax reform. Accordingly, the Company has applied bonus depreciation on certain QIP. CARES also includes provisions relating to refundable payroll tax credits, the ability to utilize and carryback certain net operating losses, alternative minimum tax refunds, and modifications to rules regarding the deductibility of net interest expense. Business CombinationsWe account for the acquisition of a business using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires us to estimate the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. This includes acquired intangible assets such as customer-related intangibles, the liabilities assumed and contingent consideration, if any. Liabilities assumed may include litigation and other contingency reserves existing at the time of acquisition and require judgment in ascertaining the related fair values. Independent appraisals may be used to assist in the determination of the fair value of certain assets and liabilities. Such appraisals are based on significant estimates provided by us, such as forecasted revenues or profits utilized in determining the fair value of contract-related acquired intangible assets or liabilities. Significant changes in assumptions and estimates subsequent to completing the allocation of the purchase price to the assets and liabilities acquired, as well as differences in actual and estimated results, could result in material impacts to our financial results. Adjustments to the fair value of contingent consideration are recorded in earnings. Additional information related to the acquisition date fair value of acquired assets and liabilities obtained during the allocation period, not to exceed one year, may result in changes to the recorded values of acquired assets and liabilities, resulting in an offsetting adjustment to the goodwill associated with the business acquired.Defined Benefit Plans The computation of our pension and other post-retirement benefit costs and obligations is dependent on various assumptions. Inherent in the application of the actuarial methods are key assumptions, including discount rates, expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, mortality rates, rates of compensation increases and medical cost trend rates. Our management evaluates these assumptions annually and updates assumptions as necessary. The fair value of assets is determined based on observable inputs for similar assets or on significant unobservable inputs if not available. Two of the most significant assumptions are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate. Our weighted average rates used were:  March 31, 2020 March 31, 2019 March 31, 2018Discount rates 2.4% 2.5% 2.5%Expected long-term rates of return on assets 5.8% 5.3% 4.9%The assumption for the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is impacted by the expected asset mix of the plan; judgments regarding the correlation between historical excess returns and future excess returns and expected investment expenses. The discount rate assumption is based on current market rates for high-quality, fixed income debt instruments with maturities similar to the expected duration of the benefit payment period. The following table provides the impact changes in the weighted-average assumptions would have had on our net periodic pension benefits and settlement and contractual termination charges for fiscal 2020:(in millions) Change Approximate Change in Net Periodic Pension Expense Approximate Change in Settlement, Contractual Termination, and Mark-to-Market ChargesExpected long-term return on plan assets 0.5% $(55) $54Expected long-term return on plan assets (0.5)% $55 $(54)       Discount rate 0.5% $25 $(793)Discount rate (0.5)% $(29) $994Valuation of AssetsWe review long-lived ("assets, intangible assets, and goodwill") for impairment in accordance with our accounting policy disclosed in Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Assessing the fair value of assets involves significant estimates and assumptions including estimation of future cash flows, the timing of such cash flows, and discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in projecting future cash flows. The valuation of long-lived and intangible assets involves management estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of assets, particularly purchased intangible assets. These estimates are subjective and can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and forecasts.Evaluation of goodwill for impairment requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets, liabilities, and goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The identification of reporting units involves consideration of components of the operating segments and whether or not there is discrete financial information available that is regularly reviewed by management. Additionally, we consider whether or not it is reasonable to aggregate any of the identified components that have similar economic characteristics. The estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions include a significant change in the business climate, established business plans, operating performance indicators or competition which could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit.53We estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of an income approach, utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis, and a market approach, using performance-metric market multiples. The discount rate used in an income approach is based on our weighted-average cost of capital and may be adjusted for the relevant risks associated with business-specific characteristics and any uncertainty related to a reporting unit's ability to execute on the projected future cash flows.
