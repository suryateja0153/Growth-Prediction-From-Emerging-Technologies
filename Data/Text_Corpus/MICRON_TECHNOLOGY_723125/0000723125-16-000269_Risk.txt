Risk Factors."  Changes in currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.The functional currency for us and all of our consolidated subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar.  The substantial majority of our sales are transacted in the U.S. dollar; however, significant amounts of our operating expenditures and capital purchases are incurred in or exposed to other currencies, primarily the euro, Singapore dollar, New Taiwan dollar, and yen.  We have established currency risk management programs for our operating expenditures and capital purchases to hedge against fluctuations in the fair value and volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in currency exchange rates.  We generally utilize currency forward contracts in these hedging programs, which reduce, but do not always entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements.  We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.Based on our foreign currency balances from monetary assets and liabilities, we estimate that a 10% adverse change in exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar would result in losses of approximately $241 million as of September 1, 2016 and $134 million as of September 3, 2015.  We hedge our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates from our monetary assets and liabilities by utilizing a rolling hedge strategy for our primary currency exposures with currency forward contracts that generally mature within 35 days.  The effectiveness of these hedges is dependent upon our ability to accurately forecast our monetary assets and liabilities.  To hedge the exposure of changes in cash flows from changes in currency exchange rates for certain capital expenditures, we utilize currency forward contracts that generally mature within 12 months.
