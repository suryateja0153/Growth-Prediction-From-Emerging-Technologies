RISK FACTORS 16Table of ContentsThe following risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks to the Company. Our business operations or financial condition could be impaired by risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company, or that the Company's management does not currently consider material. If any of the risks described below were to occur, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.The recent COVID-19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.The COVID-19 outbreak, which has been declared a global pandemic, has led to severe disruptions in the market and the global and U.S. economies that may continue for a prolonged duration.  In response, various governmental bodies and private enterprises have implemented numerous measures to contain the outbreak, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and factory and office shutdowns.  These measures and other public and private responses to the outbreak have impacted, and may further impact, our workforce and operations, and those of our customers, partners, vendors and suppliers. The manufacture of product components, the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations, including the U.S., Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan. Each of these countries has been affected by the outbreak and has taken measures to try to contain it, and there is considerable uncertainty regarding the impact and duration of such measures and potential future measures. Restrictions on our access to our manufacturing facilities or on our support operations or workforce, similar limitations for our vendors and suppliers, and disruptions of transportation, such as reduced availability of air transport, port closures and increased border controls or closures, could limit our capacity to meet customer demand. Due to the spread of COVID-19, we have modified our business practices, including employee travel restrictions, employee work locations, and cancellation of physical participation in non-critical meetings, events and conferences pursuant to applicable government guidelines. There is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by COVID-19, which could adversely impact our ability to perform critical functions, such as the research and development of new products, the manufacture of product components, the final assembly of our products, and the distribution and sale of our products.The current outbreak and the efforts to control it have slowed economic activity and may trigger a recession or a period of economic slowdown. Customer demand may be reduced to the extent customers experience shortages of other necessary materials and are forced to slow production of their end products (with a corresponding decline in the rate at which they purchase materials from us), or to the extent our customers experience reduced consumer demand for their end-products as consumers curtail purchases.  The full extent and nature of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related containment measures on our business and financial performance are highly uncertain, as the situation continues to evolve. An extended period of disruption to global supply chain and economic activities due to the pandemic, as well as other factors that are currently unforeseeable, could have a material adverse impact on our ability to access sources of liquidity, as well as our financial condition and results of operations. A prolonged impact of the pandemic also could heighten many of the other risks, such as those relating to disruptions on our operations and our reliance on customers and other third parties, described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Our success depends on our ability to develop and introduce new products and our failure to do so would have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Our success depends in large part on our ability to develop and introduce new products that address customer requirements and compete effectively on the basis of price, density, functionality, power consumption and performance. Consolidation in our industry may increasingly result in our competitors having greater resources, or other synergies, that provide them with a competitive advantage in those regards. The success of new product introductions is dependent upon several factors, including: 付imely completion of new product designs; 病bility to generate new design opportunities and design wins; 病vailability of specialized field application engineering resources supporting demand creation and customer adoption of new products; 病bility to utilize advanced manufacturing process technologies on circuit geometries of 28nm and smaller; 病chieving acceptable yields; 病bility to obtain adequate production capacity from our wafer foundries and assembly and test subcontractors; 病bility to obtain advanced packaging; 病vailability and completeness of supporting software design tools; 埠tilization of predefined IP logic; 苗ustomer acceptance of advanced features in our new products; 17Table of Contents病bility of our customers to complete their product designs and bring them to market; and瀕arket acceptance of our customers' products. Our product development efforts may not be successful, our new products may not achieve industry acceptance, or we may not achieve the necessary volume of production that would lead to further per unit cost reductions. Revenues relating to our mature products are expected to decline in the future, which is normal for our product life cycles. As a result, we may become increasingly dependent on revenues derived from design wins for our newer products as well as anticipated cost reductions in the manufacture of our current products. We rely primarily on obtaining yield improvements and corresponding cost reductions in the manufacture of existing products, and on introducing new products that incorporate advanced features and other price/performance factors that enable us to increase revenues while maintaining consistent margins. To the extent that such cost reductions and new product introductions do not occur in a timely manner, or to the extent that our products do not achieve market acceptance at prices with higher margins, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. We rely on independent foundries for the manufacture of all of our products and a manufacturing problem or insufficient foundry capacity could adversely affect our operations. Most of our wafers are manufactured in Taiwan by TSMC and UMC. We also have wafers manufactured in South Korea by Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. Terms with respect to the volume and timing of wafer production and the pricing of wafers produced by the semiconductor foundries are determined through periodic negotiations with these wafer foundries, which usually result in short-term agreements that do not provide for long-term supply or allocation commitments. We are dependent on these foundries to supply the substantial majority of our wafers. We rely on TSMC, UMC and our other foundries to produce wafers with competitive performance attributes. Therefore, the foundries, particularly TSMC which manufactures our newest products, must be able to transition to advanced manufacturing process technologies and increased wafer sizes, produce wafers at acceptable yields and deliver them in a timely manner. Furthermore, we cannot guarantee that the foundries that supply our wafers will offer us competitive pricing terms or other commercial terms important to our business. We cannot guarantee that our foundries will not experience manufacturing problems, including delays in the realization of advanced manufacturing process technologies or difficulties due to limitations of new and existing process technologies. For example, we may experience supply shortages due to the difficulties foundries may encounter if they must rapidly increase their production capacities from low utilization levels to high utilization levels because of an unexpected increase in demand. Furthermore, we cannot guarantee that the foundries will be able to manufacture sufficient quantities of our products or that they will continue to manufacture a given product for the full life of the product. We could also experience supply shortages due to very strong demand for our products, or a surge in demand for semiconductors in general, which may lead to tightening of foundry capacity across the industry.  Further, public health crises such as an outbreak of contagious diseases like COVID-19 may affect the operations of our foundries.  In addition, weak economic conditions may adversely impact the financial health and viability of the foundries and result in their insolvency or their inability to meet their commitments to us. The insolvency of a foundry or any significant manufacturing problem or insufficient foundry capacity would disrupt our operations and negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.We are subject to regulatory and operational risks associated with conducting business operations outside of the U.S. which could adversely affect our business.In addition to international sales and support operations and development activities, we purchase our wafers from foreign foundries, have our commercial products assembled, packaged and tested by subcontractors located outside the U.S. and utilize third party warehouse operators to store and manage inventory levels for certain of our products.  All of these activities are subject to the uncertainties associated with international business operations, including global laws and regulations, trade barriers, economic sanctions, tax regulations, import and export regulations, duties and tariffs and other trade restrictions, changes in trade policies, anti-corruption laws, foreign governmental regulations, potential vulnerability of and reduced protection for IP, longer receivable collection periods, disruptions or delays in production or shipments and the impact from a global pandemic, such as COVID-19 and responsive government measures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and/or operating results. 18Table of ContentsIn 2018, U.S. and China began to impose partial tariffs on each other's products, leading to concerns of an escalating trade war, which, if it were to fully materialize, could result in general economic downturn or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business. For example, ZTE Corporation (ZTE) has been subject to trade restrictions under two denial orders issued by the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) of the U.S. Department of Commerce in recent years and although ZTE was granted temporary relief from these denial orders and is not currently subject to restrictions, it may become subject to additional denial orders in the future. Also, in May 2019, BIS added Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. (Huawei) and several affiliates to the Entity List, which imposes restrictions on the supply of certain U.S. and non-U.S. items and product support to listed Huawei entities.  As a result, we, along with others in the semi-conductor industry, are unable to sell certain products to Huawei without a license grant, and our ability to do business with Huawei has been adversely impacted. Further geopolitical and regulatory changes may result in shifting regulatory barriers, tax regulations and other trade restrictions that could further negatively impact our business, financial condition and/or operating results. In April 2020, for example, BIS announced further export control regulations effective on June 29, 2020, specifically the elimination of the license exception CIV (civil end-users), which had permitted certain national security-controlled items to be exported to certain destinations, such as China, without a license and the expansion of controls over items for military end-uses in China, Russia and Venezuela. BIS also proposed modifications to the license exception APR (additional permissible reexports), which, if enacted, will impose a licensing requirement on items to be reexported to certain destinations.  Furthermore, BIS reportedly is considering other regulatory changes, such as modifications to the de minimis and foreign direct product rules set forth in the Export Administration Regulations, that could impact our business.  We are dependent upon our ability to obtain export licenses, or exceptions to export license requirements, from US and other foreign regulatory agencies. There is no assurance that we will be issued these licenses or be granted exceptions, and failure to obtain such licenses or exceptions could limit our ability to sell our products into certain countries and negatively impact our business, financial condition and/or operating results.    Additional factors that could adversely affect us due to our international operations include volatility in oil prices and increased costs, or limited supply of other natural resources. Moreover, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected in the event of political conflicts, economic crises or changes in international relations affecting countries where our main wafer providers, warehouses, end customers, and contract manufacturers who provide assembly and test services worldwide, are located. For example, the United Kingdom's recent exit from the European Union, commonly referred to as "Brexit," has led to significant instability and uncertainty in such regions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.Earthquakes, other natural disasters or public health crises could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Our worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes or other natural disasters such as typhoons, tsunamis, volcano eruptions, fires or floods, public health crises such as an outbreak of contagious diseases like COVID-19, as well as disruptions in access to adequate supplies of electricity, natural gas or water. The independent foundries, upon which we rely to manufacture our products, as well as our California and Singapore facilities, are located in regions that are subject to earthquakes, wildfires or other natural disasters. TSMC's and UMC's foundries in Taiwan and our assembly and test partners in other regions as well as many of our operations in California are located in areas that have been seismically active in the past and some of these areas have also been affected by other natural disasters such as typhoons. Disruption of operations at these foundries and our facilities could cause delays in manufacturing and shipments of our products, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Any catastrophic event in these locations would disrupt our operations, and our insurance may not cover losses resulting from such disruptions of our operations, thereby materially adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations.  Furthermore, natural disasters can also indirectly impact us. For example, our customers' supply of other complimentary products may be disrupted by a natural disaster and may cause them to delay orders of our products. More vertically-integrated competitors may be less exposed to some or all of these and other risks.The semiconductor industry is characterized by cyclical market patterns and a significant industry downturn could adversely affect our operating results. The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and our financial performance has been affected by downturns in the industry. Down cycles are generally characterized by price erosion and weaker demand for our products. Weaker demand for our products resulting from economic conditions in the end markets we serve and reduced capital spending by our customers can result, and in the past has resulted, in excess and obsolete inventories and corresponding inventory write-downs. We attempt to identify changes in market conditions as soon as possible; however, the dynamics of the market in which we operate make prediction of and timely reaction to such events difficult. Due to these and other factors, our past results are not reliable predictors of our future results.19Table of ContentsThe nature of our business makes our revenues difficult to predict which could have an adverse impact on our business. In addition to the challenging market conditions we may face, we have limited visibility into the demand for our products, particularly new products, because demand for our products depends upon our products being designed into our end customers' products and those products achieving market acceptance. Due to the complexity of our customers' designs, the design to volume production process for our customers requires a substantial amount of time, frequently longer than a year. In addition, other factors may affect our end customers' demand for our products, including, but not limited to, end customer program delays and the ability of end customers to secure other complementary products. We also are dependent upon "turns," orders received and turned for shipment in the same quarter. These factors make it difficult for us to forecast future sales and project quarterly revenues. The difficulty in forecasting future sales impairs our ability to project our inventory requirements, which could result, and in the past has resulted, in inventory write-downs or failure to meet customer product demands in a timely manner. In addition, difficulty in forecasting revenues compromises our ability to provide forward-looking revenue and earnings guidance.If we are not able to compete successfully in our industry, our financial results and future prospects will be adversely affected.  Our products now compete in several areas of the semiconductor industry, an industry that is intensely competitive and characterized by rapid technological change, increasing levels of integration, product obsolescence and continual price erosion.  We expect continued competition from our primary PLD competitors such as Intel Corporation (Intel), Lattice Semiconductor Corporation (Lattice) and Microsemi Corporation (Microsemi, acquired by Microchip), and from ASSP vendors such as Broadcom Corporation (Broadcom), Marvell Technology Group, Ltd. (Marvell) and Texas Instruments Incorporated (Texas Instruments), as well as from companies such as NVIDIA with whom we historically have not competed. In addition, we expect continued competition from the ASIC market, which has been ongoing since the inception of FPGAs. We believe that important competitive factors in the logic IC industry include: 頻roduct pricing; 付ime-to-market; 頻roduct performance, reliability, quality, power consumption and density; 蒜ield upgradeability; 病daptability of products to specific applications; 鋲ase of use and functionality of software design tools; 病vailability and functionality of predefined IP logic; 苗ompleteness of applicable software solutions;病dherence to industry-standard programming environments; 品nventory and supply chain management; 病ccess to leading-edge process technology and assembly capacity;  病bility to provide timely customer service and support; and病ccess to advanced packaging technology.Our strategy for expansion in the logic market includes continued introduction of new product architectures that address high-volume, low-cost and low-power applications as well as high-performance, high-density applications. However, we may not be successful in executing this strategy.  In addition, we anticipate continued pressure from our customers to reduce prices, which may outpace our ability to lower the cost for established products. Other competitors include manufacturers of:鰭igh-density programmable logic products characterized by FPGA-type architectures; 鰭igh-volume and low-cost FPGAs as programmable replacements for ASICs and ASSPs; 柊SICs and ASSPs with incremental amounts of embedded programmable logic; 鰭igh-speed, low-density complex programmable logic devices; 鰭igh-performance digital signal processing devices; 頻roducts with embedded processors; 頻roducts with embedded multi-gigabit transceivers; 錨iscrete general-purpose GPUs targeting data center and automotive applications; and賓ther new or emerging programmable logic products.20Table of ContentsSeveral companies have introduced products that compete with ours or have announced their intention to sell PLD products. To the extent that our efforts to compete are not successful, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. The benefits of programmable logic have attracted a number of competitors to this segment. We recognize that different applications require different programmable technologies, and we are developing architectures, processes and products to meet these varying customer needs. Recognizing the increasing importance of standard software solutions, we have developed common software design tools that support the full range of our IC products. We believe that automation and ease of design are significant competitive factors in this segment. We could also face competition from our licensees. In the past we have granted limited rights to other companies with respect to certain aspects of our older technology, and we may do so in the future. Granting such rights may enable these companies to manufacture and market products that may be competitive with some of our older products.Increased costs of wafers and materials, or shortages in wafers and materials, could adversely impact our gross margins and lead to reduced revenues. If greater demand for wafers is not offset by an increase in foundry capacity, market demand for wafers or production and assembly materials increases, or if a supplier of our wafers or other materials ceases or suspends operations, for example due to shutdown measures implemented in response to the COVID-19 outbreak, our supply of wafers and other materials could become limited. Such shortages raise the likelihood of potential wafer price increases, wafer shortages or shortages in materials at production and test facilities, resulting in potential inability to address customer product demands in a timely manner. For example, in 2011, when certain suppliers located in Japan were forced to temporarily halt production as the result of a natural disaster, this resulted in a tightening of supply for those materials. Such shortages of wafers and materials as well as increases in wafer or materials prices could adversely affect our gross margins and would adversely affect our ability to meet customer demands and lead to reduced revenue. We depend on distributors, primarily Avnet, to generate a significant portion of our sales and complete order fulfillment. Avnet's revenue accounted for 42% of our worldwide net revenues in fiscal 2020, and, as of March 28, 2020, Avnet accounted for 31% of our total net accounts receivable. Any adverse change to our relationship with Avnet or our other distributors could have a material impact on our business. Furthermore, if a key distributor materially defaulted on a contract or otherwise failed to perform, our business and financial results would suffer. In addition, we are subject to concentrations of credit risk in our trade accounts receivable, which includes accounts of our distributors. A significant reduction of effort by a distributor to sell our products or a material change in our relationship with one or more distributors may reduce our access to certain end customers and adversely affect our ability to sell our products.  In addition, the financial health of our distributors and our continuing relationships with them are important to our success. Unpredictable economic conditions may adversely impact the financial health of some of these distributors, particularly our smaller distributors. This could increase our credit risk exposure relating to the insolvency of certain distributors, the inability of distributors to obtain credit to finance the purchase of our products, or delayed payment for such purchases. Our business could be harmed if the financial health of these distributors impaired their performance and we were unable to secure alternate distributors.We are dependent on independent subcontractors for most of our assembly and test services, and unavailability or disruption of these services could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. We are dependent on subcontractors to provide semiconductor assembly, substrate, test and shipment services. Any (i) prolonged inability to obtain wafers with competitive performance and cost attributes, adequate yields or timely delivery, (ii) disruption in assembly, test or shipment services, (iii) delays in stabilizing manufacturing processes and ramping up volume for new products, (iv) transitions to new service providers, or (v) other circumstance that would require us to seek alternative sources of supply, could delay shipments and have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demands. In addition, unpredictable economic conditions may adversely impact the financial health and viability of these subcontractors and result in their insolvency or their inability to meet their commitments to us. These factors would result in reduced net revenues and could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.21Table of ContentsA number of factors, including our inventory strategy, can impact our gross margins.A number of factors can cause our gross margins to fluctuate, including yield, wafer pricing, product mix, market acceptance of our new products, competitive pricing dynamics, licensing costs, geographic and/or market segment pricing strategies. In addition, forecasting our gross margins is difficult because a significant portion of our business is based on turns within the same quarter.While our overall inventory levels fluctuate over time, the inventory of newer product lines may be higher than other products due to a planned increase in safety stock in anticipation of future revenue growth.  In the event demand does not materialize, we may be subject to incremental obsolescence costs. In addition, future product cost reductions could have impact on our inventory valuation as well as our operating results. Reductions in the average selling prices of our products could have a negative impact on our gross margins. The average selling prices of our products generally decline as the products mature. We seek to offset the decrease in selling prices through yield improvement, manufacturing cost reductions and increased unit sales. We also continue to develop higher value products or product features that increase the average selling prices of our products, or slow the decline of such prices. However, there is no guarantee that our ongoing efforts will be successful or that they will keep pace with the decline in selling prices of our products, which could ultimately lead to a decline in our revenues and gross margins.General negative economic conditions and any related deterioration in the global business environment could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.If weak economic conditions happen, there may be a number of negative effects on our business, including customers or potential customers reducing or delaying orders, the insolvency of key suppliers, potentially causing production delays, the inability of customers to obtain credit, and the insolvency of one or more customers. Any of these effects could impact our ability to effectively manage inventory levels and collect receivables and ultimately decrease our net revenues and profitability.Because we have international business and operations, we are vulnerable to the economic conditions of the countries in which we operate and currency fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business and negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. In addition to our U.S. operations, we also have significant international operations, including foreign sales offices to support our international customers and distributors, our regional headquarters in Ireland and Singapore and an R&D site in India. Sales and operations outside of the U.S. subject us to the risks associated with conducting business in foreign economic and regulatory environments. Our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by unfavorable economic conditions in countries in which we do significant business or by changes in foreign currency exchange rates affecting those countries. We derive more than half of our revenues from international sales, primarily in the Asia Pacific region, Europe and Japan where economic weaknesses have adversely affected our revenues in the past. Sales to all direct OEMs and distributors are denominated in U.S. dollars. While the recent movements of the Euro and Yen exchange rates against the U.S. dollar did not have a material impact  on our business, increased volatility could impact our European and Japanese customers. Currency instability and volatility and disruptions in the credit and capital markets may increase credit risks for some of our customers and may impair our customers' ability to repay existing obligations. For example, the United Kingdom's "Brexit" transition has created economic uncertainty and currency volatility in the European Union. Increased currency volatility could also positively or negatively impact our foreign-currency-denominated costs, assets and liabilities. In addition, any devaluation of the U.S. dollar relative to other foreign currencies may increase the operating expenses of our foreign subsidiaries adversely affecting our results of operations. Furthermore, because we are increasingly dependent on the global economy, instability in worldwide economic environments occasioned, for example, directly or indirectly by political instability (such as due to Brexit), terrorist activity, U.S. or other military actions, changes to U.S. domestic and foreign policy and international sanctions or other diplomatic actions (potentially including sanctions adopted or under consideration by the U.S. or European Union with respect to Russia or Russian individuals or businesses), could adversely impact economic activity and lead to a contraction of capital spending by our customers generally or in specific regions. Any or all of these factors could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in the future. 22Table of ContentsWe are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and changes in credit risk which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations as it relates to the market value of our investment portfolio and interest rate swap contracts.Our cash, short-term and long-term investments represent significant assets that may be subject to fluctuating or even negative returns depending upon interest rate movements, changes in credit risk and financial market conditions.  Global credit market disruptions and economic slowdown and uncertainty have in the past negatively impacted the values of various types of investment and non-investment grade securities. The global credit and capital markets may again experience significant volatility and disruption due to instability in the global financial system, uncertainty related to global economic conditions and concerns regarding sovereign financial stability.Therefore, there is a risk that we may incur other-than-temporary impairment charges for certain types of investments should credit market conditions deteriorate or the underlying assets fail to perform as anticipated. Our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair values of our debt securities was judged to be other than temporary. Furthermore, we may suffer losses in principal on our investments, including our interest rate swap contracts, if we are forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates or financial market conditions.
