We also market and license our software directly to enterprise customers through our sales force and to end users through our own Website at www.adobe.com. In a ddition, we license our technology to hardware manufacturers, software developers and service providers, and provide some of our solutions via Software as a Service (“SaaS”), also known as hosted or “cloud-based” offerings. Our software runs on personal computers (“PC”) and server-based computers, as well as various non-PC and mobile devices, depending on the product. We have operations in the Americas, Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) and Asia.   Adobe was originally incorporated in California in October 1983 and was reincorporated in Delaware in May 1997. We maintain executive offices and principal facilities at 345 Park Avenue, San Jose, California 95110-2704. Our telephone number is 408-536-6000. We maintain a Website at www.adobe.com. Investors can obtain copies of our SEC filings from this site free of charge, as well as from the SEC Website at www.sec.gov.   BUSINESS OVERVIEW   For more than 28 years, innovation in Adobe software and technologies has transformed how individuals, businesses and governments communicate and interact with their constituents. Across the markets and customers we serve, Adobe helps create and deliver the most compelling content and applications in a streamlined workflow, and optimize those experiences for greater return on investment. Our solutions turn ordinary interactions into compelling and valuable digital experiences, across media and devices, anywhere, anytime.   While continuing to sell a broad portfolio of services and solutions, we are focusing our greatest business investment in three strategic growth areas:   Content authoring—enabling how digital experiences are created, managed, distributed, and increasingly monetized in a multiscreen world. Our customers include traditional creators, developers and digital media professionals, as well as their management in marketing departments and agencies, companies and publishers. This is the core of what we have delivered for over 20 years, but we are evolving rapidly to ensure these customers have an integrated workflow to handle the plethora of new devices and formats that are emerging.   Customer experience management—transforming how enterprises engage with their customers through powerful digital experiences. Our customers include line of business owners as well as their IT partners. Our solutions are designed to help companies be effective in signing up and servicing their customers to produce a positive business impact.   Online marketing—providing solutions and services for how digital advertising and marketing is measured, executed, and optimized. Our customers include advertisers, publishers, chief marketing officers and chief revenue officers. We process over a trillion transactions a quarter in helping our customers with site analytics, visitor acquisition and conversion. This complements our content authoring franchise, bringing together the art of creating content with the science of optimizing it.          3      TABLE OF CONTENTS     PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OVERVIEW   Entering fiscal 2010, we organized our products and services into the following businesses: Creative Solutions, Business Productivity Solutions, Omniture, Platform and Print and Publishing. We reported our financial results based on these named businesses, with the exception of Business Productivity Solutions which we reported in two segments: Knowledge Worker and Enterprise. We also renamed Business Productivity Solutions to Digital Enterprise Solutions in the middle of the fiscal year.   Effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2011, we modified our segments due to changes we made in how we operate our business. We have split our prior Creative Solutions segment into two new segments: Digital Media Solutions, and Creative and Interactive Solutions. Digital Media Solutions contains our industry-leading Photoshop family of digital imaging products and our video products used by creative professionals and hobbyists, whereas Creative and Interactive Solutions contains our Creative Suite family of products including our professional page layout and Web layout products. We also merged our former Platform business unit and reporting segment into the new Creative and Interactive Solutions business unit and reporting segment to better align our focus with market trends and our opportunities. Our Omniture segment and our Print  and Publishing segment continue to be reported as they were in fiscal 2010. Our Digital Enterprise Solutions business continues to be split and reported in two segments: Knowledge Worker and Enterprise.   In addition to our business unit reorganization, we also moved several products to different businesses. Our Scene7 products have been moved from our prior Creative Solutions business to our Omniture business; our ColdFusion products have been moved from our prior Platform business to our Print and Publishing business; and our Presenter product that was part of our Adobe Connect offering has been moved from our Knowledge Worker business to our Print and Publishing business.   Accordingly, our six fiscal 2011 reportable segments will be as follows: Creative and Interactive Solutions, Digital Media Solutions, Knowledge Worker, Enterprise, Omniture, and Print and Publishing. We will adjust our reportable segments at the beginning of fiscal 2011 to reflect these changes. The following overview is organized by these new segments and combines an explanation of our market opportunities with a summary of our fiscal 2010 results and a discussion of our strategies to address our market opportunities in fiscal 2011 and beyond.   Creative and Interactive Solutions Segment   Creative and Interactive Solutions Market Opportunity   Our Creative and Interactive Solutions segment focuses on the needs of creative professional customers, as well as Web and application developers. Collectively, these customers include those in professions such as graphic designers, production artists, Web designers and developers, user interface designers, writers, videographers, motion graphic artists, prepress professionals, video game developers and mobile application developers. They use and rely on Adobe’s solutions for professional publishing, Web design and development, animation and motion graphic production, application development and printing visually rich information. They also use our professional imaging and video products, which are reported in our Digital Media Solutions segment.   Our Creative Suite family of products are used by creative professionals to create much of the printed and on-line information people see, read and interact with every day, including newspapers, magazines, Websites, Rich Internet Applications (“RIAs”), catalogs, advertisements, brochures, product documentation, books, memos, reports and banners. Our tools are also used to create and enhance visually rich content, including video, animation and mobile content, that is created by multimedia, film, television, audio and video producers who work in advertising, Web design, music, entertainment, corporate and marketing communications, product design, user interface design, sales training, printing, architecture and fine arts. Knowledge workers, educators, hobbyists and high end consumers also use our creative products to create  and deliver content that is of creative professional quality.   We believe innovation we deliver in the tools and solutions our customers use enable the future of digital media. Our creative solutions are mission-critical to customers such as publishers and advertisers; they rely on Adobe tools and technologies to create highly compelling content, deliver it across diverse media and devices, and then optimize it through systematic targeting and measurement. For example:       ·    Publishers around the world are striving to embrace the digital age—to build distinctive brands, develop sustainable business strategies, achieve greater profitability, and deliver optimized content to fragmented audiences on an expanding array of smartphones, tablets, e-readers, and other devices. Their audiences seek compelling, media-rich experiences, wherever they go, using their preferred devices.             4      TABLE OF CONTENTS        ·    Advertisers face an ever-shifting media landscape. Traditional media are giving way to the emergence of new digital channels such as mobile devices and social networks. Customers have greater choice in where they go for their preferred brands, making it harder to keep audiences engaged. Successful advertising increasingly requires compelling content and greater focus on data and analytics than ever before in order to optimize advertising for improved targeting and higher returns.      As technology continues to change and improve, the market dynamics for these creative professionals continue to evolve. Due to the constantly changing ways in which people choose to receive information, creative professionals look to their software tools and services as a means to make their information impactful and to repurpose content across a variety of media, applications and systems. They desire greater efficiency from the software they use to streamline their publishing and content creation workflows and to effectively manage their assets. They also look for new and innovative ways to deliver their content and information to hand-held devices such as smartphones, tablets and consumer electronic devices.   Creative professional customers license upgrades and new versions of our Creative and Interactive Solutions products due to the high degree of innovative new features and significant productivity gained through their use. They also frequently purchase license upgrades and new versions of these products when they buy new computers, or migrate to new or updated operating systems.   In addition, knowledge workers in enterprises and government, educators and students in schools and universities, and hobbyists at home license our creative products. Knowledge workers desire professional-quality products to accomplish tasks such as creating visually-rich sales presentations, engineering or architectural proposals, real estate flyers and school yearbooks. Educators utilize our solutions to educate future creative professionals, as well as create their course content and online eLearning-based lessons. Hobbyists use our tools to create distinctive online communications, community newsletters, blogs and Websites for family, friends or community organizations.   With the increasing use of the Web as a means for marketing, advertising and commerce, we believe a key driver of our Creative and Interactive Solutions business will also be the growing amount of Website content created by our customers to deliver impactful and compelling Web-based experiences for their constituents across multiple screens, including PCs, mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, and Internet-connected living room electronics such as televisions. We also believe those who manage Websites will want to utilize Web analytic data and other Web usage metrics to optimize their Websites and content to improve the overall experience of their sites.   To address these trends and the workflow implications, our Creative and Interactive Solutions business unit also focuses on the development, marketing and licensing of our Adobe Flash technologies, as well as our support and development efforts for other Web technologies including HTML. The broad reach and rapid adoption of the newest versions of our Flash technologies allows us to rapidly innovate with our designer, developer and enterprise software which utilize these technologies—enabling our customers to deliver new and more engaging experiences to their constituents with the widest range of media that leverages the latest advancements in operating systems, platforms, devices and rich media technologies. Our support for HTML and other Web standards enables these technologies to also be broadly adopted through innovations in  our tools, and used to create rich, engaging Web experiences.   Creative and Interactive Solutions Business Summary   Our Creative Suite 4 (“CS4”) family of products, which first shipped in fiscal 2008, incorporated Adobe technologies used by creative professionals into six Creative Suite editions and thirteen individual creative products, providing offerings for the various creative disciplines our customers desire. Entering fiscal 2010, our overall creative business was exiting a year that was adversely affected by the global economic recession and the weak general macro-economic environment. This caused overall revenue for CS4 to be lower than revenue achieved with the prior version for a comparable period of time since release. Despite this economy-driven weakness, we maintained our focus on driving adoption of our creative products entering 2010—particularly with large media companies and enterprise customers. With our executio n, and as the general economy improved in early 2010, licensing of our CS4 products remained stable in the first five months of fiscal 2010.   In May of 2010, we delivered Creative Suite 5 (“CS5”), the newest release of our creative toolset. CS5 provides more than 250 new and enhanced features, significant performance improvements, new integration with Omniture measurement and optimization services (or software services), and new workflow capabilities. These feature sets enable users to create and deliver their content and applications across the broadest range of media and formats.   The launch of CS5 included the introduction of a new product called Adobe Flash Catalyst, which is a professional interaction design tool for creative professionals who want to create expressive interfaces and interactive content without writing code. The new CS5 release was also the first version of Creative Suite to integrate with new Adobe CS Live online          5      TABLE OF CONTENTS    services, which are a set of capabilities that enhance the feature set of Creative Suite to include features such as Adobe BrowserLab, Adobe CS Review, SiteCatalyst NetAverages, Acrobat.com, and Adobe Story.   As of the end of fiscal 2010, we experienced an increase in revenue for CS5 when compared to a similar period of availability for CS4. Despite this success, we did experience modest weakness in the adoption of CS5 in the second half of fiscal 2010 in the education and Japan markets. We attribute this weakness to education budget issues which occurred during the normally seasonally strong education buying period in the summer, and, economic weakness in the Japan market, respectively. Overall, however, we believe CS5 has performed well given the status of the economy in our major markets across the world.   During fiscal 2010 in the professional page layout market, despite the 2009 downturn in the economy and the financial pressure facing traditional print media companies, we continued to focus on gaining market share during the year with our Adobe InDesign product. Similarly, in the Web layout and Web development markets, and in the illustration market, we focused on maintaining market share leadership with our Adobe Dreamweaver and Adobe Illustrator products. New CS5 versions of these products delivered in fiscal 2010 increased these products’ capabilities and value propositions for end users, allowing us to maintain or grow our market share position against competitors.   In the fall of 2010 we introduced a beta of the Adobe Digital Publishing Suite, an online, hosted publishing solution that enables magazine and newspaper publishers to deliver engaging, branded reading experiences of their publications to an extensive array of mobile and tablet devices. This new solution combines hosted services, flexible e-commerce models to sell single issues and subscriptions directly to consumers through mobile marketplaces, and analytics capabilities based on our Adobe Online Marketing Suite. Content is created and enhanced through integration with CS5 to enable a complete workflow for the creation and delivery of content to mobile device users via our new Content Viewer technology.   As hundreds of millions of people around the world adopt Internet-connected smartphones and tablet devices as a means to communicate, collaborate and be entertained, as well as consumer electronic devices such as digital cameras, Internet-connected televisions and game consoles, we believe a significant opportunity exists to offer more integrated solutions involving our creative solutions and our platform technologies. This trend equally applies to emerging categories such as smartphone and tablet application development, and user interface and application creation for new Internet-connected televisions. The explosion in adoption of such devices is creating a challenge for content owners and application developers to deliver consistent experiences across multiple devices, operating systems, Web browsers and screen sizes.   To address these challenges, we increased our investment during the year in support of formats and standards such as HTML and Adobe Flash. During fiscal 2010, we introduced new features across many of our products to support the newest version of the HTML standard, version 5 (“HTML5”). Among the new innovations we introduced were HTML5 feature sets in our Dreamweaver and Illustrator products.   We also advanced the capabilities of our Adobe Flash Player during the year. In the later part of fiscal 2009 and during the first half of fiscal 2010, we released a version 10.1 update for our Flash Player. For the first time, we simultaneously delivered comparable Flash Player capabilities for both PC and non-PC implementations. Building upon the success of Flash Player 10, the newest 10.1 version adds improved video capabilities such as HTTP streaming, content protection, peer-to-peer support, and enhanced digital video recorder capabilities such as pause, instant replay, and slow motion for both PC as well as smartphone and tablet environments. It also adds hardware acceleration for improved performance in both PC and non-PC environments, and new user interface capabilities such as touch screen input methods for non-PC devices whi ch lack the traditional input methods of a PC such as a mouse.   Adoption of the new Flash Player 10.1 on PCs was the fastest ever of any Flash Player release during the three months after it was commercially available. With non-PCs, companies such as Google, Research in Motion (“RIM”), Samsung and Motorola announced or introduced Flash Player 10.1 as part of their new smartphone operating system and handset offerings during the year. With this broad support, more than 10 million copies of Flash Player 10.1 for mobile devices were either shipped or downloaded during fiscal 2010 and we expect approximately 60 million more shipments and downloads of Flash Player to smartphones and tablets during fiscal 2011. This adoption of our Flash technologies resulted in strong growth in the number of developers in the world who utilize our developer tools to deliver content and applications based on  Flash.   Due to the success and frequent electronic downloads of these client technologies, we generate revenue through OEM relationships with companies such as Google, where we include their technologies as part of the download offerings of our client technologies on PCs. In fiscal 2010, this download revenue grew when compared to fiscal 2009 and represented a significant part of the overall revenue we reported in our prior Platform segment.          6      TABLE OF CONTENTS    With the delivery of Flash Player 10.1 in fiscal 2010, nineteen of the top twenty handset manufacturers have now committed to utilizing Adobe Flash Player for Web browsing, Web application creation and the delivery of rich, consistent Internet experiences on their devices. Over time, we expect adoption of Flash Player to accelerate—increasing the need for Adobe’s designer and developer tools used to create content and applications, as well as broadening our Omniture and LiveCycle opportunities as Web and IT developers extend the reach of their solutions to include mobile handsets and tablets as enterprise clients.   In the same way we have had success deploying Flash Player to PC and non-PC devices during fiscal 2010, we also broadened the reach of our cross-platform client technology named Adobe AIR. Based on Flash, PDF and HTML technologies, Adobe AIR enables developers to leverage existing code to create and deliver Web-enabled desktop applications that run standalone outside of a Web browser on PCs, tablets, smartphones and televisions.   Adoption of Adobe AIR has been substantial since first being made available in fiscal 2008. As of October 2010, there were more than 400 million AIR downloads on PCs, along with more than one million downloads of the AIR developer tools used to create these applications. In October, we extended the capabilities of AIR to mobile devices with the delivery of AIR version 2.5 for televisions, tablets, smartphones and desktop operating systems. With this release, Adobe AIR now supports smartphones and tablets based on BlackBerry Tablet OS, Android, iOS, and desktops including Windows, Macintosh and Linux operating systems. In addition, Samsung has integrated support for AIR 2.5 into Samsung SmartTVs, while Acer, HTC, Motorola, RIM, Samsung and others have announced they expect to ship AIR pre-installed on a variety of devices including tab lets and smartphones in late 2010 and early 2011.   Adobe Flex, our open source framework for developing RIAs, has also enjoyed strong growth during fiscal 2010 as developers increasingly use Flex and our developer tools for building RIAs that can run on every platform where the Adobe Flash Player and/or Adobe AIR is supported. ISVs and VARs deploying SaaS applications utilize Flex as a means for creating engaging user interfaces for their applications, and enterprise developers are increasingly using Flex as a way to extend the reach and usefulness of their back office applications to their constituents.  These opportunities and our solutions to address them helped to double the number of Flash and Flex developers on a year-over-year basis.   As the adoption of our Flash, Flex and AIR technologies grows, we focus on the development and delivery of our developer solutions such as Flash Builder and Flash Catalyst to leverage the latest innovations adopted by Flash Player users. These solutions ensure reliable, secure and rich application experiences across the broadest range of browsers, operating systems and devices.   In the online video and rich media delivery market, we continued to innovate to maintain and grow our market leadership position. During the year we achieved strong adoption of Adobe Flash Media Server 3.5 (“FMS”), which we released in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. FMS, our digital video-based server technology, provides improved dynamic streaming and HTTP delivery capabilities, performance improvements and enhanced digital rights management capabilities for H.264 video and digital video recorder functionality. The launch of FMS, which is licensed either directly by our customers or licensed through our Flash Video Streaming Service via Content Delivery Network (“CDN”) partners such as Akamai and Limelight, helped to maintain the broad adoption of FLV, the video file format compatible with Adobe Flash Play er. Due to the broad reach and ubiquity of our Flash Player technologies, the growing adoption of our authoring tools and our video delivery capabilities via our Flash Player, Flash video remains the market share leader in terms of worldwide video watched online according to the research agency comScore.   Creative and Interactive Solutions Business Strategy   In fiscal 2011, our Creative and Interactive Solutions strategy will focus on achieving revenue growth and increasing market share of our products through the delivery of comprehensive software solutions that meet the evolving needs of our customers.   To help drive this strategy, we will deliver more frequent minor releases of some of our Creative Suite family of products during the year to help our customers stay current with evolving technology trends. We will also focus on enabling content creation using desktop solutions combined with new content creation capabilities on tablets and via hosted online solutions.   We intend to drive faster migration to our most recently released creative products through fine-tuning of our tiered upgrade pricing model, through an increase in focus on signing larger customers and enterprises to maintenance contracts, and by using cloud-based hosted creative services which augment the capabilities of our latest desktop versions.   We also intend to acquire new users for our products through the implementation of a subscription licensing model that augments our traditional perpetual licensing model. We believe that a lower entry price point through monthly or annual          7      TABLE OF CONTENTS    subscription will incentivize customers who are price-conscious to adopt or migrate to the latest versions of our software. We also intend to acquire new users through other means, including increasing our focus on the education market, where our products are offered to schools and students and increasing our focus on addressing piracy problems with the inclusion of more advanced anti-piracy enhancements in the product line.   Looking forward, we will continue to work on the next major versions of our creative products with a focus on improved integration between our products, more efficient collaboration and workflow capabilities, better integration with our Omniture Web analytics and business optimization products, and enhanced functionality, particularly in areas related to interactivity and rich media use on smartphone, tablet, and Internet-connected TVs. We will expand our hosted cloud-based services to augment the capabilities of our desktop products. We will utilize hardware improvements to continue to improve the performance of our products. We will also continue to improve our support for HTML5 content creation, as support for the new standard begins to be integrated into Web browsers and those browsers begin to be adopted by Web users.   We intend to continue our efforts to be the recognized market leader in the professional page layout, Web layout and illustration software markets. In page layout, we will continue to add new features to our InDesign product with a focus on cross-media publishing workflows, as well as continue to enhance its integration with other products print professionals utilize in their workflows. In Web layout, we strive to continue to redefine the Web experience by offering the most feature-rich, market-leading solutions for Website design and development with our Dreamweaver and Flash offerings. In these and across all of our products, we intend to enhance our support for HTML5 as this new Web standard becomes more stable and Web browser manufacturers begin to implement consistently more of its feature set. In illustration, we will conti nue to innovate and develop new capabilities which we believe will preserve our Illustrator product as a leading graphics creation solution.   With our developer tools, we plan to add new features and capabilities to our Flash Builder and Flash Catalyst products to address the needs of designers and developers creating content and applications for both PC and non-PC environments.   We also anticipate that growth in sales of Internet-connected televisions from vendors like Samsung and Vizio will continue to increase. Participation by these partners and potentially others will extend our opportunity for Flash Player distribution from mobile devices to Internet-connected consumer electronic devices in the digital home. We expect this in turn will increase the need for designer and developer solutions—ranging from our Creative Suite family of products to previously mentioned developer tools and technologies.
