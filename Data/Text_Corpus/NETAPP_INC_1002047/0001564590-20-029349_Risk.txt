Risk Factors.  Liquidity Our principal sources of liquidity as of April 24, 2020 consisted of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, cash we expect to generate from operations, and our commercial paper program and related credit facility. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments consisted of the following (in millions):             April 24, 2020        April 26, 2019       Cash and cash equivalents     $  2,658        $  2,325       Short-term investments        224           1,574       Total     $  2,882        $  3,899        As of April 24, 2020 and April 26, 2019, $2.5 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively, of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were held by various foreign subsidiaries and were generally based in U.S. dollar-denominated holdings, while $0.4 billion and $0.2 billion, respectively, were available in the U.S. The TCJA imposed a one-time transition tax on substantially all accumulated foreign earnings through December 31, 2017, and generally allows companies to make distributions of foreign earnings without incurring additional federal taxes. As a part of the recognition of the impacts of the TCJA, we have reviewed our projected global cash requirements and have determined that certain historical and future foreign earnings will no longer be indefinitely reinvested.  Our principal liquidity requirements are primarily to meet our working capital needs, support ongoing business activities, fund research and development, meet capital expenditure needs, service interest and principal payments on our debt, fund our stock repurchase program, and pay dividends, as and if declared and invest in critical and complimentary technologies through asset purchases and or business acquisitions, including our recently announced definitive agreement to acquire Spot Inc. a provider of compute management and cost optimization services on the public clouds. For more information, see Note 19 – Subsequent Events of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The principal objectives of our investment policy are the preservation of principal and maintenance of liquidity. We attempt to mitigate default risk by investing in high-quality investment grade securities, limiting the time to maturity and monitoring the counter-parties and underlying obligors closely. We believe our cash equivalents and short-term investments are liquid and accessible. We are not aware of any significant deterioration in the fair value of our cash equivalents or investments from the values reported as of April 24, 2020. Our investment portfolio has been and will continue to be exposed to market risk due to trends in the credit and capital markets. We continue to closely monitor current economic and market events to minimize the market risk of our investment portfolio. We routinely monitor our financial exposure to both sovereign and non-sovereign borrowers and counterparties. We utilize a variety of planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure our worldwide cash is available when and where it is needed. Based on past performance  49  and current expectations, we believe our cash and cash equivalents, investments, cash generated from operations, and ability to access capital markets and committed credit lines will satisfy, through at least the next 12 months, our liquidity requirements, both in total and domestically, including the following: working capital needs, capital expenditures, business acquisitions, stock repurchases, cash dividends, contractual obligations, commitments, principal and interest payments on debt, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations. We also have an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). We may in the future offer an additional unspecified amount of debt, equity and other securities. Senior Notes The following table summarizes the principal amount of our Senior Notes as of April 24, 2020 (in millions):       3.375% Senior Notes Due June 2021     $  500       3.25% Senior Notes Due December 2022        250       3.30% Senior Notes Due September 2024        400       Total     $  1,150        Interest on the Senior Notes is payable semi-annually. For further information on the underlying terms, see Note 9 – Financing Arrangements of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Commercial Paper Program and Credit Facility We have a commercial paper program (the Program), under which we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes. Amounts available under the Program may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed, with the aggregate face or principal amount of the notes outstanding under the program at any time not to exceed $1.0 billion. The maturities of the notes can vary, but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. The notes are sold under customary terms in the commercial paper market and may be issued at a discount from par or, alternatively, may be sold at par and bear interest at rates dictated by market conditions at the time of their issuance. The proceeds from the issuance of the notes are used for general corporate purposes. As of April 24, 2020, we had commercial paper notes outstanding with an aggregate principal amount of $523 million, a weighted-average interest rate of 2.01% and maturities primarily less than three months. In connection with the Program, we have a senior unsecured credit agreement that expires on December 10, 2021. The credit agreement provides a $1.0 billion revolving unsecured credit facility that serves as a back-up for the Program. Proceeds from the facility may also be used for general corporate purposes, providing another potential source of liquidity to the extent that the credit facility exceeds the outstanding debt issued under the Program. The credit agreement also includes options that allow us to request an increase in the facility of up to an additional $300 million and to extend its maturity date for two additional one-year periods, both subject to certain conditions. As of April 24, 2020, we were in compliance with all associated covenants in this agreement. No amounts were drawn against this facility during any of the periods presented. Capital Expenditure Requirements We expect to fund our capital expenditures, including our commitments related to facilities, equipment, operating leases and internal-use software development projects over the next few years through existing cash, cash equivalents, investments and cash generated from operations. The timing and amount of our capital requirements cannot be precisely determined and will depend on a number of factors, including future demand for products, changes in the network storage industry, hiring plans and our decisions related to the financing of our facilities and equipment requirements. We anticipate capital expenditures for fiscal 2021 to be between $175 million and $225 million. Dividends and Stock Repurchase Program On May 26, 2020, we declared a cash dividend of $0.48 per share of common stock, payable on July 29, 2020 to holders of record as of the close of business on July 10, 2020. As of April 24, 2020, our Board of Directors had authorized the repurchase of up to $13.6 billion of our common stock under our stock repurchase program. Under this program, we may purchase shares of our outstanding common stock through solicited or unsolicited transactions in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, through accelerated share repurchase programs, pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan or in such other manner as deemed appropriate by our management. The stock repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Since the May 13, 2003 inception of this program through April 24, 2020, we repurchased a total of 338 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $38.86 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $13.1 billion. As of April 24, 2020, the remaining authorized amount for stock repurchases under this program was $0.5 billion. 50  During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we announced the suspension of our stock repurchases to strengthen our liquidity position given the uncertainty surrounding the overall impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The timing and amount of stock repurchase transactions and future dividends will depend on market conditions, corporate business and financial considerations and regulatory requirements.  Contractual Obligations The impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with the factors that impact our cash flows from operations discussed previously. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at April 24, 2020 (in millions):                2021           2022           2023           2024           2025        Thereafter        Total       Purchase commitments with contract   manufacturers and component suppliers (1)     $  479        $  39        $  42        $  44        $  47        $  —        $  651       Other purchase obligations (2)        133           34           11           7           4           4           193       Total off-balance sheet commitments        612           73           53           51           51           4           844       Commercial paper notes (3)        523           —           —           —           —           —           523       Long-term debt obligations (4)        38           530           271           13           407           —           1,259       Long-term financing arrangements        3           —           —           —           —           —           3       Uncertain tax positions (5)                                                                                136       Total contractual obligations     $  1,176        $  603        $  324        $  64        $  458        $  4        $  2,765              (1)  Contract manufacturer and component supplier commitments consist of obligations for on-hand inventories and non-cancelable purchase orders with our contract manufacturers and component suppliers. We record a liability for firm, non-cancelable and unconditional purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and component suppliers for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts. As of April 24, 2020, such liability amounted to $6 million and is included in accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheets. To the extent that such forecasts are not achieved, our commitments and associated accruals may change.     (2)  Other purchase obligations represent an estimate of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations associated with our ordinary course of business, excluding inventory commitments with contract manufacturers and component suppliers, for which we have not received the goods or services. Purchase obligations do not include contracts that may be canceled without penalty. Although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services.      (3)  Represents principal payments on our commercial paper notes.     (4)  Included in long-term debt are obligations related to our $1.2 billion principal amount of our Senior Notes, of which $500 million is due in June 2021, $250 million is due in December 2022 and $400 million is due in September 2024. Estimated interest payments for our long-term debt, assuming no early retirement of debt obligations, are $109 million for fiscal 2021 through fiscal 2025.      (5)  As of April 24, 2020, our liability for uncertain tax positions was $136 million, including interest, penalties and certain income tax benefits, which due to the uncertainty of the timing of future payments, is presented in the total column on a separate line in this table. Some of the amounts in the table above are based on management’s estimates and assumptions, including the commitment duration, the possibility of renewal or termination, anticipated actions by management and third parties and other factors. Because these estimates and assumptions are subjective, our actual future obligations may vary from those reflected in the table. Financing Guarantees While most of our arrangements for sales include short-term payment terms, from time to time we provide long-term financing to creditworthy customers. We have generally sold receivables financed through these arrangements on a non-recourse basis to third party financing institutions within 10 days of the contracts’ dates of execution, and we classify the proceeds from these sales as cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. We account for the sales of these receivables as “true sales” as defined in the accounting standards on transfers of financial assets, as we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables. Provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met, we recognize product revenues for these arrangements, net of any payment discounts from financing transactions, upon product acceptance. We sold $59 million and $87 million of receivables during fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. In addition, we enter into arrangements with leasing companies for the sale of our hardware systems products. These leasing companies, in turn, lease our products to end-users. The leasing companies generally have no recourse to us in the event of default by the end-user and we recognize revenue upon delivery to the end-user customer, if all other revenue recognition criteria have been met.  Some of the leasing arrangements described above have been financed on a recourse basis through third-party financing institutions. Under the terms of recourse leases, which are generally three years or less, we remain liable for the aggregate unpaid remaining lease payments to the third-party leasing companies in the event of end-user customer default. These arrangements are generally collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets. Where we provide a guarantee for recourse leases, we recognize revenues in accordance with our revenue recognition policy, as updated to reflect the adoption of ASC 606. In connection with certain recourse financing arrangements, we receive advance payments associated with undelivered elements that are subject to customer refund rights. We defer revenue associated with these advance payments until the related refund rights expire and we perform the services. As of April 24, 2020 and April 26, 2019, the aggregate amount by which such contingencies exceeded the associated  51  liabilities was not significant. To date, we have not experienced significant losses under our lease financing programs or other financing arrangements. We have entered into service contracts with certain of our end-user customers that are supported by third-party financing arrangements. If a service contract is terminated as a result of our non-performance under the contract or our failure to comply with the terms of the financing arrangement, we could, under certain circumstances, be required to acquire certain assets related to the service contract or to pay the aggregate unpaid financing payments under such arrangements. As of April 24, 2020, we have not been required to make any payments under these arrangements, and we believe the likelihood of having to acquire a material amount of assets or make payments under these arrangements is remote. The portion of the financial arrangement that represents unearned services revenue is included in deferred revenue and financed unearned services revenue in our consolidated balance sheets.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Our off-balance sheet arrangements with suppliers are discussed in the contractual obligations section above. Additionally, we enter into indemnification agreements with third parties in the ordinary course of business. Generally, these indemnification agreements require us to reimburse losses suffered by the third-parties due to various events, such as lawsuits arising from patent or copyright infringement. These indemnification obligations are considered off-balance sheet arrangements under accounting guidance. Legal Contingencies We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims which arise in the normal course of business. See further details on such matters in Note 18 – Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
