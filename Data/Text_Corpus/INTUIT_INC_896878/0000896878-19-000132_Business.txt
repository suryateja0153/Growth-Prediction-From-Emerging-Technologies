Our customers include consumers, small businesses and the self-employed. Working with a broad array of vital partners - accountants, developers, financial institutions, educational institutions, governments and other platform companies - we are dedicated to solving our customers’ most pressing problems and delivering benefits that matter most to them including:•Personalized experiences that help them save money and enable their businesses to grow and prosper.•Automated financial tasks and data entry to save them time for what matters most.•Connections to credible experts, tools and insights to provide them with confidence when making financial or compliance decisions.We build durable competitive advantage by using the power of artificial intelligence (A.I.) and other advanced technologies to deliver innovative solutions via our trusted open platform that builds connections between customers, partners and products, as described in “Our Growth Strategy” below. We consider A.I. to include:•Machine Learning - Building algorithms which progressively learn from data to automate tasks for our customers.•Knowledge Engineering - Turning rules, such as IRS regulations, and relationships about data into code to eliminate work and provide tailored experiences.•Natural Language Processing - Processing, analyzing and understanding human language to create interactions with customers and automate repetitive tasks.      Intuit Fiscal 2019 Form 10-K 4                  Tables of ContentsOur Business PortfolioWe organize our businesses into three reportable segments: Small Business & Self-Employed:  This segment serves small businesses and the self-employed around the world, and the accounting professionals who serve and advise them. Our offerings include QuickBooks financial and business management online services and desktop software, payroll solutions, merchant payment processing solutions, and financing for small businesses.Consumer:  This segment serves consumers and includes do-it-yourself and assisted TurboTax income tax preparation products and services sold in the U.S. and Canada. Our Mint and Turbo offerings serve consumers and help them understand and improve their financial lives by offering a view of their financial health.Strategic Partner:  This segment serves professional accountants in the U.S. and Canada, who are essential to both small business success and tax preparation and filing. Our professional tax offerings include Lacerte, ProSeries, ProFile, and ProConnect Tax Online. Our Growth StrategyAt Intuit, our strategy starts with customer obsession. We listen to and observe our customers, understand their challenges, and then use advanced technology, including A.I., to develop innovative solutions designed to solve their problems and help them grow and prosper. For more than three decades, our values have inspired us to innovate and reimagine ways to save people time and money, eliminate drudgery and inspire confidence. We have reinvented and disrupted ourselves to better serve our customers, as we continue to transform into an A.I.-driven expert platform company. Our assessment of external trends - the expectation of more personalized experiences, the digitization of services, as well as the growth in the self-employed workforce - reveals significant opportunities to drive future growth. The result is a shift from traditional services and point solutions to interconnected capabilities that work on platforms and increasingly rely on A.I. and data-driven solutions.As we build those interconnected capabilities that rely on an A.I.-driven expert platform we are focused on three core elements:•Building an open, trusted platform: We are creating a technology platform where we and our partners can seamlessly integrate together to solve the most pressing customer problems and deliver awesome experiences. Our open platform allows our customers to use and confidently share their data, with their consent, with us and third-party partners to help improve their financial lives.•Accelerating the application of A.I.: We are actively accelerating our application of A.I., which continuously learns from data across the platform, and revolutionizes the experience for our customers. For example, our TurboTax solutions use machine learning to create a customized interview, asking questions uniquely tailored to each individual situation. •Connecting people with experts: Across the platform, we are digitizing services by building connections among customers, partners, and experts to inspire confidence in our customers. For example, our TurboTax Live offering seamlessly connects our TurboTax customers with tax experts via a live one-way video. We will continue to develop new means to connect customers with experts so our customers can have confidence that they are making the right decisions about their financial lives, and the personalized experiences they expect. As part of our strategy, we also develop relationships with key partners that enable us to scale our service to consumers, small businesses and the self-employed globally, including financial institutions, enterprise platforms, educational institutions and accountants. These partnerships allow us to co-create indispensable connections by sharing expertise, product integrations, and new solutions to solve more customer problems.As the external environment evolves, we continue to innovate and adapt our strategy and anticipate our customers’ needs. For more than 35 years, we have been dedicated to developing innovative financial and compliance products and services that are easy to use and are available where and when customers need them. As a result, our customers actively recommend our products and solutions to others, which is one important way that we measure the success of our strategy.PRODUCTS AND SERVICESDuring fiscal 2019 we offered our products and services in the three segments described in “Business Overview” above. The following table shows the revenue for each of these segments over the last three fiscal years.

Our offerings include QuickBooks financial and business management online services and desktop software, payroll and payment processing solutions, financial supplies, and financing for small businesses. QuickBooks Online Services and Desktop Software. Our QuickBooks financial management solutions help small businesses, the self-employed, and accountants solve financial and compliance problems, make more money and reduce unnecessary work, while giving them complete confidence in their actions and decisions.

These include standard paper checks and Secure Plus checks with CheckLock fraud protection features, a variety of stationery, tax forms and related supplies.Financing for Small Businesses. We offer financing options for small businesses to help them get the capital they need to succeed. The financing process provides small businesses the ability to use their QuickBooks data to qualify to borrow capital.        Intuit Fiscal 2019 Form 10-K 6                  Tables of ContentsConsumerOur TurboTax products and services are designed to enable customers to prepare and file their own federal and state income tax returns quickly and accurately. They are designed to be easy to use, yet sophisticated enough for complex tax returns. These offerings are available either online or as desktop versions. Our online offerings can be accessed on mobile devices.Tax Return Preparation Offerings. For the 2018 tax season, we offered a variety of commercial software products and filing services to meet the different needs of our customers, including those filing simple returns, those who itemize deductions, own investments or rental property, and small business owners. Customers can electronically file their federal and state income tax returns through our electronic filing service. We also offered TurboTax Live for customers seeking to obtain tax advice from professionals, as well as audit defense and audit support services. Our online tax preparation and filing services were offered through the websites of thousands of financial institutions, electronic retailers, and other online merchants. Financial institutions can offer our online tax preparation and filing services to their customers through a link to TurboTax Online. Our TurboTax U.S. and Canada offerings consist of desktop, online, and mobile offerings. In addition to our commercial product offerings, we are a member of the Free File Alliance, a consortium of private sector companies that has entered into an agreement with the federal government to provide free online federal tax preparation and filing services to eligible taxpayers, which the IRS then markets to consumers on an IRS website. See also “Competition – Consumer Segment” later in this Item 1 for more information on the Free File Alliance.Personal Finance Offerings. Our consumer platform, including our Mint and Turbo offerings, is aimed at helping customers unlock smart money decisions by connecting them to financial products to help make ends meet. These offerings help customers understand and improve their financial lives by offering a view of their financial health, as well as access to credit scores and monitoring.Strategic PartnerOur Strategic Partner segment includes our professional tax offerings and serves professional accountants in the U.S. and Canada, who are essential to both small business success and tax preparation and filing. Our professional tax offerings consist of Lacerte, ProSeries, ProFile and ProConnect Tax Online and enable accountants to accurately and efficiently complete and electronically file a full range of consumer, small business, and commercial federal and state tax returns. Lacerte is designed for full-service year-round accounting firms who handle more complex returns. ProSeries is designed for year-round tax practices handling moderately complex tax returns. ProConnect Tax Online is our cloud-based solution, which is designed for full-service year-round practices who prepare all forms of consumer and small business returns and integrates with our QuickBooks Online offerings. ProFile is our Canadian tax offering, which serves year-round full-service accounting firms for both consumer and business tax returns. We also offer a variety of tax-related services that complement the tax return preparation process including year-round document storage, collaboration services, e-signature, and bank products.PRODUCT DEVELOPMENTThe markets for software and related services are characterized by rapid technological change, shifting customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements. Continuous investment is required to innovate and develop new products and services as well as enhance existing offerings to be successful in these markets. Our product development efforts are more important than ever as we pursue our growth strategy.We develop many of our products and services internally, and we have a number of United States and foreign patents and pending applications that relate to various aspects of our products and technology. We also supplement our internal development efforts by acquiring or licensing products and technology from third parties, and establishing other relationships that enable us to enhance or expand our offerings more rapidly. We expect to expand our third-party technology relationships as we continue to pursue our growth strategy.While our traditional desktop software products – QuickBooks, TurboTax, Lacerte, and ProSeries – tend to have predictable annual development and product release cycles, as we move to more online offerings and mobile applications, the development cycles are becoming more rapid. In addition, developing consumer and professional tax software and services presents unique challenges because of the demanding development cycle required to accurately incorporate federal and state tax law and tax form changes within a rigid timetable. The development timing for our small business payroll and merchant payment processing services offerings varies with business needs and regulatory requirements, and the length of the development cycle depends on the scope and complexity of each project.We continue to make substantial investments in research and development, and we expect to focus our future research and development efforts on enhancing existing products and services with financial recommendations, personalization, and ease of use enabled by A.I. and other advanced technologies. We continue to focus on developing new products and services, including new mobile and global offerings, and significant research and development efforts for ongoing projects to update the technology platforms for several of our offerings.       Intuit Fiscal 2019 Form 10-K 7                  Tables of ContentsSEASONALITYOur Consumer and Strategic Partner offerings have a significant and distinct seasonal pattern as sales and revenue from our income tax preparation products and services are heavily concentrated in the period from November through April. This seasonal pattern results in higher net revenues during our second and third quarters ending January 31 and April 30, respectively. We expect the seasonality of our Consumer and Strategic Partner businesses to continue to have a significant impact on our quarterly financial results in the future.MARKETING, SALES AND DISTRIBUTION CHANNELSMarkets Our primary customers are consumers, small businesses, and the self-employed. We also provide specialized tax and accounting products to professional accountants, who are key partners to help us reach small business customers. The markets in which we compete have always been characterized by rapid technological change, shifting customer needs, and frequent new product introductions and enhancements by competitors. Over the past several years, the widespread usage of mobile devices and the explosion of social media have accelerated the pace of change and revolutionized the way that customers learn about, evaluate, and purchase products and services.Real-time, personalized online and mobile shopping experiences are the standard. In addition, many customers now begin shopping in one channel and ultimately purchase in another. This has created a need for integrated, multi-channel, shop-and-buy experiences. Market and industry changes quickly make existing products and services obsolete. Our success depends on our ability to respond rapidly to these changes with new business models, updated competitive strategies, new or enhanced products and services, alternative distribution methods, and other changes in the way we do business.Marketing ProgramsWe use a variety of marketing programs to generate direct sales, develop leads, increase general awareness of our product portfolio, and drive sales in retail. These programs include digital marketing such as display and pay-per-click advertising, search engine optimization, and social and affiliate marketing; mobile marketing through online app stores; email marketing; offline marketing such as TV, radio, billboard, magazine and newspaper advertising; retail marketing; public relations; and in product marketing to drive awareness of related products and services. Our campaigns are designed to attract new users, retain existing users, and cross sell additional offerings.Sales and Distribution ChannelsMulti-Channel Shop-and-Buy Experiences. Our customers use the web and mobile devices to research products and services. Some customers buy and use our products and services entirely online or through their mobile devices. Others research online but make their purchase at a retail location. Because many customers shop across multiple channels, we continue to coordinate our online, offline, and retail presence and promotions to support an integrated, multi-channel, shop-and-buy model. We also focus on cross-selling complementary Intuit and third-party offerings online and in-product.Direct Sales Channel. We sell many of our products and services directly through our websites and call centers. Direct, online sales are an effective channel for customers who can make purchase decisions based on content provided on our websites, via other online content or word of mouth recommendations. Telesales continues to be an effective channel for serving customers that want live help to select the products and services that are right for their needs. We also have a direct sales force that calls on U.S. and international accounting firms and seeks to increase their awareness, usage, and recommendation of our small business and professional tax solutions.Mobile Application Stores. We distribute many of our offerings for mobile devices through proprietary online stores that provide applications for specific devices. These include the Apple App Store and Google’s Play Store. Retail and Other Channels. We sell our QuickBooks and TurboTax desktop software as well as payroll services at retail locations across the United States and on retailer websites. In Canada, we also rely on distributors and other third parties who sell products into the retail channel. We sell our products and services through selected alliance partners and accountants who help us reach new customers at the point of need and drive growth and market share by extending our online reach. These partners combine our products and services with value-added marketing, sales, and technical expertise to deliver a complete solution at the local level. As we expand our mobile and global offerings, we expect that strategic partnerships will become increasingly important to our business.       Intuit Fiscal 2019 Form 10-K 8                  Tables of ContentsCOMPETITIONOverviewWe face intense competition in all of our businesses, both domestically and internationally. Competitive interest and expertise in many of the markets we serve have grown markedly over the past few years and we expect this trend to continue. Some of our existing competitors have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. In addition, the competitive landscape can shift rapidly as new companies enter and existing companies expand their businesses to include the markets in which we compete. This is particularly true for online and mobile products and services, where the barriers to entry are lower than they are for desktop software products and services. To attract customers, many online and mobile competitors are offering free or low-priced products which we must take into account in our pricing strategies.Given the breadth of the products and services that we offer as a global technology company, we compete with the offerings from a variety of companies across a range of industries. Our most obvious competition comes from other companies that currently offer technology solutions similar to ours. In our Small Business & Self-Employed segment, we face competition from a variety of companies that provide products or services to address the problems that we help our customers to solve, including getting paid faster, paying their employees, accessing capital and ensuring their books are done right. Our Consumer segment competes with companies that offer products and services to help customers file their taxes, better manage their money and reduce their debt. We may also face competition from companies with platforms that could be developed to offer competing technology solutions to any of the problems that our customers may face, such as Facebook, Amazon and Google. In addition, for many of our products and services, other competitive alternatives for customers are third-party service providers such as professional accountants and seasonal tax preparation businesses. Manual tools and processes, or general-purpose software, are also important competitive alternatives. In some cases, a competitor in one of our segments may be our partner in another one of our segments. In other cases, a company may compete with us in more than one of our segments.Competition Specific to SegmentsSmall Business & Self-Employed Segment. QuickBooks is the leading small business financial management software in the U.S. Small businesses often look to several companies to address their problems. Therefore, our small business products and services face competitive challenges from a variety of companies that provide products or services that address one or more of their problems. We compete to help small businesses get their books right with The Sage Group plc, Xero and FreshBooks, among others, which offer software and associated services as well as online accounting offerings that directly serve small business customers. For small businesses with more complex financial management needs, our competitors include The Sage Group plc’s Intacct offering and Microsoft Dynamics. We also compete with free or low-cost online accounting offerings, and free online banking and bill payment services offered by financial institutions and others. In our payroll business we compete directly with Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (ADP), Paychex, Gusto, and many other companies that help small businesses to pay their employees. In our merchant services business we help our customers get paid faster and compete directly with large financial institutions such as Wells Fargo, JP Morgan Chase, and Bank of America and with many payment processors, including First Data Corporation, Elavon, Global Payments, Fidelity National Information Services, PayPal, and Square. Our QuickBooks Capital offering, which helps small businesses to access capital, competes with a range of lending enterprises, including large financial institutions, such as the ones listed above, fintech companies, such as BlueVine and Kabbage, and others.Consumer Segment. In our Consumer segment, we compete to help our customers to file their taxes. Our future growth depends on our ability to attract new customers to the self-preparation tax category and to our assisted offering, TurboTax Live, from tax stores and other tax preparers. In the U.S. private sector we face intense competition from H&R Block, which provides tax preparation services in its stores and a competing software offering. We also face competition from several other large tax preparation service providers, from a myriad of small tax preparers, and from numerous online self-preparation offerings, including Free Tax USA, TaxSlayer, Blucora’s TaxAct and Credit Karma. Some of these competitors are offering electronic tax preparation and filing services at no cost to individual taxpayers. In Canada, our TurboTax Canada offerings face competition from H&R Block, SimpleTax, StudioTax, and UFile, among others. These competing offerings subject us to significant price pressure in both the U.S. and Canada.We also face competitive challenges from government entities that offer publicly funded electronic tax preparation and filing services with no fees to individual taxpayers.We are a member of the Free File Alliance, a consortium of private sector companies that has entered into an agreement with the federal government. Under this agreement, the member companies provide online federal tax preparation and filing services to eligible users at no cost to the government or individual users separate and apart from the member companies’ commercial free offerings, which the IRS then markets to consumers on an IRS website. Approximately 22 states and the District of Columbia have also adopted Free File Alliance public-private agreements while approximately 19 other states offer some form of direct government tax preparation and filing services with no fees to qualified taxpayers. We continue to actively work with others in the private and public sectors to advance the goals of the Free File Alliance policy initiative and to support successful public-private partnerships that reinforce the voluntary compliance tax system. However, future administrative, regulatory, or legislative activity in this area could seek to replace the voluntary compliance tax system with return preparation by government agencies which could harm our Consumer business.      Intuit Fiscal 2019 Form 10-K 9                  Tables of ContentsWe also compete with numerous personal financial management companies, such as Credit Karma, Nerdwallet and Credit Sesame, and large financial institutions to help our customers better manage their money and reduce their debt.Strategic Partner Segment. In the U.S., Lacerte professional tax offerings face competition from competitively-priced tax and accounting solutions that include integration with non-tax functionality. These include CCH’s ProSystems fx Office Suite and Thomson Reuters’ CS Professional Suite and GoSystems Tax. Our ProSeries professional tax offerings face competition from CCH’s ATX and TaxWise offerings, Drake, and other smaller providers. In Canada, our ProFile professional tax offerings face competition from CCH’s Cantax and Taxprep offerings, TaxCycle, and Thomson Reuters’ DTMax and UFile Pro offerings. We also face growing competition from online tax and
