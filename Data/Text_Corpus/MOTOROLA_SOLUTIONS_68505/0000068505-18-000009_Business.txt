Our customers have unique voice, data, and operational requirements. We offer comprehensive solutions that include infrastructure, devices, software applications, and services designed and delivered to enable our customers to safely and effectively accomplish their mission.  Our strategy for long-term growth and the evolution of our business includes organic and inorganic investments in the following three areas: (i)Continued innovation in standards-based voice and data solutions spanning APCO 25, TETRA, DMR, and LTE technologies. Our dedication, focus, and innovation for public safety and commercial solutions built the foundation of our Land Mobile Radio ("LMR") platform business, which is reflected in our installed base of over 12,500 systems deployed in 100+ countries around the world. These systems have a multi-year and often multi-decade life span which drives demand for additional device sales, software upgrades, infrastructure refresh and expansion, as well as additional services to maintain, monitor, and manage these complex networks and solutions. We believe our government and commercial customers will continue to require next-generation systems, enhanced software features and analytics, as well as incremental services to drive operational efficiencies.   (ii)Managed and support services offerings that leverage our large global installed base and allow our customers to improve performance across their systems, devices, and applications for greater safety and productivity. Our comprehensive suite of services - from repair, technical support, security, and system monitoring to operation of customer owned networks or Motorola Solutions owned networks, ensures continuity and reduces risks for continued critical communications operations. Today, agency procurement models are primarily capex investments in customer owned and operated solutions with long-term contracts. As agencies seek budget predictability, increased flexibility, and outcome based solutions, there continues to be a shift to alternative consumption models. We feel our suite of services positions us well for this change and allows us to provide incremental, value-added services for our customers.(iii)Software solutions to support the entire public safety workflow - from the command center to mobile applications in the field to post-incident analytics. Today, the public safety workflow is addressed by a variety of point solutions. Motorola Solutions is attempting to expand its software offerings to provide solutions across the various segments of the public safety workflow. As the public safety market continues to embrace software offerings to enhance their workflows, we are able to sell cloud-first SaaS offerings in addition to on-premise solutions with ancillary implementation and managed services.Our Customers and ContractsWe address the communication needs of government agencies, state and local public safety and first-responder agencies, and commercial and industrial customers who utilize private communications networks and manage a mobile workforce. Our customer base is fragmented and widespread when considering the many levels of governmental and first-responder decision-makers that procure and use our products and services. Serving this global customer base spanning federal, state, county, province, territory, municipal, and departmental independent bodies, along with our commercial and industrial customers, requires a significant go-to-market investment.Our sales model includes both direct sales by our in-house sales force, which tends to focus on our largest accounts, and sales through our channel partner program. Our trained channel partners include independent dealers, distributors, and software vendors around the world. The dealers and distributors each have their own sales organizations that complement and extend the reach of our sales force. The independent software vendors offer customized applications that meet specific needs in the verticals we serve.Our largest customers are the U.S. federal government (through multiple contracts with its various branches and agencies, including the armed services) and the Home Office of the United Kingdom, representing approximately 9% and 8% of our consolidated net sales in 2017, respectively. The loss of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our revenue 4and earnings over several quarters as many of our contracts with these governments are long-term in nature. All contracts with the U.S. federal government, and certain other government agencies within the U.S., are subject to cancellation at the customer’s convenience.
