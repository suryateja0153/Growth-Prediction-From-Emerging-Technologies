Business OrganizationDuring the second quarter of 2018, we modified our internal reporting structure to better align the way financial information is reported to and analyzed by executive leadership in part as a result of recent acquisitions contributing to the growth within the newly-aligned Services and Software segment. Previously, we had two reporting segments: Products and Services. The changes in reporting structure consist of Systems Integration-related revenue and costs moving from the old Services segment into the newly-presented Products and Systems Integration segment and software-related revenue and costs moving from the old Products segment into the newly-presented Services and Software segment.Products and Systems Integration Segment  The Products and Systems Integration segment offers an extensive portfolio of infrastructure, devices, accessories, video solutions, and the implementation, optimization, and integration of such systems, devices, and applications. The primary customers of the Products and Systems Integration segment are government, public safety and first-responder agencies, municipalities, and commercial and industrial customers who operate private communications networks and video solutions. In 2018, the segment’s net sales were $5.1 billion, representing 69% of our consolidated net sales. The Products and Systems Integration segment has the following two principal product lines: 3Devices: Devices includes two-way portable and vehicle-mounted radios, accessories, software features, and upgrades.

Since Motorola was founded in 1928, our commitment to innovation has been at the heart of our company. Today, we design and deliver solutions that are purpose-built for the unique needs of our customers, who work in coal mines, run into burning buildings, teach in classrooms, and everything in between. We offer comprehensive solutions that include infrastructure, devices, software applications, video cameras and analytics, and services that help our customers work safely and efficiently.  Our strategy for long-term growth and the evolution of our business includes organic and inorganic investments in the following four areas: (i)Continued innovation in standards-based voice and data solutions spanning APCO 25, TETRA, DMR, and Long-term Evolution ("LTE") technologies. Our dedication, focus, and innovation for public safety and commercial solutions built the foundation of our land mobile radio ("LMR") platform business, which is reflected in our install base of over 13,000 systems deployed in 100+ countries around the world. These systems have a multi-year and often multi-decade life span which helps drive demand for additional device sales, software upgrades, infrastructure refresh and expansion, as well as additional services to maintain, monitor, and manage these complex networks and solutions. We believe our government and commercial customers will continue to require next-generation systems, enhanced software features and analytics, as well as incremental services to drive operational efficiencies.   (ii)Services offerings that leverage our large global install base and allow our customers to improve performance across their systems, devices, and applications for greater safety and productivity. Our comprehensive suite of services - from repair, technical support, security, and system monitoring to operation of customer-owned networks or Motorola Solutions-owned networks, ensures continuity and reduces risks for continued critical communications operations. Today, agency procurement models are primarily capital expenditure investments in customer-owned and operated solutions with long-term contracts. As agencies seek budget predictability, increased flexibility, and outcome-based solutions, there continues to be a shift to alternative consumption models. We feel our suite of services positions us well for this change and allows us to provide incremental, value-added services for our customers.4(iii) Command center software solutions to support public safety workflow - from a citizen's emergency call and dispatching first responders to communicating with personnel in the field and managing records and evidence. Today, the public safety workflow is addressed by a variety of point solutions. Motorola Solutions is building a command center software offering that provides a unified suite of solutions across the public safety workflow. As the public safety market continues to embrace software offerings to enhance their workflows, we are able to sell cloud-first software as a service ("SaaS") offering in addition to on-premise solutions with ancillary implementation and managed services.(iv)Video analytics, network video management software and hardware, video cameras, and access control solutions for government and commercial customers. We have video solutions installed at thousands of customer sites, including school campuses, transportation systems, healthcare centers, public venues, critical infrastructure, prisons, factories, casinos, airports, financial institutions, government facilities, and retailers.Our Customers and ContractsWe serve government agencies, state and local public safety and first-responder agencies, as well as commercial and industrial customers who utilize private communications networks, often to manage a mobile workforce. Our customer base is fragmented and widespread when considering the many levels of governmental and first-responder decision-makers that procure and use our products and services. Serving this global customer base spanning federal, state, county, province, territory, municipal, and departmental independent bodies, along with our commercial and industrial customers, requires a significant go-to-market investment.Our sales model includes both direct sales by our in-house sales force, which tend to focus on our largest accounts, and sales through our channel partner program. Our trained channel partners include independent dealers, distributors, and software vendors around the world. The dealers and distributors each have their own sales organizations that complement and extend the reach of our sales force. The independent software vendors offer customized applications that meet specific needs in the verticals we serve.Our largest customers are the United States ("U.S.") federal government (through multiple contracts with its various branches and agencies, including the armed services) and the Home Office of the United Kingdom, representing approximately 8% and 7% of our consolidated net sales in 2018, respectively. The loss of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and earnings over several quarters as many of our contracts with these governments are long-term in nature. All contracts with the U.S. federal government, and certain other government agencies within the U.S., are subject to cancellation at the customer’s convenience.
