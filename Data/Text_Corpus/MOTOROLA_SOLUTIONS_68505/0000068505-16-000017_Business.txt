We have a history of delivering these products and services by focusing on the following areas:•Building technology that improves productivity and safety;•Driving innovation and thought leadership;•Ensuring security and resiliency;•Providing ongoing support for customer investments; and•Delivering complete solutions, comprised of infrastructure, devices, system software and applications, and services to solve complex communication needs.This focus provides us with the leadership position we have in our core products. We define our core products as our standards-based voice and data communication devices and systems and the related Integration and Managed & Support services. We expect to demonstrate strong results from our core products and services through: (i) leading the ongoing global migration to digital products, (ii) continuing to innovate APCO P25, TETRA, and DMR standards-based voice and data communication devices and systems, (iii) innovating new products and technologies for the future, (iv) enhancing and expanding our services offerings including Managed & Support services; and (v) expanding our direct sales and channel partner programs both geographically and across new commercial verticals.We believe we have the scale and global presence to continue to maintain a leadership position in our core products. We have over 12,000 systems deployed in over 180 countries around the world. These systems have a multi-year useful life to the customer. We believe many of our government and commercial customers have yet to replace aged analog communications networks with next-generation digital systems that enable enhanced features and more efficient use of spectrum, providing us opportunities to help customers migrate to these digital systems. In addition, we believe government and commercial customers are just beginning to experience the benefits of converged wireless communications and the efficiencies realized through a connected, mobile workforce, which will provide opportunities for the implementation of new public safety communications systems. We believe we are well-positioned to assist our customers in the deployment of new networks as additional public safety dedicated spectrum becomes available.In addition, we continue to innovate around our existing core products and services by finding innovative ways to improve our products by adding features and functionality to improve the user experience. By partnering with customers and observing how our products are used, our goal is to enhance our customers’ experience through future product enhancements and upgrades. In addition to focused research and development ("R&D") efforts on existing technologies, our strategy for long-term growth and the evolution of our business includes the development of: (i) next-generation public safety solutions' including public safety Long Term Evolution ("LTE") systems and devices, (ii) Smart Public Safety Solutions including critical command center applications that incorporate voice, data and video, and (iii) new product introductions for expansion into core-adjacent markets and geographic regions.  We have been investing in next-generation public safety broadband networks based on the LTE standard since 2010, which reflects our belief that broadband is a foundational long-term trend for our government and public safety customers globally. We believe that the application of these new broadband technologies will also generate innovation and lead to new smart public safety technologies, products, and services which will change how government and public safety organizations create, organize, and effectively manage vast amounts of data. These changes will also require a more comprehensive approach to the services required to assist our customers in managing an ever more complex world of real-time, interconnected technology and processes.4Our strategy includes leveraging our products and services for markets outside of the public safety and commercial markets we traditionally serve. A portion of our new product introductions in recent years include products which may also be used in the hospitality, mining, military, transportation, education, and utility vertical markets ("verticals").Geographical diversification is accelerated by our investments supporting: (i) different regional interfaces, (ii) multiple languages, (iii) tailored form factors, and (iv) unique feature sets.In addition to organic development opportunities and growth, we continually evaluate opportunities for inorganic growth through acquisitions or targeted investments in innovative technology companies that align with our strategic initiatives.Our Customers and ContractsWe address the communication needs of government agencies, state and local public safety and first-responder agencies, and commercial and industrial customers who utilize private communications networks and manage a mobile workforce. Our customer base is fragmented and widespread when considering the many levels of governmental and first-responder decision-makers that procure and use our products and services. Serving this global customer base spanning federal, state, county, province, territory, municipal, and departmental independent bodies, along with our commercial and industrial customers, requires a significant go-to-market investment.Our sales model includes both direct sales by our in-house sales force, which tends to focus on our largest accounts, and sales through our channel partner program. Our trained channel partners include independent dealers, distributors, and independent software vendors around the world. The dealers and distributors each have their own sales organizations that complement and extend the reach of our sales force. The independent software vendors offer customized applications that meet specific needs in the verticals we serve.Our largest customer is the U.S. federal government (through multiple contracts with its various branches and agencies, including the armed services), representing approximately 8% of our consolidated net sales in 2015. The loss of this customer could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and earnings over several quarters as some of our contracts with the U.S. federal government are long-term. All contracts with the U.S. federal government, and certain other government agencies, are subject to cancellation at the customer’s convenience.
