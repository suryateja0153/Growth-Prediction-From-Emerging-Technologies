 The research my team's involved in, whilst being specifically focused in the areas of virtual, augmented and mixed reality research, is not solely focused on the technology. More importantly what we're interested in is whether or not that technology is useable by human beings. So you see so much on YouTube and online about what this technology can and cannot do but what we're trying to do here are test beds using virtual reality and what we call telepresence technology where we're using headsets and gloves and other controllers to control robots to make sure that it's fit for purpose and to make sure that the human can use it. So the lab we're in at the moment is our mixed reality medical emergency response team trainer that we're developing for the Royal Centre for Defense Medicine and what we're doing here is we're looking at what we call mixed reality but for training future paramedics. So the plan is to carry out experiments with people from the Royal Air Force the Royal Navy and the Army and see if we can use virtual reality to train them what it's like for example to be in the back of a Chinook helicopter on the way to a casualty incident. The research my team does is not exclusively limited to the laboratories, we're on the road quite a lot working with real people in real places doing real jobs. In the defense arena we're working very closely with the likes of the Ministry of Defence, defence science and technology labs and with BAE Systems and we're looking at for example a wide range of training applications of virtual and augmented reality from the UK's Cutlass bomb disposal robot right through to future command and control using a mixed reality command table. In the heritage sector we spend an awful lot of our time in the West Country, on the coastlines, at sea and on Dartmoor and what we're trying to do is use virtual and augmented reality to make the invisible visible, to bring historical and archaeological sites back to life and some of the projects we've been working on for example include the loss of the HMS A7 wreck back in 1914 over a century ago and tried to visualize what that wreck looks like now in collaboration with some of the dive teams down in Plymouth. On Dartmoor itself we've been very active in bringing history back to life for example long abandoned railway lines, 15th century manor houses, old quarries and we used drone technology to be able to fly over some of these sites and to use the video from the drones to actually recreate them in 3D and then put them in place on typical three-dimensional maps. We're also very active in the healthcare sector and we spend a lot of time working with the clinicians and patients at the nearby Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham. So one of the applications for example we're experimenting in is to use a pedal exercise that the medics use to help recover muscle function after a very very complex and traumatic operation to allow the individuals in intensive care to cycle around the coastal path around Wembury Bay in the West Country. We use undergraduate students to get involved in some of our remotely operated or telepresence research getting them to design sensors to go onboard drones or get them to design various payloads that will go on to remotely operated submersibles and if the projects are successful we will actually take them to sea and we'll get their technology in the water. The future for the team is very exciting indeed for example we're leading the virtual augmented reality aspects of the Mayflower 400 program and that's going to happen in 2020 where we're going to commemorate the 1620 crossing of the pilgrims from England over to the New World and we're also very closely involved in the space industry as well we're working with an organisation called Blue Abyss to look at developing new training techniques for future aquanauts and astronauts in the United Kingdom
