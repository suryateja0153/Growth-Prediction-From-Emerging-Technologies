 Some people tell frightening facts about mixed reality I just had the chance to try Magic Leap One and I must assure you that you don't need to be afraid of it Personally I'm really afraid of disappearing I wanted to be always present, I wanted to be aware of what is happening around me basically I wanted to feel safe and it means being aware of my surrounding In Magic Leap you won't disappear you will be always present as well as your body will be present How does it work? So the device displays digital objects in front of you Company states that it uses the environmental recognition But what I feel it's really not about the device that understands what's happening around me This is me who got bored of the view I am the one to be afraid or I am the one to miss an image or the scene So even if it seems that everything is happening in front of you I feel it really happens inside me Some people are also afraid of being overwhelmed with additional layers of information that is displayed in front of them and always present around them Let's imagine if you try to visualize all the thoughts that are back in your mind that distracts you from reality I I feel it is really what may make me distracted and not present so I believe that if I would try to visualize and put down the thoughts that I have in mind and display them around me that will really make me focused and were present at the moment And finally you could be also afraid of the fact that you don't want any additional stimuli anymore and you just wants to be on your own in the reality and Magic Leap is equipped with this back to reality button that you can push and you immediately switch off all the additional visual content that is displayed So, I am really glad that I had the chance to try it and I wish that you could try it too
