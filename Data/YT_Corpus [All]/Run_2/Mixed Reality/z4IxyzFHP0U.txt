 In this final chapter, we’ll learn how to use the Select and Grasp input events and how to instantiate objects. Search for ObjectSpawner and drag the prefab into the hierarchy panel. Drag the ColorPickerWheel into the ObjectSpawner field called Color Source. Let’s take a look at the ObjectSpawner script. In the InteractionSourcedPress event, it first checks to see if event is coming from the left controller. Next, if the interaction type was a Select, then an object is spawned. Otherwise, if the interaction type was a Grasp, then we change our mesh type. The SpawnObject method creates the object, detaches it from its parent, and sets its color from the currently selected color. Save your scene again in Unity and click Play. You’ll be able to change the objects with the Grasp button and spawn objects with the Select button.
