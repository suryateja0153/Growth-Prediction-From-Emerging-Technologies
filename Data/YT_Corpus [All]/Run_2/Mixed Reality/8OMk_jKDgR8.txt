 hi everyone I'm Lucas Rizzotto down here at the Microsoft build floor I just tried out the eye tracking demo from Tobii and would love to ask a couple questions I'm really excited about the future of mixed reality and I tracking is going to play a key role in the user interfaces why don't you tell us what are you doing with Tobii and what role you see eye tracking play over the next couple years so we are implementing eye tracking in the Verity of devices from laptops to VR headsets having the eyes as an inputs is going to change the way you interact with devices today devices are blind they don't know my intention thing of know where I'm looking they don't know what I want so just adding that kind of thing into the equation will change it dramatically interesting and how easy it is for your developers to implement these kinds of features into their products bill here Microsoft is announcing the windows API for eye tracking in on the desktop environment so there is a Windows API we have our own open API to do implementation in in games or accessibility products we have a variety of things to East for the developer to get it implemented one of the cool parts of the demo is that you showcase two mixed reality avatars one with tracking one without it and you can just feel how there's more humanity when you have the eye tracking involved so I'm just curious what kind of impact have you seen in social interactions once you have I try to be involved we have that in a couple of games that other Studios have implemented where the avatars look back at you when you look at that for example it gives a liveliness to the experience thank you for your time this is really exciting and I hope that you guys keep pushing that boundary board we will thank you for stopping by
