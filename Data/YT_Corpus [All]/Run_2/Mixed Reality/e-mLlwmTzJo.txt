 In this chapter, we’ll learn about the elements of the motion controllers and how to attach objects to a specific element. To attach an object to the controller the first step is to choose which element of the controller you want the object to attach to. These elements are defined in the motion controller info script. Find the MotionControllerInfo script in the Project panel and open it in Visual Studio. In the ControllerElement enumeration, you can see the elements you can work with. Back in Unity, look for and open the AttachToController script. This script provides a simple way to attach any object to a specified controller handedness and element. The AttachElementToController method first gets the handedness and then the controller element. You can now attach your object to the specified controller element. Switch back to Unity and this time look for ColorPickerWheel. Add it to our scene. In the Inspector panel, you can see we can attach the ColorPickerWheel to either the left or right controller and the specific element of the controller. In this case, we’ll attach it to the left controller and the touch pad. Now open the ColorPickerWheel script in Visual Studio. As you can see, it inherits from AttachToController and overrides OnAttachToController and OnDetachFromController to subscribe and unsubscribe from the InteractionSourceUpdated event. We are subscribing to this event because we will use touchpad input to update the color selection in the next chapter. Switch back to Unity and save our Scene. Click Play and in your headset, you’ll be able to interact with the color wheel UI using the touchpad on the left motion controller.
