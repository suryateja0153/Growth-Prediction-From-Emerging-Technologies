 This is the Acer OJO 500. Our Acer Windows mixed reality headset. This is basically the first detachable  Windows mixed reality headset. For people who have  many users for headsets, It's a very easy way to swap  out the actual headset. Very easy to take out and clean as well. This is our first headset without an extra headset for audio. We have a patented sound pipe technology which is really nice and also very practical. So you only have one device and it's all here.
