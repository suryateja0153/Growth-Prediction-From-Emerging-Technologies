 hi so I have so far made three videos in this series about learning to code from the very beginning with P 5 and the P 5 web editor and I kind of have been avoiding showing you what happens when you make a mistake which I really should not have done that's the thing I really should be showing you right for the beginning but I didn't and I also haven't mentioned to you something called code comments and both of these things are fundamental to how you might create a p5 sketch one that you might work on for a period time and return to later so let's first look at the console and errors so there's this whole extra section down here that I've ignored I've been talking about this is where you write your code the play button executes the code and this is where you see the result of your code well what do you see down here what you see down here is messages that are things that are related to what's happening in your code that might be a mistake or something that you add you want to specifically put a message there so I'm going to show you there's a function called print I'm gonna say print and I'm gonna say hello and I'm putting this in setup because I want this just to happen at the beginning and this again I will come back to later so this being in the code suddenly in the console we have this down here the idea the console is not something so if you're making a project that you imagine users using like a game you wouldn't put the score of the game here you would want to draw the score somewhere on the canvas or there's actually a way you could put the score below the canvas something for the user to ultimately see but if you just want to be able to see what the score of the game is and kind of like for yourself while you're developing the console is for you the person who's writing the code or your friend who you're sharing the code with or your teacher or whoever I mean it's something that anybody using the p5 web editor can see but when you've finished it and you put it on your own website which is maybe something I'll show you how to do that console wouldn't necessarily appear so in addition to be able to put your own messages anything that you do wrong is going to be down there now one thing that's really important notice how no stroke has a capital s look no stroke also doesn't even have any arguments in here like it's just open and closed parentheses because there's no way to modify it that's something I didn't mention notice how there's commas here if I could get anything wrong like if I delete this comma look at this now I'm also getting error messages in here now this is a buzz look error message so here's the thing whenever you see the read error message first of all just take a deep breath sometimes their message is lovely if luck tells you exactly what's wrong and you can and it tells you how to fix it and this might be a case on caught six syntax error missing parentheses after your argument list sketch line eleven oh look line eleven missing friend of these sorry you know what it really should say missing comma so this is the thing the thing that's generating the error the web editor the JavaScript language the browser all of these pieces are figuring out what to put down there it doesn't always guess correctly so we the next thing is I can see like unexpected a parenthesis we can kind of like see it there but we're gonna have to guess what's wrong it's actually a comma sometimes you'll get an error the message that totally makes sense I'm gonna change this from stroke weight with a capital W to stroke weight with a lowercase W and this I'm not getting such a great error message but this is a really important one uncaught reference error stroke weight is not defined well but why is it not defined I watched a video from Daniel Schiffman and he said that stroke weight is a function from the p5.js library it's not part of the JavaScript language but it's a function with a p5.js library and I could call it in my code if I'm using the PA I just way better we just drew but because programming is in JavaScript is case-sensitive it doesn't know what it is without the capital W and notice how the editor is syntax highlighting it for you so stroke weights only it turns blue this is by the way no different than me saying like oh I want to write a function called unicorn magic o uncaught reference error unicorn magic is not defined because it's not a functions not part of the p5.js library or any other library that be choosing to use as part of my project there are other functions that you can call by the way that are just part of JavaScript inherently that you get when you use javascript and p5 adds functions to that so that's an error you're gonna see a lot it's it's because you've misspelled it maybe you got a capital wrong or it's just something you thought was in p5 or some other library using but it's not there at all so here's an interesting thing I'm going to just take out all the semicolons or like some of them no error message I'm having like heart palpitations right now because the semicolons give me comfort but the truth of the matter is the semicolons are somewhat optional in JavaScript they indicate where the end of the line is the end of a line of code background 100 is where is it it's there but JavaScript can usually figure out where the end of line of code is even if you don't include this the semicolon the weird things I'm going to show you something kind of interesting if I were to put let's say rect mode up here on the same line the code runs just fine the same way javascript actually thinks of that as two lines of code because semicolon means the end of the line then the next line but if I delete the semicolon now all this lost it can't figure it out so this is why it's generally good practice to use the semicolons it's like a safety net like I'm really explicitly saying where the end of the line of code is but you might you like really just you should have fun and just like not using colons but I can't help it and also I have to do the tidy code thing now there okay I know I said at the beginning of this video that I was gonna talk about the code comments but I'm not going to that's gonna be in the next video and do that separately so you can look at them individually and this videos title should probably just say like console and error messages so you won't turn up in your search alright so if you want to the next thing that I think is useful to you and like working on your assignment to your project for this first set of videos is understanding what code comments are and how to use them I'll do that in the next video [Music]
