 The idea of the Nordic Pavilion is to investigate architecture as the mediator between human culture and nature. Usually, we see generosity in architecture as an element that is between the built environment and people. But we tried to think about the whole built environment and the ecosystem as one thing. We have built these inflated structures and they interact with the different nuances of the environment. They all breathe constantly and according to the carbon dioxide level, they either breathe more or less. They are machines, but how they live is actually from the responses of the input of nature. We see the Biennale as an opportunity to bring a bigger question. We talk about the free gifts of nature, for example. For us architects, we need to reinvent the way that we reestablish the connection with the broader ecosystem. What kind of an architecture will be the architecture of that future? I would like the visitors to pause and feel a moment of hesitation. To ask, what are these things that we make? What are buildings?
