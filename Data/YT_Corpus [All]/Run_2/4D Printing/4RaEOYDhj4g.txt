 My project was amazing. I got the chance to build a Delta 3-D printer that is 6 meters tall in order to 3-D print clay houses. I learned so much this summer. I got to build a lot with my hands and learn a lot about how to brainstorm and research and design a project, do some 3-D modeling. This is probably the best mechanical engineering experience that I have ever had. You can learn a lot in classes, but it's not until you're actually doing these different experiences that you are really pushed, and you are really challenged and you really grow. And then I definitely learned a lot more than just engineering. I learned a lot about myself, about my strengths, about my weaknesses. I learned a lot about culture. And, in turn, I learned a lot about my own culture. It was a very, very empowering experience, coming home to be like, I did that. I spent 12 weeks in India. I worked on building a Delta 3-D printer to print houses. It was a very cool experience to say that. Ethos has provided me the opportunity to flourish.
