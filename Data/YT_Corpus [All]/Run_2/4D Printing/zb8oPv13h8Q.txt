 Zortrax M300 Plus is a new iteration of our large volume FDM 3D printer. Much like its predecessor, the M300 Plus comes with one of the largest workspaces of any desktop devices of its kind, giving you the opportunity to create large models in one go. This advanced model comes with Wi-Fi connectivity and the ability to create wireless 3D printing farms. A camera integrated into the printing chamber enables remote control of the manufacturing process. A high-definition, 4” touchscreen enhances user experience. The all-new hotend guarantees faster heating and thanks to the additional extruder fan, the cooling system is even more efficient which allows for printing with more demanding materials. The X and Y axes have been thickened to improve the extruder’s stability during the printing process. All of these features make the M300 Plus the perfect printer for large scale manufacturing.
