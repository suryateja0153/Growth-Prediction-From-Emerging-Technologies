 This is the Digital Factory Podcast. I'm Jon Bruner. Computer-aided design, or CAD, ties the entire manufacturing universe together over the last several decades it's progressed along with computers first it ran on mainframes with command-line interfaces and then it became a desktop application and now it's increasingly a cloud-based tool that you can run on a laptop a mobile phone or a tablet in this episode of the Digital Factory Podcast we'll explore the latest generation of CAD and see how it's reshaping the way things are designed and engineered. This program is brought to you by Formlabs, which provides powerful professional 3d printing on the desktop with the form 2 SLA printer and the new fuse 1 SLS printer 3d printing is an essential technology for ideation prototyping design and engineering and it's also becoming a practical technology for manufacturing as well with the form 2 you can fabricate looks like feels like models you can make jigs and fixtures for manufacturing lines and you can even 3d print injection molds and models for investment casting check out the full line of form labs printers and professional materials at formlabs.com. My guest today is Jon Hirschtick. He's the co-founder and CEO of Onshape. Jon it's great to have you on the program great to be here Jon so Jon has the the co-founder of Onshape and also the co-founder of SolidWorks a while ago you've been present at at several major inflection points in the development of computer-aided design so um tell us a bit about what it is that you're working on it at on shape today and how this represents you know a new a new generation of CAD thanks John and on shape we saw an opportunity to build a new generation of CAD that would help modern design teams work faster you know be more innovative get things done in less time and honestly also have more fun what I've seen in the last 37 years and the CAD business and working with SolidWorks as you noted when I was for almost 20 years is that the fundamental the fundamentals of CAD work but the process is really cumbersome teams and that's just getting worse as teams teams work in modern agile ways so the complexity of CAD today of these workflows maybe arises from the fact that CAD is used everywhere right and so more teams have to collaborate using CAD and this becomes complex yeah we find that modern design teams are no longer located under one roof they're spread out there's they're spread out because of geographic geographic diversity people are in multiple places corporate diversity instead of one company you're doing a lot of outsourcing or you're using consultants and contractors you're involving people like like customers who will never be consulted or a contractor who our customer customers are get involved in process executive management is getting involved so there's more actors and it's changing every day you know new people come on and off the team and so the first issue is just that it's it's Multi multi location distributed teams second issue is everyone wants to move faster they don't have time anymore for complex workflows they want to do things in parallel they want to do things in a highly iterative way they don't want to do these sequential Gantt chart driven flows because they don't have time anymore if they work that way they're not going to be competitive and finally everyone wants to be innovative and in some of some cases the the iterative nature I talked about earlier one of the reasons people want to do that is they want to innovate and they they don't when I talk to two - I'll talk to everyone from single individuals starting a new company working with a small team - CEOs of some of the largest companies on earth and they all have the same priorities and so yeah so that's those are some of the problems you have and cat is a cat is exacerbating that in the old state and we're trying to to improve it for the future so you have these situations where a lot of different teams now are interacting to develop a design together and the classic way this seems to manifest is that you wind up with a lot of files floating around on Dropbox or something and they're called like John underscore final underscore final v2 and so how is it that that you're addressing that a ton shape well we saw that that honestly that the whole idea of copying files and software downloading software or copying files you have all those problems the one you mentioned the the end with the software itself who's on what version it's impossible the right version so the way we fix it is really pretty simply we are the first and only professional CAD system where the CAD system and the CAD data are stored in one place in the cloud and they're never copied anywhere and it is really it sounds like a breakthrough idea for CAD but it's the way any other kind of business software works whether it's email or accounting software HR software Salesforce NetSuite Zendesk workday any modern software leader works this way there's a database and the the software system itself sits in the cloud and so by architecture we eliminate most of the problems associated with these old install and copying file around processes you're looking in real time at a global single source of truth no matter where you are on earth no matter what computing device you're using no matter how many people you're working with everyone's finally looking at the same model with no need for copying version control and revision II like you talked about final labeling something as as revision a or sent to manufacturing those are labels you attach to States in a global database and again instantly in real time everyone can see them very simple idea required us to rebuild everything from scratch it seems like there's an important cultural change that arises from this to that that's related to what you just mentioned where you can extend a tool to everyone in your company and we talked about this at formlabs too that you know just the in the same way that you give all of your employees email you give all of your sales people access to salesforce you give everyone in your manufacturing access to your QC software you ought to give all of your design Engineers access to prototyping and and 3d printing and in in this case you know you mentioned a few folks who are now involved in the design process and who maybe interact with CAD who might not have interacted with CAD in a world where everyone needs you know individual licenses that cost thousands of dollars apiece right right I mean the old model of CAD licensing was predicated on the idea that the CAD system was a thing in the corner used by an engineering group that was in the act in one little room you know it was never end so that's where he got this idea of expensive licenses and codes and installing it on one carefully curated computer you know and and so I in in I didn't really I wish I could say none of these ideas I really let's just listen to customers I would visit customers and they'd spend hours you know telling me all the time that's being wasted and then like you say it discourages you from giving the tools to your extended team and guess what if you want to be innovative and moving fast you want to give the tools your extended team yeah you know and whether it's at form labs or most any other company so I totally agree with you we with on shape we're not only giving you a cloud-based CAD capability and data management we're also giving you an incredible ability to deploy it and we we've actually built the tools you would imagine we would have built so you can deploy large numbers of users very quickly we we also even now attach to single sign-on systems in our Enterprise Edition so for companies I know some some of your audience won't know what this is about and some will be nodding their heads if you're using a single sign-on system like octa for example that's a way to sort of meta deploy all these systems you talked about so you can you can deploy or D deploy when employees leave you know everything you talked about your email you're you're maybe using agile process tools like JIRA or something those sorts of tools you just you you have one single sign-on in one point of provisioning and we're able to participate that because that only works with cloud-based systems you're not going to do that with installed so the other issue is everyone's using multiple computing devices so when you say deploy this system I mean you know in the old days it meant one computer like I said today when you say you give each employee email you don't give them access to the other systems you mentioned you don't give it to them on one particular computer they're going to use it on multiple devices they're going to use it on their their phones their tablets maybe maybe you even probably want them using it on their computer at home when they're home on the weekend maybe they didn't bring their laptop or they don't have it with them and they get a call from someone they're able to use all these systems that's the modern way as you see you know on shape rollout and and companies adopt it are you aware of any cultural changes that are happening as a result of you know giving it to more people within the organization and making it possible to sort of collaborate in real time yeah I would say there are cultural changes happening there our customers and the things I've just been mentioning one is people people find that some of the processes they use the need that our processes they just don't need anymore like they they don't need to have a formal process in a corresponding time delay to distribute a design update because they can just put a revision on and everyone sees it they they're getting back so that's one thing the idea of a CAD expert who has to be installing and care and feeding the system that kind of goes away and another thing is like you say like we're just talking about more people get to see the live design and that's a cultural that's a real cultural change for them the other one is freedom to to try things I've spoken to customers where they're like where there's a reluctance once the design is once the in the file based world once you get the assembly right and all the files finalized you're like I don't want to mess with that you know this it's kind of a there's an overhead there's an activation energy required to move it forward we tell our customers go ahead and in a you never lose a previous state of work that was good you're never going to lose that it's never going to go away you can always go back to any point in time and that causes a cultural change for people it's like what you mean you know they don't have to worry anymore about oh I'm about to ruin a good you know a good copy of my assembly because I can always go back to the good copy in assembly so people tend to try more things another thing another I mean I'm just going on another one is where people work we have a customer who said you know we now are doing design work it sounds crazy we're doing design work while we're driving around you know going between clients and he's like I never thought we would do that but now we're doing it yeah and so so there's there's a lot of the the cultural expectations in some cases it increases pressure on people because there's this feeling of oh well you ought to be able to do that from wherever you are and get it to me immediately right right and just can't hide and there's more transparency and that's sometimes not good some people resent that right it's just like having email on your phone at home on the weekend yep yep and also the boss can see what's going on mmm so like for instance for instance you know you send something out to a contractor and they're they're not working on it you know they're not working on mMmmm it's an interesting what yeah yeah yeah it can't be like well I'll send you the file Tuesday I know I'm half done it's like no I can see you haven't started yet and our newest our newest addition our enterprise edition of on shape lets you get reports analytics of which projects are being used where when and by whom you can look at it from any angle you know by the project by the person by location and you really get a lot of insight and that also means people have to be aware that they can't hide mm-hmm you've mentioned a few ways that doing CAD in the cloud can you know streamline the design process in the engineering process and in this sense I think of what you're doing is being similar to what Google Docs does or word processing or what github does for programming kind of centralizes work and turns it into a continuous process rather than kind of a broadcasting process where you say I've done my revision I'm sending it out I'm publishing it to my organization and I have to wait a week for them to respond so you see the design and engineering process is getting smoother and more continuous do you think there's a limit I mean is is CAD going to look like you know distributed programming or or Google Docs work a few years from now or will it retain aspects of the you know the hardware development process that are maybe a little bit slower a little bit more particular well that's a great point John we we like to think that you really you really congratulations you really get the the essence of it but you know you're right that that we are on shape is like Google Docs and it's collaboration and it's deployment capability and it's platform it run on anything platform it's a little like github in terms of formal release control as well that's super important in manufacturing so you know Google Docs lacks that kind of formality around releases and versions it lacks workflow though interestingly my children use Google Docs for education which has some workflow in it which is really cool because they don't offer that to corporate clients but they can turn in homework and get it graded and so that's actually a workflow activity that is in present so we had to look at it we while we borrowed a lot of thinking and we're inspired by Google Docs inspired by github ultimately what we've built with on shape is a unique approach that is not exactly like either those systems that is as you say aimed at the rigors of hardware manufacturing hardware design so for instance we have formal release management where you say you know I'm going to designate I want to release release package with what we call releasable objects like you can release an assembly release a drawing you can release parts you can you can release files of any arbitrary type to if you've brought in a data file or datasets from another system you put this together and you say I want to release this I want to promote it to a new release level and it enters a workflow with formal approve from different people that you need and and we we have a very formalized process and you'll see pending states on the release now it's cool and on shape is you can just keep working it never stops anyone's workflow there's there's no locking by the way Krishna there's no notion of locking you know you make that release package if other people do work it's it's incremental we also introduced the concept of obsoleting releases which of course is very important in hardware manufacturing these are capabilities that even small manufacturers need but that previously were only available in these super high-end PDM mplm systems that out of reach for most companies and came with all kinds of slowdowns that you know that people don't really want to use now that your fingertips so the answer is yeah Google Docs and github or inspirations we try to borrow what were the good parts of PDM and PLM thinking and ultimately have wrapped them into a unique approach that on shape uniquely combines elements into a system that we think serves our target market of professional organizations designing you know new new hardware products so this type of you know continuous development that you're describing where you're not locking things and sort of you know publishing designs as numbered releases seems to lend itself to a hardware development process it looks a lot more like a software development process where you know Google Docs is is released multiple times a day right and as a user maybe they're not even aware of it but the the software is updated constantly there's this dream that really it's really multiple times today I didn't know that that's cool and now that it is I mean they don't I call it a release but it's you know it's happening often some days multiple times a day to fix bugs to introduce new features and so on and it's it's almost invisible to the user sometimes you refresh in the UI looks slightly different but there's this dream that someday hardware development could look like that - mechanical design could look like that that if you have a manufacturing process that's flexible enough and a design process that's sort of continuous and incremental you could you know tweak an enclosure and send it to your to your manufacturer and if retooling isn't too onerous you know you've introduced that incremental change into your into your product uh well I like to think that we're the with our new generation approach to the platform we give people the tools they need to do that now unfortunately engineering and product design is still hard work yeah yeah we we haven't made it we haven't made it you know easy to build great products we've made it easier and we've made it possible you could implement those kinds of processes with on shape and I think pretty much uniquely because you know because the unique nature of our system you could have faster moving more continuous like I wonder if we'll ever have what you're talking about it's sort of like continuous deployment rapid where we're going to make a change and that boom products are coming off the line and you know the next one gets something different we're a long way from that because of the practical realities of hardware development I like to think that what formlabs is doing is helping that too because you've now made it possible to have such flexibility in manufacture I know we see in the many on shaped customers that use form labs printers we see them you know they're able to do fast iteration the the changes to shape mean almost nothing you know free now that's right you know that you can say you know we're not worried about recutting a mold or you know all the delays and cost with that and so I'm imagine that it's really about the tools working together I think the combination of a formlabs style 3d printing and and seeing your customers starting doing volume for manufacturing which I know is certainly seems seems to be on the agenda with the fuse and right you know and that that that will go hand-in-hand with that and give people the tools to do it but ultimately it's up to them to have this better and better process but yeah and the ultimately the first companies to figure out how to work like this with more continuous string of changes they're going to out-compete the ones that are still stuck in old right hold release cycle right you know and can I make another observation that that you touch on something that I just want to bring in here that the power of our on shaped platform of a modern full cloud platform for CAD is also changed how we can work and as a developer move cat and how we support our users you know we're able to support users in ways that just couldn't be done in the old world because we can a user can say hey I need help with this model and they let us jump in in real time only with their permission we can't do it unless they but they can they will invite us in to help them and our experts do that all the time every day they jump in in a few minutes they jump in help resolve an issue and then then the customer removes that permission and we no longer have permission we have no hobbies nothing and so we're doing that and of course as you know on shape releases we release every three weeks we don't do it during every day but every three weeks and and every user in the world instantly is upgraded all the data is is compatible there's no downtime associated with that and those fast updates means we deliver functions faster than our competitors in the same way we hope that our customers deliver functions faster than their competitors right right and it smooths everything out so it's I mean something you've you've hinted at in a couple of your your ideas here is that the the entire sort of product development process when you're using software like this can collapse into a synchronous process rather than as you said a Gantt chart driven process where you know you might have a an industrial designer and then the industrial designer locks in and then you have a mechanical designer the mechanical designer gets the you know an envelope that they're allowed to work in everything else is locked the electronics people are doing their thing it becomes possible to do that synchronously so so not only does it make that faster but it also kind of begins to collapse some of the areas of expertise that if you're maybe an industrial designer it makes it possible to work a bit closer with the mechanical designers if you're if you're an electronics person and you need to push the enclosure out just a little bit you can kind of do that and add a note let the industrial designer know that this has happened right but it becomes a more continuous series of interactions rather than like groups of expertise taking command of the project for a few weeks at a time and pushing it forward going to you know DFM at the end and then publish to the manufacturer at the very end so it makes it you know a more fluid sort of continuous thing and it lets professionals begin to like operate in each other's area of expertise and each other's domain absolutely yeah that's that's well said and and again that and that gives a more flexible work force to I was speaking to a CTO of a large company about that topic last week just what you're saying about this they don't want the the the siloed experts with the with the serial workflows it's not a great way to utilize your skills it's not good for innovation it's not good for speed right and and so we we make the tools that enable that but ultimately enable a better workflow but ultimately it's up to the customer to use it in the right way you know it just you know just like with 3d printers you can make the gear but it's up to the customer to adopt it and use it to make a real impact on their business process excellent so now we'll move on to a recurring segment where I ask our guests about his or her favorite tool and guests come up with all sorts of answers some of them professionally related some of them personal things that you'd find in a kitchen sometimes they're pieces of software sometimes they're pieces of steel so john hirsh Nick tell us about your favorite tool well my favorite tool is my my uniball pure malt for color pen that I use and I adopted for color writing with my pen a few years ago or readapted because we all had these as a kid so in prints in black - setup was black blue green red and it has the pencil which I really use in these sorts of pens were popular when I was a kid you know you'd get them like cheap pens but no one professionally ever used it and then a friend of mine who travels to Japan off and on business about all I'm gonna say about five years ago he came back from Japan and brought me this particular uniball pen it's called a pure malt and the barrel is made of actual wood I think it's meant to be made of the wood that would be used in a cask of single malt scotch okay now I'm not a scotch expert you know and it could be sometimes Japanese style you know liberalisation of English culture of America non-european cultural things but anyway the the barrel the part your fingers hold is is wooden it's real nice feeling and it's a 4-color pen and my friend said this is all the rage with Japanese executives all using these and I'm like okay thanks you know I through to my pocket probably give it a try well it really has changed the way I take notes and my runner-up tool that was a hard time deciding and they go hand in hand literally is my shinola branded journal box made in Detroit by shinola a great manufacturing success story I think and so my channel a journal book paper and my four-color uniball pure malt pan let me take notes in using the colors on the notes really help me organize in ways that I really didn't imagine it's also always having all four colors at your fingertips not changing pens midstream and I change colors without looking at the pad I'm so used to it so in the middle of a meeting red is my action color I'll switch over to red and there's a small clique but I can do it without looking us I feel the I know where the pen colors are so my favorite tool uniball pure malt four color pen made in Japan wonderful executive tool for for note-taking productivity and my runner-up is my Shinola made in Detroit Journal books excellent well Jon it's been a pleasure speaking with you if if listeners want to find you
