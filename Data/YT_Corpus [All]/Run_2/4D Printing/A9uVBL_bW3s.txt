 well tonight a federal judge actually issuing a temporary restraining order stopping the release of downloadable blueprints for 3d printed guns we've been telling you about the change that was supposed to go into effect tomorrow while a settlement making it legal for Texas nonprofit defense distributed to publish those blueprints online allowing anyone to download them from there people could use 3d printers to make these guns critics arguing the plastic guns will be untraceable and will easily land in the hands of criminals six on your side reporter Blake Stephens has been looking into now the judges action he joins us now live and Blake I understand you spoke with a local law expert so does he think this restriction violates the Second Amendment not exactly Kristin the judge didn't restrict gun sales he made it illegal to post the 3d plans online for now the case for those weapons now goes to federal court Stuart Harris a law professor at Lincoln Memorial University says those for 3d printed weapons will argue it's their First Amendment right being violated he believes their claim is they can express whatever they want to online and people can download whatever they wish to put it simply these change the gun game no serial numbers potentially untraceable and for a mother about to send her four kids to school they're terrified it's not okay I mean we're trying to protect our kids with all of the shootings and everything that's been going on here lately I I don't see how it's a good idea to give a plastic gun or even make a plastic gun where a child could see it and say oh this is a toy I'm gonna take it to school LMU law professor Stuart Harris telling me principal guns erode regulations set by the government and give licence to anyone to carry a weapon 3d printing of guns will allow mentally incompetent people children felons all sorts of people that I think most of us agree really shouldn't have guns will allow them to actually construct them in their own homes - Liz Lassiter it's simple she says our founding fathers didn't factor in 3d printing - the right to bear arms if you can't walk into Walmart without going through 20 different steps to purchase a firearm legally why should you be able to print the the blueprints to make a 3d weapon that just doesn't make sense at all Harris spears this is only the beginning he says principle bullets bombs and weapons of mass destruction could follow if it's as simple as downloading it online thirteen-year-old boys felons murderers rapists terrorists they no longer have to smuggle guns into the country they can come to the country by themselves a computer by themselves a 3d printer and create their own weapons here within our borders kristan more than twenty thousand downloads of 3d printed weapons have already been downloading according to see net they're a consumer and technology news agency with that federal ruling they've been taken down for now and while you can't download it at the moment Harris says this debate could go all the way to the Supreme Court so it's far from over and of course we'll continue to watch it Blake thank you so much by the way earlier in the day before the judge's order President Trump said he was looking into 3d printed guns and of course as I said we will keep you posted on this very controversial issue
