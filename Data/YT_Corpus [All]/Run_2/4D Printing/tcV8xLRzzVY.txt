 so hello everybody my name is Ellie and this is Humphrey we're from morphing metal lab Carnegie Mellon University so we have a big team in this project I want especially mentioned guan yin as our first author and leading as our advisor they take a lot of effort in this project and the other team members are contributing different aspects in this project so today on behalf of thumb we are here to present you for team ash standing for 40 printing morphing non-developer mesh surfaces so 4d printing is a fabrication concept introduced as 3d printing plus transformation over time so in some scenarios were observing 40 printing as more space-saving and economical than conventional machining and to some extent is also a material and time-saving than 3d printing since it will help to eliminate some support materials support structures so our group of morph metal lab has investigated 40 printing in different scenarios including edibles gadgets and toys made of thermoplastic and now for Team ash aiming at larger items that have some structural demands so long story short for Team ash is using single material and make her version FDM printer to produce comparable e large scaled items with non-developer mesh surfaces so to make it clear the non-developer surfaces meaning surfaces that maintains nonzero gaussian curvature is locally to make it intuitive you can interpret it as surfaces that cannot be flattened without shrinking or stretching so for instance on the left hand side we can see her gummy egg shape which is a developable approach towards that shape and in 40 mesh were aiming at a non develop approach which is one step closer to the right hand side shape and the basic non developable surfaces are cone shaped and settle shape so with those we can involve more arbitrary and organic form factors in our design so additionally I want to mention we adopted mesh structure instead of a continuous surface because the mesh structure maintains enough structural strength while saving us a lot of printing time material and also will helps to enable double curvature by eliminating some encounter forces inside the structure so looking at 40 printing in different scales we can see the 40 mesh is introducing a pipeline to produce comparable large items and specifically it provides an inverse design tool to process non developable surfaces so in order to approximate a 3d surface that is given we design a pipeline starting with the software that flats and flattens the 3d surface into a flat mesh configuration with some local geometric information and after we get that we can plan out the printing path and print it out with the 3d printer and then we submerge into hot water and they will morph into the target shape that we desire to be so become some artifacts like this so following this pipeline I want to introduce you to our digital workflow our flooding algorithm and that will include some detailed discussion about how the performance is in our technology so starting with the workflow firstly in our software would give these a choice between two algorithm that we implement it to flatten the given 3d surface and after you do that the software automatically flatten the 3d surface into a flat mesh configuration containing some local geometric information either shrinkage or bending angle and finally the software will output a g-code file to guide the 3d printing so using this tool the users can adjust algorithm and rasterization parameters and receive some visual feedbacks real-time and on the fabrication side we're using stack res for printer which is a major version at the young printer similar to MakerBot with with a comparable e larger printing bat and terms on filament we're using link one kind of material which is PLA and this is an off-the-shelf PLA filament more detailed information including the paper you're more than welcome to check it out and the mesh configuration we're printing out our consists of joints and beams since we want to diminish the negative influence the joints provides towards the morphing process we actually printed them with a lower impure rate so that it will be as flexible as possible when the transformation is taking place and the beams are consists of actuators and passive blocks since as I mentioned we're only using one kind of material so if you see this kind of representation later arm the colored bars are not another kind of material they're just spin it in different printing patterns so there are two actuators and the white ones are the passive blocks that will not do shape change during the transformation process and after we after we print out the match configuration we submerged into hot water to heat it up and figure out the transformation since we're scaling things up as I mentioned the gravity will become an issue so the artifacts will sink to the bottom of the tank and interfere the transformation so include so in order to condensate that issue we actually added sugar to the water to increase the water density so that the artifacts will neutrally buoyant in the water so after we're clear about the fabrication process let me introduce you to our flattening algorithm as I mentioned we actually implemented two of them based on two different kind of actuators one is the shrinkage based activator and the other is the bending actuator so they both have pros and cons and users are allowed to choose which one to use according to their specific scenarios and starting with the flattening or Ghassan with the shrinkage base our actuator we're actually distributing different shrinkage ratio in the beams in the mash configuration so that just for instance if you're distributing more shrinkage ratio on the outer line and less in the middle the whole match will pop up in the middle to become some shape like this so by distributing different shrinkage racial distribution we it can help us to achieve different curvatures both locally and globally so the shrinkage space that beams are printed with shrinkage actuator and passive blocks so as the printed parts were shrink along the printing traces when he so the shrinkage activators are printed along the longitudinal axis of the beam and the passive blocks are perpendicular to that so here we give a formula to calculate the actuator length in each beam so on a higher level with a given fixed beam less the longer the actuator is the more the beam will shrink so we're modulating this ratio to control the overall shrinkage of each beam in the mesh and we got a lot of technical details that we cannot cover in this presentation so here we're giving you an outline of the shrinkage based flattening orbital so the input is a 3d CAD surface and we first rendered them into triangular mesh and then simplify it with quadratic edge collapse decimation to prevent the mesh to be over danced and then we flatten the mesh with least squares conform maps with aching about value approach and by comparing the just the last difference between the previous two mesh we can get the shrinkage ratio on each beam on the mesh configuration so that we can section out how long the actuator should be in each beam and then print out the configuration letting morph to be the target shape so following this workflow we're actually generating several artifacts as applications for this method so taking the lampshade in the first row as an example once we get the 3d shape we bender it and remash it to be a simplified mesh and flatten it and then maintain the local geometric information which is shrinkage ratio in this scenario and then plan out the printing path pin it out and trigger it with hot water so it become a lamp you like this and another artifact I want to mention in this method is the chair seat so this chair seat is too big to be printed in the art pretty bad so we actually sectioned them out into two parts and so that's in the flattened them and fabricated them separately and glue them back together with epoxy so it become a chair seat like this and now I'm going to talk about our bending based actuator and threatening algorithm develop for so our bending Bezier that actually has a similar structure to our shrinkage actuator we're still using a single material but we're structuring the printing methods differently in this scenario we substitute certain layers of the air shelter with calcium blocks that has perpendicular printing methods by doing so we create a natural copy in the material shrinkage such that when he lead the beam will beam toward the side that has actuators and we can control the bending direction of the beams by positioning the actuator block on either side of the beam similar to our shrinkage a shader we can control the overall bending angle for each beam by modulating the length of our shader and again there are a lot of technical details we can cover in this presentation but they are detailed in our paper please check them out there if you have questions and here we're giving you an outline of the flattening algorithm so we develop our first algorithm for bending actuators based on the chebyshev main algorithm but we made some modifications first of all during the meshing stage we first extend the surface to make it into a larger one and then we mention and crop the mesh edges to fit through the original to reconstruct the outline of the original input and during the flattening stage to better approximate the bending actuators and the surface we convert the straight edges on the mesh into arcs and then we deploy chebyshev 9 algorithm on the plane again to derive a plan a planar mesh and then we but this time we're using the length of the arcs to instead of using a uniform length for edges and then based on the angles are the arcs we assign actuators to each individual edge and then we generate Rico files and fabricate artifacts and leveraging the advantages of our pending actuator we design several applications first of all is visible play this full plate is concurrently curved on both directions of the surface and with our pending actuator we can actually control each individual beam to curve on a specific direction so here's a picture of the fine final outcome and as you can see this this four players curve is curved on both directions and our our algorithm adopting chebyshev man is especially good at processing improve services that has a rather rectangular outline and also we design and armour set specifically this shoulder armor has a large bending curvature along y direction it spending more than 180 degrees and without bending actuator we can actually achieve this dress the curvature and here's a picture of the arm itself in addition to the shoulder armor notice how well the chess pieces fit into the body curvature of the wearer this is especially desired in costume designs and now after showing both our flattening algorithms let's make a comparison of them each of our flattening strategies has their own design spaces and unique benefits for instance our bending beds educators can process both cone shapes and settle ships and has a larger shippable surface curvature but on the other hand our shrinkage pays actually the better preserves the outline of the original improve and additionally it is structurally stronger we have also proved the idea of combining both of our flattening strategies together to produce artifice so here we show a helmet the shell of the helmet is designed without shrinkage actuator to achieve higher structural strength and the face shield is designed without bending actuator to achieve larger bending angle and we have also tested the structural strength of our folding mesh using a mechanical compressive load and our advisor also decided to sit down into tested by herself and yes there was a bezel fail moment for us and at the end of our presentation we would like to share with you our vision in poly printing we have a vision to create of 40 printing ecosystem leveraging smart materials in this vision software and design tools is an important part to interface designers to these materials and this tools and software will also handle the fabrication of aspect the fabricated RFS can be packaged flatly seven packages space and consequently reducing shipping costs the RFS can be transported outside and trigger on demand some other materials such as the thermal places were using in 40 mesh are recyclable hence creating a circular ecosystem the designers in our team excited about 40 met for several reasons first of all is this cotton mallet customized ability to create Juergen ami ships in haste and also non developable services provides a unique aesthetics and since we're pushing things in a larger scale we're also thinking about the possibility of producing larger scale structural components and me myself as an architect is imagining an occupational practice in which we produce houses in factories and transport them outside and trigger them into their functional States let's see at the end of our presentation we would like to acknowledge when doubting CMU school of architecture CMU graduate student assembly and next manufacturing center thank you for your thank you for listening to our presentation we're now open for questions [Applause] [Music] hi Laura Elbert University of Calgary cool it's thermal folding or through mobile holding who doesn't love it um I actually want to ask more about the structural qualities so you're basically introducing compression and tension into the structure itself so I'm wondering how that affects some of the more durability long term viability of this sort of approach whether or not it would last for a couple days or a couple of years so what's the what's the longer-term vision of how these hold up over time so the church we have designed Leslie for roughly a month before someone sitting only have eventually break it and we have observed the fracture patterns of the chairs so yeah actually they're pretty strong against compression but the weak point actually is the seams due to the FDM printing process so this structure is actually weaker against tension Hey - both University Copenhagen I'm curious how the thickness or the width of the beam affects the properties of the material does it change how much to convened there's a change the strength yes so yes the geometry of the beans will affect the transformation performances and in this paper we are basing our beam parameters on the thickness would be based on commercially available plastic chairs to ensure is structural strength and the width we we decided our width based on the nozzle with up our printer and also we we ran some preliminary simulations to check basically how wide the the width of the pins should be and there's also another factor that determines how wide the beam should be so because the joints actually interferes with the transformation process of our forty matches so we actually want to eliminate the joints or make the joints as small as possible and you can imagine that the wider the beams are the larger the joints will be so we have to modulate basically between structural strength and transformational accuracy oh one more question does environmental heat affect the final physician so if it gets very hot will it fold more or collapse oh yes so the triggering temperature is actually a tricky thing to select first of all you want the temperature to be high enough to allow the artifact to complete its transformation before it goes down right and on the other hand you want the temperature to be low enough to minimise convection in the hot water to having interfere less with the transformation so yes there are a lot of factors that can affect the transformation accuracy and the transformation is so but I'm thinking about after it's transformed so now I've actually are in the room and the heat comes on so when triggering the art events we're actually heating the thermal paksas above its glass transition temperature that is about 60 degrees Celsius and in room temperature I can really imagine there will be a scenario where this is exposed to that degree enough yeah thanks but yeah if you blow hot Air's on the chair it will start with e4 so I have a question actually um and it's about chairs which sometimes you want to be really comfy and it seems that you have structure that's not only has to be durable but you want it to flex just the right amount when you sit in it for example not be too hard not be too soft be you know kind of just right so in the tools you have do they give you some insight into the way in which is going to flex when varying kinds of forces or our placed on them so well since we're using POA in this project so the chair itself is pretty hard right and we didn't we didn't investigate into the aspect of using soft materials or compliant materials to make the chair see the softer say and yeah I suppose that could be included in future works to use composites Josh's 440 painting and in terms of the deformations of the chair we actually conducted some finite element and from the results we we think that the church should be quite comfortable for people to sit down hi I have a question so in some of your structures that you showed you know the the curvature was what was actually designed in a very unique way so I was just wondering if there is any geometry constraint like for example were there any designs that you weren't able to mold the structure to and like if you have if you have it's very hard for me to explain like but okay so we so actually our pending issues can if you have a been assured about this long you can bend more than 180 eighty degrees but in our applications the penny angle for each beam really goes beyond sixty degrees so that's why we're not showing that just a transformation here
