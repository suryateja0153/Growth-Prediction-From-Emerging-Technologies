 another presentation in about a half an hour but I wanted you to see in case you've missed it because it sold out in three airings and we launched it last year okay now origami is our number one top selling storage and organization brand and this is one of their top selling pieces it's this wonderful cascading decorative shelf so you will notice that the shelves get deeper and longer as you go down so it becomes that great way for you to display and store books and DVDs and photos now it's a ravely reviewed customer pick with literally tens of thousands of these shelves sold here at HSN and we have a price that I have not seen in a very long time if ever this shelf today that collapses down that easy store is that easy moves from room to room or home to home this top-of-the-line piece of furniture that does not have to be assembled is $20 off and free shipping today you can buy a top-of-the-line four tiered decorative cascading shelf and only spend $20 right now on any major debit or credit card to have a ship it out to you now Tracey Rose is going to dance her way in okay seriously seriously what do I love about this the fact that at zero assembly we're going to break more of a sweat dancing we are together so this is how it's gonna come to your home and I love that in the instructions it says it takes one person less than one minute to put it together so this is how it comes this is how you put it together you open it up you open it you open it and that's it so that bottom shelf basically just falls right in place and as you can see each one of these shelves already attached already leveled already ready to go done done that's it no assembly if you need shelving right now in advance of the holiday season to display photos because your mother-in-law's coming and there's no pictures of her out and you don't want to have a fight about it if you need a place to be able to decorate and put you know all sorts of fun holiday decorations and snow globe and you want to have a place to to lay out decorative pieces and you want a shelving system to do it but you don't certainly not this time of year won't have to build or put anything together this is the solution now we got great colors to show you great choices for you to choose from when you walk us through this one right here is our turquoise with light oak you know so this is a beautiful combination it's a beautiful rich turquoise it's kind of that color of that famous blue box if you want to get the color in the tone of that that's what you're gonna get there so back here is a this has been a huge customer pick because it's a platinum with grey and one of the things I love most about this is number one it's the most like popular accent color of these days and it actually looks like it's hand painted with that beautiful wood finish on top there it it looks whitewashing it looks like it came from that store that sells you really big furniture but says they're a hardware store hmm exactly restored like four times the price they restore your hardware for a little bit more than $20 a month exactly I think their membership is more than $20 monthly I believe so you know so again you're getting that you guys better love you know look at that look at how beautiful that finishes on that wood shelf right there gorgeous absolutely gorgeous so that's the the gray that's the gray in the Platinum young now this has become a huge customer pick right here because this is our vintage bronze with our walnut so this is a very very rich sophisticated shelving system right here I love that we have it set up as if you know you're displaying your beautiful Christmas dishes Thanksgiving dishes flatware all of that stuff our vintage bronze is very rich with specks of gold in there so it has a lot of contrast it's if you have leathers dark cabinets hardwood floors this is going to be that beautiful color there so that's walnut and vintage bronze great in office as well right here we have the walnut and white remember all of these have a powder-coated steel base so it will not chip it will not rust it will not corrode and again with that cascading design you get that depth so you can put taller items on one shelf and smaller items on another but that bottom base is going to be 18 inches by 18 inches so really that's your footprint Brett and the nice thing to remember too is they're not article board they are actual wood they don't deteriorate they don't start to crumble you don't worry about disassembling them to move it somewhere else having it kind of have that blowout when you try to rip out the dowel or the connecting piece it's real wood real powder-coated steel you're investing in long lasting top-quality furniture yeah and you even hear the quality of the furniture when I put it together you hear you know you want to hear that you know that wonderful wood when it bangs up against the metal because that gives you just that self-confidence of knowing that it is the quality of origami so we have two more colors this is that beautiful light oak with the white very very clean very modern I love this sleek clean look I like how we have it propped out with the bathroom stuff but it also looks great in your laundry room and all those different places and then if you want a modern look this is our most modern this is the black powder coated steel frame with the black shelves right here and this is the only one that's gonna match back perfectly it's also really nice if you're doing it like isn't part of an entertainment center absolutely it's where the DVDs and the the blu-rays go if it's where the the VCR the DVD player or the cable box is gonna go if you're using it as an entertainment console piece I highly recommend going for that black and I've actually read reviews about people who've done just that and the nice thing is no assembly the nice thing is when you move to your next home or when you redecorate this one you fold it up let's go they're moving origami again and you you move it wherever you want and then you put it back down yeah put it back I mean this really is no muss no fuss I mean look at how nice it looks even been side yeah you know I love this idea for the bed side because I have so much stuff that I put there you've got your glass of water your electronics a book a magazine a lamp and alarm all that stuff and usually it's just one level this gives you four levels of organization but look at the depth that you're getting in between each one of these shelves it's a great bar it's a great place to put like I said your holiday decor and I even loved it in the office and notice there Brett there's a full-size printer on that third shelf and there's even enough space that you can open that up if you wanted to use it as a scanner so again a lot of great stuff but this is what I'm talking about this is when we need it you know during the holidays when you're pulling out those mixers when you're pulling up those kitchen items that have been hiding underneath the cabinets that mixer you know weighs a lot you know so now you're able to store those clear up your countertop space get that real estate back and you can display it perfectly here but this is great like Brett said if you're somebody who loves to pull out that holiday decor and you don't have this space for it this is that perfect space this is that portable bar this is that buffet station and look at that beautiful cascading design it's one of the most decorator friendly really indoor designed pieces in the origami line and our customers have fallen in love with this line we have sold literally over a million origami shelves here at HSN across all the different designs that we offer this one is a ravely reviewed customer pick and internally like you know my producer said Tracy's as we all said it's this price is real is it really happening and it's not usually on sale and being offered with free shipping and handling that's a big savings this is a 25 pound shelf that's already fully assembled there is literally you don't have to put a wheel on you don't have to put a leg on you do not have to do a single thing other than get it out of the box and let it cascade open now it really will go anywhere you could possibly imagine it whether it is filling a corner in a living room a reading room a TV room it's a wonderful way for you to be able to create a multi tiered choice that you can put a bedside table you can flank in an office and even in a kitchen you know there's so many different wonderful ways to to use and design with this piece so it's a wonderful sale price today and it's gonna give you a wonderful way to maybe fill in a corner that you've kind of never really known what what to do with or what to put there yeah and if you're if you're wondering about what type of footprint it takes up you know this is one of our more decorative ones each shelf holds 30 pounds worth of weight when I'm talking measurements it's just under five feet tall so a great footprint but again assembly it says less than a minute for one person but it comes like this okay so you take it out of the box and all you do is open it up and you can here are the quality I mean that's that's wood that's not particle board and then you've just pushed each shelf down and it goes perfectly into place now again the footprint on this is right down here it's 18 inches by 18 inches so that's gonna be the biggest area that you need and it stands just under five feet tall so again notice that beautiful cascading design and I love that because you can put you know some of your taller items at the bottom and bring
