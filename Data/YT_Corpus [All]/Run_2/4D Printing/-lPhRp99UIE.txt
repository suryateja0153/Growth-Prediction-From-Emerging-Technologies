 If you make something, you're going to want to know about 3D printing. When we talk to companies about what they want to know, we always hear they want education. They want to know what tools are available, how to use them, how to justify them, and what new innovations they can do because of this technology. In 2012, this industry was a 2.1 billion dollar industry. In 2016 it became a 6.3 billion dollar industry. 3D printing is a whole new way of looking at things that will enable you to do things you could never do before. We're going to start in this class by addressing that goal. We're going to educate people first very broadly about the processes, the technologies, and the software infrastructures that are required. And then we're going to get very specific about the various processes (how they work) so that you can decide in your organization, or personally, whether or not a particular kind of 3D printing process will work for you.
