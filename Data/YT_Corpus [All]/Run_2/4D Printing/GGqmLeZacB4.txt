 Kollmorgen empowers their customers with the speed and custom products they need. With their new online catalog, users can fully customize their parts without ever leaving Kollmorgan's website. Let's check it out. Under the Service and Support tab, click Technical. Then, scroll down to 3D models. Here, select the product you'd like to configure. In the product configurator, you can customize the product to fit your design while the configurator builds your product on-the-fly. To the right under the preview tab, you can preview a 3D model of your design part as it will appear in your application. When you're happy with your design, click the CAD Download tab, add your email, and click the CAD Download button. Now you can select from over 100 file formats and versions to download your model as a native CAD file. You can also receive a free 3D PDF data sheet that you can easily share with team members who don't work with CAD. Click Start Download. Now you can test that part directly in your design. No more wait time. No more need for step files.
