 Hello everyone, I'm Zach Marr. I'm a student doing a directed study here at Kennesaw State University under Dr. Ayse Tekes. My partners Kevin Van Der Horn, Chong Tian and myself are here trying to solve a problem and that is, how can we simplify laboratory systems use to teach vibrations to control systems information to students? So here we have an example of a electrical mass slider system. We have springs, masses and dampers. The system is machined using dell parts and is fairly expensive, it's pretty heavy and students can't use personally. The goal of our project was to simplify this system into a format that is easier to use, cheaper and more accessible to students. Here is our dual parallel mechanism. It is made out of mize and beam. So beam is made out of POA and PADG. PADG is more flexible, but it is expensive. POA is cheap and easy to work with and you can usually change the configuration by changing the number of beams attached to it and here comes Kevin with his experiment. So over here we have our complete experimental set-up. Right now we have six links attached to it in a parallel configuration with our sliding mass that only moves in the x-direction. Attached to the top of it we have our triaxial 3-D accelerometer fed using a PCB system into the signal express by LabView software and when you perform the experiment what you need to do is place the mass initial distance you let go and you allow it to vibrate and oscillate. The top graph you can see we record acceleration versus time data and the bottom graph we record amplitude versus frequency data. This frequency graph can be used to determine the natural frequency of the system and by applying logarithmic decrements to the acceleration versus time graph you can determined the damping coefficient C of the system which could not be measure directly and because these are six lengths in parallel you can calculate the K equivalent by just multiplying six times the K value of each spring.
