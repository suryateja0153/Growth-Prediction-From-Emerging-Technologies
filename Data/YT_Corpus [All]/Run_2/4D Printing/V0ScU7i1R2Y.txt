 People generally think engineers are nerdy, they spend most of the time studying, someone who's antisocial... People we're actually really fun! I definitely think we're a new generation of engineers. People like Elon Musk have made being a nerd kind of cool. Engineering isn't boring, engineering is fun. Engineering is fun. Engineering isn't boring, engineering is fun. The cardboard canoe competition here at Rutgers University is one of the best engineering traditions in the entire country. It's really just about having fun. Getting there in a quick time is really important but getting there with style also wins over the judges. So I'm a biomedical engineer. I do aerospace classes. Circuits and electronics classes. Soil mechanics and fluid dynamics. I think it's definitely important to like take a break. Having a good balance is really important you need to mix studying with the really good time so you can push through it. You got to have some fun while you do some engineering, that's how you keep students motivated and engaged they also get to we're in real-world aspects of what's in the classroom. Having projects like this or physical examples of book problems, such as this one, is very important for the learning process. I think the cardboard canoe race is definitely one of the coolest additions. I'm probably gonna say it's the coolest thing. it really adds a fun element to being part of engineering.
