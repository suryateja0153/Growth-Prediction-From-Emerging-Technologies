 hey photographers welcome to this ROES  tutorial on how to add your logo to products and save them for later use it's a really easy feature in ROES and let's go ahead and take a look walk you through the steps first thing you want to do is we're gonna click on a catalog here and choose lustre and non color corrected and then I'm gonna locate the al a cart tab and the 8x10 after selecting the 8x10 opponent you to notice these tools here these small icons that I'm hovering over the Edit tool and these different tools here the drawl tool draw a text tool we're gonna focus on the drawl tool so click on the draw tool and we're gonna get and draw our logo box to keep our logo in i've also pre-loaded some dot PNG files down at the bottom here so once we draw the box and you have to play around with this to see what works for you and there are also these coordinates on the bottom right side here so you can also play around with those see what's gonna work as a test we're going to go ahead and drop the image in so you can see what that looks like remember these are .PNG files okay so i'm gonna have to drag and drop this football icon that i have here and you can see at first it doesn't fit but make sure you find the fit button there's a proper fit button and you can see once i click on that it fits perfectly into the image node making the adjustments that you need to and then go ahead and add your picture to the background behind the logo and you can see what that looks like and once you're happy with how it looks or which logo you select and the next step is to go ahead and add that it's a favorite so we go ahead and we click the art with the plus on make sure you select activate package creator it then go ahead and save your template and now we're gonna go ahead and go back and take a look now the only downside here is that the logo itself does not get saved which would be really nice it's something that will talk to the software developers about but for now if you only have to do that one time before you order hopefully that's not too big of a frustration for you because the end result is really great and it'll look really nice so this is how they look and once you add it to the cart you can see the logos have been applied thanks for watching this video I hope this video is really helpful remember to subscribe to our youtube channel and look out for more helpful videos like this thanks a lot
