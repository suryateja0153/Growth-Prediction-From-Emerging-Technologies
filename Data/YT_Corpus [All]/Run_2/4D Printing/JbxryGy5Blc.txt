 Hello everybody, it's Scott Crane here with Brian. Brian how are you? I'm doing great. We're here at the AAO 2018, I wanted to talk a little bit about some clear aligner ortho applications. Absolutely. Lets talk a little bit about that. Well I mean one of the things with ortho nowadays with all the things that are going on with our competitors and the market, clear aligners is a big booming business. It's also very very profitable for the dental lab if they want to get into it. Even if you are a full-service laboratory doing the crown and bridge, a lot of your general dentists, they're also doing minor movement with clear aligners - an opportunity for you to really capture part of that business, with doctors that you're already working with. Right. So with that, the clear aligner business is pretty simple, simple setup is, you're basically printing models. Okay, right. And then you're doing a suck down - which is simple enough and trimming them and you're in the aligner business. Very profitable and just some CAD software to get going and you can get into it. And you know I had a lab tell me "oh my doctors don't do clear aligners" and then he found out that since he wasn't offering it a different lab was doing the clear aligners for him. So  you'd be surprised at how many doctors out there are either wanting to get into this, or already are, and they may not be using you as their lab. I'm in it, my wife is in it. Yes she is. And really it's very profitable for the dental laboratory to get in to. Awesome, thanks Brian.
