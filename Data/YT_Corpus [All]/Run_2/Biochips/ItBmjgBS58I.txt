 so what we have here is a dimple which is a he civ sticker that goes on the back of your NFC phone there's two buttons so you can also get in the four button configuration but I just have the two buttons here and what it is is when you press the button it connects the antenna to an NFC tag and then you can attach an action to that so for the two buttons there's two different NFC tags and works with smart lock also so basically I can you know turn on my phone and I have a pin pad here but if I press the button it will read and then I've attached the flashlight function to this button so i can press it again turn it off but it fully unlocked my phone and then also activated the flashlight so pretty cool little it just adds some physical buttons to your to your android device and so at the bottom 1 i've attached to a tasker process that will launch get glimpse for me and then then I can like copy my location send of people so like if I'm driving something I don't have time to type in all the information I can just hit the button here is going to grab a glance to the clipboard and then i can paste it into a you know text or a SMS or whatever so pretty cool little thing and it doesn't get the way of other reading other tags either i can reach totally read other tags including my ex ante implant I can still read it just line so while you're not pressing the button it's not causing tuning problems or anything with the with the reading capability so pretty cool you should definitely check it out
