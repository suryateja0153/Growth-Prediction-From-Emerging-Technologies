 The best things often come in small packages. Case in point, nanotechnology. Researchers at IBM are creating tiny diagnostic chips that can detect early signs of disease in blood or urine samples. That allows physicians to treat conditions before they become major issues. The chips hone in on tiny particles called exosomes that contain valuable information about our health. They filter the exosomes along microscopic pathways into which only they can fit. Then they are examined for signs of concern. Best of all, this technique is non-invasive so patients aren't inconvenienced in the slightest. Who knew tiny particles could make such a big difference.
