 Randox is the leading company in the world in the development of biochips - for the early diagnosis of diseases. We have ploughed £285 million into developing these products. However we've also had a very long and productive relationship with Ulster University developing many different biomarkers. This is an expansion of this plan. We believe fundamental research is  vital to the well-being of our economy, and to our company and to our University. So we feel this is a brilliant way to expand this relationship.
