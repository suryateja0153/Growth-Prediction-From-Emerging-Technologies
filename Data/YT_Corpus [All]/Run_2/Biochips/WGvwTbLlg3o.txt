 [Music] hi welcome this is the second module of our class one for course fabrication techniques for MEMS based sensors from clinical perspectives now what we have seen until now is there are several sensors right that we can make for solving some important problems in the area of medicine or in the area of biomedical engineering same technology that we'll be discussing in this particular course can also be used for fabricating devices micro devices to be precise or devices based on MEMS based technology that is micro electromechanical systems based technologies that can also be used for other applications such as electronics robotics chemical engineering mechanical engineering and so on so in in our class one what we saw are few devices starting from the micro heater right so today what I want is I will just show it to you how the heater pattern looks like now the pattern that I will be showing it to you would be different than what you have what you're looking at the screen but the idea is that the micro heaters like I said can be patterned in a different way because it is nothing but a resistor right so resistor if you want to have a resistance of a matter if you want to increase the resistance of a metal you can increase the length or decrease the area right so let me show you the micro heater which is right now with me all right so if you can see here right this is your micro heater all right this is a micro heater you can see the pattern right pattern of the micro heater on the glass substrate right see is a pattern of the micro heater on the glass substrate all right this is the back side of the heater back side of the heater and what we are done we have we have we have used chrome gold we have used chrome gold as a matter okay so this is how the micro heater looks like now this is again you see that the length is high the area is also high so the resistance would not be that low but we for this heater was patterned with a particular application now another thing that you have may have observed is I am wearing gloves right so to avoid the finger prints so to avoid the contamination on the device again this devices are for the demo and that's why even the recording studio is not a class cleanroom like last thousand class ten thousand right this is just to show you the devices outside the cleaned oh right but if you have a complete device then the devices are of several types one that can only be used in a cleanroom environment second that can only be you that can be used anywhere else so we have to design the device since it is a clinical approach clinical research this devices should be able to go outside the laboratory and at the same time it should not have contamination issues that can be done when you package the complete device right because again the clinical environment the hospital environment would be is considered to be cleaning cleaner compared to compared to the dispensary when I say cleaner suppose the surgical room is there surgery room is there it is around class 10,000 ok so then what we have seen we have seen an inter digitated electrodes right then after in traditional so in individual electrodes what we have seen that there is a heater and on heater there is an insulator on which there are ide patterns ide patterns right so if you want to see inter digitated electrodes i will show it to you and show it to you here now if you see here this one which i am pointing this one all right this one this sensor this sensor here this chip has has a micro heater the bottom and on that there is an insulator on which there are inter digitated electrodes made out of chrome and gold this particular chip once again I am showing it to you this chip okay this chip so we will see we will see in detail about the the fabrication of this chip with a with a matter of zooming angle when we are talking about this device is in detail right now my idea is to show it to you how it looks like then it will go into detail how we can fabricate it and the time we will even zoom it further to understand how it looks like from the from the actual design point of view okay so what's the role of that what the role of that devices was that now on this integer electrodes you can you can load let's say if I load P so resistor P so resistive material and if I create a diaphragm on the backside so what does it mean I have this electrode right so you see here you see here I have as oxidizer silicon wafer so I will draw oxide sorry okay and then I have heater then I have insulator then I have inter digitated electrodes this is what this particular diagram is all right now if I if I have if I have P so register app is a resistive material such as P dot P SS on this and if I apply a force or a pressure on this piece of resistor I apply a force then it will not show change in resistance or it will show a very poor change in resistance R very small change in resistance why because I am using silicon then I have silicon dioxide then I have silicon right again I have silicon dioxide I have here heater right I have here I inter digitated electrodes right not because of this things because silicon is hard and silicon is hard material so if I want to see the bending if there is a bending then there is a strain in the phaser resistor right for that I had to create a diaphragm so what is the ephra means that we will etch silicon from backside in this particular fashion all right so this is your these your diaphragm that you have created this is the action that you have created and now if I apply a force if I apply a force then the Ephrem will Bend and this bending of the diaphragm would cause change in the resistance will cause change in the resistance you got it so if I want to deposit a material which is a piece of resistive material on this particular electrodes then I had to have a diaphragm on the backside this can be one of the application another application is instead of Pisa resistor instead of this P dot PSS right what I'll use I will use gas sensing material gas sensing material so if this material is material used in sensing material used in sensing gases right such as semiconducting oxide materials semiconducting oxide materials hmm like indium tin oxide zinc oxide tin oxide right indium oxide right tungsten oxide then if in the presence of gas in the presence of VOCs volatile organic compound there will be change in resistance because of the reducing because the VOCs are reducing gases we will see detailed how we can use it and then showing you that that AB the application of this particular this particular device right now can be in many areas in many areas and two of which I have just shown it to you one can be a force sensor another can be a gas sensor right so the the device that you have seen right now which I have shown it to you right was a micro heater on which there is an insulator on which there are inter digitated electrodes then what we have seen then we have seen a device for atrial fibrillation so again we need a flexible for sensors right so I had to make a flexible for sensors and the tip of the catheter the tip of the catheter and as I told you that we will discuss in detail atrial fibrillation so when I talk about tip of the catheter then we need Agena flexible for sensors right so what should be the sensing material it can be just a strain gauge so if I create a strain gauge or array of strain gauge like this right then it can measure force correct so how can I create this array of strain gauge on flexible material so to see the pattern so see the pattern I have I have here another wafer by having another wafer which you will see which you will see how the how the chip looks like when the centre of this chip there are there are mic there are four sensors you see here if I see if I show you this one right then in the center in the center of this chip there are four sensors Center okay and what's on centre of the chip every these are four chips 1 2 3 & 4 and the centre of the chip center of the chip there are 4 sensors all right so if I deposit if I create this kind of pattern if I create this kind of pattern on flexible material on flexible material it will be a flexible for sensors isn't it right if you just look at me now and and you see what I am holding right you can also hold the wafer in the way I am holding it's similar to this right earlier wafer that we had was a micro heater right so there are 2 ways of holding it when you perform lithography the best way of holding is always using tweezer this is called tweezer tweezer all right so we can hold with tweezer or you can even hold with the gloves like what I am holding right now so you see there is a so if I put it properly then you can see the pattern properly right so in one side I have I have flexible 4 sensors a pattern for flexible 4 sensors that I can use further on another side I have a heater is a heater this is a pattern for flexible for sensors right so heater we know how we can use it we now know that how you can use flexible for sensors right for for the atrial fibrillation for measuring the Keter contact force right so so there are several ways of how people are comfortable by holding the wafer again the best way is to hold with tweezers all right now depending on the dimension depending on the primary fret and second b-flat the prefer can be identified as p-type or n-type you see there is a flat one is primary fret here say second fret is at the bottom so it is at ninety degree you see here there is another flat 90 degree primary flat if I see it's not circular you see it's not circular wafer the there is a primary fret here and then there is a another flat let me just show it to you which is here at the bottom this is in ninety degree with respect to the primary fret here is a flat here is a flat so let us try to see if you can catch it yes you see primary flat and secondary flat right secondary flat is always smaller with respect to primary flat if we know where is the second fret with respect to primary fret then we can understand whether the wafer is 1 0 0 or it is 1 1 1 whether it is n type or this P type all right this advantage of primary flattens you can reflect we will again see Barrett at second reflex you will see how the lithography is done how can create this pattern a lot of other stuff in this particular course that is the idea of this particular course - to educate the students right in the area of micro-engineering particularly when we can solve some very interesting problems right using these devices so then what we have seen we have seen the flexible four sensors for atrial fibrillation followed by a cantilever a piece of resist you can deliver right so when we talk about wizards two cantilever right I had told you that there is there is an su a tip that is used for piezo resist you cantilever and as the name suggests there is a piezo resistor embedded within the cantilever piezo resistor embedded or integrated within the cantilever right how we can integrate a piezo register inside a silicon or on a cantilever we'll see there factors now as we know if there is a piece of register if I bend this cantilever if I pray apply a force then there will be change in the resistance there will be change in resistance right so how each handle ever looks like you said you can see the chip here right you can see the chip but this chip at the end of this chip so if I if I draw just a line like this and the end of this chip if you if you if you just concentrate on this particular chip mmm the line that I have drawn is this cantilever now why I had not line because you cannot see if you cannot see with your naked eye you have to go for microscope to understand there is a cantilever so how this chip looks like let us see here I have cantilevers for you if you can focus on the disk yes so you see or let us do like this let us focus I will put in my hand let us try to focus this yeah so the these small things within here right over here okay this chips these are the chips these are the chips but within this chip also within this chip at the end of the chip there is a cantilever you guys see so it's so small it is so tiny super tiny right and we cannot see the cantilever coming out we can only see the chip we can only see the context that we can take the context out of the cantilever so it's very difficult it's very difficult to write right now see the cantilever right it's very difficult to see the cantilever with with a naked eye even with the zooming factor of the microscope we can see the pattern of the contact pads there so if you see the screen what we are looking at here is if you see the screen the context the context that you can see which one this this chip you can see and this see if i zoom further what is it it is like this you see so you can only see this much you can only see this much you can not see this so in fact it is very difficult to see this as well right but but still you can see so what is this these are contact pads this one and this one contact pads all right here is a is here is your cantilever that we cannot see and this is the contact to the cantilever contact to the cantilever so in fact contact to not only cantilever but there is a piezo resistor embedded in the continual so if i zoom it further if I just say a cantilever right and that there are contexts for the cantilever this is a cantilever and there are contacts for and deliver then then there is a piece of register there is a piece of register and this is the contact to the piezo register this one is contact to the piezo resistor and then further you go down and make a big contact further you go down and make a big contact this context are for the cantilever this one this one is for the cantilever the cantilever has a su-8 tip it is super tiny as you can see everything is super tiny right it's in terms of micrometer so you assume that when it is micrometer if it is like this if it is nanometer you can definitely not see with your naked eye right so and we have seen that this cantilever can be used for cantilever can be used for understanding the mechanical property of tissue it can be also measure used for understanding mechanical property of cells it can be used to measure the stiffness of the material right and we will see how we can fabricate how we can apply this Pisa raise to Mecca and deliver from clinical perspective all right so next was inter digitated electrodes that we have seen right and in that what we have seen if you see the screen that we can place the tissue and we can measure the change in impedance again we will look at this in detail when we go into del about each devices then we have seen this chip right this chip and like I said now we are interested in measuring the electrical thermal mechanical electrical thermal and mechanical property of tissue in this case we should have a sensor that can measure the electrical property of tissue that can measure the thermal property of tissue that can measure mechanical property of tissue and to measure all these three properties to measure all these three properties we should have a chip we should have a that consists of or that is integrated with all three sensors right sensor 1 sensor 2 and sensor 3 so this we can call bio chip bio chip why bio chip because this chip is used for phenotyping or for understanding the change in the tissue properties and what changes electrical changes mechanical changes and thermal changes of tissue properties why it is important how to Shiva party changes why this whole whole idea of designing this tool comes into picture and really is it important to make this tool or because just we know Micro engineering we are kind of designing different sensors lot of questions right and it should be there it should be there before you design any device before you start working on any device the main thing is what is the application of the device what is the gap in the current research that you are going to solve right by designing this device am I going to solve a gap with really existing in the technology or is it really useful from diagnosis point of view and if yes how right so always understand the devices from the application for interviews first understand the application and understand the problem and then you and nu DS by device your design or design your device accordingly all right so if I want to see this bio chip how it looks like I have a bio chip in my hand right and here we have to focus on you see this area if I see the camera yes you know you don't have to see the center this one you have to see this one all right this one are all three of chips in bottom you will see there is there is a subtle difference because here you can see that there it looks different than this one right because now you have now you have a gold pad and on that you have su 8 pillars you have gold pad and you you eight pillars if I can show in this particular fashion yeah if you can zoom it further please yeah so you have here if you see this chip compared to you you see there is earlier one we are looking at this chip right where it was having micro heater and inter digitated electrodes now we are looking at this particular chip this three in the bottom three in the bottom and here there is a clear change clear change in the design you can see very clearly you cannot clearly understand what are the patterns but you can see that the chip looks different and we will see in detail by zooming each chip what are the patterns within the chip but these are the bio chips integrated with three sensors the bottom one bio chips indicated with three sensors this three and this one okay for this four indicated with three sensors one micro heater then piezo resistor and then electrodes alright and we will see how we can use it we will see how we can use it so if you come back to the slide we come back to the slide what we see here is that we have we have a heater we have the individual electrode over which we have piezo resistor over which we have electrodes electrode on which there are su-8 pillars you can see in the center right and on the back side there is a die there is an itching of the silicon and this etching is done using bulk micromachining bulk micromachining right if you go to workshop right then you machine the things right you machine the things here we are machining the things at micro scale at a micro scale that's why micro machining why it is bulk because you are removing a bulk of silicon you see if this is a silicon wafer right if this is the conveyor and I am eating the silicon wafer from the backside this is by silicon dioxide this is silicon this is silicon dioxide and I will tell you why we why I am drawing such a pattern always silicon dioxide with silicon okay so if I say that the silicon right is 500 micrometers and I am catching the silicon I am itching the silicon about 480 micro meters then the bulk of the material is etched bulk of the material researched right bulk and then the diaphragm this this one can be from 1 millimeter can be from finer micron 200 micron 100 micron right this is the window but this one what I am talking about is this one the area hundred micron 200 micron 300 micron 400 micron 5 micron it's in micrometers right here we are performing a micromachining technique micromachining technique right so so etting of silicon from backside is done using bulk micromachining see if there is a bulk micromachining then there should be also surface micromachining surface surface micromachining right so what do you mean by surface micromachining how it is different than bulk micromachining we have to see that as well and we will see it we will see it in some time all right let's see it in some time now we'll see the bulk micromachining from sir what is differentially bulk and surface by capacity then we have seen microphonic chip for rapid drug screening and I have discussed with you why it is important right the the importance of this particular device that you can see on the screen is that now you can test multiple drugs for the same patient so you can load if you if I just zoom this particular one zoom this one what is it it's a channel like this connected with a smaller channel right channel connected with a smaller Channel and I can load I can load cancer cells in this area okay I can load cancer cells in this area now below this below this there is the inter digital electrode here you see here interdigital electrons if i zoom for that looks like this and below individual electrode there is a silicon dioxide and below silicon dioxide there is a heater you can see this one you got it there is a channel inside the channel in this area in this particular area there is an inter digitated electrode which you can see from here below interdiction electrode there is an insulator and below insulator there is a heater okay guys now I have loaded cancer cells in this particular channel and I am passing a drug I am passing a drug one drug number one on this one right and I am circulating continuously for some amount of time let's say 24 to 48 hours you can select anything you would optimize it okay now how many channels I have I have eight of those I have eight one two three four five seven and eight eight channels I am right so what will happen I can test eight different drugs right because I have eight different channels so now you can do a drug screening that means if when when the drug is effective the drug is effective the cells would die and the impedance would change we will see in detail how this thing's works but the idea is now what you can see you can see that using this particular device you can test multiple drug for the same patient that means that if you take the cells from the patient and if you load in this channel and all the remaining seven channels right same patient and you can try different drugs to see whether drug is effective or not alternatively you can load eight different patients in a different Channel and you can try the same drug and see whether drug is effective or not both ways it is possible right either same patient cells from same patient in all eight channels you to test eight different drugs or or you take you take eight different patient's cells from eight different patients and you try a same drug and see what is the what is the efficacy of the drug how the drug is effective to kill the cancer cells or not right it's a rapid drug screening device a rapid drug screening device right so how does this rapid drug singing device looks like you have course you can see from the screen but how exactly it looks like so I'll just show it to you I have brought one for you just to see I'll put this back and take a tweezer right and then pull out this device right to show it to you first let us see this device in my hand right what you can see is there are certain channels right there are number of channels number of channels is there and then below the channel there is a the in the center there are electrodes below electrodes there is an insulator below insulator there is a heater so if I show you from the back side you can see the heater you can see the heater right you can see heater clock clearly and then you can see that there are lines going right like this which are inter digitated electrodes okay so heater is there but I am showing from the back because you cannot see clearly from the front that's why I'm showing from the back side heater is that on which there is an insulator on which there is a interdigital electrode on which there is there are channels and these are a different channel so you can test a different drugs right so let me just show it to you let me just show it to you here here right you can see now there are channels and then there are contact pads Agency contact pairs right over here right right over here there are channels and then there is below the channels there are electrodes below that there is insulator you cannot see that and then there is a heater so in the back side back side let me hold it properly right you can see now there is a heater right and this lines that are going lines here here here right on the second side also these are electrodes right and you can see also the holes for the channel right this is backside you can see heater first when I say back side from back side you can just see there is no metal here if I touch here there is no metal okay there is no metal on the back side hmm there is no metal on the back side right guys so we will see in detail again by zooming it further when we are talking about the microphone a device for rapid drug screening but in principle in principle this devices can be fabricated using the micro engineering technology right it can be fabricated using microns in technology and this can be used for rapid drug screening so that was that was about the Micro engineering devices but when you have when you have drug to flow when you have some fluid to flow in such a channel which about one millimeter or 100 micron or 200 microns any anywhere between 100 to 1 millimeter right or 0.5 millimeter then it comes as a micro channel and a fluid flowing within the micro channel we have to understand micro fluidics that's why such a devices are also called microfluidic device or microfluidic chips all right this devices are also called microfluidic chips so when you talk about microfluidic you have to also understand whether the fluid flowing from that will be a smooth flow or turbulence flow you have seen right those when the river flows right unevenly on this stone if there are if you have seen the river flowing very fast you see a lot of turbulence is there then you have also seen river which is slow in nature right smooth it smooth flow turbulence flow same way people who are travelling flights right you may have experienced an air pocket then suddenly there is a turbulence right so we don't want turbulence right we don't want turbulence so the flow should be smooth to understand this turbulence and smooth flow we should further understand something called high Reynolds number Reynolds number so we will discuss this when we will discuss about the microfluidic chip all right now if I go to the next slide what I see is I see a device that can be used to understand the antibiotic susceptibility testing for what for bacteria and like we discussed in the last module that the material antibiotics ability is extremely important problem since lot of neonates gets affected with several material infections and the report right now comes in 24 to 48 hours right which is which is too long for an unit to wait for and because of this lot of neonate dyes there are babies dyes there is one thing second thing is even for us right even for the grown-ups generally we have to take multiple antibiotics topical antibiotics and we don't want to do that right we want to we want to create a technology that can aid the doctor to give a particular antibiotic within the shorter period of time rather than waiting for the reports to come back from path lab are in 24 to 48 hours or even sometimes 72 hours right so for that can we design a microphone a chip that can perform this kind of rapid testing or can we have a just a microchip that can do rapid testing so we'll see that particular you know work as well and for you guys I have also brought you this microphone a chip again we will discuss this microphone a chip in detail when we are talking about the rubbing about this particular topic in detail but right now let's see how it looks like right so in my hand there is a microfluidic chip that can be used that can be used to understand the antibiotic resistance antibiotic resistance right this is this is our chip looks like now again you see this is all about the design right and here we have used PDMS this material is called PDMS silicon all right we'll see how we can create this kind of channels but love suppose I want to now commercialize this one right and I want to put it in in each and every pet lab so that I can rapidly rapidly diagnose which bacteria is there and then rapidly diagnose whether bacteria is the resistant to particular antibiotic or not what should I do because the wafer that I'm holding right now right itself is costly it's a glass in glass right I can use a glass slide instead of that one way now there are gold patterns and then there is a PDMS again you will see that when you want to create a PDMS chain channels in PDMS is a it's a pain it's not so easy right and then it is costly suppose we have excellent skills right we should have if we have an excellent skill in micro fabrication but if the if the fabrication is costly we cannot use this we cannot use this right we cannot use this technology in that case we have to off for some different technology so instead of creating a channel in PDMS can I create a channel in plastic can I do plastic molding can I stick a plastic on this on the electrodes and heater can I make entire device on the plastic anti device right it will solve a lot of problem if I have anti device on the plastic because it will be cheaper right it is robust this it is this is fragile this project if I if I just leave it it will break into pieces right so the point is that we not only have to design a device first of course for research we can design a device we can test the device whether the concept works or not what we are thinking whether it works or not it's good for that particular area once you have designed the device it works well you have to now go further and reduce the price now this is not necessary for every medical technology for every medical devices no right but for some yes when you reach masses where people cannot afford where people cannot afford the the high-end technologies for for understanding whether they have a particular material infection or not or something else this is I'm just giving an example then if you have a alternative technology which is similar which gives a similar performance which has similar performance to this costly technologies right and that everyone can afford if I make everything in plastic right and if I if I have the total cost of the device around five five dollars there are about 250 rupees 300 rupees then each core each patient has to just pay two three rupee two to three rupee maybe four if I rupees maybe ten rupees will be twenty fifty right but not like 100 not like three and then not like fire and did not like thousand no we have to try to make technologies we have to try to design technologies that can reach each and everyone in our society no one should die because they cannot afford effort about technologies right that is the idea that is the interest that should be the interest either I can create a sophisticated device with you know and sell it for like a few legs or I try to understand the concept use my research try to bring the cost down and still maintain the performance then this device can be used for a common man like you and me and people who cannot afford at all right can we put this device or such devices in government hospitals and can it be used for free government has a lot of subsidies right so you see that if you if you really understand the concept you can make technologies which are low cost and which can be used for betterment of human life all right anyway this in detail how it can be used this is really hot topic and very important topic right now for the in the area of research antibiotic resistance again when you want to understand any topic if I talk about drug screening or if I talk about antiviral resistance or if I talk about atrial fibrillation or if I talk about cancer diagnosis tool right every time if I use a word try to see more try to look at videos try to try to look at the technologies available try to read research papers write more you read more you understand how the technologies are or how the technologies work and how we can create a different technologies compared to the existing technology right and how it will be better than what we are creating right so saying that let's see the next one next one what we saw if you see on the screen that is the microfluidic chip for evaluating drug efficacy right and here we discuss about that this device we can mimic the in vivo situation on in vitro platform right we can mimic the in vivo situations on in vitro platforms right these are in vitro microphone a chip so if I want to mimic this one I can create a device right which will have a similar kind of design which is within the body within the body this is very simple microphone a chip now people are also working on organ on chips organ on chips so to have this kind of pattern if I want to have this kind of pattern these are all SEM images like I said for I'm sorry about this this is like this so if I want to have if I want to create the microfluidic chip right I have to have a mold mold and his mold is of silicon and this was this what you can see this these are all SEM images scanning electron microscopy scanning electron microscopy these are our SEM images right and these images are of the mold mold and using this mold we will create the PDMS channel the channels in PDMS all right so how this device looks like how this device looks like let us see if you see what I have I'll just show you the pattern I will show you the pattern see what I am showing you to you is this one so this is the channel that we are looking on the SEM and then in between the channel if you see the central region here we can load the we can load the material on one side we can load the cancer cells on another side of the channel here this device there are two channels you can see right so one channel we can load the cancer cell another channel we can load the epithelial cells or who excels who excels is a right way way hu VEC who excels and in Center we can learn matrigel and then we can test different combination of drugs so how this works we will see when we are discussing this device into detail this is the pattern of the device pattern how the mold would look like now this is just to show it to you how the pattern looks like this is not a mold again to create a mold we had to create this kind of pattern on silicon and then do each the silicon to etch the silicon when you edge the silicon so opposite of whatever is there in the silicon will come in the channel opposite of whatever is there in silicon will come in the channel if it is too confusing let us see what does I what do I mean by opposite of that so if you see the screen if I have silicon like this and I create something like this right and if I have a PDMS if i QR PDMS this this layer is PDMS if I cure PDMS my PDMS will look like when I peel it off when I peel PDMS off my PDMS will look like this do you want this we would not want this right we want channels in PDMS so if I take a silicon and if I add silicon in this particular fashion right then if I pour PDMS then my PDMS will look like right that is that we have created a channel in PDMS right this is my PDMS we have created a channel in PDMS what what I mean by opposite is whatever the mold is this is mold right this is mold whatever the pattern on the mold is opposite will come here you see there is a hill here is a valley here is a valley here there is a hill here right so you can see here what we have is a valley so opposite of that would be Hills if there is a hill which you can see here right clearly then opposite of that would be in the PDMS that's what I mean by opposite you will see in detail how we can fabricate this device as well when we talk about the combinational therapy the the devices that can be used for understanding the combination of drugs okay then we also talked about the flexible MEMS for phenotyping tissue properties right and this is similar to that we have seen earlier also if you see this one this one right or this one right it has two sensors one is electrical sensor and another one is a piezo resistive sensor and this device looks like this which we have seen earlier just to show you quickly once again I am showing it to you this is similar device which I am holding in hand right these are device that you see on the screen as well this is the device that I am holding right now this has a piezo register and it has a electrode and everything is in the center everything in the center the rest is just a chip register bio chip okay alright so that is what we are looking at on the screen right it is on the flexible material that's why we say it is a flexible MEMS and can be used to understand the tissue property that's why we say that the flexible members for phenotyping tissue properties right okay now let us talk about one more technology called immunotherapy called immunotherapy okay so immunotherapy is therapy that will activate your immune system as the name says immunotherapy right it will it will work with your immune systems and again immunotherapy I have several divisions we will just talk about one particular division in which we need to understand whether the immunotherapy drugs will be effective or not right so you understand very simple thing here and then we will discuss in detail later on right now when the when there is a tumor which you can see this particular figure right and there are cells that flows in the blood vessels right then within the cell there are something called t-cells we will discuss about T cells later on and depending on the tumor if the immune system is working well if the immune system responds well to the tumor then there is a change in cd4 and cd8 concentration sorry cd4 is - cd8 concentration now you understand this thing cd8 are called killer cells killer this cd4 cd8 are in T cells okay we'll see what is T cell how cd4 cd8 becomes right now just understand cd8 is killer cd4 is helper cells so what I said if the immune system responds well to tumor the killer cell should be higher in number right T less I should be higher in number so the blood is taken from the patient and cd4 cd8 ratio is measured using something called flow cytometer flow cytometer flow cytometry okay you understood this much now if I want to create the similar kind of environment which is my in vivo environment on to in vitro platform I can design a microfluidic chip I can design microphone a chip which will mimic this in vivo situation okay what I will do now what I will do I'll create the channels and lower the tumor in the center of the channel in the center like you see here right you can see the the magnified view of the chairman's channel with dimensions in figure number F in Figure F right so here I'll load the tumor and from here I'll pass the T cells pass the T cells right now immunotherapy is not so easy to understand but just to help you out if there is a cancer cell and there is something called immuno checkpoint immuno checkpoint right so one is called PD l1 alright and on T cell correspondingly there should be PD one PD one what is around cancer cell PDL one cancer cell is T cell what is on T cell PD one this PD one will interact with PDL 1 and it will think that the cancer is normal there because normal cells normal cells also has PDL one so cancer the t t cells cannot distinguish between normal and cancer t-cell cannot distinguish with normal and cancer in this case if I block this PD one if I block PD one then T cells will just kill cancer cells because it cannot it cannot find it cannot have a bonding between PDL one and pd1 it cannot have interaction between PDL 1 and PD one so what will happen the T cells will start killing the cancer cells and more T cells will generate or we can also work on engineering T cells as a different topic right now we are not interested in that we are just interested in that if I use a drug that can block PD 1 and that's why the drug name is called ntpd 1 and t pd 1 so if I block the immuno checkpoint one of the checkpoints right on T cell and then if T cells cannot have interaction with PDL 1 the T cells will kill cancer cell so in this case if my cd8 will start increasing killer cells would start increasing number of cd8 increasing that means my my drug is effective my dog is effective right so I can use this NTP d1 and similar kind of drugs similar kind of drugs right and test it by flowing this across this channel loaded with nitrogen and tumor and every time I flow after 48 hours I measure the cd4 cd8 ratio that means I first flow just T cells just T cells and measure cd4 cd8 then I float T cells treated with drug let me write out here T cells treated with drug t-cells it'll be drug and then I again flow in this channel after 48 hours I again measure cd4 cd8 ratio correct then I try with Caesar fitted with another drug three drugs for drugs Phi drugs every time I measure cd4 cd8 ratio I keep on measuring cd4 cd8 ratio whichever drug is more effective I'll get a better response for cd4 cd8 ratio right that means that you can now based on the because see if there are three different drugs you don't know which drugs will be more effective for a particular patient so if you know with the help of patient cells if you pass the if you extract the t-cells from blood and you could treat the T cells with drugs you will know whether their patient will respond to particular and immunotherapy drug or not right because you see if there are three drugs let's say there are three fda-approved drugs and right now we just give one of the drug to the patient which whether the patient will respond to the drug or not we we probably don't know so if we can design a patient-centric device if you can design a patient-centric device such that you can lower the tumor or you can lower the cells of the patient in the channel you extract the blood and from that you accept T cells and if low T cells without any drug next to this cells cancer cells or tumor within the macrophage chip and you measure cd4 cd8 ratio then you treat these T cells with a particular drug like a first drug and you flow it anyway the cd4 cd8 ratio then you treat the T cells with second drug and you again flow it in the channel any whether cd4 cd8 ratio then you take T cells that treated with third drug right flow in the channel again measure cd4 cd8 ratio in if the drug is effective if the blockage is well-liked ntpd one right there are other other immuno checkpoints as well I am just taking an example of one immuno checkpoint then what will happen what will happen that the B is on the cd4 cd8 ratio we can know that yes look at this result this the patient will respond probably better to this particular drug rather than the another two drugs in if you can do that then you can use this device as a patient-centric platform in case of you know understanding the away or awake evaluating the efficacy of the drug immunotherapy drug and this is very important because immunotherapy right now is given at that next stage like chemotherapy radiation therapy immunotherapy right it's very interesting for people who really want to understand how cancer works and what kind of you know therapies are there learn what is chemotherapy what is the side effect of chemotherapy what is radiation therapy what are the side effects of radiation therapy what is immunotherapy that we discuss what are the side effects of immunotherapy now the point is when you when you do research on immunotherapy you will see that 68% of patients response well 32% does not respond to n so why 32% are not responding well when already these are fda-approved drugs so can we design a device that can be used in a fashion that we just discussed so again to claim something we should have very strong data this is another area which people are working on right and I am just talking about a subdivision of immunotherapy meno therapies vast area any therapy is always fast right we have to understand a small portion and try to solve that portion try to understand further so as an engineer I can only III know what are the what are the problems but but the point is I I don't know lot of medical terms and that's how a very important thing is whenever you guys design whenever you guys develop any device always have a coalition as your partner right because doctors are the right person to talk to if you want to work in the area of clinical research then general scientist you can help them to solve the problem what is a problem and is it really a problem after we do our study we talk to the clinician we get the response from them we understand the problem and then you develop your device then you design your device their new performer experiment then you show the data and then the device will be actually useful so that is how you generally work in the area of biomedical or clinical research okay so point was can you design this device and the answer is yes and you will see how we can how we can design such a devices and again this is micro fluidics so we call it as a microfluidic chip all right okay so there are two more devices after this and we will discuss this in our third module two or three devices left to show it to you in terms of micro ranging devices and that will finish our lecture one after that we will start understanding technologies to fabricate my micro sensors and micro engine devices or micro sensors or MEMS based sensors right and we will see how we can fabricate those devices so we had to understand process flow via understand recipe right it is very simple let's see micro technology also relies on process flow it also relies on recipe like our life right for example if you want to make a sambar if you may to make a Samba right sambar with idli someone with those right somebody with rice somewhat is delicious right so the process flow to make the sambar is known I also know you also probably you know right but the recipe that we use the way I will make my somewhere will be different than yours and probably the way that our grandmother used to make where we'll be more delicious compared to what we will make right because they know correct recipe correct recipe process flow is same recipe is correct same way when you want to fabricate device first is you should understand process flow what is my first process I should take a silicon wafer what's the next process I should clean my silicon wafer what is the next process right the process flow we know I should H this metal how much time who wants to be the thickness what is the bonding time how can I mix my PDMS with my hardener these are all recipes recipes if we don't know correct recipe your device will not be will not be working right so it's very important that you correlate the things in your life with research it is easier to understand process slope and it is actually called recipe guys in micro engineering this are called recipes and the process flow same thing like our life same thing like cooking right so just understand and merge both the real life applications with the academics and ER your research your your study will become easier okay so with that just go through the all the things that we discussed today and we will discuss remaining devices in the next module till then you take care bye
