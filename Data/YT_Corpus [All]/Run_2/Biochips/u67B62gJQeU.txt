 live from Washington DC if the cube covering in forum DC 2018 brought to you by in for well welcome back to Washington DC we are live here in the convention center at in forum 18 along with Dave Volante prime John wall's it's a pleasure now welcome to the cube Lee Martin who is the senior director of the dynamic science labs at infor and good afternoon D Lee thank you for being here all right well tell us about the labs first off obviously data Sciences is a big push and in for what do you do there and then why state of science such a big deal yeah so dynamic science labs is based in Cambridge Massachusetts we have about 20 scientists with backgrounds in math and science areas so typically PhDs in statistics and operations research and those types of types of areas and we've really been working over the last several years to build solutions for in for customers that are math and science base so we work directly with customers typically through a proof-of-concept so we'll work directly with customers we'll bring in their data and we will build a solution around it we like to see them implement it and make sure we understand that they're getting the value back that we expect them to have and then once they once we prove out that piece of it then we look for ways to deliver it to the the larger group of in for customers typically through one of the cloud Suites perhaps functionality you know that's built into a cloud suite or something like well give me an example I mean it so as you think they're saying that you're using data it's math and science based for application development or solution development for you well yeah like how so so I'll give you an example so we have a solution called inventory intelligence for healthcare which we're it's moving towards a more generalized name of inventory intelligence because we're going to move it out of the healthcare space and into other industries but this is a product that we've built over the last couple of years we worked with it a couple of customers we we brought in their loss and data so their loss in customers we bring the data in an area where we can work on it we have a scientist in our team actually she's one of the senior directors in the team Don Rose who led the effort to design and build this design and build the algorithm underlying the product and what it essentially does is it allows hospitals to find the right level of inventory most hospitals are overstocked so this gives them an opportunity to bring down their inventory levels to a manageable place without increasing stock out so obviously it's very important in healthcare that you're not having a lot of stock outs and so we spent a lot of time working with these customers really understanding what the data was like that they were giving to us and then Don and her team built the algorithm that essentially says here's what you've done historically right so it's it's it's based on historic data at the item level at the location level what have you done historically and how can we project out the levels you should have going forward so that they're at the right level where you're saving money but again not implementing stuff you're not increasing stock out so so it's it's a lot of time and effort to bring those pieces together and build that algorithm and then test it out with the customers you try it out a couple of times you make some tweaks based on their business process and exactly how it works and then like I said we've we've now built that out into originally a standalone application and in about a month we're gonna go live in Cloud suite financials so it's going to be a piece of functionality inside of cloud Suite financials so John if I may digress for a moment here because the first data scientist that I ever interviewed was the famous Hilary Mason it was course now at Cloudera but and she told me at the time that the data scientist is part mathematician part scientist part statistician part data hacker part developer and part artist so you know it's it's an amazing field that Hal Varian who's the the Google economist said you know it's going to be the hottest field in the next ten years sure and it's sort of proven true but my question is so you guys are practitioners of data science and then you bring that into your your product and what we hear from a lot of data scientist other than that sort of you know Penelope of skillsets is they spend more time wrangling data and the tooling isn't there for collaboration and how are you guys dealing with that how has that changed inside of infor mm-hmm it is true and we actually really focus on first making sure we understand the data and the context of the data so it's really important if you want to solve a particular business problem that a customer has to make sure you understand exactly what is the definition of each and every piece of data that's in all of those fields that they send over to you before you try to put them inside an algorithm and make them do something for you so it is very true that we spent a lot of time cleaning and understanding data before we ever dive into the problem solving aspect of it but and to your point there are there is a whole list of other things that we do after we get through that phase but it's still something we spend a lot of time on today and if that has been the case for you know a long time now we wherever we can we apply you know new tools and new techniques but actually just a simple act of going in there and saying what am I looking at how does it relate let me ask the customer to clarify this to make sure I understand exactly what it means that part doesn't go away because because we're really focused on solving the the customer solution and then making sure that we can apply that to other customers so really knowing what that data is that we're working with is key so I don't think that part has actually changed too much there are certainly tools that you can look at and people talk a lot about visualizations so you can start thinking okay how can I use some visualization to make to help me understand the data better but just that that whole act of understanding data is key and core to what we do because we want to build the solution that really answers the answers the business problem the other thing that we hear a lot from data scientists is that they help you figure out what questions you actually have to ask so it sort of starts with the data you analyze the data maybe you visualize the data as you just pointed out and all these questions pop out what is the process that you guys use you have the data you you you've got the data scientist you're you're looking at the data probably asking all these questions you get of course I'm getting questions from your customers as well you're building models maybe to address those questions training the models to get better and better and better and then you infuse that into your software so maybe is that the process is it a little more complicated than that maybe you could fill in the yeah so I my personal opinion and I think many of my colleagues would agree with me on this is starting with the business problem for us is really the key there are ways to go about looking at the data and then pulling out the questions from the data but generally that is a long and involved process because it takes it takes a lot of time to really get that deep into the data so when we work we really start with what's the business problem that the customers trying to solve and then what's the data that needs to be available for us to be able to solve that and then you know build the algorithm around that so that so for us it's really starting with the business problem okay so what are some of the big problems we heard this morning that that there's a problem in that there's more job openings than there are candidates and productivity business productivity is not being impacted so there are two big chewy problems right maybe attack and you guys seem to be passionate about those so how does data science help solve those problems so I think that you know at infor I should start off by saying at infor there's actually you know I talked about the folks that are in our office in Cambridge but there's quite a bit of data science going on outside of our team and we are the data science team but there are lots of places inside of infor where this is happening either in products that contain some some sort of algorithmic approach the HCM team for sure the talent science team which works on HCM that's a team that's led by Jill strange and we work we work with them on certain certain projects in certain areas they they are very focused on solving some of those people related problems for us we work a little bit more on the some of the other areas we work on as sort of the the manufacturing and distribution areas we work with the healthcare side of things so supply chain exactly so some of the other some of the other areas because there are like I said there are some strong teams out there that do data science it's just they there it's also incorporated with other things like the talent science team so so you know there's lots of examples of it out there in terms of how we go about building it so we we you know like I was saying we work on answering the business the business question upfront understanding the data and then really sitting with the customer and and building that out and so the problems that come to us are often through customers who have particular things that they want to answer so a lot of it is driven by customer customer questions and and particular problems that they're facing some of it is driven by us we have some ideas about things that we think you know would be really useful to customers either way it ends up being a customer collaboration with us with the product team that eventually we want to roll it out to to make sure that we're we're answering the problem in the way that the the product team really feels it can be rolled out to customers and and and better used and more easily used but assume it's a nonlinear process that it's not like somebody comes to you a problem and it's okay we're gonna go look at that okay now we got an answer I mean it's it's it's you're more are you more embedded into the development process than than that can you just explain that so we do have we have a development team in Prague that does work with us and it's depending on whether we're going we think we're going to actually build a more a product with aspects to it like a UI versus just a back-end solution depends on how you know how we've decided we want to proceed with it so for example I was talking about inventory intelligence for healthcare we also had pricing science for distribution both of those were built initially with you eyes on them and customers could buy those separately now that we're you know in the cloud Suites that those are both being incorporated into the the cloud suite so we have going back to where I was talking about our team in Prague we sometimes build product sort of a fully encased product working with them and sometimes we work very closely with the development teams from the various cloud Suites and the product management team is always there to help us figure out sort of the long-term plan and how they're different pieces fit together you know kind of big picture you've got a I write and then the machine learning pumping all kinds of data your way so in an historical time frames it's all pretty new this confluence right in terms of development but where do you see it like 10 years from now 20 years what's it what what potential is there we talk about human potential unlocking human potential well unlock it with that kind of technology what are we looking at to you you know I think that's such a fascinating area and area of discussion and and and sort of thinking forward-thinking I do believe in sort of this idea of augmented intelligence and I think Charles was talking a little bit about that that this morning although not in those particular terms but this idea that computers and machines that technology will actually help us do better and be better and be more productive you know so this idea of doing sort of the rote everyday tasks that we no longer have to spend time doing you know that'll free us up to think about the bigger problems and hopefully you know in my my best self wants to say we'll work on you know famine and poverty and all those problems in the world that really need our brains to focus on and and work and then the other interesting part of it is if you think about sort of the concept of singularity and our computers ever going to actually be able to think for themselves you know that's sort of another interesting piece when you talk about what's going to happen down the line maybe it won't happen in ten years maybe it will never happen but there's definitely a lot of people out there who are well known and sort of tech and science who who talked about that and talked about the fears related to that and that's a whole other other piece but it's fascinating to think about you know ten years twenty years from now where are we going to be on that spectrum how do you guys think about bias in in AI and in data science because you know humans express bias tribalism there's inherent that's inherent in human nature if we're if machines are sort of mimicking humans how do you how do you deal with that and adjudicate yeah and it's definitely a concern it's another there's a lot of a lot of writings out there and articles out there right now about bias in machine learning and in AI and it's definitely a concern I actually read so so just being aware of it I think is the first step right because as scientists and developers develop these algorithms going into it consciously knowing that this is something they have to protect against I think is the first step for sure and then you know it's just reading an article just recently about another company who is who's building a sort of a a bias tracker so a way to actually monitor your algorithm and identify places where there is perhaps bias coming in so I do think we'll see we'll start to see more of those things it gets very complicated because when you talk to start talking about deep learning and networks and AI and you know it's very difficult to actually understand what's going on under the covers right it's really hard to get in and say this is the reason why you know you're you're a I told you this that that's very hard to do so it's it's not going to be an easy process but I think that we're going to start to see that kind of technology well we heard this morning about some sort of systems that could help my interpretation automate and speed up and minimize the hassle of performance reviews yes and there's that's the classic example of you know an assertive woman is called abrasive or aggressive and assertive man it's called a great leader so this is just a classic example of bias I mentioned Hillary Mason rock star data scientist happens to be a woman you have to be a woman your thoughts as a woman in tech and maybe can AI help resolve some of those biases yeah well first of all I want to say I'm very pleased to work in an organization where we have some very strong leaders who happen to be women so I mentioned Don Rose who designed our iih solution I mentioned Jill strange who runs the talent science organization half of my team is women so it's particularly inside of sort of the science area inside of infor have been very pleased with the way we've built out some of that that skillset and I'm also a member an active member of wins so the women's infor network is something I'm very involved with so I meet a lot of people across our organization a lot of women across our organization who have you know just just really strong technology supporters really intelligent sort of go-getter type type of people and it's great to see that inside I mean for I think there's a lot of work to be done for sure and you can always find stories you know from other whether it's it's coming out of Silicon Valley or other places where you hear some really sort of arcane sounding things that are still happening in the industry and so some of those things it's you know it's disappointing certainly to hear that but I think Van Jones said something this morning about how and I liked it the way he said it and I'm not gonna be able to say it exactly but he said something along the lines of like the the the the ground is there the formation is starting to get us moving in the right direction and I think you know I'm hopeful for the future that were they were heading in that way and I think you know again he sort of said something like once the groundswell starts going in that direction people will really jump in and will see the benefits of being more diverse whether it's across you know having more women or having more people of color however you know however things expand and that's just going to make us all better and more efficient and more productive I think well I think you know there's a spectrum right well on the one side of the spectrum there's intolerable and unacceptable behavior which is just it should be zero tau in my opinion is a passion of ours and the cube the other side of that spectrum is inclusion and it's a challenge that we have as a small company I remember having a conversation earlier this year with an individual and we talked about quotas and I don't think that's the answer and her comment was no that's not the answer you have to endeavor to reach deeper beyond your existing network which is hard sometimes for us because you're so busy you're running around it's like okay it's the convenient thing to do but you got to peel the onion on that Network and actually take the extra time and make it a priority I mean your thoughts on that no I think that's a good point I mean if I think about who my circle of my circle is right and the people that I know and that and I interact with you know if I only reach out to the smallest the smallest group of people I'm not getting really out you know beyond my initial circle so I think that's a very good point and I think that that's we have to find ways to be more interactive and pull from different areas and I think it's interesting bringing so coming back to data science for a minute if you if you sort of think about the evolution of where we got to how we got to today where you know now we're really pulling people from science areas and math areas and technology areas and data scientists are coming from lots of places right and you don't always have to have a PhD right you don't necessarily have to come up through that system to be a good data scientist and I think to see more of that and really people going beyond beyond just sort of the traditional circles and the traditional path to really find people that you wouldn't normally identify you know to bring into that that that path is going to help us just in general be more diverse in our approach well it certainly seems like it's it's embedded in the company culture I think the great reason for you to be so optimistic going forward not only about your job but about the way your company's going about doing would you or would you advise young people generally who want to crack into the data science field but specifically women who have clearly are underrepresented in in technology yeah so I think the I think we're starting to see more and more women enter the field again it's one of those people people know it and so there's there's less of a because people are aware of it there's more there's more tendency to be more inclusive but I definitely think you know just go for it right I mean just if it's something you're interested in and you want to try it out you know go to a coding camp and take a science class and there's so many online resources now I mean there's you know the massive online courses that you can take so even if you're hesitant about it there are ways you can kind of be at home and try it out and see if it's the right thing for you toe in the water yes exactly exactly try it out and see and and then decide if it's the right thing for you but I think there's lots of different ways to sort of check it out again you can take a course you can you can actually get a degree there's a there's a wide range of things that you can do to kind of experiment with it and then find out if it's right for you if you're not happy with the hiring opportunities out there just start a company that's my aim and a great advice - thank you so much Martin joining us here at in forum 18 we're alive in Washington DC you're watching the exclusive
