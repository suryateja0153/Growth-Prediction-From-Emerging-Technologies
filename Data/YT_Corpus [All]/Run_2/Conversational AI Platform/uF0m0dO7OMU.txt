 Hello everybody, my name is Aida. I'm CEO, co-founder of Xor. At Xor, we help employees to accelerate and streamline their recruiting efforts using chatbots and AI. So as a former recruiter myself, I've been spending hours and doing the routine or repetitive tasks instead of focusing on interviewing the candidates or doing the strategic work. This is why we started Xor to help you to do this heavy lifting automatically. So here's how it works. Xor automates the initial candidate engagement, instantly answers any candidates question about the job or the company, pre-screens the candidate for a role, captures their application and schedules them for the multiple steps of interviews, and constantly keeps them updated and engaged during the rest of the recruiting process. So right now, we have 54 corporate customers around the world. We recently hit the milestone of 1 million candidate interviewed by our chat box. And the candidate loved it because we surveyed 10,000 people, and 93.3% of them said: it was excellent experience. Also one of our UK customers saw a dramatic increase in the conversion rate from visit to apply from 15 to 51%. So now Xor communicates with candidate in 100+ languages and constantly improves itself. So as now we focus primarily on talent acquisition part of their HR process, there are still a lot of internal processes starting from the employee onboarding up till the moment of the exit interviews. Of course, chatbots cannot automate everything; there is still human touch involved. But we can help you do your job better. We'd love to share our experience with you and let you know how you can apply the chatbot to your recruiting process if you schedule a demo with us.
