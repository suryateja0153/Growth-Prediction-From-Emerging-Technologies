 all right welcome to GCP online Meetup number 32 I'm Jonathan Kim I'm your host today today we have a very special guest Priyanka vergata how are you I'm good yeah and one thing I just found out you've only been here for what three months Wow I know you're the expert at chat box there's a fist pump right here that's good that's that's really impressive so yeah Priyanka has been around you know for only a couple months but she's been telling us all about chatbots and how chat bots have been proving and automating a lot of the you know a lot of the activities for her customers so yeah tell us a little more yeah sure so um I am customer and engineer here at Google so just a little introduction about myself I do have some background in IVRS and technologies like interactive voice response and that's why chat bots do you said in my have a special place in my heart so as soon as I joined Google I realized that we acquired this company called API Road AI which we have renamed to dialogue flow now and I got my hands around it and my customers were talking about how we can improve their experience so I just got hands down working on some customer use cases and I realized six this could be very helpful to do as a as a live session for some of our online folks as well so that's where that that's why we're doing this today please do send us questions so we can answer them as they come in yeah so we'll be answering your questions and just one thing that Priyanka mentioned is about the user experience I've actually worked with a lot of customers who say I mean they want to you know attend to customer needs very quickly right I think we're living in a digital age where we expect the answer is right away like hey we know what's my shipping confirmation you know where's my flight status they want it right now and chatbots will be able to give you that kind of immediate and you know the sense of urgency that customers desire and want and also to extend to that point a lot of my customers like help just everybody in every customer can relate to because everyone has a helpdesk and everyone gets those calls around how to hardware reset my password or how do I submit a ticket and they don't want to talk to anybody so from the user perspective they don't want to talk to anybody and from the company's perspective they don't want to raise money on handling those types of Monroe and his calls so I think for those reasons as well chatbot is very good yeah if someone had to talk to me about resetting passwords every time exactly yeah that's a good segue into kind of what you're demoing which is a ticketing system yep all right so let's just dive right in I have I don't have a lot of slides all I have is to show you a demo and then how that demo actually works behind the scenes so that's all that's in the agenda and then you're obviously always welcome to post questions we'll handle them as they come in and also towards the end so without further ado let's get into the demo so this is that help desk demo that I was talking about you could you could put your you could actually integrate it with your web chat interface or your mobile website interface I'll put it in there you could also put it in your in Google home as an app as an action and then you can also use the same chat bar that you built in dialogue flow and put it into your assistant as well so it's like one-time effort but you can broadly distribute it if you into all the different channels you could use Facebook as well for if you interface with your customers or work so just for some of the viewers so that they don't feel intimidated I mean you don't actually have to do any machine learning like I mean you're not doing any like mathematical algorithms and things like that for you to do this I'm glad you asked that question no you're not so and I'm going to show you in dialogue flow it automatically learns so all you're doing is basically providing it a couple of different utterances were of what a user can say and then the machine the software would basically learn on its own over time as to what rikku requests it gets and then it it modifies itself over time there is also a training component to it so you can train it with the requests and responses that you could get great I guess we'll walk through that in a little bit yep all right so let's try to test this thing I would like to submit ticket and then it should respond back saying alright give me your name so I can put you put your ticket in and then I can say I'm just making up some name and then it will say okay thank you John so it it's smart enough to understand that this was John and then now describe the ticket for me and then I can say write my phone screen is broken even that and then it should respond back saying I have logged your ticket in this is their ticket number and someone will contact you in 24 hours and that's all you pretty much need in most cases like a person on the phone would also just call in and submit a ticket for you and they won't be personally handling the ticket right somebody else in the queue will be handling the ticket so the chat bot just did that in like five seconds for for the customer now you take that now you can see what happens behind the scenes so I have a data store behind the scenes which is a database no sequel database and it's basically sending that data into the database and saving it so my phone screen is broken this is John this was the ticket number what is it using to send into data started so it uses cloud functions to send it to data store and in cloud functions and I have it up here it's really not a big code that you're right now all you're doing is just interfacing with datastore and calling the API for the datastore so right here I'm taking and parsing out that email phone number if you're not catching the email in this case because they use it and give it to us if they did we would catch that as well but you take that put it in the datastore and then respond back saying I successfully launched your ticket with the ticket number so it's very simple function that you're writing and the reason I'm using cloud function here is also because you don't have to set up servers or install them and do all that jazz all you're doing is you just need a function that can talk to an API right so that a cloud functions is best for doing that so alright we did that in the chat you could do the same with Google home or action so let me just give you a little glimpse of how you would do that with with Google I'm using the simulator which you would use to test out and I can say talk to help desk support let's get the test version of help help me reset my password no problem and be your username and I will send the link to reset your password alright so that was what I wanted to show you like you could do the same thing that you were doing from the interface from chat also within within Google home now how was all this built so let's get into your dialogue flow a little bit to understand how this was all failure as I'm sure you want to know that as well so I'm gonna talk about in intense and entities in a little bit more detail I have a slide in there but it's basically insured intent is basically whatever the user can say and then what do you do after user says that so like what action do you take and what response do you provide the user that's an intent and entity is B so I'm gonna open one of the intents here so that you can see so we you saw that we submitted a ticket so that's the intent where user can say I want to submit a ticket I have a problem I have an issue they can say all sorts of things to submit a ticket so now you're capturing them in a bucket that these are all the things that a user can say and then you're taking an action on it so in this case I don't have an entity because all I want is to capture those those things that the users saying the problem the incident the ticket and then just give them a static response which is okay sure I can help you with that give me your name so there's no action that I need to take other than just giving them a static response so that's why this one's a little bit simple when we go into this one which is the description so remember when I asked for the description from the user like what is your what is the problem that you're facing they said my phone screen is broken my laptops frozen or something like that I am parsing out what type of a problem is and that is just by nothing but defining an entity and that entity in this case is an incident type which I'm parsing out and putting in my data store and saying okay this is these are all the tickets that came for phone problems and so now I can say this is my entity which is incident type and now it's my variable that I can take an action on and then I'm not risk finding anything here but I'm asking it to go to a web hook which is where cloud function is written so when I go into my fulfilment which is where are my web book is defined this is the URL for the cloud function that we saw right here if I close that you can see that that's the link to the cloud function and that's what you define in your fulfilment you could actually also write the same cloud function within the editor and we've just released this two weeks ago so that's a really cool feature now you don't even have to go out of dialog flow to write a cloud function you can just do it right here in the editor yeah that's really nice so yeah that's that's how this was all built do you have any more questions yeah I mean I think one thing to keep in mind is that you've put in a lot of different intents right but but you don't actually have to put every single combination or permutation of questions that the users gonna ask right I mean that's the whole point of training so can you talk a little bit about the whole training process you know you've collected maybe some questions that you get and you know at some point maybe the chat bot didn't understand and at that point you need to throw that in there say hey this is you know the intent is the same which is what you're trying to do but they asked it in a different way yeah exactly so really glad you asked this is in this is the part feature in within dialogue flow that's in beta right now which is training so the first thing you would do for any machine learning models is you would try to give it as much training data as possible so that's what we are trying to do with all the requests utterances that we put in the intense but there will be things that work that you may not be able to catch in there but those are the things that you can catch in here on the screen I have the training portion of the of the bar here where if I click on one of these I can see that help me reset my password was correctly matched to an intent password reset I could have found something that did not match my intent so we could say something and I can't think of an example with wit but this could probably imagine that this was attached to our different or a wrong intent then we could change that right here and say okay now attach it to contact us because that's where it should fall and then say that I approve that and then approve it and once you do that now every time a user says something related to research or something related to help me reason it would automatically fall into that contact mm-hmm so that's how you would continue to like somebody who's managing this chat pod would continue to go in and try to see if things are falling off and then continue to maintain it and manager by approving the training so the chat pod captures all the history and then can you show like how you actually do training is that you just kind of you have all this training data and then you push the train button yeah let me do this so let's see so I have CI say this one and I change that and I change it to I'm gonna keep it the same and just they approve and then say approve and then once it does that now see the training is started it's starting to train and you can see the gear icon moving here and then once it's done it's going to save the model astrayed and now it's going to start and you can test it right here as well you can test the same phrase here it will start to take it again very nice very nice and then can you talk a little bit about the different integrations that we have I feel like dialogue flow one of the benefits is there's a lot of different integrations yeah so there is so the point that I made earlier about I have the web demo version and then I also have the assistant that's enable so you're basically building it once but you can now deploy it by just toggling the switch and say I wanted to apply this on Facebook message messenger as well and all you do is that and then you verify your token for access to Facebook and off you go and it's enabled for Facebook as well and then similarly for slack Twilio if you use Skype we have some really cool integrations done with Skype as well I think one of our customers has used this for like controlling their refrigerators oh wow yeah it's a very cool use case and so yeah you can these are all the options that you can connect it - and just write the code once that's right so yeah that seems like it's part of the fulfillment process you know you covered intent and maybe at a high level in tennis what are you trying to do right like what's the goal maybe you want to reset a password maybe you want to order something maybe you want to contact support talk a little bit about the entities like how do entities fall into the intent are they entities are just things that you want dialogue flow to capture from the sentence right right so entities are think so let me actually give you a simpler example so it makes a little more sense so in this particular example I have a weather forecasting application right so this is much easier to understand you say weather forecast in San Francisco tomorrow so the user is interested in San Francisco City and tomorrow is the timeframe so those are my two entities entities anything that you want to take an action on so I want to take an action on the city so I can take the city and plug it into my API and get a response for it so and then same for tomorrow I can I could get a request for today and then I would take that parse it into a date and then give it to my API and that would respond by so anything you want to take an action on the one thing I would also touch here that you didn't ask gelatin is context a context is very important as well so this is this is actually a biggest differentiator for for dialogue flow in general so in this case I can say a user can say weather forecast in San Francisco tomorrow and then it would respond back with that weather and then following up I can say oh how about today and then it would know that I'm still talking about San Francisco so you can set that context and the way you do that is again going back into dialogue flow and then I can show you one of the intents that has context so when I'm doing description remember it is it remembers the name email and phone number from my previous intent and all you do is just connect them together and it will remember the content student so that was in short that's really good so it seems like you can make some very complex conversations it's not just question answer question answer it's more like question answer follow-up question answer follow up even more follow ups yeah and that's where context comes in exactly and that's where the whole natural language processing within the within the engine and the machine learning also comes into picture as well so and it's learning over time yeah that's really interesting so let's see we have a couple questions let's talk about all right what are some drawbacks of you know I think you know this is a meet up so we try to talk about the great things about dialog flow what are some drawbacks with dialog um I would say it's a it's a product that's obviously constantly evolving as we say in machine learning is all constantly obviously evolving and evolving so that's one thing that I would say we are very open to feedbacks and learning from insults to a space that's evolving itself in itself like Chad Watson yeah so we are learning through the experiences there some of the other drawbacks I would say our religious around like languages we're constantly working on supporting more and more languages I think we have about 12 to 14 today but like we have in the other speech api's and we I think we have around 100 hundred and 80 languages in there right so around that range so we're constantly trying to catch up with that so that I would say is a little bit of a drawback but other than that it's evolving product yeah I mean I think so customers obviously they love the fact that it's out of the box I mean I'll throw out some buzz words out there and machine learning right like you know LST M's recurrent neural networks I mean these are all mathematical algorithms and models used to build chat BOTS if you're not interested in doing that right this is kind of an out of box solution if you need more control maybe like let's say you're doing something fun like I don't generating Game of Thrones text or some like you know some random language and you know that's where you're not going get that type of control with this right this is you know we're training the model for you we've built it out for you and we've made it really simple but if you need kind of variant specific use cases yeah you know this is probably not the best tool yeah I would also add like you know if you're looking for trying to find ways to start using machine learning in some way within your organization this would probably be your good entry point to make exposure to machine learning because it's like that easy way where you don't have to worry about training the model you still understand how the model would be trained if you do it with some other application so I think it's like a low barrier to entry into machine learning in a way safe place because you you have the model being trained by the platform itself but you're just learning through it right right now actually another interesting use case that I've been working with the customer on is you know they see it as a phase approach right machine learning is a very it can encompass many things where hey we want to automate everything we do yeah but I think realistically it's just kind of taking it step by step so the first step is really let's just try to have a chat bot right this is like a really easy first okay let's just start figuring out what customers are asking now that they collected all this information they might realize oh this is exactly what we need or it's not yeah and so it's like it's making easy step back as well and if it's not then let's just step back start again yeah you didn't lose anything so yeah yeah you're still acting all that you know data from your customers into to build your own model I mean we have customers building no chat BOTS with our cloud ml technology and yeah it's you know using tensorflow so it's a I mean there's many ways to kind of do the same thing but yeah yeah it's a platform to make things simple alright so another question is it free I love that question it's free it is absolutely free at this time so you can go ahead start building things and start using them the integrations that you do with your web hooks and stuff they could probably cost you something if your hosting them say you can talk functions or some right actually that's where you might get tired like cloud functions you pay yeah it's small prices I'm a data store you would pay yeah the right now I think dialogue flow is actually free so itself is free okay that makes sense that's good and then why why did Google rename ATP III I mean like when I first heard of a pasa I don't know what it is most people thought that right like what is API that AI you get a website okay is it a chat pod okay so this chat pod is that all it does because if yet is such a broad name right great question yeah and you you pretty much kind of answered your yourself it's basically it was hard to understand what it was just fight the name and it is API it's in his AI but again in normal language its what is it really doing it's really helping you have smart and intelligent conversations which is very much aligned with the dialogue flow name yeah that's why we we took a step back and we made it more commonly use of your word then than epi da da which is hard to comprehend as to what it does I think the funny thing about names is no one's ever gonna agree on a name like I mean I love flow you can argue yeah it's not the best name but it's not the worst right I think for any name it's it's always gonna be a yeah you know argue arguing there'll be some in support and some yeah yeah just like politics so alright know that that's good out and then I think so met a questions linked to dialogue flow dots and intro I haven't heard of it before yeah so Alex will definitely send a link to actually if you just do a quick Google search hopefully Google is good at finding done I think I did a quick search yesterday and its first thing that comes in okay and then Ashok asked the question how to name an agent for different integrations or is it the same for Google home and Alexa it's the same for everything so all the integrations you have you will name the agent the same so there there's only going to be one agent and then the integration you just enable the integration to be available for all the different platforms but you're only writing the agent one right so yeah very complex if you have to create a different agent for different integration so yeah basically one agent encompasses all the different the different key points okay yeah great and then let's see here all right well look I don't see any more I mean there's a lot of questions so I think that's it you know definitely subscribe to the channel if you have any topics you'd like to discuss throw it in the comments Priyanka thank you so much for a time that was fascinating I mean I'm gonna build a chat by just to talk to me because I don't have many friends you should do that but I can talk to you alright anyway thank you so much tune in next time I think our next topic in two days actually on terraform which is super cool as well you know automating deployments with terraform on Google cloud platform and yeah all right thank you very much thank you for having me here [Music]
