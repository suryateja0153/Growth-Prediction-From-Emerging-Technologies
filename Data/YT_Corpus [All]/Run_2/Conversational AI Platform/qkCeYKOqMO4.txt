 [Music] so hello to friends in the room friends who I know are joining us virtually I'm really excited that you are here and thank you Justin for having me it's great to be here this is part of a big bunch of research that I started some way or another 13 years ago and some way or another in 1996 even and I want to start by making the claim that architecture AI and design are all connected these 60 these connections go back some 60 or 70 years to 1956 or even 1948 and newness seems to be central to how we talk about artificial intelligence today we say things like AI is the new black AI is the new UI artificial intelligence is the next digital frontier according to our friends at McKinsey Andrew ings stated that AI is the new electricity but also AI is the new MOOC because he will be an online course that he's running you need data for AI so data is the new oil the future of computers is the mind of a disembodied toddler head and apparently I am also the new AI and I will spare you this what this says but it's really really sexist and really awful if you want to get an idea of how much the word new gets used when we talk about AI you could look at something like this MIT Technology Review article I just highlighted the word new where I could find it and there were six mentions and the first two paragraphs of course I think one of them was New York so I don't think that that actually counts and this gentleman was a part of a conversation about tech muggles declaring an era of artificial intelligence but AI isn't the new because AI isn't new here's how new it's not 1955 John McCarthy the founder of the Stanford AI lab and before that the MIT AI lab referred to Artefill coined the term artificial intelligence to mean making machines do things that would require intelligence have done by man in 1956 he brought together a group of researchers at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire and they spent the summer hashing out what they thought the platform of research on AI should be and it included things like neural nets and it included what did what does he say says an attempt will be made to find how to make machines use language form abstractions and concepts selves kinds of problems now reserved for humans and improve themselves we think that a significant advance can be made in one or more of these problems if a carefully selected group of scientists can work together on it for a summer 1956 herb Simon Alan Newell and JC shot Simon a Newell very important to Carnegie Mellon's history wrote in 1958 that they'd pretty much figured out this problem of modeling the human brain in computing they said intuition insight and learning are no longer exclusive possessions of humans any large scale high-speed computer can be made to prote and made to exhibit them also they believed that by the 1960s they'd haven't figured at a figured out and of course Marvin Minsky who in 1961 said I believe that we are on the threshold of an era that will be strongly influenced and quite possibly dominated by intelligent problem-solving machines proto machine learning you might find in the world of perceptrons in 1958 the New York Times published an article talking about this new Navy device that learns by doing and said that the Navy revealed the embryo of an electronic computer today that it expects will be able to walk talk see write reproduce itself and be conscious of its existence the Navy said the perceptron would be the first nonliving mechanism capable of receiving recognizing and identifying its surroundings without any human kiman training or control so all of these ideas are really old they're older than me by far and they're older than a lot of what we work on but in it to this I want to point out that AI and architecture are old friends and kind of co-created each other at a certain point in time that in ways that has very direct impacts on the kind of engineering and design work that we do today and the problems that we focus on I'm going to introduce three of the characters in my book art of architectural intelligence the three people I'm going to introduce in this talk are Christopher Alexander Cedric price and Negroponte II Nicholas Negroponte II who here is has heard of Christopher Alexander couple anyones Cedric price right on and Nicholas Negroponte a couple more all right so they're all architects worked very closely with technology in different kinds of ways some so much so that you don't probably think of Nicholas Negroponte II the founder of the MIT Media Lab as an architect and I'm going to talk about the ways that they worked with cybernetics and artificial intelligence to build new kinds of worlds and new kinds of approaches in ways that affect what we do today I'll start with Christopher Alexander Christopher Alexander if you do know of his work and even if you don't buy me putting up this book right here I've probably begun to bring him into something you've heard of before he's written many many books he's mathematician born in Vienna raised in England came to the United States in the 1960s he's quite old but still alive living in England again was a professor at Berkeley and he I'll mention three books today notes on the synthesis of form a pattern language in the timeless way of building notes on the synthesis of form was his his thesis and if you've ever heard the idea of design being good fit or fitness you know trying to shim a table until it kind of works or putting a stable system in place that's where that idea comes from those of you who have used patterns whether in UX or in software are are right in the lineage of Christopher Alexander his idea of pattern languages have influenced this and then his philosophy of design which he outlined in the timeless wave building if you've ever used a wiki or you use agile processes you have used something that that he's done my own research with Alexander started when I was reading notes on the synthesis of form and this question of a I came up when I realized in a footnote he was referring to Shannon and Claude Shannon John McCarthy and Marvin Minsky and I wondered why is this architect what does he have to say about artificial intelligence in 1964 thirteen years later I have a book about that he was interested in finding ways to break down design problems so they could be easily understood and designed anybody who has created tree diagrams in order to explain the function of a piece of software or website is working in this lineage in fact this is the outputs of one of his programs from this is a something that's in the Berkeley archives that shows how you'd break down the elements of a design problem for how you design highways he also applied these ideas to the BART system in 1964 this is 390 requirements that he and his team outlined and this is before Bart was built I'm not sure how many of these are in place today I think we probably need new requirements my ears are still ringing from the BART ride I took this morning pattern language and timeless way of building I already mentioned briefly but I want to tell you a little bit more about them the pattern language as he puts it and it's not the only it's a pattern language it's 253 patterns from large to small scale and then the timeless way of buildings is a philosophy of patterns and these patterns are anything from how to make a nation-state down to how to organize your bedroom and it's he in his and his collaborators write each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment and then describes the core of the solution of that problem in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over without ever doing it the same way twice so in the book here's an example of a pattern I live in Pittsburgh and I live in a row house and so it's very dense where I live and these are patterns about the design of a row house you see number statement a picture a statement about the design problem illustrations to carry out to to explain some of what that design problem is doing and then a connection to other patterns in the system and it works sort of like an operating system the patterns are a network so you see here are a number of them in their order explaining what each of them do you know this is going from a mosaic of some cultures all the way down to a household mix and it goes further and further into more detail Alexander is someone that a lot of technologists have read if you know Alan Cooper the interaction designer he used to ferret out Christopher Alexander's books in his high school library and read them there he wanted to be an architect so did Kent Beck and then realized he didn't want to build buildings he wanted to build software and there was a lot more that you could do within that world and Ward Cunningham Ward Cunningham and Kent Beck we're curious about how they could apply this idea of patterns to the idea of object-oriented programming languages so they applied it to interface patterns in small talk in the late 80s in about 1987 and a community of programmers got together and over the years built up what was called the design patterns movement and this group of four men who called themselves the gang of four are the ones who created this kind of network of design patterns in software and it's an idea that you see millions and million tons of times I think there's something like twelve hundred bucks on Amazon that refer to design patterns in in software and in interfaces and games whatever okay now does this how many people have heard of design patterns there you go also if you've ever if you've ever used agile processes or followed extreme programming Kent Beck and board coming Cunningham and a number of other people applied these ideas about the philosophy of design from Christopher Alexander in the timeless way of building to up end change the politics of the design process and to give more flexibility to users into people and when I interviewed Kent Beck he told me that it was a rearrangement of the political power in the design and building process everyone here has used a wiki and the wiki format was developed by Ward Cunningham he was developing it in HyperCard in the early 90s and then it was suggested that he could maybe build this on this new thing called the World Wide Web and what he wanted to do was have a conversation that never had an end if he wanted to map all of the knowledge he had of his that he and his team had he didn't want to say it ends here he wanted it to be able to go and go and go he never patented the wiki format and it was picked up in the early 2000s to run Wikipedia and now we've all used wikis one way or another but this is again a direct inspiration or a direct influenced by Christopher Alexander project okay so that's Christopher Alexander the other thing to say about him is architects tend to hate him and technologists tend to love him I'm not sure why conundrum but kind of interesting so I'd like to introduce you to a different kind of architect this is Cedric price I've called him the secret patron saint of interaction designers he changed the way any number of people in the UK understood architecture and buildings and what they could do his life partner is was Eleanor Braun he died in 2003 Eleanor Braun was in the Beatles movies and was responsible actually she was the inspiration for the song Eleanor Rigby so just a very curious and very funny person who liked to ask things like technologies the answer but what was the question and Cedric price was best known for things that were never built so for instance the fun Palace was designed in the 1960s and it was supposed to be a big cybernetic theater movable kind of place where all sorts of things could happen and the space was going to learn from its users over time and adapt to their interests and means and you could change it over time and use it kind of as a big leisure center to learn and experience whatever it is you might want to learn and he worked with the 25-member 27-member cybernetic community which is what you see here on the right and in this particular image it's kind of hard to to read but it talks about input of unmodified people and then output of modified people so they thought through this like a system diagram he did this project with Joan Littlewood who is a radical theater director and a protege of the German playwright Berthold brushed he also was really inspired by Gordon Pasque and Gordon Paz is a cyberneticist who also had a big influence on a lot of a lot of architects and a piece that he wrote in 1969 talked about changing this design process and some really interesting in some interesting ways and he suggested that we turned the design paradigm in on itself and let us apply it to the interaction between the designer and the system she designs rather than the intersection between the system and the people who inhabit it so rather than the system you designing doing your bidding maybe it does something different maybe it meant s-- and creates something different than what the two people put together this is a trying he gave of second-order cybernetics he wrote things like assume for the moment I'm the successful businessman with the bowler hat and I insist that I am the sole reality where everything else appears only in my imagination I cannot deny that in my imagination there will appear other people scientists other successful businessman etc as for instance in this very conference since I had the since I find these apparitions in many ways similar to myself I have to grant them the privilege that they themselves may insist that they are the sole reality and everything else is a condition of their imagination on the other hand they cannot deny that their fantasies will be populated by people and one of them may be I with Buller hat and everything this is second order cybernetics where the fact that you're engaging with the system changes the system and if you start looking at the design process is something that needs to take that into consideration design begins to look a little bit different subject price was again very very inspired by his interactions and collaborations with Gordon Paz and one of the buildings that or one of the projects that he designed was something called generator this was never built but it was a project that was in existence from 76 to 79 and it was a set of 12 foot cubes 150 cubes walkways boardwalks that could be moved around and and recombined for whatever purposes someone might like this was an arts retreat center for a wealthy patron in Florida Kali's really liked moving cranes so there's always a moving crane here and generator would come together like this there was grid on the ground you'd put cubes over it roofs on top connect the parts and then you could put up the side baffles and the stairways and do what you'd like with the space you could also model it with these little qubit to parts that you would see he thought that may be fun things might happen like you could take a bleep or walk I won't mind you this is 1977 or so when this idea came up and something strange about a mouse rolling around a cube but it's strange and weird and funny all the time and again we look at Gordon Pasque Gordon Pasque did a project first in 1953 and then in 1968 called which became the colloquy of mobiles and what happens with these Mobile's are you interact with it and in an inner Anor it interacts back with you until it gets bored and Paul pangoro who is a cyberneticist and and a professor at the College for Creative Studies in Detroit has just rebuilt the kulluk way of mobiles for the 50th anniversary of the original project he is Gordon tasks archivist and it's up right now as we speak in Detroit so this is what what does this have to do with generator well-centered price realized it was unlikely that people were going to want to move around generator enough and learn from it and do the kind of funny things that it would expect so he began to work with John Frazier and Julia Fraser who were computer scientists well as architects and wanted to put together set of programs that people could use that would be used by generators so there would be microcontrollers on all of its parts an inventory program a design program that's what you see here you can pick up and move these cubes and they plot and printout and a boredom program and the boredom program said the following in the event of the site not being reorganized or changed for some time the computer starts generating unsolicited plans and improvements and this is something that John Fraser wrote in his letter to cedric price introducing these programs if you kick a system the very least you would expected to do is kick you back and then he said you seem to imply this is a handwritten footnote that you can kind of see down here in the letter you seem to imply that we were only useful if we produce results that you did not expect I think this was this leads to some definition of computer aids in general at least one thing that you would expect from any half-decent program is that it should produce at least one plan which you did not expect so this is where something like Gordon past's colloquy of mobiles makes its way into Cedric prices architecture and these are ideas that we pick up today in some really lovely ways on the next slide I'm going to introduce a project by the roboticist Madeline Gannon she just finished her PhD at Carnegie Mellon in architecture and she did an exhibition at the London Design Museum with a robot a robotic arm that would play with it's play with somebody and its midst until it got bored and went away thing comes together and you're in the space with the robot and you just have a very raw experience with this animal-like machine responding to your every move all the technical aspects sort of melt away into the background it's incredibly important to have opportunities and spaces to come in and experiment and misuse these existing technologies she didn't know about burton pastor cedric price when she did this project but i find it compelling that many years later this is exactly what she is trying to do and trying to get us to rethink our relationship with our machines she calls herself the robot whisperer third person i'd like to talk about is Nicholas Negroponte II and you'll notice here he always seems to have his fingers in the picture he always seems to be gesturing at something you would probably know him as the founder of the MIT Media Lab but before the Media Lab he ran something called the architecture machine group at MIT and that's what I want to want to talk about here the MIT architecture machine group was in the school of architecture but worked very closely with the AI lab and developed interfaces programs and environments for for artificial intelligence the gesture thing he he's the author of a number of books the book that you'd probably be most likely to know would be called being digital and being digital came out in 1995 but in 1970 he wrote a book called the architecture machine and he dedicated it to the first machine that can appreciate the gesture Nicholas Negroponte he is a clever man but this book I think is actually fascinating and really important it was a theory of design for artificial intelligence that I think still holds weight today I want to point out a little bit about the funding structures of the architecture machine group and of artificial intelligence in general the architecture machine group was funded by the information processing technology office of DARPA and the Office of Naval Research the office of naval research was so important for defining the funding for artificial intelligence from pretty much its inception onward through the 80s so vital that I think that Marvin Minsky has referred to Marvin denna cough who was the the program officer as the grand old man of artificial intelligence so the thing to point out is something that caught that on Paul Edwards the historian has referred to as the closed world that artificial intelligence was primarily developed within Department of Defense funded entities because it meant a small group of people could continue to work on these projects through the same social network friendship networks and professional what networks that had been developed since the end of World War two where NSF funding National Science Foundation funding kind of automatically and invites very spirit tried to throw things open to the world and open things up and bring more people in so it was desired by DARPA DARPA tiptoe and onr to keep funding and development in these small networks of people to get things done better and it meant that the architecture machine group started to structure their work like the AI lab did at MIT and work very closely on interfaces and small machines and environments for artificial intelligence one of these first projects was funded by IBM it was called urban 2 or urban urban 2 and then later urban 5 and it was a conversational user interface for urban design this is 1970 I actually started a little bit before that and the what happens here is user chooses a set of blocks you see these squares down at the bottom and then there's a conversation going on at the side using this light pen to select questions and answers and it asks you questions and you you use the conversational dialogue and the buttons here to determine what the attributes are of these these areas that you are designing so it's for urban design and the architecture machine group book or the architecture machine book outlines and critiques there there study here and you might notice this last one that's Ted many conflicts are occurring and they said you know it was charming but it printed garbage but at least it was friendly garbage so the words that you they used and it I think it points out if you anyone here has tried to has tried to design a conversational user interface you know how easy it's going to seem on the surface and how hard it is in reality and even just in what we could look back to someone like Joseph Weizenbaum in 1966 who created Eliza the therapy program it's a question and answer user conversational user interface and very difficult and problematic in ways that cause Joseph Weizenbaum to rethink his own total engagement with computation and artificial intelligence so everybody knows that this is difficult to do and yet we continual continually try to do it anyway Nicholas Negroponte II and Marvin Minsky were friends throughout their entire throughout Nicholas's entire professional life until Marvin's death a couple of years ago and here you see a robotic arm stacking blocks this is a lot of AI problems were developed in what we're called micro worlds right so you focus in on some small part of a project some small issue right you're looking at edge finding you're looking at computer vision in fact you're still today thinking about computer vision in some very specific small ways I know Justin was just taking a computer vision class at Stanford and you tried to throw away the rest of the noise and just focus in on that problem and that's appropriate for some period of time but after awhile microworlds didn't actually scale up and this gets to be a problem but as I mentioned the architecture machine group worked in micro worlds as well and ai ai interfaces and this is a project that they did in 1974 the software show was a museum show at the Jewish Museum and information technology it's new meaning for art and so here you see all of these cubes isn't it funny like generator has cubes and urban 5 has cubes more cubes and you've got this set of mirrored blocks 400 married blocks of 5 foot by 8 foot pen and a gerbil horn a gerbil colony living there and it's gonna be difficult to read this but it says gerbils match wits with computer built environment and what Seek did was stack blocks and what gerbils did was move them around and knock them over this is the gatefold of the software catalog the life in a computerized environment and there's this great quote from Ted Nelson who says our bodies our hardware our behavior software and it's Paul pangoro who made the contemporary color coin of mobiles and a member of the architecture machine group who told me it was a little bit too true because seek tended to kill the gerbils in later days the architecture machine group turned to command and control interfaces that were explicitly that had explicit military connections and applications and this is because the only way passed 1974 that you could get work in artificial intelligence funded was to align it with command and control questions and direct tactical military applications this is due to some legislative things that had happened in the 70s in the wake of the Vietnam War and so this is the Aspen movie map it is kind of what it looks like Google Street View that you experience sitting over in a room in a chair you zoom down the streets of Aspen Colorado in an Eames lounge chair with joypads and a video disc produces the images for you they had a prototype video disc player in the 1970s and the way you get the images is everybody goes to Aspen on vacation and you load up the Jeep and that's what you have right here so you zoom down the streets and there are other there are other photos that show what's in front of the the to smaller screens are usually maps and are on touchscreens I want to point out that part of the reason this project was funded was the it was in the wake of the the jet rescue the the hostage rescue in Entebbe Uganda a number of Israelis had an Israeli jet had been had been hijacked and the rescue of the hijacking was performed by building a model desert or a model Airport in the Negev desert and prayer death practicing the rescue under cover of darkness in fact this I think this is the subject now of a movie that's about to come out or as coming out later this year and so the question here became what could be what would happen if you were able to actually simulate and do remote moving and move down these streets so that would be the stipulation for this project in later years they were really explicit about this and some of their the some of the reports they wrote Minsky and his colleague Richard Bolt wrote that we are proposing to develop human computer interfaces on the one hand is sophisticated in conception as a cockpit and on the other hand is operationally simple as a TV from either perspective the objective is the same supreme usability later on they started delving into virtual reality in certain ways and questions of augmented reality so this provocation and mapping by herself is a postcard held up in front of the Queen's palace in Stockholm and imagining what it would be like to have a screen that overlaid information upon the world on the other side is Westinghouse mapping a Westinghouse window basically a very early iPad like thing that was still connected to various technologies and you can kind of see in the background there's a Selectric typewriter and a dictaphone but this was a mapping window and intended to substitute for maps in the battlefield it had two dimensional and two and a half d capabilities depending on how you would flip it and this is apparently the first example of a layered digital map I like the fact that Nicholas Negroponte has always understood what he has been working on and the conundrums and contradictions about it and in his 1975 book soft architecture machines he said I strongly believe that it is very important to play with these ideas scientifically and explore applications of machine learning that tottered between being unimaginably oppressive and unbelievably exciting and I find myself as as I look at these historical examples and where we are today I find myself wondering if we need new cliches because when I do Google Image Search and pop in AI this is what I get there's always this you know the wavy or the behold the hand and it's always that color blue it's like the the blue of the projector when no one's in the room Chaisson lady I think there no this is jQuery right yeah yeah cyborg lady if these are our views of AI in the future I think we're in trouble but I appreciate some of the subversive ways that we can look at this and some of the fun ways that we can as well is anyone here a fan of Jenelle Shane in AI weirdness I nerded out so hard at i/o this year when I got to meet her she she does very funny things with AI that I'll talk about but I really appreciate that she understands what she's doing and she said you know it's life plays by the rule engine recognition works well but as soon as people are sheep do something unexpected the algorithms show their weaknesses so are these orange flowers in a field or sheep because she colored them orange it's not sure anymore Jenelle has also done things like this is 7000 paint colors fed to a neural net and it begins to create new colors all of which are terrible and color names exactly yeah I've been reduced to tears multiple times Carrington burble simp turd ly ranching blue thunder she fed the names to the names of guinea pigs for the current Portland guinea pig rescue and came up with some names for guinea pigs here we have hanger Dan and princess Powell and my husband has said you know I think any kid could come up with princess Powell but it takes a neural net to come up with hanger dan only meets machine learning can produce it and and again when I think about these kinds of things I also find myself thinking about this which is actually it it apparently was not Marcel Duchamp who delivered this to the Art Show in 1917 this urinal as his object but rather a woman whose name I can't remember they've just surfaced that it wasn't him but this was part of dadaism where the world was going to hell it was World War one and things were really really dark and so what does art mean when things are really dark means that you've got to turn to absurdity you've got to turn it upside down and so art starts to look different or you look at someone like Eugene Ionesco who wrote the play rhinoceros in 1959 it's an absurdist play and it's where a group of people in a French town bit by bit turned into rhinoceroses and of course he's talking about totalitarianism UNESCO wrote a play called the Bald Soprano because he had started to try to learn English he's a French Romanian and in order to learn English he would type phrase after phrase from this kind of English book John and Sally go to the store over and over and he began to question the nature of these meanings it's almost like he became his own algorithm in order to learn this and he produced a very funny play called the Bald Soprano about it or you could even look at something like boon yell Louie baloon boon yell who did Chien Andalou in the 1920s 19 teens but in 1970 71 something like that he did the discrete charm of the bourgeoisie which is about a group of people trying to have dinner and they just keep getting thwarted and it's a content well somewhat contemporary surrealist film but all of these things are ways to when the world is on its head you upend it in art and I want to suggest that maybe we should be doing the same things more frequently with our algorithms can anyone name what this is thank you okay we're saying that but yeah yeah it's exactly what it is and the uncanny valley is an idea from 1974 Masahiro mori and what I'm struck this is the the idea that when robots are too similar to us they freak us out and he describes the eeriness that that produces but he says something else in his piece in in the article he wrote in 1970 which is that it's about how we understand what makes us human we should begin to build an accurate map of the uncanny valley so that through robotics research we can understand what makes us human until recently Manuela Veloso was the head of the machine learning program at Carnegie Mellon and I was at a conference that she was speaking at and she was talking about machine learning is successful when it does what you expect it to do and for Cedric price we saw the goodness of when something doesn't expect do what you expected to do but there are some dark things to the stories that came out earlier this spring about pollen tears predictive predictive policing in North in New Orleans and the fact that that had not been known not even to most people in the city of northern New Orleans or city officials I like the work a lot of memmio knew aha some of you may know her work she does the project called uh missing datasets and you can't you can't parse what you don't collect and so if you don't have the data you can't begin to parse it she does this both as a tech piece and a critical piece and an art piece so here you see a lot of folders full of missing data sets and of course if you go look through them they're all empty she keeps a github repository where she has these missing data sets and this one civilians killed and encounters with police or law enforcement agencies is no longer a missing data set it's been collected and so she'd like to see more of those and you know case in point sometimes there's an activist angle to her work but there's also there's also work that happens as a result a group of Asian actors on Broadway contacted her about the roles that are available for Asians on Broadway and that blue line is the Asians the Asian roles in the play the King and I and the other bright light blue that you see our Asian roles elsewhere in the 2014-2015 season similarly you can see the problems for black actors or Hispanic actors just not a lot available at that point but by collecting this data it became possible to change the equation and now there are more Asian actors on Broadway this is not a matter of an algorithm but it's just quite simply a matter of the collection of data and collecting the data and naming it making changes Oprah but I'm struck by the things that machines don't do that we don't have good machines for picking raspberries and we kind of do for picking strawberries but it's very very difficult to get this right to manipulate to do this properly and I'm struck by the fact that if you I think it was in Sweden there was a mining operation that had a truck that had some very nice machine learning algorithms operating it more efficiently and it was so efficient that it dug itself into a rut and couldn't get back out so they had to introduce noise into the system to allow for the our love for the vehicle to not to expertly dig itself into the ground so in closing I'll say that AI is new but it's also old and that it is a matter of architecture it's a matter of infrastructure and it's a matter of how we design this is something I see in my neighborhood in Pittsburgh I go running by Carnegie robotics not totally sure how I feel about it yeah I'm still not sure how I feel about it but I think it's pretty compelling but this is the thing that you do come back to over and over again which is our man Cedric price who says technology is the answer but what was the question thank you hi my name is Davide Malina I'm an analyst here at Google and I've been getting really interested in some of the things happening on the edge of this space like generative design and some of this stuff that Autodesk is working on yeah and I'm curious as to how where you see the space evolving sort of like fastest because you know like 3d printing you know there's usually industries that pick it up first like where do you see like the first sort of mass-market case of architectural you know AI or intelligent it's really happening that's a really good question and I'm not sure if I if I have a well-thought-out answer but I'd point out that the history of 3d printing is already quite old and so what we see the uptake in now at a consumer level or at a professional level well and the other thing is I don't think that 3d printers I think they became something that it was said they were going to transform everything in the world and so then everybody started getting maker spaces and I'm not sure that that has actually printing objects has made the world changed but the question of generative design I think that architectural II the primary focus has been on form and representation you know you you use any number of authoring programs and sign programs to produce produce work that you wouldn't be able to otherwise I get very curious again about these old ideas that I still think are vital about how they change the design process and the ingredients that go in that make us think of something that isn't necessarily just ending up in form but ending up in how we construe design but that's yeah thanks it's a good question now I'm gonna try and figure out the answer so Rohit says any thoughts on bill Mitchell's roll city of bits and or urban design on software yeah other than Sim City Oh Bill Mitchell Bill Mitchell was at points the Dean of the School of Architecture at MIT here and the smart cities lab absolutely vital individual he's actually a alum of my master's program and he died about five years ago and I didn't write about him very much in my book I was focusing on a slightly earlier era but he's he's a totally vital figure and there's a woman named Ann Marie Brennan right now she's a graduate of my ph.d program in Melbourne Australia who's been working on some of his work and using his archive there so I think we're gonna see some stuff forthcoming about Bill Mitchell but you also see his work in you see his how he's inspired people including like Anthony Townsend who wrote the book smart cities and has been thinking a lot for the last 20 years on urban planning smart cities and development I guess from a smart city perspective I keep going back to two big concerns that smart cities tend to be and again I get to say this because I'm an academic I guess but there it seems to be viewed as the locus of really great big enterprise deployments like if we used to get excited about enterprises the scale of the building or a campus this is even yet still more tech and a lot of it hasn't been very graciously designed I also think of that idea of microworlds that the question of scale is really vital but when we say scale it means a lot of different things like is it 1 to a billion is it tiny to great big it has many more users as it has many more stakeholders and I think designers and architects are really well positioned to talk about issues of scale but it's it's the hardest thing I think for us to figure out what we mean when we mean deploying on that kind of scale Thank You Rohit hi my name is Christine I just wanted to ask like what are you most excited about that's getting like research now or an idea that's you might have just heard about like what in this field are you most excited about thanks for that question that's a really nice thing to be asked well I recently received this named professorship and it's it's the Kane L Gates professors associate professorship and ethics and computational technologies I'm not an ethicist I'm a designer and I'm a historian and I'm really curious about what we talk about when we talk about ethics because I don't think that it means ethics per se I like you can't just sprinkle some ethics on top and make the food salty and and that that doesn't work and it makes me remember that time in like the 90s and 2000's when people discovered usability and said we need some usability on this website and and like no you don't want usability you want it to work you want it to be good and I'm gonna leave here and go to Stanford to meet up with Fred Turner who if you haven't read his recent pieces in logic and in 0:32 C you should the 0:32 C piece came out this week the piece and logic has a few months old so he's the head of the the communications department he's a historian of among other things Silicon Valley and he were grappling with a question about education and he's he's speaking about engineering writing about engineering education but I mean I think anyone who's gonna work with stuff how how do we educate people engineers are increasingly Fred will argues oriented and then anything else is relegated to other departments but how do you make an ethical approach not be a blow-off class how do you make it be a part of the data sets that your the problem sets you're working on part of my interest in casting the role of it of design to work in different kind of areas is because of that I'd like to you can you can work with designers on framing a problem determining what data should be collected how it should be used how it should be visualized or explained so I have questions about that I have questions about the possibilities and impossibilities of explainable AI and honestly if you just sit me down with like a new history or a bunch of documents about the history of AI you won't see me for a while because I'll be very happy if I can go into into that stuff but I think we have some very human questions that also meet the jobs of the people in this room and the people on my campus and probably the places that we all studied that need broader approaches than just the most efficacious and effective and efficient approach Thanks so one more question from the dory also from rohit why aren't there more real architects celebrated in the field of software architecture other than Christopher Alexander bless you for asking this is so great thank you um yeah I asked Alan Cooper a couple of years ago can you name another architect and I did this to Kent back to and silence fir and I think that Kent Beck said lacor BCA and I think Alan Cooper said I was at John Portman the guy who did the Embarcadero Center and you know the the Bonaventure in in LA it would be better if we had other architects but I think the other thing is that Christopher Alexander as a mathematician and as something I mean it's something that everyone in the room deals with you work on some very tiny part of an absolutely huge problem how do you go back and forth how do you keep that in your head and Christopher Alexander can explain that to people in a way that is really really that really resonates with them the the working on these two scales and then explaining why it actually matters on like a cosmological sense as light stuff is is very woowoo and and that that really resonates and it really doesn't resonate with most architects to build buildings so I I would like to see Chris or I'd like to see Cedric price get taken up by everyone else because he's fun Alexander's not much fun but Cedric's have a blast and to get to know other architects out there I think that the classes of people over about the last four or five years to graduate from architecture school or design school or those of you are in the spaces that crossover really doing interesting work and interesting ways of thinking about it if you want to look at something fun look at my friend Fred Sharman's work he's an architect he's a professor at Morgan State and he has a book coming out on space architecture like space exploration architectural history's next year so fantastic stuff throw your talk I think sometimes when you mention AI like I would consider it as like more like human-computer interaction mm-hmm the reason I'm saying that is because like I'm an engineer so when I get my PhD like years ago so like if you have a PhD in AI is not as easy to find a job as now yep right so in my understanding like like we have a lot of breakthrough in AI like core technology I'm talking about like for example of a gold yeah or like image recognition totally IBM Watson right so when they won't the chapatti show at that time yep so we're talking about like they're a different type of AI core technology advancement and that's recently bring back the Tran of AI but this is quite different from what you're talking about like the human computer in action so and I think IBM call it like cognitive computing so would you would you agree with me if like I try to understand when you say AI is more like human interaction which is not Cori I ever from that we're talking about so yes and no thank you for that that's great and to be to be clear the focus of my research in this book is 1960 I mean to some extent 1948 because I look at cybernetics a lot but to really about 1977 1980 the parts of the book that are focused on on later material are not focused on questions of AI and I agree with you that they are questions of human-computer interaction but I would say that when Negroponte II was writing this book he was writing the book in 1970 and doing the work in 1970 he was developing interfaces with the AI lab using their technologies and their environments and basically tinkering and working in in that capacity so yes they are its input and output devices and and all kinds of ways that the lab over that that period of time played with that it becomes human-computer interaction but I don't think HCI is the field really kind of comes together in that term until the 1980s I I'd need to look at my notes to remember exactly when I will say that I'm very curious about what happens in the HCI community around 1990 because there's some interesting crossovers that I think have have things to do with HCI and interaction design in ways that are in things that are really vital and yeah I would also agree with you that things are way more complex today and I have skated by all of it so my understanding of it is more nuanced but again I'm also a historian of technology and architecture and I'm not someone who got my PhD in AI but yet when you start looking at it today and the implications and the different kind of terms that people are claiming cognitive computing deep learning there's a whole different set of things to start looking at and studying their their histories their going back to the 1980s and 1970s that I haven't yet gotten into but it's you're you're right and and yes but no but yes thank you for that thank you so much everyone for coming out today and thank you Molly for your presence here thank you [Applause] you
