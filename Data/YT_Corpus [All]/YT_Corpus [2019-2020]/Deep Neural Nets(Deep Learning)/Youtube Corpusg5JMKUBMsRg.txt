 [Music] hello I'm Emily Fortuna for the developer show this is our weekly update on the coolest developer news from Google coral is a platform for building intelligent devices with local AI it offers a complete local AI toolkit that makes it easy to grow your ideas from prototype to production this includes hardware components software tools and content that helped you create train and run neural networks locally on your device to learn more head on over to the post linked in the description below tensorflow 2.0 alpha is here this new version of tensorflow is about providing simple and easy to use higher-level AP is focused on Keros and eager execution the big announcement came to the tensorflow dev summit in Sunnyvale California this last week other highlights included new online courses from deep learning AI and Udacity as well as the powered by TF challenge click the links below for our top 5 recap video the recap blog post or the full playlist of sessions G pipe is a distributed machine learning library that uses synchronous stochastic gradient descent and pipeline parallelism for training applicable to any deep neural network that consists of multiple sequential layers it allows you to easily deploy more accelerators to Train larger models and to scale the performance without tuning those annoying hyper parameters graphs and a link to the github repo are on the post android jetpack work manager 1.0 stable is available with some great new features the latest version of work manager lets you set constraints such as network status or charge state when the task runs supports asynchronous one-off and periodic tasks allows chained tasks with input and output and much more for the intro video and sample code take a look at the post you can simplify enterprise threat detection and protection with new Google Cloud security services such as the web risk API which is now in beta with a simple API call client applications can check URLs against Google's list of unsafe web resources including social engineering sites like phishing and deceptive sites and sites that host malware or unwanted software to learn more about this and other fools quick surgeon post chrome 74 is available this includes the ability to highlight all nodes affected by a CSS property which is super cool a WebSocket binary message viewer performance panel updates and much more this whole list with screenshots is on the post linked in the description below please remember to Like subscribe and share I'm Emily Fortuna for the developer show thanks for watching dev show will be on break next week but we will see you in two weeks for episode 150 how about I do this whole thing in this strange accent it's reminiscent of 1930s
