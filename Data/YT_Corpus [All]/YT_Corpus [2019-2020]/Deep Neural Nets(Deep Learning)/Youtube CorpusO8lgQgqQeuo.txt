 we present primal dual mesh convolutional neural networks the focus of our paper is on performing deep learning tasks specifically shape classification and segmentation on 3d triangle meshes directly using mesh elements as the processing unit requires handling non-idealities and variability in the surface discretization as well as generalizing 2d operations mainly convolution and pooling to a non-euclidean domain which relates to the field of geometric deep learning we identified two main types of approaches that work directly with mesh data on the one hand methods based on graph neural networks which consider meshes as graphs and therefore define operations that are not tailored to their structure on the other hand methods that exploit specific mesh properties notably mesh cnn which implements pooling as a task driven edge collapse which however limits the type of elements that can be pulled and defines convolution on the mesh edges but uses kernels shared across the entire mesh therefore not adapted to the local variability of its elements we tackle these limitations by using a primal dual framework which relies on two graphs specifically defined for meshes a dual graph with nodes corresponding to the mesh edges similarly to mesh cnn and the primal graph which is the topological dual of the mesh and has notes on its phases we implement convolution using the generic framework of dpgcnn which we are the first to extend to meshes feature aggregation here shown for the dual graph is performed through an attention mechanism that allows to dynamically weight the kernels depending on the local properties of the mesh convolution is performed on both graphs which allows to extract richer features and is particularly suited for a pulling operation we define pooling as an edge contraction in the primal graph its key property is that corresponds to forming clusters of faces in the mesh in particular our network learns which edges to pull based on the sum of the attention coefficients over them contrary to previous methods this operation is not limited by topological conditions our approach performs dynamic aggregation by uniquely combining a tension-based convolution from graph neural networks with mesh specific task-driven pooling these operations allow the network to often form clusters of faces which correspond to larger structures in a mesh a particularly relevant direction to abstract from its low-level elements experimental evaluation shows that pd-mesh net outperforms competing methods both on mesh classification and at mesh segmentation where we perform the comparison using several different accuracies to account for different types of predicted labels to learn more about pdmsnet please refer to our paper
