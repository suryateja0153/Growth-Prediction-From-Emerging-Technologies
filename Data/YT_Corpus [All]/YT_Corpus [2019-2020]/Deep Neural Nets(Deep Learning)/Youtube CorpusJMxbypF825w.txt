 Deep Learning is the subset of artificial intelligence which is revolutionizing our future from Google self driving car tow Apple City All of these applications of deep learning and that is why top companies such as Google Facebook and Amazon looking to hire people skills in the domain of deep learning So given the Bordens off the planning and mine we have come up with this full course on deep learning Now before we start off in session I'd like to inform you that we have launched a completely three website called Great Learning Academy Over here you have access to complete course is related to artificial intelligence cloud computing distant marketing and the Lord more domains She would be able to have access to different court books data sets and project fights with respect to all of these courses Now that's how quick glance at the agenda So we'll start off with a quick brush up to all the concepts and fightin that as pupils list and dictionaries After that we'll understand one off Luke control statements and fightin Going head will learn about object oriented programming after it will work with library suggest numb by bond US and my plot lip which are very essential when it comes to deep learning So once we're done with brushing up all fighting concepts will dive into deep learning So this session will be taken by Professor Mackay Show Who's the Director Off Education Data science A great learning The location has a word 20 years off industry expedience in data science market results and project management and that's conducted a 100 corporate trainings So when deep learning will start by understanding the importance off artificial neural networks for exactly are they and what is the architecture off artificial neural networks are that will understand the concept off activation functions Going head will learn about back propagation and great indecent algorithms And finally we'll have a demo with respect to board the Tensorflow and Cara's dream books So let's start off in a session Hey guys this is part of me from greet learning Let's start by installing python on you can insult bison from this website over here Www dot by thin dot org So I click on this right so you see that you have the latest version of fighting over here by thin 3.8 point Oh and you can download the python version with respect to whatever operating system you're using If you have a window system then you can download Buy them for windows If you have a line X or UNIX system then you can download fightinfor line extra UNIX And if you have ah my co operating system then you can download Buyten for Michael paging system And since I have a window sister Mile downloaded for windows So I just click on the soul here and you see that that download has started right So now I actually have heightened installed in my system So once the installation of python is done we need something known as an I D So I deviously stands for integrated development environment and integrated elopement Anointment basically makes a work much much easier Why programming So it gives you certain problems and you have all of the tools present in the I D And one such I D which is very famous for bison a spy chump so we can install by Tom from the side over here jetbrains dot com slash by charm So let's the street to the side opens up right so you have the download button over here You just click on this on Dhe for our programming purpose will just download this community was You know we're right So for your pipe and development you click on download and the download would start and again since I'm using off Windows system So this is what up windows system over here All right Now I recognize a python distribution which basically provides you all of the packages in built So you have packages such as Mark Block clip for visualization bond us for the manipulation and numb pie for numerical computing You don't have to manually installed all of these packages when you actually install and conduct All of these packages are actually pretty installed in Anaconda up and for doing all a few according you have something as the Jupiter notebook So first use of Jupiter notebook we would need Anaconda So let's go ahead and install Anaconda All right so this is anaconda dot com and I just click on download now So we need the anaconda distribution and again I click on download Right So God Windows Marquis and Line X And this is the latest version of python 3.7 So that is what we had downloaded or you So this was the old division of Fighting 2.7 But everyone has moved on to Python 3.7 now And that is why I will also be downloading on indefinitely despite the motion which is biting 3.7 So we'll automatically start the download for 64 bit operating system So once the download for Anaconda is done we need something rest of Jupiter notebook which I've already told you So the desert you know here to return your book is basically your browser based interpreter that allows us to intractably work with biting And this is how your jupiter notebook looks like So let me go ahead and open up Jupiter notebook So let me open up Anaconda prom first So I'll die pin on a gondola from So this is the command line interface Now open of Jupiter In your book I'll just type in Jupiter's piece notebook and let me wait till his opens up All right So this is the Jupiter notebook over here right And this is how it looks like now to open up a new notebook We just have to click on new and we'll click this new bite and three notebook and we have successfully opened our new by the Notebook Let me just rename the stew Buyten programming Now Once it's done let's go ahead and write off forced by thin program so we'll just use the brain statement So you just have to type in print on dhe Inside this I'll type and let's see This is Sparta up on All you have to do is click on run and you have your food's program You have successfully printed this a spot out on the console Well you just taken the first step to hacking NASA right So we just have to take the baby steps and you'll be an export bite and programming and you have successfully started with your food Spieth and program All right so now that the average enough Force python program the question which needs to arise in your minders every programming language needs to deal with the Lord of Data So where do we actually store this data Well this is where beatable is common So let's say you have to store the names off all of the students present in a classroom So let's see The names are John Sam Mad Bob on Julian so on And you have 50 such names You have to store all of these names somewhere hearted would Well all you have to do us take available and store all of these names in a variable No you must be thinking we're exactly so beautiful So let's understand that with this example So simply put readable Czar basically temporary storage spaces where you can store data up or values Now let's take this example over here so consider this folder to be available So what you do is you store this value temporarily inside this folder This value us John which is the name of the student suit taken this value and please inside this variable for certain amount of time Now after that since this is only your temporary storage piece you can pick out this variable and replace it with Sam Right So now this variable holds the value some on after some time again you decide that Sam was not the names I want a story and I want to store the name But so can you pick out the name Sam and store Matt inside this folder So this out variables work their temporary storage values where you can keep on changing the values inside it So now what we know what exactly are variables Let's go to Jupiter Notebook on Walk with Variables So again I'll open up a new bike country notebook over here So now to assign a variable I let's create a new object over here and I'll name it as our one I used the assignment operator and I'll give in the name of the first name would be Bob on to print it out I'll just type in wire one over here again What We have successfully stored the value Bob inside wire one Now I'll seems the value inside this forgettable So we're all Louis I will actually store the value Sam inside this wire one on Let me print it out again You know where one stores some so initially wired one had the value Bob and after some time had to replace the value with some new again Let me change the value So inside wire one I will be storing might on Let me print it out again So this time it has the value mad So as you see vegetables are just temper used to read spaces where the values can be changed Now every variable is actually associated with the data type so there are different types of the tablets variable can hold It can be off in teacher type It can be floating or decimal type It could be a 1,000,000,000 It can be a string So it comes to individuals You basically have numbers just 10 500,000 minus stand minus 27 1 and floating are basically decimal point numbers of 3.14 15.97 or minus 2.1678 soup Any such dismal point number would be a floating point number and then you've got bullion values Obviously logical values and true and false are basically off bullion values And then you finally have those string values So what String is basically a set off characters and close together right So Sam is the excuse it off characters It is a string and then you have my Frisbee skills set off characters It is a string and strings are generally enclosed within double courts Single code sir Triple courts Right now let's assign some different types of data Toby doubles So let me create a new variable E And I'll store the value 10 inside this Now I'll go ahead and check the type of this so the type of this variable would be and now inside A I like to use to order the small point number So this time I'll start with 1.4 on get me Take the type of it So die both be Can I take on run So this time we see that there's a floating point number So what you gonna be Skin notices The type of the variable would depend on the type of the D temperature actually storing inside the variable A few store on in teacher type data inside the variable than the type of the variable would be impeached And if you store the floating point or a decimal type data inside the variable and the type of the very well would be floating type now similarly let me go ahead then store of bullion value inside this so I'll store drew inside this Let me check type off eh So the type of years bull Now let me store Oh character value So I'll type Hello world Let me remove out this w over here And then again I'll take the type of this so type off e one type of years string So finally we have one more type of data which is basically complex number so complex numbers You basically know that it has a real part in an imaginary part So let me just type it out So four bless Let's see a G now normally in mathematics is actually present as four plus eight I know when it comes to python programming really present the imaginary part with you So Ford is that he'll part over here on day eight G is the imaginary part over here So just to confirm it I like it in take the type so type offi the type office complex So all of these other different types of data which we can work with and bison so going ahead will you walk with operators and bison So we've got a medic operators relational operators and logical operators Let's start off it arithmetic operators I'll get onto a Jupiter notebook over here on our medic operators are basically leadoff normal mathematical operations which you do so that would be addition subtraction and then your guard division And then you've got multiplication So these other different symbols which will be using to perform these operations so we'll start off addition So let me just add in a comment So to add no comment you will use this hash on Then you'll type in whatever you want to add so common so basically statements which are not executed by the Python interpreter And it's not only to help the quarter order loner All right so I'll execute this cell over here so I'll have one beatable and I'll store 10 inside this and I love unavailable be I'll store to Andy inside this if you go on run all right so I'll start with the addition operation So I'll just type in e plus B and you get the value off 31 is quite simple So is their basic addition operation which you've been doing since your kindergarten right and also will be doing some similar operations and then I'll go ahead and perform a minus B So what you think is the answer Well it's minus 10 because when you subtract 20 from 10 you'll get a value of minus Stan Well let's also multiply these two numbers so I just type in across Be so that would be 10 into 20 which will give you 200 And then finally I'll just type in a divided by B so you get a value of Cedar Point fights so 10 by 20 gives your value of 0.5 So these were the basic arithmetic operations Now Well go ahead then work with some relational operators So I'll just type in relational operators over here So again I am putting down comments so relational operators on relational operators basically help youto understand relation between two variables Now what I mean when I say it helps us to understand the relationship between two variables So let's say when you have two variables the value and one variable could be greater than the value and the second variable Or it could be less than the value in the second variable or it could be equal or they might be no relation at all between these two really appeals This is where we'll have relational operators to find out What is the exact relation between two operates right So again I just type in the equal Stan and B equals 20 over here right If we can run right so I'll start with the less than operator So I'll type in e less than be so here I'm just second of the value off E is actually less than the value of B So we get a value off through this means that then is actually less than 20 Now let me check if he is greater than be regular false value because 10 s not greater than 20 Now I have the double equal to operators With the help of the double equal to operator we check if both of these values are equal to each other again We get a false value because 10 is not equal to 20 now there is a not equal to operator So he is not equal to be so Hee I'll given this exclamation mark and then I'll give in this sequel to symbol and give the second operation which is be so we see that is obviously not equal to be or another term stand is not equal to 20 So these were some basic relational operators And then we'll go ahead and walk with the Lord Can operators while type in large coal operators over here So the two basic logical operators are on DDE or on Sis how you to present the and operator And this is how you representing or operate Oh well actually start with the on operator No I know But it does use to take the condition or the logic between variables and this is how the on operator works So if both of the operations are true only then the final result will evaluate the truth And if either of the operations falls or both of the operations is false then the final result will be falls So I'll just create variables over here And this time I'll be storing the value true inside a and I'll be storing falls inside beat So I'll just execute this over here All right so now I'll type in e and be so we are basically checking through on Dhe Falls So what do you think will be the result We get a false value because we need to cruise and only when we have to Truth doctors one will get the true value Now we'll check B and it so when it comes to be and if we are basically changing the position of these operations that's it So now it becomes false and true and the answer's falls Now let me check E on E This will be true and true So when you compare true and true you get a true value And finally let me check be on B You get a false value So this is how the and operator works Now let's go ahead and walk with the or operator So when it comes to the our operator if either of the operations is true or both of the operations are true denigrate true value and only when both of the opens our falls that is when you have a false value So this time I'll type in E or be this would mean true or false and obviously we have a true value over here Then I'll diaper and B or E to this would mean falls or true and we obviously have a true value Now let me go ahead and check e or E for this would mean true are true So when you have two crews obviously it's a true value And then finally let me check B or B and we have a false So this is the only condition that you'll get a false value when it comes to our Those were their basic operators and python not its head onto fightin strings So fight and strings are the most widely used in our types when it comes to python And as I've already told you strings are basically sequins off characters which are enclosed within single courts Double codes for triple courts and triple codes are used to denote my feline string So as you see this example over here I am going to France tomorrow So you have to put quotes around the string because this is presented multiple lines So hello Will has presented single course This is a string this is part of as present and double chords and again this is a string But when it comes to I am going to France tomorrow This is a my D line string so that's the basic provides for strengths So now let's go to Jupiter notebook and walk with these drinks All right so I create a new really below here and I'll store a string inside this so I'll we're in the string Joey doesn't share is a I can run right So obviously no one likes to share That is up to we right So now let's go ahead band walk with the strength So let's say I want to extract the first character who just g from this entire string Now when it comes to python indexing starts from zero so G is basically present that index number zero So if I order extract G I'll type in the one I'll put in square braces on denial typing zero and how successfully extracted the Force little and similarly if I want to extract the last character from this entire strength So for that you'd have to put in minus one and when I click on run you get the value So this is how you extract the last character from the entire string Now let's I would extract the sequins off characters so I want to extract this and die award which is doesn't so 012345 So the index starts at five and it will go on to 6789 10 11 and 12 So let me type in 12 over here I'll pick on run right Would you have given 12 Because when it comes to the second term over here it is exclusive So five is inclusive Well is exclusive 012345 d is presented Index number five then 6789 10 and 11 City is presented index number 11 But if you only given 11 over here then you'll get doesn't right So what You have to keep in mind us when it comes to the second indexing DM it is exclusive So that is why you have to go and tell 12th on you'll get the end I award which is doesn't now let's see How can we check the length off a string So you check the length of a string We have this land function So inside alien I'll just pass in this variable which is the one on which he had the land of the stringers 24 characters Now when you say 24 so this would include all of the species and all of the apostrophes and full stops and all of those characters as well Right now let's go ahead and walk with some of the inn build functions off strings So if I want to convert all of these characters into our bookies so I just have to type in E one and then I have this function upper so I'll click on Run Right so successfully converted all of these characters to capital Similarly if I want to change all of these two small case so while type in a one dot lower so everything is stolen tow Loki is now Similarly if I want title case so I'll type in Even Dodd I do right So I have successfully changed all of these words Too tight Icky Suji is capital these capital or here since apostrophe is taking us another character that is white is also given capital and then we have SS capital in the U S Capitol Right So these were some basic functions when it came to strengths Now let's go ahead and walk with some non primitive data structures in fighting for the main non primitive area structures and fight in our pupil list dictionary and set So when it comes to all of these data structures you can store my tipple elements inside one beat our structure so tell never work with only variables And when it came to wearables we could store only one value in Von Variable Now let's say if you go to a music concert and you have to store the names off all the people at in the music concert and the strength off the audience would be around 10,000 So to store the names you would require 10,000 variables Now that's a lot of funerals and you'd have to manually store all of these names inside 10,000 variables That's a humongous task and that's her tiresome task So this is where you would need these dear structures where you can store my tipple elements inside one single dina structure So instead of the 40 structure which is basically a pupil so when it comes to do pull it is an order collection Off elements include within around breezes so we have curious seasonal here on He'll be coming in between to give us some pointers So curious isn't tells is that pupils are immutable now What does he mean when he sees that pupils are immutable So basically when you go ahead and create a pupil so let's say you are five elements inside one pupil Now you can't change or modify the pupil which you have created so that would basically mean that Let's see if you have five elements then you can't change the value of the second element or the toward element Or you can add another element inside the tube in which you have already created So this is basically the mutability nature off pupils on This is how you can create a pupil so you'll use this round braces or here and inside these you'll given the values right So as you see pupil is actually you had trip didn't steal a structure So here you are starting a new medical value of character Val you end up bullion value right So let's go to Jupiter notebook and walk with pupils So let me queda do Bill so I'll name that you blast you be one and I given the values right So this is our triple Do you be one Let's see how Kim access individual elements from the stupid accent Elements from Pupil is the same as axing elements from a string The only do is given the name of the people with Stu P One You've given this square braces and then if you want to extract the first element which is basically presented index zero your type in zero or here and you have extracted the first element which is one Similarly if you want to extract the last element you have to type in minus one and you have extracted the last element which is 23 And if you want to extract our sequins off elements so let's say I want a true and be so this would be from index number one going on till in next Number four because we want 12 and three So I'll die pin one colon for rights I've extracted E drew and B right so so you can extract individual elements from our people Now as I've told you our cue Polis immutable So let me go ahead and try to change the value which is present inside of people so I'll type in u P one and let me change the value which is presented Zero What the next and I'll change it to let's see 100 And we get an editor here So the arrest stupid object does not support item assignment And that is because Stupples are immutable Now let me try to other new value Inside this we've got 12345 So that would mean this is index number four Let me try to add something that in next Number five I'll die I've been a reporter again We got the sea matter So deep logic does not support item assignment because of this immutable Now we're onto the next year a structure which is open list So let's send pupils are quite similar The only difference is less a mutable while pupils are immutable Now what I mean when I say less are immutable So this means that less can be changed once they are created So there are five elements in a list So the second element or the toward element can be mortified and against himself said that there are five elements so another five elements can be added inside this list So this is the basic difference between less and pupils and this is how you can create a list So basically given square braces and you're given all of the values Insider square braces Let's hear onto Jupiter Notebook and walk with lists So I'll type in one and I've given some values over here and then I'll print it out Right So this is a list over here on Daxing Elements from the list of Seamus Do Bill So if I want to access though Forest Elemental type and Elena given square braces and then I given zero so have extracted off first element Now let's go ahead and access her sequins off elements So I order access thes three elements are were true Tow N B So this is index number two and then going on until the next number five So Alan and too cool and five writes a true too and be so we have successfully extracted thes three sequins off elements Now let me go ahead and actually change the values inside this list so I'll change this value 1 200 for what happened l 10 and I'll assign the value off 100 Now let me print out l one So as you see initially the value off this element was one And then we have seen the Value 200 No let's say I want to add a couple more elements inside this list so I'll type in Elwin dot happened and I lied an element and name it Do we Let's see toward and then let me print out l one rights are successfully added a new element So I can actually I had a list inside the list So let me again use the pen function over here and then I'll add a list inside this so I'll type in 1234 and five So let me again Look at l one rights are successfully added this new list inside this list Now we can also go ahead and remove these elements So to remove the last element we've got a malfunction so I'll type in Elwin dot bob So as we see this last element has Bean popped out Now again let me type in Elvin dark pop on Let's see what we re popped out right to this time this elements world has been bobbed out Now let me have a look at the modified list rights We are only left with these values because word and this list has bean bobbed out for itself We can work with lists Now Let's get on to the next year structure which is a dictionary The dictionary actually quite different than a less standard people because it Kansas soft key value pairs And these are actually a KN ordered collection off key value pairs which are enclosed within Coley breezes and again dictionaries up mutable So this is how you can create a dictionary You'll print call you braces over here the first you put in the key So we're here The key is apple and then you've given up Colin and then you'll given the value So for the key apple the value is then and then you'll give the next key value pair So after Comer the next key value Paris Orange 20 Orange is the key and 20 is the value Let's go ahead and creator on dictionary So let me create the dictionary Over here I'll type in the one tonight given these call you pieces So we have So I just start giving some names of fruits So let's say the first key as mango and the prize of the fruit would be the value So mango cause 45 bucks and then we've got Apple So let's see Apple's cost us 30 and then with God orange and then orange costs around 77 off that god guava and then it this would cost around 100 and 25 Now let me print it out So this is our dictionary Now what We have us a key value purse So if I want to access only the keys then we have the keys functions while type in D one dot keys So given the name of the dictionary and then I'll follow it up with the keys function even got keys right So I have extracted all of the keys which are mango apple orange in Kuala Similarly if I want to extract all of the values which are basically the price of all of these fruits I'll type in de $1 values and I have extracted the prices off all of these fruits Now let's go ahead then modify some of these elements So I order teens the cost off mango so I'll type in D one on then I'll give in the name off key So the name of the GS mango and the cost would be 100 on denial type in D one So initially the cost of mango was 45 then I've ordered it to be 100 So this is how we can work with dictionaries And then we've got the final leader structure which is a set So the site is an unknown ordered and a next collection off elements in close within curly braces So where do I mean by indexed So when I say a new index this basically means that sets don't have any index toward so we can't really access the elements with respect to that indexing and also another thing to be notice sets do not allow duplicate values So let's see if you are the value then then you cannot add the same value again so it will take the value only once and that's how you can create a set so you'll have calibrate so here and then you'll given all of the elements inside it So let me create my final leader structure over here so I'll type in one e and then I'll give enough floating point while you let's see 3.78 Let me print off the set So this is our set over here Now where l do us I'll copy this and let me try toe add some duplicate values so I'll add one all of these times And then I'll also add a Now let me friend out s one and then see what while you do I get so we see that duplicates are not allowed one Even though I have given around five or six times it has been taken only once and you have given two times But then again it comes only once So obviously said does not allow any duplicates inside it Now you can go ahead and add some new values inside the set So I'll die Pin s one dog ad Hello world right Survived this new element And if I want to add more than one element it or single time then we've got this update mattered So I'll type in a swoon dark upbeat and I'll give it a list off values So while diaper and let's see Sparta up on then I live in 1 23 Then I'll give in Let's see three bless 90 Then let me print out as one All right All of these elements have been added again You see that The order of these elements has not reserved it is random right So three plus 90 comes over here And then we caught 11 23 rates of the random a snort it all preserved All right so we're done with the basic data structures and biting which will basically do pull list dictionary and set So now we're here under the Floo control statements on then flew control statements will start with F statement So in jail World you will come across a lot of situations but I don't have to make a decision on the basis for condition So let's see if this happens then you'd have to perform a selloff actions else You have to go home with different serial factions So let's take this example to understand this buildup So let's say it's raining and you'd want to play football So if it's raining then you can't do anything and you just have to sit inside else So if it is actually not training then you can go out and play football So these are some of the real world situations which can actually be represented in programming with the help off if else statement So let's go to Jupiter notebook and work with efforts So here I'll create up to variables So given the value off 10 Toe E and I've given the value off 20 Toby on then let me check if the value of B is actually greater than the value off So f B is greater than E Then I want to print out b s greater than it So since this condition has been evaluated to troop Maris Wendy is greater than 10 And since this is true this statement has been executed So we get be scarier than a Let me actually flip it So I order check off e s greater than be end of this evaluates to true I will print out e s created then be so don't get any result And that is because this condition has been evaluated Two falls And since this condition has been evaluated toe falls the statement has been skipped So this is where else close comes and so let me use tells over here Now I'll type in If he is greater than be then I'd want to print out ISS greater than be Els I want to print out be this greater than hey Right So here the first condition evaluates to false and that is why it escaped And then we given the else close and this condition sprinted B is great isn't it Now let's see if you have multiple conditions So if you have three numbers and reward check which is the greatest are those three numbers So that's where we would need if else if else So let me actually assign the values again So I'll assign then e 22 bi on d ie Also assigned 30 to see So now I'm more a check of is greater than be in a scarier than see so I'll type in f e s greater than be on DDE e s greedier than see and of this evaluates to drew I want to print out e S t Could he just and this evaluates to falls Then I'll type in which stands for Elsa So I'll given the next of conditions over here so I'll type in B is greater than E on Dhe B is greater than C and here I will print out B is the greatest to be a stuff greed ist And again if this evaluates to false I'll find you Put in l's Andi I will print out See a CZ though Greediest So here are the final result S C is the greediest Now let's understand this whole thing Probably so first we come to the f statement and then we check F e s greater than B and E is greater than C barest a stent greed than 20 and 10 Creative and 30 So both of these are false and falls and falls would evaluate two falls And that is why I will skip the statement over here Then we'll come toe else if and we're checking If B is greater than it for 20 years earlier than 10 which is true then we'll check Is 20 greater than 30 which is actually falls so true and false will evaluate the falls And again this is kept and finally will come to else and will print out See is the greatest So that's how we can work with F else Now let's use the F statement without pupil So let me create a tupelo here So do you be one and let me give some values a be on DSI So I have created the stupid Now after this I ought to check if the element is present and the stupid so f e and you be one then I'd want to print out e s present All right So since this condition is evaluated to true Paris the element is actually present in the stupid and that is why we print this out Now let me just check if the character s s present and this on diffidence present I want to print out as this present So this condition evaluates to false and nothing has printed out Now Similarly let me go ahead and work with F and list So if that list and then I'll go ahead and create a list So l one and then I'll give it a bunch of values inside this So then 22 d 40 and 50 Now I want a check of the first element and this list is actually 10 And if the value is equal to 10 Then I want to change it to 100 So if l went off and Egg zero is actually equal do 10 Then I want to change this too 100 then I'll finally print out this list right So initially though first element in this list will stand with the help of the F statement I've changed They do 100 now Similarly let me go ahead and work with F and Dictionary Dictionary would if I create a dictionary the one and then I'll give it a bunch of key value parents over here So I'll type in the name of the fruit which is mango on the night assigned the value which is then and then the next fruit would be apple And then the cost would be when Deke and then the final fruit would be banana and then the cost would be hurting All right so now I were a check of the value off mango distant and effort is equal to 10 Then I'd want to add 100 more to this value so f d one off mango is actually equal Do then Then I'd want to add and more to this so d one off mango would be equal Do the one off Mango Less 100 and then I'll print out demon over here Right So initially the cost of Mango Winston Then using the f statement I have incriminated the value Do 110 I guess so This cell we can work with the F statement Now let's head onto looping statements So looping statements are basically used to repeat a task my nipple times So let's understand looping statements with this example So you have a bucket and you want to completely fill it up with the mug off water so the conditioners while the bucket is not full you will keep on adding a mug off water to work until a tasteful So here the repetition task us You will have a mug of water and you'll keep on pouring that into the bucket until a chestful repeating a task until the final condition is met And this is how the why loop works so and the new bank statements you basically have while and foot so we'll start with the Why loop So let's go to juvenile book again So let me initialize Available for soil type in I equals one And then I use the Why Luke So the condition would be while I s less than are equal to 10 I'd have to print out I Now after this is done I have to incriminate the value off I with one So we let me print this out So this is the result Let's understand this better So initially I have a variable I onda have initialized it with the value one Then I'll start this Why loop So we're here I'll check if I s less than or equal to 10 And initially eyes value is equal to one So is one less than or equal to 10 So it is true And since this is evaluated to true I'll come inside the wild loop and I'll print out the value off I which is one Then I'll incriminate the value off So one plus one would become too Again I'll check off to West less than or equal to 10 And since two years less than or equal to 10 I'll again come inside the wire loop and then I'll print out too Then again eyes implemented ice value would become three So I'll check of three is less than or equal to 10 again It evaluates to true I'll print out three and then this loop repeats itself until eyes value becomes equal Do 10 right to the final value would become equal to 10 and then I's value would become 11 So here I'll check if 11 s less than or equal do 10 and that condition would feel And when the condition finally feels we will come out of the loop So this is how the why loop works So now you know why loop I want a printer to table let us through Cross one equals two to cross to equals forward and across three equal six and so one So I'll have the first available initialized witches I equals one and then I'll diamond and equal stupid So I have my valuables initialized over here Now I'll start though why Lou on down the slope will go until ice value is less than or equal to 10 No inside this I will print out so end and then cross I as equal Do I just put in and cross I So let me print this out off this I have to actually given one more condition which is I equals eye less one So if I don't income in the value of fight then it will go into an infinite loop So I'll hit around So we have this to table over here So let me explain this properly So initially eyes valueless one So I'll check if one is less than or equal to 10 which is true So I'll come inside this and I'll print out to cross One is equal to do and then I'll income in the value off I would just do Then I'll check if us less than or equal to 10 which is again true Then I'll come inside and then I'll print out to cross Two is equal to four Then again eyes value is incremental It becomes three Then I'll check a freest less than or equal to 10 And since this is true I like in common side and that I'll print out three Cross to is equal to six and the school's on until the eyes values equal to 10 and then I'll print out across town is equal to 20 and when being committed eyes value again It becomes 11 So is 11 less than or equal to 10 Well it evaluates to false because 11 s clear than 10 Right So this is where the loop ends and we have the final value It is to cross 10 equals 20 Now let's use why Loop with the list Obviously create a list with a bunch off elements inside it on with the help off while loop I would add 100 more to each of the value inside the list So let me create a list over here L one and I'll add in a bunch of values over you So 1234 and five So the list has been created Now now I'll go ahead and initialize the variable I to be equal Do zero So this is all Sudan and then I'll start the why Luke So inside the wire loop I will basically check till I s less than so Let me remove these brackets over here So while I is less than length off l one So lento fell one would be 1234 and five So I would go from 0 to 4 and then I basically want toe inclement the each element inside this list So l one off I would be equal Do l one off I bless 100 And then I also have two income in the value off I So I would become I lost one on Then finally I'll print out the value off l one right So initially though by using the Lester 1234 and five and after running the loop the values became 11121314 and one of five So let's understand this group So initially value off I was zero and I'm checking of zero s less than fight which is true So I'll come inside and I'll assign l one off zero to be equal to Elvin off zero plus 100 will be 100 less one which is equal to 101 right So one would become 101 and then eyes values incriminated Why want so eyes valueless one now And then again I'll check if I s less than five which is true So I come inside and then I'll assign l one off One is equal to l one off one place 100 So I'm adding 100 to this element toe It becomes 100 toe And similarly this Wilco Wandell index number four and when it becomes five so far is not less than fight and Irishmen will come or of the slope So this how we can work with them while you now we'll hear under the full you so full uppers usedto I trade overdose sequence So that sequence could be either to pull list dictionary said or even a string And it's no sin takes off for loop So for value in the sequence and then we'll give out the body Now this might seem a bit We got difficult to understand so philosophically had to Jupiter notebook and go ahead with the court So let me start by creating a list So I live in l one equals and then I'll give it a bunch of colors inside this which would be equal to Blue Green on Ben I just sign read through it Now once this is done let me use though for Lou Band I trade over this list So for I n at one I'll just print out I right So I have printed out each individual element off this list So for I N l one right So when I say I this value off I initially would be blue So for i n l one So Ellen has thes three elements Blue green and red And initially eyes value would be blue So I'll come inside this list and I'll print out blue Now it's incremental and I'll go to the next element in the sequence which is green So I will have green inside it I'll come in and I'll print out Green and then I'll and then I'll go ahead to the final element inside the list which is right So again I'll come inside and I'll print out the red So this is how the four loop works Now we can actually create a nested for loop so that would mean a far loop inside a for loop So for this let me create two lists and uh two separate for loops So while create let's see collar and I'll assign some value So the values are cream Yeah Lou on Dhe think And then I'll also another list And then I leaned the list to be equal to item and I'll add a bunch of items to word So let's say the first item is chaired the second item There's book and the third item is Foon Now I'll start a four loop So far I and collar I another affordable here So for G and item I will print out I come a G and this is what we have So let's understand this So we'll start with the outdoor for Loop which goes through this list over here which is color So for I n color so initially eyes value would be green Now when the eyes value is green Welcome inside the four loop and we'll start the inner loop for G and item So initially jeez value this year So I'll print out green chair Now again I'll go back and increment the value off G So then we have book inside you so I'll print out green book Then again geez values implemented It becomes phone I'll print out green phone right So now the inner loop is also done I'll go back to the outer loop and then I'll increments in clean Hello So now eyes value is yellow So again I'll come inside the loop and then I'll print out Yellow chair yellow Book and the telephone again I'll go back to the outer loop and then the value off ice pink Then I'll come inside and then I'll print picture bankbook and pink phone So this is how you can work with nested loops So now that we're done with the flow control statements will Paronto functions So what exactly is the function to simplify this What We're basically doing this You're taking in a bunch of court putting it in a simple model and weaken in book it whenever we want to perform a specific task So let's take this example of an A t M So over here depositing money inside the A team would be one function Withdrawing money would be another function and chicken balance would be another function Now let's see if you want to deposit money on dhe you would have to right around 100 lines off court to deposit my on Let's see if you were deposit money around 100 times then you'd have to write this 100 lines off scored 100 times now Instead of this it would be wonderful if we just had one deposit function on all we did was involved his deposit function and we could deposit our money happy Right So this is where functions coming Similarly when it comes to the withdrawal function we'll just have to add one function well right Or the bunch off court only ones And I never we want to withdraw money will just involved dysfunction Similarly whenever we want to check the violence I just walked the violence function and I can happily check the violence So let's go to paternal book and work with functions so nuclear function and fight and will be using the d E f mattered And then after the e f is given the name of the function So I just stopped create a very simple function on and I'll name that function to be hello And this needs to be followed without big synthesis So after this I'll give in a colon and then I'll given the body off this function So this function just brings out hello world So hello world Right now if I have to involve dysfunction I just have to type in Hello with this parentis All right so if I want to bring it out Hello World oil I have to do us Copy this Piece it over here So I'll have to do is invoke dysfunction on Then I can happily print Hello World How many times there weren't Now off this world of ours I will create a function where I'm taking our input value and adding 10 more toward So I'll type D e f and I'll name the function US ad then And this basically takes enough batter Mito value If you see this previous example you see that I did not pass anything inside the spirit This is But we can actually pass in a value inside the period this is and I'm passing in x which is obviously could be any arbitrary value and I'll put in a cooling over here Now what This does this This three tones then less ex So it takes an X adds intend to it and then returns the final value This is the function So let me in work this Let me pass in five inside this function So when I pass in five it will ard tend to it and it'll be done The final value with just 15 Similarly let's see I'll add an 100 inside this settled redoing a value off 110 So this was another example now going ahead will check fo value is even or odd using your function so I'll dive D E f And then I just named dysfunction does Are you in on again The sticks in a value so I'll use the F condition and I'll check if eggs and I'll check of eggs person to a stubble equal to zero So whatever input value was given I will divide it with two and of the input is equal to zero Then I will just rent out Eggs is even else I will print out Eggs is hard so I have created this function Now let me invoke it and passing a value so I'll pass in nine and let's see where is the result right So this function tells is that nine isn't our number Let me again passing a number inside the soil passing forward So this time dysfunction tells us that four is even right So this is how we can create functions with Fighting Noble Toronto Me Joe Biden and biting witches object oriented programming Now when you actually look around you what do you see You are surrounded with objects aren't you Right So you might have a laptop in front Off you You have a phone in front of you You have ah bike You have a dog All of these are real world objects And if you want to present these real world objects and programming paradigm then you would need something known as object oriented programming Right So simply put you have all of these steel world objects around you And if you want to represent all of these steel world objects and programming paradigm that's where he'll go ahead and use object oriented programming So now when it comes to article in the program and you be slinging to understand who particular concepts which are basically classes and objects so devastated over here a class is basically your template or a blueprint for real world entities now or I mean by So when I see template or template would comprise off two things one s properties off the object and the next test behavior off the object So let's take a phone now off one would have certain properties associated with it and it will also have certain behavior associated with it Now the property's off for food could be its color It's costing It's bad three life So what is the color of the fool in How much does it cost and how long does the battery last So these are some properties which are ASU's So these are some properties which are associated with every single phone that everyone has and then all the phones have certain behavior common to all of them so you can make a call to the phone You can watch the news on the phone and you can also play games in a phone Right so these are the properties and behavior Associate it with the phone What class basically combines these properties and behavior in one single template So that is a class Now let's understand what exactly is a object So objects are basically specific instances off a class So as I've told you a class is a general template and when you want a specific instance off that general template that is when you have an object So when I say food that phone would be your class and the objects off that phone would be Apple more troller and Samsung right So Apple Motorola and Samson would have the general template off a phone so they will have the general properties and they will also have their general behavior So if these objects are of the same phone class then you'll get those same properties which are basically which is Basically all of these phones would have color associated with them costs associated with them and then you will also have back three life associated with them And when it comes to behavior these three phones would have those functional piece comin right So in all of these three phones you can make phone calls you can play games and you can also watch videos So this is what I mean when I say objects are specific instances off a class right So now that you know where exactly is hoops and where exactly are classes and objects Let's go ahead then perform some object oriented programming So let's go ahead then create our first class and to create a class we will have to use the class keyword and then we'll give in the name of the class and by convention the first letter off the name of the class needs to be capital So I'll type in Capital B and then I'll pull it up with hetero any sort this phone And then inside this I will given the properties and the behavior of the class So ah ah phone Be skip the help of a phone You cannot make phone calls and you can play games so I'll start by creating methods So the first method is toe Make a phone call so I will name this mattered as make a call and then this will have something known as self So this self basically means that this method belongs to the instance which invokes it So this might be a bit confusing but once we actually create an instance off this last it'll become very clear to you So we have created this method and when someone in books this matter I'll just type in me can go a phone call on the Nile Given the second method which has a league game again this will have this self attribute So again the self attribute basically stands for whichever instance invokes this method It belongs to that All right so I will friend out laying game All right so I have created this class which is basically the general template off a phone Now I will go ahead and create the object So to create an object I will type and the one which is basically the instance other object off this class and I will have to type in the name of the class forward by the parenthesis And I have successfully created the instance off this phone glass Now if I have to involve these methods from this object so I will type in the name of the instance I use a daughter operator And then I can directly get the name of the method in this class If I want to make a phone call I just have to type and even dot make called So be one is the name of the instance After that given the daughter operator and then I'll give in the name of the method inside this class which is me Call right So now I have successfully involved this matter off this class so be one as an instance off This class and I'm able to access this method with the help of this instance Similarly I'll type in B one dart league game All right so now I have started bleeding Dean Right So this is how we can create instances Now let me actually go ahead and add some para meters to the methods inside this So again I'll create a new class or basically and mortifying this class I'm not creating a new clothes so I'll type in class So this will be phone and then I'll create a new method on debts will be basically toe at the color off the phone so I'll type in add color So now every method inside the class needs to have this self attribute And then after that I'll given another parameter which is basically Carly And inside this Ivan said self dot Koller equals color Now you have to understand that this self dot color and this color are actually different So this color is the value when someone gives while in walking this matter while the self dark color is the in Build a tribute inside this class off that particular instance So this seems confusing Let me repeat it again So this color that you see is basically the perimeter of the value when someone gives and white in working this matter and the self dot color is the value it is being assigned to the color attribute off the instance which is being involved So let me actually go through and this will become very clear to you right So I have created this method and then similarly I wanna do my third called us on cost again This will have to perimeters forced yourself on the next would be caused and then I'll die Pond self dot cost equals cost So this has also done so going ahead I will create one more matter where I'd have to show the color and show the cost rights Until now I have only taken the color from the user and taken the course from the user Now I also have to print it out so I'll create a new mattered called us Sure color This would have self and on this would basically return the color so self dark color And after this I would have sure cost again The barometer would be self and this would be returning the course so that would be Self Dart Coast All right on denial Again create those two basic functions which are basically making a phone call and playing a game So definition off this would be self I am just printing out making a phone call off this I'd have to create the final Mattered Which us play game again This will have those self attribute andan I'll print out playing game right So I have successfully created this class No I'll go ahead then create and sense of this class so I'll type in We do equals phone Let me go ahead and add the color and cost of this phone so I'll type in B two dog collar Let me go ahead then at the color in cost of this phone So I'll type and be too dark Collier and uh all right go ahead then at the color and cost to this phone so I'll type A and B to dart Add color on the color of this phone is let's see blue now Similarly I also want to add the cost of this phone so be too dark at cost and the cost of this foreigner's let's say $200 right now I have a signed the color and the cost Now let me show the color in the course so I'll type in b two dot show collar so we see that the color of the phone is blue Now let me also print of the cost so be towed out show cost So we see on the course of the fullness 200 All right so now what you see is this self dot cost equals cost yourself dot Color equals color So this color is basically this value which we are passing in when we are invoking the function Right So this blue is going over here and this is being assigned to the attribute color off this class phone So make it more clear Let me actually create one more instance off this class on Let me add the color to the So be three equals Foon So I have created this and then I type and be three dog add color on the collar off this phone would be red Now let me show this out Be $3 shoe color So the color off this instance off the phone be three Israeli Now let me die about we do Lord Sure color which is blue Right So this self what you see this basically denotes the instance which is invoking the method Right So were here when we involved the odd color with the Frito instance This self attribute was with respect the p two instance and similarly over here when we were in booking the odd color with respect the p three instance the self attribute was off the B three Instance this how we can add parameters to our methods and invoke them through our objects Now let's head onto an important concept and object oriented programming which is inheritance What comes to mind when you hear the word inheritance So simply put inheritance basically means that when something acquires the property's off someone else's are something else is right So let's say you are inheriting your features from your father or you are inheriting the land or the property from your answer stores right so it could be materialistic inheritance Or it could be the features all the looks from your appearance fruit so inheritance is basically acquiring properties from another person or another thing And when it comes to object oriented programming that pretty much means the same thing Over here you will have two classes are more than two classes One class inherits the features or the property's off another class And that is pretty much the concept off inheritance and object oriented programming So let's again head back to Egypt a notebook and start with inheritance Sure inheritance Over here I just create an extension of the original class So our elders I will create our new class and I'll name this class as iPhone And this iPhone will be inheriting from the these class phone which we had created earlier Right So this is the base class and this new class iPhone would be inheriting from this B's class No this would have one extra method which is cure cancer Now As you know iPhone is already famous and its females because it can I click your cancer so doctors why it cost so much So that is amazing isn't it So your cancer I'll given those self attribute and then I'll just print out I can cure gun So So I have created this new class Now let me create an instance of this so I be one equals iPhone So I have created the instance Now let me go ahead and in Logan methods But as you can see this class for this instance of the class has the methods add color and art course Now even though I have not explicitly stated these methods inside this cars they are still a part off this class because it is inheriting from the bees class which is fighting And since these two methods are part of the beast class I can automatically invoke these two classes So let me a sign off color to this phone So the collar off iPhone is Greek Now I'll go ahead and also said in cost So I p one dog on cost and the cost of five poon would be let's see $899 and then let me involved a method which is Ah only there in the iPhone class So I'd be one dog cure cancer All right so I can cure cancer right So this is how inheritance walks and biting right So we're done with object oriented programming as well Now we'll go ahead and work with some packages in biting so well Sarah Fido numb by package number basically stands for your medical python and is the school library for New American Scientific computing So that's too much off information So simply put numb by basically has a multi dimensional Eric Now to process those multi dimensional areas you have certain functions on you have certain operations pre built in the number I package on That is how you can work with these numb by multi dimensional Cherries so you can perform all sorts of new medical and scientific operations on this number So let's go to Jupiter notebook on dhe walk with this very famous package or less number So start working with the number library who have to first imported so you'll type in import numb by us And this is just an alias so that I can keep in walking this package whenever I need Right So N P is the alias Now before you can actually go ahead and work with this library you'd have to install it so you install it Since we're working with Anaconda let me open this up right Pseudo install this you'd have to type in Pip in stall number Right But they're gonna feel walking with Anaconda numb pipe on dollars in my lower lip All of these company installed in and conduct But then again if you're working with by chum or if you're working with any other python I d Then you'll have to manually installed Mumbai All right so in Mumbai as already in Seoul and I have six really important number into my system now it's time to go ahead and create my first multi dimensional Eric So once you install them by and you invoke the library you have to create a numb by Eric and you can create both a single dimensional area as well as a multi dimensional in them by So do create a numb piper Laurie you just have to type in n p dot Eric have a little U N P is beast leader Elia's Phanom bicycle type in N B Dart Harry And this basically takes in a list off values or a list off list to create a single dimensional area of what you Louis you will pass in a list inside this NP dart airy and this will give you a number I Similarly to create a multi dimensional array you will pass in a list off Lis Right So this is one list and inside this you've given to list right So the first list comprises off elements 10 2030 and 40 and the second less comprises off the elements 40 30 20 and 10 So let's go ahead and create our first numb by race So why create a single dimensional number Hurry first So let me just add in this comment single dimensional numb by area So as I've only told you to create a number I really would have to type in and be dog Harry And inside this I'll give it a list off values Let's see the list off Values are 10 2030 40 and 50 So I'll die Bend for zero over here and fighting over here And I'll store this you know new readable on name that variable eyes and one Now let me print out and one over here So this is our number I worry not Let me also check the type to be sure So type off anyone and this shows is that this is so numb by nd hurry or n dimensional Eric let's go ahead then create a multi dimensional area So I'll diaper and multi dimensional So we're here I'll be storing this value and and do so and b Dawg very hard to keep in mind that you passing a list off list So here So I create one list and inside this I create the first sub list on the values would be 10 2030 And then I create another sub list the values I'm giving our 30 20 and 10 No let me print out and do so This is my my D dimensional area which comprises off to rules and three columns So the force through comprise off 10 2030 And the second rule comprise off 30 20 and 10 Not gonna let me check the type of this so type off and do so type off and do it again Numb by and dimensional Eric And this is how we can create numb by Aries and biting So guys this is just a starting and you can do a lot of stuff with these numbers areas All right I will go ahead and see How can we initialize er number I agree with all CDU's So let's say if we want to create up simple rule Ari which comprise off two zeros then we have this zeros matter So impede or zeroes you are invoking this heroes my third from the number I package when you type in numb So when you type in n p dot zeroes and then you have to give in the dimensions offered So the dimensions of the number area one cross too And then you'll get this Similarly If you want to create a fight cross fight numb by re which comprise off only zeros then just type in and p dot zeros and inside the actual given the values So let's initialize are numb by David Zeroes Over here I'll type in End one and then and B Dawg zeros So I want those size of the number I hurry to be one cross too and then I'll print this out right So how successfully created my numb by area off dimensions One cross two which means one wrote two columns and the values are just zeros now Similarly I'll create an aluminum via race Oh and one equals np dot zeros and I want us to be Oh let's see six across six Numb by early which comprise off only zeros Again let me print in the value of end one Right So I have created this number area which is often mentioned Six Cross six and it comprise off only zeros Similarly let's see if you want to initialize the number I agree with those same number So this is where we have the full method from Mumbai So we have to type in and be doubtful and the stakes into parameters The food's perimeter is their dimension of the number theory and the second perimeter is the value with which you would want to fill up your number Over here I am creating a number Hurry off dimension to cross to and the value which I'm filling it up with this number 10 So let's create this So I'll name the size and one again and I'll type in and we dot full Are you in the dimension I want to create a three cross three numb by Harry and I won't do fill it up with the number seven on Then let me put in doubt and one over here So we have created this three cross three numb by river All of the elements are just seven again We can initialize are numb by a Reno differently So if you want to initialize are numb by a riveter particular every engine mind So let's say I want my number IRA to be filled with all of the values from 10 to 20 So basically the interval as the one on the skiff value is one will have 10 11 12 13 14 15 going on until 19 right So I want to fill up my numb by a repeater particular range So this is how I can do work now another formers I basically give us skip value So when we don't give the third perimeter a range or dramatically peaks the skip perimeter us one So when we look at the second example over here the range is basically from 10 2 50 But the skip value is fight So your first number would become 12th numbers 15 20 And then this goes on until 45 You have to keep in mind that this last number which you see this is exclusive It is not inclusive So when you are five more to 45 if it is less than 50 only then you'll get the last value If it is equal to or greater than 50 then you will not get that value All right so let's go ahead and initialize on them by a with the particle range So again I'll type in and one So this would be and B dawg the range on inside this I will be sleeping in the range with which I want this number IRA to be filled with So I want us to be filled starting from one going on till 11 And then let me bring this out Right So this number I read the value started one and Gwendolyn then now similarly let me create an aluminum by hurry with those specific skip value So N one equals and B dawg a range on dhe Let's see I want the range to be from 100 going on 300 I want to skip value to be equal Do 50 So let me just print out and one now right So this is my number so 100 as the starting value to fifties The last rally Skip values 50 So that's why I get 101 5200 and 50 And when you add 50 more 22 50 it becomes 300 And since 300 is not inclusive that is why you will not have that number over there Now let's see how convenient relies on them by A with random numbers So if you're to initialize our empire with random in Bi Jo's then we've got this rand in sub matured from the random mattered So again you will set the range off the numbers from which you want the random numbers over here right The range of the numbers is one and 100 So starting from one going on Bill 100 you will juice fight random numbers So let's go to Jupiter notebook and walk with this So n one equals NP dart Random dog grand and and then inside this Let's see I want 10 random values and the values should be coming in the range between 102 100 So I want 10 random values let me print out and one right so these other 10 random values between 102 100 so That was how we good initialize our number Irene A lot off different trees Now let's see How can we check the sheep off are numb by on it Checking the sheep off our number IRA would be sleeping the number off rules and number of columns present in the Mumbai So all you have to do is create a number area first and then use this shape mattered So we use the sheep method This will tell you the number of fruits and number of columns present in this name by area Now with the help of this ship mattered you can actually change the sheep off your number on it So initially when you're initializing it this numb pie very hard to rules and three columns But with the help of this ship method you can change it to three rules and two columns So let's call it a paternal book And let's see this visually so again and one And let me create in them by early or here And B dog Harry let me give in some values So let's see one do three and four on dhe actually have to give him the list off lists So let me got those sand beast inside this and then my second sub list would be 567 and eight So I have created and one over here let me check the sheep and one dog sheep So the shape of this number areas to cross for this would mean we have two rules and four columns And this numb by Harry that would basically amount to eight Now it's enough to cross food I want this number I agreed to be off the ship full cross to Or in other words I don't have four rules and two columns so I'll have to do is type in and be dot sheep equals four Cross do So this is done Now let me print out and one right So initially this was our and one hurry which was off the sheep across four and then be reshaped it Now this is how it looks like now once you know how to initialize a numb by reason howto check the sheep off when the empire is let's go ahead and perform some simple mathematics on top of these numb by Perry's So we look at some basic addition operations Soto are too numb by a race We will just use those some function from the numb by package So here I am creating to numb by race and won and and do And when I use those some method over here I'll person anyone and do as a list Right So this will add all of these individual elements from both of these numb by fairies So when you add 40 30 20 and 10 it will give you a complete value of 100 Now you can also said the access that you don't set the access than it will add all of the individual elements which are present So when you said access to be equal to zero then it actually does work Tickle addition right So what I mean by what pickle relish Innis It would add the individual elements off each index about this Terry So Index zero over here for and one and two When you add 10 plays 30 it would become 40 and that is what you have Similarly when you come to index number one and you add 40 plus 20 you get 60 And that is where you have now instead of access to be equal to zero When you said the access to be equal to one you basically are doing horizontal addition doctors You are something of the values which are present in one individual number library So here then plus 20 becomes 30 And that is what you have and would hear when you add to a D plus 40 and become 70 and that is what we have over you All right so let's go to Jupiter Notebook and perform these methods So let me create a new name by three I'll call it E over here so it will be and be Dog Harry and I'll pass in our list off values over here That would be then and Wendy And then I'll create another onem by Harry's Wild I pinned and be dogged area again and the values inside this would be 30 and 40 So I have successfully created my duodenum Buyer is now going ahead Let me use some methods so it would be and be dart some and inside this I'll just parson e comma be which are basically than them by a race which I've created And I got a complete value off 100 Now let me go ahead Dan said The access so n v dot some I type in e comma Be on then let me said the access who I am sitting though access to be equal to zero And when I said the access to be equal to zero as we have already seen we have vertical additional here So 30 plus 10 gives you 40 and 40 plus two antique soup 60 All right No let me go ahead then said the access to be equal do one So I'll pass in a coma Be on dhe I said the access to be equal to one right so 10 plus 20 becomes 30 and 40 plus 40 becomes 70 So those were some basic addition operations on top of the numb by worries Now let's see how can we join Different number varies So we're basically God thes different methods We've got restock which stands for were tickle stock than we've got Head stack which stands for horizontal stack and then we got Gollum stack So when it comes to restock what we do is we join these numb pi r is true wise so over here we have to win Umpire race and Won and Anto And when we use the stack mattered upon thes to numb by Parise We are basically joining thes tune Umpire is otherwise Then we have the head stock function So when it comes to head stag function we are combining these two numb piras call advice So Nesic column vice We will take in this first number library and then will that That's the second number I hurry to the back and off this Then we have column stack very basically taken to single dimensional lump I worries And then we stagger them calling vice to create a two dimensional So as we see over here we've got to wonder missionaries right to end one and then two And when I used column stack on top of this island two dimensional area over here these two are stag Call on vice All right so let me go ahead and use thes three functions So let me create and one over here So and one is a will do And the dog Harry on Let me given the value stand 20 and Cody then and you would be equal do and be dot Harry and the values inside this would be let's see 30 40 and 50 So I have created and won and now it's time to use We stack on top of them so I'll type in and be dogged We stuck and inside those sile parson and one on do So let me get the result right So I have horizontally So I have a stag These two columns otherwise now similarly instead off the stock let me use horizontal stack So I die Pin head stack over here right So when I use head stock I get the saw him horizontally stacking He's too numb by race And then finally let me use and v dot column Stack on and I'll person and one and then do on Dhe I have taken these two individual single dimensional areas for 10 2030 30 40 50 and have stabbed them calling vice to create a new dimension them by Right So this brings us to the end of this number I model Now let's go ahead and walk with another interesting package in fighting which is find us So panda stands for final later and it is the core library for determining police unit leader analysis So as numb by provides us my d dimensional Harry Similarly bond US provides a multi dimensional deal a structure for performing various data manipulation operations So it provides us both or a single dimensionally a structure and a multi dimensional deal a structure So as we see over here the single dimensionally a structuralist call as the series object and the multi dimensional structures called as the deed after him and well mostly working with the data streams and biting so dear friends become extremely important when it comes to deal assigns operations So all of the machine learning algorithms which you apply linear regression logistic regression decision free and so on All of these are applied on the dreams and this is because all of the deed assets which you have all the CIA's we files which you have text files which you have they can be converted toward the stream and fightin and all of the manipulations can be done on the state of him All right so let's start off in the bond our series object So so as you see or hear or serious object is basically a one dimensional labeled area So the difference between this and the num Piper areas when it came to the number I agree it was not legal but the series object is a one dimensional labeled area And that's how you can create a series object So before we go ahead and create a series Object Force would have to invoke Go bond us library So we'll type in import pond as SPD and Petey again Over here is just an alias for pond us So after being broke ponders will type NPD dot series So what You you have to keep in mind that s s Capitol and inside this well personal last 1234 and five And we have created this series object So let me start off by importing pond a soiled diaper and import fund as our speedy So the ministry tell this packet is loaded So that was done Now again since I'm using Anaconda Bond us comes preinstalled in it So if you have to manually installed find us this is what you have to do open up and conduct roamed and then you'd have to type in installed find us So once you do that bound us will be installed All right So I have important the pond A slavery Now let me go ahead then create my full series object So I named the subject as s one and I'll type in BD dot CDs And inside this I'll be sleep arsenal list So the list would comprise off the value stand 2030 40 and 50 So let me print and as one over here So this is my series object So as you see over here these are the values and these values are off type Indy Joe 64 So indeed your 64 bit and these are the labels associated with each of these values So zero as the label associated with 10 1 is the label associated with 22 with the level associate with 30 She can either call these index values or the labels associated with these numbers So you must be thinking that Is there a bee that we can actually change the index off or panda Siri's while you can So all you have to do with include this index attribute and then give the labels which you want for these So as you see over here initially the labels who's you know 123 and four now After that you just use this index attribute and then change these values to A B C D and E Right So let's perform thus So let me go ahead and add the next to this So as you see or hear initially the labels were 0123 and four Now let me go ahead and change the index So this time I'll said though index to be a B C D On dhe Eat now let me print out as one So as you see over here these were the initial in next values and I have changed them Do these over here so we start to clear the CDs object from or less Now let's see How can we clear the CDs object from a dictionary So as you see over here we'll just pass in this dictionary inside the Siri's object And one thing to note over here is if you don't specifications said the index values the key automatically becomes the index and the values would automatically become the actual values inside the series object So I re treated the keys would become the index values and the values would become the actual values off the series object So let me clear Door dictionary over here So the one and uh I'll said the key to be equal to K one and the value to be Then then I'll said the key to be gay too And the valuables 20 than Ke aes Key three and it US toady I have created the dictionary Now again let me go ahead and create the CDs are this so BD dot Siri's and I'll pass in the dictionary inside this and I'll store this in s one So let me print out this one again Right So this is my Siri's object which has been created from this dictionary So as we see over here the keys have become the index values So Ki won ki duk e three other index values and 10 2030 other actual values of the series object Right So that was all about the single dimensional data structure series No one here under the most important data structure and bison which is indeed out for him So other than stated over him A date A famous beast Clear two dimensional label data structure under comprise off rules and columns So that's where you see So you've got three rows over here and two columns over here And normally when it comes toward the tough for him all of the elements inside one column would have those same type So as you see this is the name and the names are normally string So Bob is a string Sam is a string and on a string right And then we've got Mark's So Marxist another individual column And when you look at the values inside this Marks column you see that 76 25 92 all of these are in PGA values right So this is our data from looks like and to create a data for him This is how you can do it So all you have to do issues the p d dot the tough really mattered And then you can create it from a dictionary over here right So the key becomes the column name over here and these values become the true values over here So let me create a deal A frame So I'll name the street after him A student and the first column would actually be the name of the students So I'll diaper and student name So this is actually the key And then I'll give him the list off values So the list off values would be Bob and then the God Sam after that with God Julia and then with God Charles So these other student names and then the on Then let's go ahead and given some box to the students So I really create the next key which would be student marks So I'll die friend student marks over here and then I'll given a list off values So let's see Bob has scored 87 and Sam has scored only 30 marks Then we've got Julia who has scored an impressive 99 then we've got Charles who has scored an average 67 so I have successfully created this dictionary Now it's time to create a deal for him or this dictionary so I'll dive in be the dart to the Gulfstream and inside this I just have to pass in this dictionary I can run and I have successfully created the steel frame where the tea over here becomes the column name and the's list off values for a particle Erkki become the rule values for that column So Bob Sam Julia and Charles are the list off values or the rule values for this key student name which is the column name Similarly 87 13 99 and 67 other rule values for this key student marks So now that we know how to create or deal off him let's go ahead then perform some inbuilt functions on top of this deal after him So we'll be working with this basic functions Just tail had sheep and describe So walk with all of those and build functions will start by reading or CS We file as our data for him first so I'm gonna let me but from the basic steps so I'll type in import bond as a speedy Now you look to see if we file I'd have to type in BD dot read underscore CS Week and inside this out after giving the name of the fight So we'll be walking with this iris dot CS we file on Duh I'll be storing this in a new object and I'll call it object as Iris So now I would have a glance at the first fire records off this Irish dude after him to have a glance of the forest fire records I'll just type in iris dot head right So I've got this first fire records of the deed offering Let's understand the state of him properly So this has got fi columns which are basically CEPAL int separate battleland battle within species So these are basically the different features off the species off the iris plot So I've got three different species said Joseph Warsi Color and War Jessica And for all of these three different species we've got the CEPAL and separate battle lengthen pedal right So as we already saw were here the head function helps us to have a glance at the first fight records for this detail For him if I were to have a glance of the first then records then I'll have to do is type in 10 inside this head function Then we'll have a glance of the 1st 10 records of the state offering right And if I want to have a glance that Let's see the 1st 100 records Then I'll just type in Ida's daughter Head 100 Right So these are the 1st 100 records by though in next value starts at zero and that goes on till 99 Now I love us to the head function We also have the tail function so I'll type and Iris Dart deal Now the stale function would give me the last five records off the state after him So the starts it in next number 1 45 and goes on till index number 1 49 Similarly if I would have a glance in the last 10 records then I'll just pass And then over here right So these other last 10 records of this Ira street off him now these other head and tail functions There is also this describe function So I just type and describe over here on let the seawater does over here So this would be Scully described this entire data frame in terms off all of these different measures So we've got count So this count is basically the number off records present for each of these different columns so that our 1 50 records for several and similarly 1 54 separate worth by the land and brutal word All right so these obviously though different count values off all of these columns and then we've got the mean value So this is the mean value off supple and supple worth better length and Gretel bread And similarly we've got the minimum value standard value 25 percentile maximum value and so one So these are some basic functions which can be implemented on top of any d w So now going ahead we'll see how you access individual Druze and columns Ramadi tough ring So to do that we've got the eye lock and the loc methods So let's start with the I lock matter So Force will give in the name of the data for him and then we'll just type in dot i l O c So this dark I'll obviously stands for index location And this is how we can extract some specific cruise and columns from this entirely different So here what we're doing us We are extracting the 1st 3 records from this data for him and the 1st 2 column straight So the index values go from 0 to 3012 And then the call and values are zero to write to zero and one CEPAL lengthen separate So they said we can extract a subsidy off the data stream from this and I did it for him So now let me again print out the head of this so Iris Start head This is my data for him over here Now let's say I want a subsection which comprise off the room numbers starting from Let's in 99 on going on tell 1 26 and I want only the Bright Island and the battle were to call him So to do that I'd have to type in Iris and then I'll type in Lucy Are you giving this Square Braces were here I'll put in a comma Now whatever you give in on the left side off the com a doctor would denote all of the rules which would want to extract And whatever you put in on the right side off the commandant would denote all of the columns which would want to extract So as I've said that room numbers was able to extract our from 99 to 1 26 So indexing will start from 99 go till 127 and then the call and value should be 012 and three So the signal from 2 to 4 So I just put him to do for over here and I'll store this in a new data for him And I learned that to be Iris one So let me print out Iris one over here right So this is our data from Iris one which comprise off only the columns by Dylan and Petal Word Right And the room number start from 99 Cornell 1 26 now Similarly let's say if I want to extract all of the records starting from room number 10 and going on telephone number 20 And I warned on lead these two columns to assemble and column and the species called him So let me show you guys how it's done So this time I'll named it after him as Irish stew and I'll Die pin Iris start I will type in I lock over here and this would go from 10 to 21 after this I will just given the column value so again I will be in a list over here and inside this I've given the index although First column which is basically zero And then I'd given the index off the final column were just four over here I look on run on let me print out Iris to war here Right So this is my subsection of the end I date after him there I have through number starting from index number 10 going on until the next number 20 And these other two countries have extracted to separate and then species So this is how I can work with I lock matter then I love us too Though I lock method we also have the lock method to extract individual rows and columns So the only differences and to love giving the index values over here be given the labels off the columns over here Right So here when it comes to roost will similarly given though index values of the rules And over here when it comes to columns I will give him the names of the columns So let's work with I Look now let me print out the head again Iris dot Head Right So This is my date after him Over here on this time I warned all of the records starting from room number 33 going on let's say 44 Andi I store this on iris three So this will be iris dot loc And inside this this has to go from 23 to 44 And then the names of the columns which I will extract would be separate Burton But a word Now you have to keep in mind that you given the column names properly right So if you make a spelling mistake then there would be an error over you so I'll type in separate on Then I'll give in the name of the next column which is basically battle word Now let me print out the subsection so I just print in Iris three Right So these are all the records starting from tau number 33 going on till rule number 44 And those other two columns have extracted Several were 10 petals All right So you know what We did this We extracted some individual rules and columns with the help off dot lock and dart loc But now well actually perform data manipulation operations where we'll be extracting records on the basis off condition So let's go out and do that now The condition which I won't specify Yes I want only those records from the state as it were The separate length is greater than five So let's see How can we do that So first I give in the name of the deed offering which is Iris and I'll put in code So here and then I'll give in the name of the column which is basically CEPAL And so I want to extract only do with records where the separate length is greater than five So I will be speaking on condition that the supple and has to be greater than five Now let me click on Ron and let's see what do we get So obviously got a bunch off true and false values Now what does this mean So this means that wherever you have the true label this condition has been satisfied and wherever you have the false label this condition has not been satisfied So we have the true label for the zero it record over here and that is because the separate length is greater than five Similarly we have a true value over here And that is because the separate length is greater than five Right So wherever you have the true value that is where you have the supple and to be greater than five Now we've done this Let's go ahead to the next part where we actually have to extract those records Now we just have a bunch off True and false values Extract the records again I'll type in Iris I really given Praecis I will guard this and I will be Is this inside this iris data for him So what I'm doing us I will be extracting only does records where this condition evaluates to True I'll take on run right And this is what we have Now if you look at the CEPAL end Colum then you'll see that all of these values are greater than five So what will be excluded us First we started off by giving the condition and then we put in this condition again inside this iris to get after him So this give us only those records where this condition was satisfied Right now let's go ahead and perform similar operations So this time I want only does records where battleland is greater than two and the species is equal to war Jessica So let's check that out So let me got this first and given the condition So the first condition would be Iris And then we wonder off Battleland to be greater than two So I'll type in battle underscore length and this has to be greater than do No I will includes this within round brackets After that I will give in the end operator because I want both of these conditions to be satisfied So I'll go ahead then given the second condition So the second condition Iris on dhe this time the name of the columnists species So this has to be equal Do I was gonna go so I just said Raji Nick over here All right so these other two conditions now I will gut this out and again I'll type in Iris and beast it inside this and I will store this in our new deal A free man named that to be Iris Finally Now let me check the head of this So iris final dart head Right So we see that we have extracted only those records where the battleland is greater than two Right So here you see Patel and is greater than two and the species equal towards Unica So we have given multiple conditions to extract these records Similarly as many conditions as possible you could give 234 or five as many conditions as you want So let's complicate this a bit on well given three conditions over here So this time I wonder separate lent to be greater than six CEPAL worth to be greater than three and battle went to be also greater than three So let's given all of those three conditions and let's see what do we get So I will type in Iris and my first condition would be separate Lent has to be greater than six I'll put in braces and this is my first condition After that I'll give in the end operator and then given those second condition I'll type in Iris And the simple word has to be greater than three so wild type in CEPAL world This has to be greater than three tonight given the final condition which is basically the better land has to be greater than six So Iris on then I'll give in better length over here This has to be agreed to Then six Let me got all of this Let me taste it inside this All right So I have given my three conditions over here Let me get this entire thing out Let me type in IRAs over here and I'll be sitting over here All right I will store the Seine Let's say iris random So this would become Iris Random dog head Right So we have these records where they're separate lenders Greater than sex The supple workers realer than three The petal length is greater than three And the better length is real Then six Right now let me actually remove this head and let's see how many actual record satisfy this So see that we are only three records Are these 150 records where these three conditions are satisfied doctors The separate lentils were than six The petal worth is greater than three And the petal length is greater than six Right So these were some different data manipulation operations which we could perform when the iris t does it so that was data manipulation Now we'll head onto data visualization and perform data visualization biting Try to serve packets called us my blood lip And with the help of my clock lip you can create beautiful graphs such as Bob Lord Scatter plots hissed a grams and a lot more So let's go to Jupiter Notebook and who work with these graphs So we'll start by importantly by plot sub model from though my problem library So I'll type in from my Lord Lib I'm bored five Florida's Bld So I have imported this and we also have to create some numb by areas So for that purpose I would not have to import Mumbai So I'll die pin import numb by as and so we have important the required models So now that we have the required packages are first plot which will be making is a line plot So create this line plot we would require X end Why values So let me start by creating the X values so X would be equal to and B dawg the range And I want the value starting from one and going go until then All right so let me just bring this out first So I've got my ex values ready Now let me also create my y value So why would be equal dude two times off x So let me also print out why So I also have my why values Really Now it's time to finally make the line plot So make a line Claude All we have to do us type and b l d Dark Lord So this blog is beast leader Alliance for this by plots of mortal Now whatever plots you're making start all of them you'll be making with this pipe lots of model and make a line plot you will be using This Lord mattered from the reality sub model So you'll just put in this round braces over here and then you'll pass in the X And why values as the initial Param it does You'll type in X comma Why Over here After that just type in b l d dot shoe Go on run And then you successfully have created your first visualization Now isn't this a beautiful line plot So over here what we basically have is the X axis This is the why access right So when you have the X value to be equal to the vie value as four when you have the X value to be equal to four the value has eight And there is word this line plot is telling you now Will this be even better if we are Title X label Lando while able to this So let's go ahead and do that So let me at the title So at the title you have to type in B l T Door title and let's say the title which I'll be giving this a CZ line Blood Now let me give it the X Axis label so this would be really dot exe level and I'll just simply put in ex access over here Now let me also put in the wild label so I'll type in Realty Door Y label on dhe Inside this I'll type in Why access Right So we have part of the title we have out of the X axis and we have also added the why access Now let's say I want to change the collar off this line so I don't really like blue Maybe I want green color or red color So how do I do it So over here So I would have to go inside this main function which is P l d dot Lord and I will use the color at reviewed and I will set the color So I want us to be green so I'll just type in green over here Right So now I have changed this color green Similarly five wonders to be orange I can just type in orange over here and the color becomes orange Now I can also play with the line Were tender lines style offered So I just type in lying right Where were you on Let me send it to be equal to Let's say it Do let me go on run So let me get on with this underscore over here Right So I have increased the line We're so to make it more obvious let me make it five over here Right So this has become thicker so you can give it whatever value you desire I'll given 50 right now This has become quite Thank you So let me change it Back to do you seems quite good for this No I can also change the line style of this so I'll type and line style Andi I'll set the line style to be equal Do Colin So when you put in Colin this is what you get Right So you have a dashed line over here So this how you can basically creator line plot right So first you will type in realty dot plot and then you will give in the X values and the Y values offer that if you want to describe the plot more you cannot the title you can have the x label and also why label So let's say if you also want to add a great to this so all you have to do is certain bld dart grid So this has to be small g over here and you'll just type in true inside this right So you have also added up create So this So this is how you can either line block Now let's say I want to add two lines inside this one single blood So where Louis I will actually add one more Why value So my why I want us to x over here Similarly I'll also create why do so I'll set Why do Toby equal do three x So let me print out Why Ron as well as why do Right So this is why one and why do so I will be making two large store here So first is with respect to why one and X next would be with respect to y two and X right So now we have two lines over here to distinguish them Let me give it a different color over here Let me change their studio Let's see back to blue again Right So this is a line which the notes why is equal to three X And that's the line Which the notes Why is it called a U X So this was a line plot Now let's go ahead and create a bar plot so I'll type and I just given to come into your bar large You create this bar plot I would need a dictionary first So let me again name this dictionary to be student Over here on Dhe I'll have some names of students and the marks of the students So let's see the first student as Sam Agan and he has scored 30 then the God Bob who has scored 50 on Dhe Finally the God Julia who has scored 70 So we have created this dictionary over here Once the stationery is done I'll have to extract the keys and store it into a separate really well and extract the values and store into a separate variable So I'll take this new variable called as names and I will extract only the keys offered now Once I do this I would need the list off the keys because the lot because the Peel Didot bar function only takes a list off values I got this and I'm piecing this inside this similarly also extract the value so ill So I'll be storing garden the marks object again Let me do the same thing So this will be student dart values So let me print out names and marks over here first names and then I've got marks So I have extracted the names and then I've also extracted the marks not to make a bar floor Titus after type and B L D Dart bar So first I would have to give in the categorical values which are stored in names And then I'd have to give in the corresponding numerical values with respect to those categorical values which are stored in marks Let me also put in really the dart show over here right So this is my bar Lord So this graph basically tells me that there are three students forced us some who has scored 20 marks Then that is Bob who escort 70 marks And then there's Julia who has scored 70 marks Now again if I want to change the color of this part I'll have to do is use this color attribute and give it a different color So let's see I want to give it Yeah so I'll set yellow over here right So I've changed the color again If I were to give the X Axis label you access label and the title it does the same process again So I'll type and b a d dot title over here Andi I give the title Eyes marks off Students offered our tiles in the X axis label So P l D dog X label on DDE that would be equal to names off students on DDE we l d dot Why label which would be equal Do just marks right So Marshall Students is a title Marks is the Y Axis label on number and names of students is of X axis leaving again If I would add a good that will be be LD dot great on dhe id Have to just set in True over here Right So this is my bar blood There's also something known as a horizontal bar Blood What Here we have these bars tagged award tickly barred and said If you want to see these bars horizontally then we have this bar hedge function from the by plot model So the only difference which will have to do us instead off realty dot bar We just have to put in real d dog bar hatch And when you do this this is what you get So initially these bars who stag Particularly now when you use bar hedge these bars are stacked horizontally Now let's go ahead and create a scatter plot Let me out the comment over here All right so first I'll go ahead and our Kate to less over here so I'll name the force list as X again and I'll give in a bunch of random values Oh you So I'll take in Let's say six random values So 12345 on Dhe six Now Similarly I'll take one of the last style named Toby Why Ron Now you have to keep in mind that you Diego seem number off values and X and Y because of a scatter plot It basically gives you or point for a specific position off X and Y coordinates Right So again I'll give in some random sex value So 9126 on dhe four and nine again So we've got the X end Why Values ready now to make a scatter plot all you have to do is just type and b l d dot scatter and then passing the X and the Y values And this is what you have to let me also add Big red So really dot grid I'll make it to be true Right So this is what you have So this is the first point where the X coordinate as one and the y coordinate as four right So this is the point which it does denoting And then we have got three Comotto So three commode to would be this point than we've got 4949 would be this point Right So this is our scatter plot Looks like Now let's see if you wanted to pick two different point teams on those same scatter plot than all you have to do us create a new list So I name this to be Why one I said it Toby Why one over here Let me again create our new list Which is why I do let me give in a bunch of random values again So 478126 Right So I've got my bunch of six values over here Let me create another sky deployed over here So this time it will be with respect to X and why you and I will give it a different color so the color would be red All right So I have added to a different team point on those same graph over here Now let's get on to the next plotting which is Oh hissed a gram So Mr Graham basically helped us to understand their distribution Off continues column So for this will be actually loading Though I Z That's it again and understand the distribution or some of the continent's columns off that day does it So again I little bit he does it So I will type and speedy dot read c s we And now I'll give in the name of the file which is irs dot CS week and I'll store this and Iris again All right so let me have a glance at the head of this again So ira start head Right So this is our day Does it Now I want to understand the distribution off this CEPAL length column So for that or Lewis be lt dot make a history Graham we've got this hist function and inside this I just given the name of the column So Iris and I'll give in the name of the column were just separate lint And then I'll just put in B l d dog show So this is the history ma'am And this truce is their distribution off this separate length column Now to increase the distribution off these bins over here they've got the bends attributes Why the stipend Vince So let's say I want to when deepens so I'll just type in bins So I just said the immense value to be called a 20 the inference which we can draw from this plotters So that's if you take this particular been over here than this tells us that there are around 16 records where the CEPAL land off the flowers exactly around five Then we've got this over here So this been tells is that there are again around 16 records with a separate lettuce 6.5 And if you take this been over here so there are very very few recalled So this would be Let's say there's just one record by the CEPAL Enter somewhere between 7.5 indeed So again if you take this been so that would be around four records or there are just four flowers who separate lent US 4.5 So this is the sort of influence which we can draw from artist a gram and the basic difference between oh hissed a gram and a bar floaters So our bar plotters used to understand the distribution off a categorical Buble while hissed A gram is used to understand the distribution off continues really well now Similarly if I want to understand the distribution off Let's see Tell word So I changed this over here and I just put in But it's worth right So this is the distribution off battle word So there are around 34 records who is spittle where it would be somewhere around 0.2 or 0.3 So those constitute a lord of florist right And if you take this been over here so there would be just one recorder There's just one floor rather Patel worth a 0.5 And this seems to be the maximum battle word which is around 2.5 So though maximum by tell world off 2.5 they're around fire records Right now let's again understand a distribution off CEPAL worth So I'll change this and I'll just put in simple over here right So we have Ah big beak over here So there are 20 fi records where those simple worth street on there's less And there is just one regard Who Cepal Where it would be around 4.3 or 4.4 Right So this is history Graham So now we'll go ahead and make some box plots so box plots are used to understand the distribution off How does one continues variable change with respect Oh a categorical value And again we'll be billing box plots on this Isaiah said So I'll type in Iris died Box blood on this basically has stew perimeter So the force para meter is the column who are well assigned the y values or the country news value on the continent value which I'd want to given a separate leant over here So I'll type in separate leant on denial mother categorical value onto the X axis So for this I've got to buy a tribute on dhe They've only got one categorical variable over here right So the species column is the only categorical beauty will which you've got so I'll type in species of you I'll hit on Run on This is the box blood which you get So what you see over here So this line which you see in the middle of this box this is known as the median line This is the 25 percentile line and this is the 75% Thailand Just focus on this median line over here So this tells a start at the species off the floors seducer than the median separate lint off the flower would be around five and again Let's take this box over here So if the species off the flowers were secular than the median CEPAL length would be around 5.9 on will seek this So if those species of the flowers were Tanika than the median CEPAL land over here would be 6.5 So this is the influence which you can draw from a box plot Similarly if I want to understand how this battle worth really with species let me just put in bye till we're through with you right So again we have three boxes over here one box each for the different species of the iris flower So here it seems that the median line would be somewhere over here So though said the species of the florist settles out than the median petal where it would be around up 0.3 or 0.4 than report will see color over years Of those species of the flowers were sick all of them the median battle over It would be 1.2 basic inference is war Janica over here would have the maximum I tell worth And so does I Would have the minimum height L word So that was the same case which we saw with separate Lent as well So what Monica had a maximum Zeppelin and said Oh so hard The Minimum Zeppelin If you want to meet this plot even more beautiful we can use the Seaborne library So let me just import the Seaborne library I'll type and import see von US s anus Then we've got the box Blood mattered from this So s s daughter Bo explored Now where Luis I have all the loaded this Iris D does it so onto the X access I'll be mapping those species called him So Iris Andi I'll type in species and onto the why access I will be scheme at the Zeppelin column So again Iris So the name of the column a separate land right So this is a much more beautiful plot when compacted us again The inference is pretty much there seem All right So where's Nika or here would have the Maximum Zeppelin Although the median separate length would be maximum forward Jessica and the median separate land would remember Sentosa So these other influences with respect to box blood Now will you go ahead and walk with the final plot with respect a visualization which would be a pie chart So before we make this pie chart we have to create two less over here So I'll create first list with the name fruits and Ijust add some names off fruits So fullest fruit as apples that conclude a cz mango than the god orange And then we have God banana over here So I've made the first list and then I will given the cost of fruits over here So I just given some random value So 76 45 90 on Let's give in 85 as well right So I've got the fruits Lestrade and I've also got the cost less ready Now I'll have to do is map thes two indoor by chart so I'll diaper and B l d dot by Andi Inside this I will first mapped the numerical values so I'll type in cause and then I'll map the labels So we've got the labels attributes over here on Dhe for this label's attribute I will map this list to the labels attributes I'm mapping fruits on two labels over here again I'll just click on run So we need this I'll put in P l d Dog Show Right So this is my by chart over here So this basically tells us that the maximum distribution or the maximum percentage is mostly off orange and banana and that is actually true So orange if we see the value is 90 and butter knife received overvalue us 85 If you want the actual percentage we have something known as the Ordo BCD attribute So let me add in the auto PCD attribute over here and I'll put in a single courts I'll put in a person dates symbol on denial Type 0.2 I'll type in earth and then I'll given new person date symbols over here Right So we've got the percentage values over here now where does this exactly mean So this point dubiously denotes the decimal value If I put into over here than this vulture two decimal values Let's see if I just put in one over here then you got one decimal value or here right now I can also add Oh shadow this So I just put in shadow equals true And this is my by child or used to This shows us that the maximum percentage of the fruits belongs to orange We've got 3.4% and then record banana 28.7 followed by apple and then the least us mango Now let's see if I want to increase the size off this blood So we have something on SB LD dot figure I'll type and really don't figure And inside this we've got the attribute fig size So I'll given the value six Come out six over here Right So I have increased the size of this now Similarly let's say instead of six come on sex I put in then Come on then Then this would be enlarged even more Right So this is our final by blood All right So guys the string goes to the end of the visualization model So this brings us to the end of this python tutorial I hope that you've comprehensively learned all of the concepts Really talk about the new levels It automatically means it's artificial neural networks Okay so my object illustrates Ah session is I'll introduce you to deeply religious on to do so I'm first taken through the history behind this big new leaf book What exactly happened One of the limitations of this very early prototypes which they came out with on how did it all evolve And today why is it such a popular Why's it so popular That everything that you see today you Racine Alexa you're a sin city Us in Google assistant Last week I was in China on board The writing was in Tamil I couldn't understand anything There was this guy foreigner He just pointed this theme of elected and he went away He knew what the message was And I'm still waiting for the musical that is online Real time language translators You point a phone towards it Translated into English All these technologies are based on this algorithm Called it a little They're variants off deepness Littles Of course we have such for example are in and recommend new networks We have something called LSD in long short term memory So down the line you'll come across all these things very interesting field but it in just a lot of power popularity But the power can be a boon And being both you miss applied it'll completely mislead you So before you build your models and trying to put these models in the production here to do a lot of testing So welcome to this world of Bittner Lynbrook Before I start on this any questions you have from anything that we're done below Just in case because all these things are connected to each other Heaven linear regression You'll see linear regression coming to play heroes You're gonna logistical regulation all the you'll see logistic also come into play in this not directly indirectly logistic curve you're seeing logistical It's also called Cigarette Girl You know the properties of signaling goof What is important range What ISO could reach seen manage function manages cousin off signore It It also looks the same in port is minus infinity plus infinity output This minus one plus one Yep these two functions played a very important role in the history of deep personal effects But today we rarely use these to function than this because of certain limitations of these two functions Yep So we'll understand all those things and we'll start No Before I start once again any question Shoot Otherwise we'll great it is It is an advancement because along with support vector machine this one is the most powerful algorithm available to us in danger since truly still a few years ago If you If this was 2010 for example 2010 not very far back newly troupe was not very popular The reason for that is we didn't have the hardware technology with us Tobe able to implement new really works It is only after cloud computing Then you're big data technologies on your Internet became robust enough All these technologies when they converged did we find the required context in which we've woken you neural networks The results started in 19 for peace so it's not something new It's actually started in 19 forties but during those times they did not have the kind off support required in 19 forties And your little went through a lot of up sandals until 10 4012 where it really started picking up on it left all the algorithms behind because what you're a little can do even support Vector machine cannot no that is also very powerful So this stands on the top followed best Liam in terms off the power to do things followed with the other Well they're very relevant Uh as we speak now there are lost being formulated in Far East on in Europe where the law requires that when you do modeling your model should be white box It means you should be able to explain on the world conditions You took this decision whether the person's gonna churn or not Before before Nunally Book is a black box It'll tell you the result But it looked really why it reached to the country's You're not able to find the book So other undertones of quite relevant If you're working in finance banking insurance well most of the time find the other vehicles especially decision trees It's barely write books right in execution Like any other elder upon This algorithm is also part of Superboy Sling mattered here Also you have X and a Y in the training site Access your independent variables wise You're dependent variable So like any of the algorithm this also tells you what is the relationship with an X and y How ex gets transformed into a way To that extent it's similar to the other algorithms but this algorithm is based on the observations on whole human brains Work on A lot of research was going on in this field on biology Neurology to be precise We're back in the 19 for peace Even today is going on But today any results that is going on in definitely little It's not related to the research going on in biology But in those days these were tightly coupled A lot of information lot of ideas with border from the world of biology into this However today's research whatever We're coming across tree they have nothing to do with politics So you don't need to worry about not knowing biology If you don't know biology The Iwas in those years 19 forties How does the brain work Was a big question even delay Today we don't know how it works but it works It's one of the most powerful computing systems we have If you read all these research papers it's so him It's so having surprising so mystifying How this brain really book We don't know Okay during those two years when the research was going on there trying to understand how this not a little brain The neural network in the brain works The natural nearly broke out with the neurons were hard Is it hold this process the information And during that time some biologists who were also mathematicians they tried to replicate the findings over there and see if we can make the existing computer systems off that time Smart are intelligent and of mimics the functioning of the brain human brain so that we can make this computer systems learn to do things without being told how to do When an infant stands up and walks for the first time it learns how to walk for the first time on its own right so that Iwas can make a computer system learn to do things without the necessary off training it how to do it without telling it how to do it Now To appreciate this you have to go back to the 19 forties where there was no by phone There was no pass school There was no see There was no Java the only language WAAS machine learning zeros and months I'm not sure how many of provoked on machine learning language machine language Sorry machine Not machine really machine language which is the language of zeros and ones Even to act two numbers you have to manipulate the registers shift the registers left and right and do all the things this to our two numbers Now imagine asking that computer to do for you We're very complex Task what kind Of course you'll have to write in that machine language I know I don't know how many If you're seeing this I have seen this myself So I'm not used it in 19 eighties when I was a student as just getting into the Khan signs and all these two have punch cards punch cards with holes in it It's a punch card would look like an invitation card for managing mutation cards in that you will have Collins The columns will have eight rules A presence off a whole indicates of one No hole indicates a zero so Siris of punch cards will be sent into the machine That series of punch cards it's equal it off You writing a program today on the editor This is eighties Imagine more details in for peace All right So uh can we make computers do things for us without the need for writing this machine Kord machine language That is all on dhe doing that research They studied the human neurons They actually took a neuron from one of these animals I don't remember which And I think it's all screwed up something which apparently lives in your script It looks like octopus The reason why they took the neuron from this honest this is the only animal which has the longest in your own biological neural known to man on extracting these neurons putting under a microscope and observing them while they're alive On doing experiment on this what's very difficult us Because the moment you separate a neuron usually within seconds it'll die Are they new on this No Good right So they underwent a lot of these difficulties And while studying those neurons the realist certain aspect off how this neurons work the biological Iran's work Those ideas are carried forward into artificial neurons that they were trying to build to make the company is intelligence Yeah we really don't need to know about these things we don't need But similar concepts is going to come into What is he On the left side is uh very generous representation of biological evidence that they come in different sizes and shapes This is the baby It'll be depicted in books and articles What does he hear The branches these branches are called Jane writes Their objective is to extract from the involvement the information the information coming form of chemical signals or electrical signals It used to use combination of both All the signals accumulate in the center Some something happens in the center I'm not an expert in biology so I don't know what happens But something happens in the center If that's something crosses a very short then the new nonsense A signal forward Tow the subsequent neurons better connected to this new on through the Dane rights by sticking onto this water's cold accent We don't need to know anything beyond this but you're most welcome to go and study these things available on this Ural Yeah now when the implement artificially Iran it was It is also represented like this in block diagram Either it shone as an oval or it soon as a circle This in your own also takes inputs from the environment on the environment in this case will be already different And these imports that are coming into this environment are the various Collins in your do different that computes So the data were red on inserted your own two things will happen It's a two step process The first step is a simple linear addition Why is it going to m one x one plus m two weeks two plus e em one x one plus m two extra plates See that is called simple in your relations When that result of that operation and one ex unpleasantries to Percy when the result of that operation the Y crosses a threshold if it's greater than this fire of one If it's less than this fire is evil That process of checking whether the output is crossing the threshold ir north that is your stepfather So in every new Ron we have the inputs The inputs are summed up over here as the first part There isn't of the summation If it crosses a thresher Nero outputs of one if it doesn't cross the threshold of your own output Zero This concept is nothing exactly the click off what you see in politically roll with imports are processed and the processing crosses a threshold It fires at the voice it doesn't fire on The simple concept is used even Toby Even today when you're working deep neural networks L s team are ardent and everything everywhere The same thing happens Well the thing is they don't you step functions anymore Views other mathematical transformation functions Such a cig more damage or a Lu Ray Lewis rectified Linear units You may not have seen this unless you're from electron ICS right So those functions have replaced the starter function and there's a technical reason for it Even Sigmund and manage are not used anymore But if it really Ray Lewis or the variance of real But whatever it is the structure revenge sissy What it was in 19 forties The same structure remains even today for the neurons The artificial Littles such a such a simple concept First do a linear regression The first part is always a linear regression If the output of linear regression crosses a threshold then the neuron activates If the output of the regulation doesn't cross official the neuronal concezio images using such a simple concept Today Deep Neural Network is able to do natural language processing vision based projects object identification object addiction object tracking Everything is done using So now the natural question is what is it in it that makes it so powerful that it beats other algorithms hands down when it comes to complex data set So when you look at the history off how it all evil Three names jump out Okay three names jump out on those names are basically Rosenblat's neuron which is called Perceptron I'll talk over it down the line on we have a mecha Nope It's near on McCulloh pits where two people uh who actually started the work on this nearly our Egyptian at all Michelob Hope it's Warren Michael Oh and water picks They're a combination of biologists and mathematicians So they're the ones who came out of this concept off a Kardashian it on first but they're in Iran had a very severe limitation That limitation was overcome by rose and black on the Rosenblatts neuron also had a limitation But all those limitations were surpassed They were overcome eventually on to rest near oral artificial It on bothers a lot of ideas from Goes and blacks Nero But it's slightly modified which So what exactly does we'll see that So we call it N c p R Make a low pitch Nero Okay It's depicted using a block Bagram as this where you have a submission You have us state function The inputs come here That was excellent X two And you get the outcrop Okay all if you remember the gates concept the bullion gates in a bull in algebra us rent about this in consigns All our computer systems are based on bull in algebra Even today it is bullying algebra which comes to work at your chip level where all these operations that we do get transformed mission language and in machine language All this operation's actually undergo Boolean algebra Bullen Gates are nothing Burke A presentation off the different kind of logic that we use in our day to day life If suppose I talk about a student on I consider a student as a pass or leave free passes in mathematics physics So if the student has passed in mathematics on dhe passed in physics then his past Overall if the student has passed in mathematics but not in physics Then all is a fail If student has passed not in physics but in Matt's Eliza free Thank you If a student has neither person that's not in physics or Eliza failed whatever he did write these things Which gate is this This is an and gate logic If the storing process of maths or physics cease pas if the student passes and that's become a physics he still pose This is your organ So whatever we do whatever logic that we use in day to day life all those logic that we use in our discussions can be represented as bullion gets Okay so what These people did this They tried to see if a neuron can rebuild that implements that gets the bullion gates first If you're able to implement bullion gates than using a combination off neurons I can replicate the behavioral comes complete assistance on that computer future build Using this neurons it will be able to do things for me without being told how to do it That is objective right So the first thing that the disease can be used Bullen Gates on represent this Make this neurons mimic the bullion gates That is objective So what these people used to do is suppose he won't implement and I'm get on this on gate on gets her two inputs X onyx too So we have 11100100 This is our POTUS one These are old zeros right This is out Now you tell me if I'm going to send here a one and a zero and I'm doing the simple submission of this What is this Some of these two numbers And if I want this tow or put a zero now Okay 10 This is this This is input we have given if I want output zero What should a threshold be Yeah you just ask trick if some is greater than one If the summation of these two is greater than vendor now put the one otherwise output zero So this will happen One leaving These two are once Then you'll get an output of one Simple Yeah Now if I want implement and our gate in this suppose I go for organ X one x two And why and or get organiz 10101 bond and this is 000 knife I won't implement or get What should this special to be Isn't one believe problem greater than equal to one If emit a 11 leaf is greater than equal to one These tools submission is good too These two submissions want these to submission is one If it's one or greater then emit of one Then this new known mimics the behavior son organ by changing the thresholds Here I can make the neutron mimic and and a gate and Aldgate exhorted Gates on support not an ex target There's a reason why it can't be done for except But using this methodology I can make a new deal on mimic Some of these gates agreed But the problem is they're your own It's not learning anything I'm going and fixing the thresholds based on what kind of behavior I want Your honest not letting in it Seven born American law and pitch They came out of this neuron The showed that it's possible it was a good start but not good enough because it required a human intervention on our object Iwas Without your human in division can we make it learn Can I give this data So this new John and the neuron automatically learns that racial that is objected on that It's weird this you don't wanna make make low pitched neurons was replaced by another neuron by Rosenblatt Very famous figure in the world off artifice a little noodle and works He was a fun who demonstrate her It's possible what it is Same structure same structure your take X one Extras input Same submission here also But he introduced the concept of beads which means inside this neuron you dedicate if they're two connections to inputs coming in there to wait's over here which is shown on the link Okay which is shown on the link Two inputs coming here there to us of age associated this link So what this does is M one or doubly one doubly one x one plus w two extra Isn't this familiar to you Simple Any revision Everything Yeah and he also introduced the concept of by us He was the guy who introduced the by ourselves so initialized by us to some value on this was a way to associate with this also So this is the new three So now the question becomes less w three b Okay Bias is a constant fixed value When you multiply the weight with this dignitary working of bias goes into your question If this is saying initialized to 50 that doesn't mean to be considered What comes here is W three indifferently Are you okay This Lena submission is what he introduced here Andi also introduced the concept Lost again We had stepped functionally and he introduced another concept card Okay the output of this let it be shown us by hat And if the white hair is different from what you're expecting you haven't ever this letter used to make use of this error to adjust these weights not the threshold Using this error can find out what weight should these be so that the air becomes you introduced this logic into the neuron on when he introduced it Logic into the neutron There was no reason No requirement for you to fix any threshold Whatever usually fix the neutron will automatically learn what these weight should be for the air to become zero This is the first version Often artificial neuron very demonstrated that by just giving it the data The neutron will automatically learn what the way it should be And it will It will mimic this It'll mimic these and gets on Gives our visions on the This is the first question first of tar off artificial neuron This is called Rosen Blacks knew Yeah we'll see this in the court will see this in action Why do we need by us Why did he introduce by us Since you people have done linear regression questioned his question is to you What is it Roll off the bias in linear regression What Oh you're talking the bias at him You're talking the bias there That's what the definition for bias it Yes that's how it begins I'm talking about the interested that you have in the Lena Ridge Why Call them Express CC is called interested So why do you need the innocent That interested also goes with the name of bias Our constant right Go back to your Lena tradition case You have a distribution network here Off data points between why and X on these points What kind of relationship is there between my annex Boston linear relationships Boston linear relationship We can also sure Never Negative Also we can do it Negative Also right now what is the best foot line Best red line is the line which represents all of them as accurately as possible Minimized At least some of minimus the summer scholars Right So we want to minimize Uh is this e some off skirt it ISS or development in mean sum of squared errors That line which minimizes this is the best recline ugly And this over here is your interest It which is called Shawn Macey on Called by us in our new Littles Artificial neurons It's called by still the question to you is why do you need this if I suppose I don't worn by us I want this imperceptibly Tzeitel That means I'm forcing this line to go through the origin wonder then intercept with zero But the line which goes to the origin may not be the best front line So there is a hyper perimeter in linear regression I don't know what you're seeing that are not there You can force their Gautam to say by saying that I don't want uninterested when you do that then your algorithm is restricted to evaluate one lead Those lines which go to the point on those lines would go to the point The best fit line which is found amongst them that may not be truly Bestwick had given it the freedom Go and select the bias also Then it would have given you the best fit line where it minimizes the some off predators So the intercept that using linear regression the intercept gives her degree of freedom to the total It gives the additional even lines to evaluate It does not restrict it to evaluate when with those who go through this are you with me on this So by using an intercept you make the algorithm even more Richard even more powerful And the solution that we come up with it's likely to be much more open Then we know that Okay Similarly he introduced disconcerted by us here to make this new one richer in evaluating things If I don't give the bias here then it's a restricted to using only these two weights and come out of the solution Are you with me Yeah So he was the 1st 1 who introduced the concept of bias He was the first turn into is the concept of errors basically difference between actuals and predicted on He was also the 1st 1 to introduce off way off reducing these errors by controlling the weights again Linear regression only So in the direction we have S S E this is equal to a white hat minus Why raise too poor too Some off creditors Yeah Some means you'll have a sigma I still the one to end number of data points you have Then I'll write This is why I wear with me Okay so we have the summer school dinners Now let's ignore all this symbols Let's focus on in these two Why had minus y is the area right now Okay Can I write This is and mix Let's see Minuses Why generate it Yeah okay That means in this if this is it in this manner this era is influenced X And why come from your data set You can't do anything with it X And why I come from a dutiful It's party for training Sit There's nothing you can do about it What you can control is this in on the sea This one these two are want defines your error so your error can be controlled When you control the M and the sea there can be controlled When you control the embassy awaits the raid Socialise em on the sea The cve it goes into your Equus Sh What's he goes into the equation This go w three in Toby's What goes into the question So w three w to doubly one If I manage them I can minimize this edit and then you don't zero Are you with me All of you Any questions So my question is that now with this linear regression the same question is on the Rosenblatt equation also so does that Whitehead on the Rosenblatt equation will give the same result as their linear regression where why you had will give because of this transmission Ok Sam I just wanted to ask one question and since we're saying that M and C are going to change based on the era but X and fire are different data points So which means that for every two inputs off except by that that whole question will keep shifting southward Well very good observation due to get out a question Do you understand what you're saying You're going to adjust the MNC keeping in view one particular record at the time for this recording but need different MNC for this recording Might need different tendency That's a question right What's your answer individually Yes they will try toe find the best it light But what they are actually trying to do is find one line that covers all the really response So they will find error based on one line for one particular data point and then calculate error for all the response that that are available to us to find which which one little one which will be the one line which will have the least error Okay I think you've got me in the right direction But the choice of words could have been different See finally in regulation also what happens Senior immigration Also linear regression that optimal weight that a stone for your lenient model for some records will continue to give another for some records will give you good results Your white hat Reese Amos Why But for some records my head may not be Seamus by even in the best reclines But overall across all the data put together you get the Easter So what drives the M and the sea is overall sum of squared errors not indigent letters So here also really evaluate different weeks and save it and releases that it'll not indigent record level but overall together Unfortunately this particular gate and other gives some of the other gates those gates the way that data is between inputs and outputs We call them Lee Nearly separated data sex Do you know what the meaning off Lena Inseparable Data's it ISS Have you come across this before Linearly separable data sets of those data sets whose classes can be separated our 100% accurately with the linear model and these data sets happen Toby linearly separable data sets I'll show that to you in a moment because off which it is possible by these algorithms to find one set off m one and m two and see which gives a zero error across all the data points Problem happens when your data sets are not linearly separable in that situation you know to settle for a best fit line where the best freight line minimizes and some more squared errors It doesn't become zero which means Ah best freak line will continue to give orders for some off the inputs Good Keep this in mind This is a very important concept which people miss out good Granted your suspicion the best recline will not give you correct answers for all inputs Some input will give a good answer Some important give incorrect answers But the degree of incorrectness across all the data points put together will be the least okay on In this case the given data sets that we have here X annoy their linearly separable data sit and hence there will be one unique combination off MNC which will give you zero for all the edibles Okay so let's see What is that How does it happen Let's see that will come to the court and we'll see that old So one question for leaning inseparable sets that has been happening is happening to ask before we put the deed in the morning it's our it's our exercise and we try to do that using a particle The future engineering and features feature Injuring feature selection is not the most important tasks that you have to do in your mission landing exercise but in practical in reality you'll not come across the street Is is if you come across this data sets which very nearly inseparable Who needs a model Why do you need We don't need Morley right All we need is a room since so I feel lean inseparable courtesy If something listen this then he's going to be a reporter or something more than this is going to be known to fort If you have the factory built with you then why do you need a model You started signed Reinbold That'll ever happen But they did have become across really that they never really near misses All right let's go 10 so these are the gingers necklace and blood brought in This is a remarkable improvement over Michael Opitz Water pits Chino And when he demonstrated this the interested in artificial neuron it went to the roof They're lot off Expectations on board is going to happen You have videos available from the 19 sixties where some of this data scientists were into room on in their interview just going see what All the same how the company is going to overtake the human beings and rule the world and all these things happen All the type happened immediately after Rosenblatt came over this new and he demonstrated that it can learn to implement And in all of these but immediately to gentlemen peppered and Minsky who were working in a mighty land something at the time these two demonstrated their butts A prawn This is small personal Rosenblatt is called possible They demonstrated that this person Tron cannot learn all the hits There are dozens of gates in your Boolean algebra on possible Cannot learn all the gates on to demonstrate that What they Sure boss exhorted Where did I come to accept getting the moment Very Rosenblatt Compass idea of using leads Very interesting story behind this There's a gentleman called William Heads He was a biologist He was trying to find out Where is the memory store In the break Okay On uh what it was He had a pet dog Apparently a potato on He used to feed the dog while feeding the dog history Annabelle He dated my people times on Then when he rings the bell they don't start in celebrity even though there was looking for So the question is what is going on What William had to say This the neurons that fired when the dog heard the bell on the neurons that fired when the dog tasted the food When these two neurons these two sets of neurons the fire simultaneously multiple times they start connecting to each other And next time any fire Only the bill neurons related on listening It automatically fires the ones related to the Facebooks So he came over the famous rule in biology and disclaim assume today neurons that fire together wire together That idea This Rosenblatt bordered and got it into the neural saying that the strength of the connections can be represented as based Larger the weights stronger the connections less in the weeds Porter the connection Pour the connection Nothing new You have seen this in lean integration already in linear regression If Why Goto mimics Les See if this M is equal to zero What is the relationship of the Nixon way They're not related The relationship in X and Y zero it does not influence wife So the lot of this Amis correlation can range from minus 12 plus unless what And the moment it goes towards one this one or that one We say X is a strong influence Off way Same concept feels broaden it The weights are close to zero That means the neurons are not related to each other They don't fire off together If the rates are very strong Large magnitudes that means the set off You don't often find together And he brought the concept off reach here into his needle So I bought her this idea from the Libyan rule on dhe Interesting story behind this and he was able to demonstrate that it can learn or and lot functions But what happened this The two gentlemen peppered in Minsky they demonstrated that it cannot learn all the forces on one of the functions that it cannot learn is excellent This is just a comparison off Michael Ovitz noodle But the Rosenblatts noodle both of them do the same thing But only thing is he uses weights here There are no wait shown here Okay In some books and in some diagrams Elsie's waits shown here also But all those weights are equal leads Equal reach means as good as not having any weights Okay so all the bits of equal weight They didn't give any specific importance to the connections Whereas this guy said No The collections have different Should have different breeds depending on with the bureau inspired together Nonsense Okay And then he brought in the concept of error and using their own How do you just awaits You brought in that photo on Ordell This learned the hitting gates Or and not But it was a short lived exactement because we had This is Michael Ovitz noodle you already discussed These are the bullying gives Is that right Implement Okay I'll come to the court a bit later I'll show you the court We'll see all being discussed All these things but I'll take it to the cordon Become clearer limitations These two gentlemen demonstrated that it cannot learn the eggs or get what is an exorbitant It's our gate iss When your inputs are x one x two and why If the importers say 00 operatives of 1100010111 Don't confuse this with mortgage People get confused nor get Lord or there's no likeness Except this a different point Andi when you include this very asked the principal to learn this gate It fails to London on the reason why Clay fails to learn the gate Iss Let's draw this X one extra Okay When Excellent Next to both of them A zero We have one here Let me show the one with the triangle when both of them one each Then once again we're trying But when any one of them is a zero that means this point At that point any one of them is zero This is a lecture Me This is a circle So now you're given a data set with labels They moved them Are trying the labels to form a circle It this distribution is given to you on As you can see there is no way you can lean your listen You can't draw any line anywhere which cleanly suppressed It'll these data sets eggs or gate is a distribution which is more lenient since it is not linearly separable This guy uses a leader's transformation fails to implement exalted And when this was demonstrated all the interest in artificial neuron collapsed collapse means people stopped doing research Anybody try to publish any paper Hundreds It was immediately rejected no funding nothing So it entered what is called a winter off near a Littles It was indeed Please Nobody was working on this anymore A few people continue to work on this They believed in it The continued to work on this They didn't stop At this point onboard the real Estes tryingto make one neuron intelligent enough to understand all the gates Instead Bishop connect the neurons on a collection Off neurons should learn all the kids When the big Dark they realized that they can implement any dates that revived the interest in artificial neural network immediately Once again the interest went up But something happened Because of this The interest all came down again to zero on That was the second winter for artists So the limitation of this person strong led to the evolution off mural Little Rosenblatt was trying to make this person strong intelligent enough to understand all the gates But what was demonstrated isn't stuff Depending on what you're on We should have a collection off murals And that's what happens in human brain Also we have a collection off neurons that fire together and do something that is the origin off our diction New nickel Let's forget burst So I joined the diagram again So this is a triangle triangle This is clearly not separate bills in two dimensions Painful damages right So what we do is let's have three damages Let's have three dimensions So in three dimensions may none of these two imports extra next to one of these two or 00 Then I want one When is this to our 11 each Then I want our total sense for otherwise I want a Tzeitel Tzeitel in this life in three dimensions What does not separable in two dimensions in three dimensions it becomes separate This concert is called Project In her data points from the lower dimensions of the higher dimensions Many project the data points in higher dimensions The probability that the classes become linearly separable increases This is going over still in mathematics there's a film called Oversteer which say is if you have distributions where the classes are not nearly separable project them into higher dimensions the probably that they'll become linearly separable In cases have you done support Vector machine in support Vector Mission have done colonels and terrible tricks Journals project leader points that is based on the school Is there Colonel Tricks is getting that one page of higher dimensions without projecting it that it's terrible tricks support Vector machine of very beautiful Alberto based on layers and layers of mathematicians sales So really understand that Alberta might enjoy anal and goto unique that mathematical exposure Not very difficult but we don't come across those mathematics in our day to day life so we find it difficult Otherwise you need to know the branches you need to know over stadium on You have one more thing They're forgetting all the stadiums sit on each other like the sandwich which actually empower the support vector machine over Similarly in your network we have both heroes one of school a studio that the one is called Magro to I don't know what he said on whatever he said It's similar to what we do in your Littles on these two is born Give the mathematical power tow this new network to become so far In fact newly work is also a bonus universal function Approximately There's a very strong word Okay Universum function about Senator when we build models when we build models What are we doing by every building models Whatever Aging A building Mortars Yeah we're predicting We're estimating what's happened Correct Right All models they represent certain processes in Dorian World The processes could be tangible or intangible processes if a building models to predict mpg off a car Given that tribute to the car and predicting the behavior of a tangent process for the car If I'm trying to build a bottle and see what is the stock price tomorrow in Bombay Stock Exchange that I'm trying to build a model to replicate the behavior of Bombay Stock Exchange is intangible process So if you look at it this way all models are nothing but representations off processes in the real world If you had every person the process is immortal Then by understanding that if I give this import borders outcrop later to be I can predict the behavior of the process how it's going to be here I take advantage of the beauty that knowledge right So now the question comes what is the process A process is a collection of vilifying steps which act on in input I'm given output given output Okay process Oh the process tells you the relationship between outputs and inputs on this relationship is mathematically shown us Why is a functional expo next to Isn't this what you doing Ah linear regression or any other thing any of the number Why is a function of these to this function is what is a process on models that build They represent the processes that means on the models that were built in mathematics circle functions and when he said Neural network is a universal function Approximate er that means using neural network You can represent any process in the real world Tangible or intention It's a very powerful statement You can't do this with any other With new network You can You can build a more presentable on the stock exchange You can build a mortar to the present automotive the car We can build a model to find out your weather or predict the weather It's a very powerful statement A neural network is a universal function Approximate which means it can represent any process in the world Tangible loading that is the power that it enjoys and where does the power come from the boat come from Be stood here and supporting it And it also comes from another fact that happens in the neutrons The factors This is a Linnaeus emission What happens here Long linear transformations This is linear transformations Vineyard functions all put off Lena Function is transformed again using a non linear transmission and the left and right and a left Right now it is because of this nonlinear consummation Along with these two pills it begins a very powerful too using which you can represent any process in this When you say you changed from a linear toe nonlinear function so are you changing Um the function itself origin either data data data to represent to behave like a nonlinear Okay Sunkuli business A lot of things to business down the line People treat you really focus some kind of black art Black magic It is not If you understand that Link concepts nearly took it so easy to learn and understand what's going on inside Okay little let's go and see the port Yeah it's going to be the court record is shared with you I think this morning something was here before Yeah Okay I'm going to start the first line is important and I put from kind of impulse choice This is a simple bite on statement There is a bunch of functional piece available under life record Right from there I'm importing one particular one Call choice Okay What does Joyce just given a data it randomly picks up on record sensitive The Okay So it's only for random selection of records from the given duty from Mumbai I'm inputting Ari from Numb pine Umpire All off you know what is numb by numerical python It has all the numerical functions in corded there in C So one of the functions that is included there is the dot function What does the dark function do Dot function is basically a multiplication and information together So when I won't write bicycle m bone X one plus in tow X two plus even I want to do this and C is also having in our case w three will call it n three plus B When you want to do this you keep em one m toe on m three In one metrics you keep x one x two and be in another metrics Dot Operation is multiplication of these two Makris and submission So the result that you get here this result is nothing but this e question output of this secret in is more to get here So what you're doing to get this result you multiplying the mattresses and something of the something them up That concept is called dot operation duty So when you do this dark it automatically does all these things and gives it that is it Entire neural network is metrics Algebra beast Okay so one of the first introduction to Patrick's algebra neural it will be the daughter operation Okay let's come back to this So I'm importing dot for that I honestly don't remember what I'm using random for Right Okay I'm importing numb pies and then here I'm going to demonstrate to you the behavior off Michael operates Neuron first make a low pitch Neuron did not have any concept of rates They give equal importance to all them perpetrators So what I'm doing here is just to make this court a general court just to make this court agenda record Ah this is what it's called So what I'm doing here is I'm initializing both these weights with one so keep in mind make a low pitched in Iran did not have any bias live it had one Lee inputs extra next to both of them I'm giving the weight off one right now And in between you have a step function this omission There's no bias in my club It's neuron So we don't have any bias here So what you're doing is not Look at this I'm initializing the weights with one Both of eight are equal one on This is the training data This training data if you observe carefully Which gate is this This is Andy Dick I'm giving an and Gate Day Does it So the new dawn on Dhere I'm defining my step function It's a daughter Operation will give me this the step function after define the step function I'm defining here using Lambda operation all of your family to Lambda Okay Lambda is a function that is used only once After that it's discarded So what I'm saying It's Look at this carefully Input of the land dies X If you're if you're kind of getting confused here you can replace this with some input of the lambda Is X If the X is less than equal listeningto then go to zero All put a zero If the summation is listeningto otherwise output of one Do you understand this life Are you all with me on this Okay so when I add these two up But I do the daughter operation And are these two up Are these two up In none of these three cases in all of these three cases your summation will be listening to So it'll output as it'll one In the last case the threshold will be greater than two equal to do so it'll violate this since it violets this it local the one Yeah So this is good And run this Make sure you run the first important also going and run this You'll see that in the airport We'll be able to print it here This is for Nick's look going through the records one by one and sending them to the daughter operation As a result of that I get the summation The submission over here That summation I'm sending it to the state function If the submission crosses is listen to open a zero otherwise output of one You see this is an and gig The foot is the same as on gate All put on We say that because of the special Michael OPIC Neutron is mimicking an and gate If I won't implement an or get then the changes have to do is first the training data will change You see this is an organ data on Then the threshold will change You see the threshold here If the submission is less than one Output zero If the summation is one on about all part of one you please look at this uh lambda function again What It says this if the import of this lambda function which is a sum if that sum is less than one I'll put a zero Otherwise give out one Go back to this data one In this case the summation will be Lesson one In all other cases Either the submission will have one or greater than one So using this threshold I can meet this make low pitched in Iran being like an organ So when I run this again this is our gate Good start but not good enough because we have to go and change the threshold Can we make the neuron Learn the threshold also Otherwise where is the intelligence Then came your Rosen Blacks knew Don I'm going to jump the ninth gate You can go and explore with this experiment with this I'm going to jump in Russell Blacksmith come to Rose and blacks Neuron on The first thing I've done here is I've given the step function here in Rosenblat's neutron step function I just kept some random threshold value of 30 Right 30 No reason Seven of the submission It's less than her P m it zero brimming with the submission is 30 year about emit a one If you're still thinking why 13 No reason you can replace it for different fields All right so I've just created a step function here on I'm giving it a data to learn from on Observe this carefully In this there are three inputs Why Because Rosen black introduced a bias So this by us also has a bait OK on now This will not be one This is doubly one This is w to this devil it free This is X one This is X two on This is the bias coming in Okay so this is Rosen Blacks Nero So what I'm doing here is I'm saying the input that is going to come in is your 0001 Mondo along with the weight off one you initialize this bias to one But how much will actually go into this will be decided by doubly three and Toby Right You initialize this to one If you want to initialize this 100 you initialize this 100 But this is not the bias that is going to go into the question What is going to go into the questions W three and Toby Are you all with me Yes Okay so what you do is in the next step were randomly fixing the w one w do that were randomly putting some values over there So this development of looting of W three will be random numbers to begin with Obviously when you'd multiply this random number takes one random number of extra in this the output will not be what you're expecting Office A little would be This is like having a distribution and drawing a random line The random line will not with the best fit like so given the trend in Lang I usedto alert himto make the random line orient and become best fit like and to make it reorient itself to become best fit line I love modify the weeds But how much would I have modified the weights That depends on how much air you're living so we'll capture the error Also here on if you see we're creating a provision for capture layers right And I'm also going to use something will eat up What is this Each of this seat I school learning read By any chance have you come across this learning rate You're come across learning great win grading descent algorithm A linear regression Very good So this is the learning rate Okay Why do we need learning rate and all the things we'll discuss in some of the station when it comes to that other functions and all we'll discuss that later Okay On this is and how many iterations you wantto have for your new don't be able to understand The sweeter one iteration may not be sufficient The random line wherever disoriented One set of change in values off w may not bring it to best recline You might have to do it multiple times for it to become Basically I don't know how many times I want to modify the rates to make it best wiggling So I don't know how many attractions agreed So I just put some number here 10,000 I don't think you need so many iterations anything but let's start with pickles Are you all with me on this day Love with me Yeah So now starting for next Look select a record randomly from the given data Is it That record has both the input very well And our target variable This is India independent variable X and y what I'm doing Not the sensory I'm doing a daughter operation here between Nixon Wait Is this clear This is dot operation which is short on the board This is where your MBA next 1% 2 extra bliss MP plus M three b happens here At this point there isn't of back is captured here This is your linear model That result Okay Obviously I compared with expected I send it through the state function I compared the output of the steak function with water You expecting the actual why was a standard way the difference between these two is there So he introduced the concept off which uh those people didn't think off Now given this letter I can use this formula to design what The way it should be This is a great and distant from lighting going to use that word grading descent because I was not sure whether you heard of this before but you see what we're doing here New weight is good old wait plus e trying to ID her It is learning step learning rate for Geeta entering to X So this is where the Bates get adjusted Given the order that you have done in a particular record Are you with me on this Still Oh this simple linear regression coming into play writing for the food So what did Louis given this function Bottle Lewis Let's go ahead and execute the whole stuff This is the same for next Look take a record AmeriCorps dodo dot operation on dhe Send it to the step function Final data motivates go back And for the same record check for that there is reduced That is what this for makes Luke will do Go ahead and run this there's good and run this whole list of one single block So in 40 gators triple zero You see the airport gate is also triple zero Yeah I let me change the threshold I'm going to change the pressure to say from therapy Say I make it 50 Okay I don't need to do this but I'm just demonstrating to you how this neuron learns the weight given the threshold So I modified the original 2 50 So this good and run this the new don you'll see it has again learned awaits The rates have changed These are the weeds Keep an eye on this week's okay In fact you can print your w here if the virus you can bring the w here Okay Drink You can print a W and see the end of weights And the weights changed Modified reads Now let's implement Let's implement an organ Okay So employment or get all I need to do is change the data So what I do is I make this 000 I make this as one I make this one I make this all since one This is an organ I'm not touching the threshold at all I modified the data here This data is no become or gay Data have not more different threshold I'm not tested special Not on this It learned to represent the or gate or his 0111 So Rosenblat's new Dawn You just have to give up the data he learned from the patents Given how to the prison that gave you don't need to go and modify anything So this was first demonstration there Something is learning from the data without us telling us how to do it For example I don't have to write a cord if extra physical zero and extra physical zero then all protest zero I don't need to write such lines I don't need to do such things Keep in mind we're in machine language How difficult it would be So by just giving it the data the neuron learns from the daytime Does it for us But let's replace this with X or gate Which means these two are zeros Make this us ah zero on Make this also is it This is an ex target Now run your neuron Check the outboard You'll never get the pattern that you expected You said the airport Is it all 0111 What do you want This 1001 You learn it as many times as like you change this from 210,000 Also there's no dinner change No Sorry God I'm so sorry Not this one This is wrong This is by a very sorry This is by us Mr Uh Change this too Video zero is one on these two are zeros No right This is an executive Yep No than this It never London get visit output Remoter print Prentiss was in confusion with this spring We don't need this So run it as many times as you like in never land again Okay Even if increase iterations 100,000 still it will not land again The reason why I cannot lend the gate iss But soprano is Alina separator It cannot separate nonlinear classes for a stargate You're right Yeah Show me your output The result is matching them You get No This is not 1001 That is operating No go So they go up in your screen Yeah that isn't it Yeah Okay Yes You can do it No but they didn't know Do it So I'm showing you this street quality board but yes you can do it But all new little straight that I know off their own leader Economics First you're here then Oh yes I lose this What Mike get out in this ex Argue it Oh yeah You'll get my people That's a different as none of them will direct depending on various putting The light will get different answers But it won't give you the right answer Okay Thing is this is not the morning your book is coordinating with the other morning served white box lords for example decision trees A white box logistic is away books in your visions of white boats these old black holes black box mortals sometimes in real world for if you're working banking financial you can't implement a new unit because they want to know on what basis do to decide whether a person is not even before the run before you can take you to court That's what I said Probably not here today as we were discussing these things Now laws have been passed in Europe and Far East where the models have supposed to be explainable Another big problem That research is going on in back How do you make any mortals built out of these technologies Explainable A lot of interesting work is going on that right So those things still have though this is powerful Those things still hold their own ground Shelley Moore Yeah Okay Yes Makes question Yeah What Yeah I guess Patterns predict this principle doesn't live Yes yes The failure of the person from the failure of the person drawn in x our gate and other gates Also the failure of the personal Perceptron led to the evolution off religion A new networks is a universal function approximately your mother What Yes Yes Yes right Okay Yeah All right This'll was a brief history off neural networks Very interesting But what we have today is based on the lessons learned in these experiments What we have today is a neural artificial neural in book This artificial neural network is very generous representation of how it looks saying this What you're seeing here is these are all neurons artificial neurons this what you see here the black dots these air not artificial Iran's These are the columns in your data frame They're also called Dominions On this live that you see here it's your data frame transposed This is called the input layer So when you come across the word input layer inarticulately please understand It refers to your data not the artificial neurons Okay on the first layer After this this is laid off neutrons This is your first hidden live You may have multiple hidden layers as many as you want I've shown you too hidden lives and the last layer is the output layer The output layer will have as many neurons I'm showing you only one new dawn here If you're doing binary classification you'll have one neuron Zero means class A one means last B But if you're in multi class classification 100 digit recognition 0 to 9 you have 10 different classes Then you'll need 10 neurons In this live securing multi class classification you'll need multiple neutrons in vinyl reclassification You don't need multiple neurons but in case you want to have two neurons here for binary classification your choice you can have that also Okay this output layer interacts with the world outside the input layer interacts with the world outside the layers in between they don't interact with the world anyway outside world the data for this new one comes from here It passes on the best this guy positive And this and this interest of the world outside That's why they're called hidden neurons Hidden lives Okay on what is he Here is a concept that Rosenblatt introduced We call them by us neurons But there again Damn In Iran's they're not by nuance it'll they're some kind of Constance that you put in your court as we are done in the court You said a constant value to the bayous Okay but we showed them the students But always keep in mind these are not neurons And if the bike's value here is be one not the entire of even goes to every neuron What goes to the neuron is decided with the weights here the rates every input goes to every neuron In the first written here every input goes to every neuron In the first year in live output off on Iran goes to every neuron In the subsequently output of this neuron goes to every neuron In the subsequently same thing heroes This is called fully connected neural networks also known as dense Newman reports there are cases where we use partially connected networks What is still no sparse knit words way have those also but very specific niche areas We use them but usually when we implement new little based solutions those are fully connected Dense nearly kills So the data comes in from here It undergoes all the transformation Lenient nonunion undergoes under transmitter in Vietnam Dear Output White hat Why aren't minus y is e better That editor it's used to modify all the weights there to see him on the weights get modified in such a way that overall the new little minimizes the eternal on to modify the weights to minimize the others it uses Great indecent before it is great in this you're all familiar with good innocent right questions So you there's no particular reason These are all hyper perimeters how many lives you should have in immortal on within each layer How many neurons you should have These are hyper parameters here to evaluate these hyper parameters using great such on DSI which gives you model vicious most accurate and General Izabal Thank you So we have a possible people by civilization Yes yes yes absolutely So we just No no no Training appearing A neural network is the most one of the most difficult jobs in their sights On the more the layers you have more deeper than minimal effort becomes more deeper than you're in it it becomes more difficult It becomes to train it which is the most successful and advanced new net Today there are two architectures One It's called Google's Inception That woman is arrested from Microsoft Research They're very the 150 lives or something in them Off neurons on they do Very fantastic job Yes Yes On edition is universal addition off negative numbers and minor suffers Yeah Yes Yeah yeah yeah yes yeah yes yeah That depends on the various ways off running it one is called but brilliant descent Which means you read the entire data set find out the other across all the data's had put together that is there s s e divided in means score later And then do the great innocent The other one is many match meaning match means breaker data sort of smaller chunks I read the first batch finder data are just the rates Throw the batch Read the next batch Final data I just went through the batch that is called mini Batch gradient descent And the other one is stochastic Stochastic isn't randomly pick up it a guard Send it to this about forward propagation find data and just awaits I didn't pick up another record So this has three techniques available Which one of them used will answer your question Bus will go into every noodle Okay so what we show here is a bias known for every year That's what we surely chart the block Bagram's Okay so this is just a way of showing on the block diagrams on before I go into what I'm going to tell because I need to tell that to answer this question I just want to cover two more things Depending on which methodology of used letters in backs methodology the entire data set will be pushed through the neural networks That is called forward propagation prediction For all the records for all the records will predict on for all the records to compare perfect person sections So every record suppose your data files 100 records all The under the course of the rate for every record will be white bread They will say OK what is the white prayed minus Why you cross all these records Let's do a square off that and sum it up some off square letters and then it'll do what it's called Okay given errors These errors at this point are controversial but all unions all neurons are responsible for this So now this area we call it every ingredient back propagation We propagate that elevating back I'm eat neuron it just it sweets to minimize the overall air This concept off okay we got there across the data file but we are all responsible for that error So let's all shake take a share of the blame on me I just have a wage to minimize a little later This concept is called back propagation So we have a forward propagation Enter use dictator back propagate data ingredients and all these weights get existed Hopefully next time in the Dhofar propagation there will be zero That is the whole But you know there he'll only many mice Right Then we are best for Klein in linear regression Then we are best fit model in this case are you all with me So we have a new political architecture A very simple architecture input layer hidden there hidden layer off All the neurons are connected to all the Newmans in subsequent mills The only thing and then we have the bias knows return of Benjamin Iran's which give the bias to the leader transformation in every Nero Fine Then we have before word propagation editor back propagation All these things that were showing here on the screen all these things is one way for him to do explanations Do not imagine that these neurons are some kind of things sitting on different CPUs and connecting to each other physically I know all this new loans can be running on one single to you on all this new homes What you're seeing here Actually what is happening under the hardest Mavericks operations It's mathematics Algebra Okay For example if I take one of the first layer if I take the first little beer I'm x one and extra These two inputs are coming to this New York I know what it's going like this So this is the deadly one W two on the bias Be government three Then what you're actually doing is you're creating a Metrix off Three weeks are doubly One w two This Mark Rix is being multiplied by We already seen this extra extra that that comes here Go through the normal function Now suppose you had two neurons on this extra next to go through them all Then this will be two weeks Two sets of weights This is the lift four double If I and W six laterally 4 75 76 this input might play This gives it this this one this equipment plan But this gives it this one This is what you get over here So what We sure as newly let work here is one leaf for understanding What actually happens under the hood is all mathematics algebra metrics off weights mattresses off in port They get multiplying to get out of your transponders and in markets operations everything a sequence of matrix operations Are you all of me Yes I don't We don't need to worry about about its operations at all We don't need to We don't need it But if you understand this then down the line When you started the convolutions of network it becomes slightly easier What exactly is going on there but very very far away from that We really don't need to know how this kind of insight to be able to understand us questions So the non taenia transformation that happens is by default set as a perimeter off again the we decide what transfer me because at the end ofit the output is driven by the non Nina transformation How do we decide that So that is a hyper perimeter Remote activation functions the nominee transmission the world use for their this activation functions I'm There are different types of high position functions It's a hyper vitamins that you have the sect Otherwise it is buying the forward sake sigmoid activation functions But we can change all this activation based on that I think before this is my question Is ah saying a mini batch process If say suppose five rows are getting inside I'm in processed in one short So in the first evidently therefore neurons the first Newman will act on the first record second on the second So what is the point of having four new ones on the same record when X one x two Extremely past With this one's good question can you get us a question again The last part Yes So the question is if all the four neurons in the frustrated Larry's acting on the same sort of values of extra next two extra Yeah so I mean what was the need off for It looks like senseless right Why are we sending the same data to all the Ford neurons All the four students are going to lose Bias also is same getting busted be ones but cushion And a very good cushion of good attempt Also I'm saying I thought you almost came to the answer But then you alleviated The thing is is that you're you're deviating too much Sorry Oh how did you Just different Okay Now look at this Okay This is where the over serum concept comes into play But before I go there supposed this camera hanging on the ceiling from the ceiling OK I don't know What is this entity I can look at this entity from different angles When I look at this entity from different angles I get a comprehensive view comprehensive information off picture about this entity You know that they're in nature There are spiders with six ice The world is the same way It doesn't need six eyes It's looking to say Mom take what you need Six eyes Why do you need to wise By the way you rabble anyone I know more than eyes more You go You get information about the object from different angles right So anyhow multiple neutrons given to you on the weights that connect these neurons examine the next to the rage that connect These new ones are different It is like looking at the same object represented by this extra next to from different angles depending on what is Wait over here So the weights are different Basic waiting Really That next it'll be different But this is a very important question You asked I don't know whether you realize that or not Okay on the other thing is now look at this new tone which is acting over here in this new on there are three inputs coming in Isn't this like three dimensional feature space They're as you started to Dante Feature space exo next room So data point Prudential Pizza spirits is being product into three dimensional feature space where it is likely to be able to separate the two classes if you have having finally classifications like the ex orbit the production into higher dimensions happen when you have more neurons in the layer with inputs are being saying if the number of neurons in the layer is more than the number of attributes you have that is sitting in the project into her damages Oh versatile Where the bias is coming Here we have the biases coming here Are you You don't mean this name Okay Biases this upon stint it's not in Iran Okay so what This bias does this It basically tells you Okay suppose there's suppose biases He kind of folk going forward I'm restricting toe wanted this But if I go forward then I have a better view of the thing than being restricted of this So buys gives the additional degree of freedom using which you can draw those Lena separators which are able to baker different shipbuilding class in class hope to be saved How to decide what should be the watch of the weights be That is where the grading descent comes finally what designs is the error function and optimism L gotta hope it's been able to bring down the other toes close to me So I was just wondering if we are just ring before we build this a n n a Is that a good decision about decision on my biasing know Suppose I You know since you're building these there's a certain learning Parton and what what you said is about fire together wire together objects that have similar attributes will have a certain learning baton asserting evolution So I was just wondering before you build in your data set itself like we did force Sami supervised learning as well You do some amount of clustering now What I don't know is there's a bias which is human bias coming in in the clustering logic So averages questioning that applying plastering here before you build a network is by seeing it in a good way or a bad way Oh my God Okay All right Uh she just don't get the bias every nor the bias here right You don't in the by insiders Okay First of all they never build any models I always do one suppose letting the good spots because I want to do that answer personally matured gaming plastering and others to really understand other than they given relationship it is everything Are there any other hidden relationship moved in these eggs and the wise you don't know you're voting card and picture it isn't Yeah on the guardian period it is that you have done your fair block in the paper float in the diagnose Do you observe in the kernel density estimates anything unique what it was Oh just welcome Peaks So now you only have multiple peaks Sure they were building one single modern archery links of great ones when you don't analyze those things and you're going to build a model of model which is supposed to predict the MPD during the characteristics of the car now after characteristics of paradise If you say this Marty tendered then how can you even think of building a model model Represent the process a tangible process in this case How can you build a mortar Correct Listen to different processes at the same time Money So many colors when it's a city But if I don't do the questioning I won't be able even a veil of these things So when I do the clustering and the cluster stand out and I'm rejecting Our hypothesis is which means those questions are very significantly different from each other Then does it make sense to build one single model are actually build separate mornings for small cars large person since so all this I always do this okay and clustering using different techniques to understand whether there any hidden kind off information in the data set which is not evident to us from the data thing that we have some answer to Your question is yes you should but not coming to your next question Whatever you do in your inner models as a data scientist at every step you're you're mitigate the risk off Introducing bias there's because by insiders are introduced by the data scientist by the different choices that we make For example when you do the sampling from the universe your sample is best When a break that sample in the training set just save your mortifying the distributions going check Look at the distribution of the origin later on After splitting into training sitting look at the discretion of data on the Vegas attributes You will see that and some of the articles that discretion to change the center Well it's a change The standard fusion has changed You're introducing by several but modifying the distributions You think that in the given data say the feet of selection that you're doing you think feature affirmative to its We are important But have you taken more data Secular known that if four also is important But you dropped that they fall from your day Does it Because in your letter said it didn't appear is important You're introduced by sir You detested the relationship then by an ex appears to be lenient But actually it's known to you there So whatever decisions we take be introduced by service That's what they have to be very cautious and careful in understanding what we're doing A simple case A very simple case Let me I'll answer that cushion Then I think we'll break for pee Yeah Now suppose you have tour distributions okay Oh this is a small car This is large car and this is mpg Okay One large car claims say of this thing off mpg mpg rose 46 kilometers per liter Mpg is a different unit from this X kilometers but leader And then you also have a case off Ah small car polka Which planes to have empathy off say 02 kilometers per meter Does it ring a bell Can you have a tortoise returned from this excluded Rosalita Looks like an old time Similarly a small car Marti International given coagulants Proletarian What is it getting that also looks like an old Claire Love to fix the whole clan What do you do One of the studies is that people say is a replacement median meeting off What Didn't the interrogators it You should replace a meeting of the cluster So when you look at a small car beep message meeting of the small car Well look at large Tariq Assad meeting of the lodge What people do is they don't even do this analysis They look for meeting extreme value on this side and decide they treat this whole thing is part of one distribution which is absolute blunder on By doing the street involving as one single distribution and replacing outlasted central values you're going to bring these two together on the more together these two distributions are the more useless this dimension because in classifying so you're started These are fixing applies your started user fixing Missing on this will interest biceps Yes we deviated the big but was important to business So we discussed on the various ways you can do so minus symptom especially new network It's a very powerful Elberton You need to be very careful You can very easily Basile's it on You know you won't realize it until you put in production Barry Bonds magnificient Was this the future's like with like tens of thousands of features onda ne the first hidden layer Also will it be proportionate are like What is the relation between the number off future There's no relationship between the number of neurons in the first on the inputs If you have less number of neurons than your number of features then your project in your data into lower damages which is very popular Possible situation Also you're done PC principal component Analysis Your project You're trying to lure damages and in the Lord I'm sure PC world you're modeling your mechanisms but generally what happens is when the classes are not Cellini really separable We project them to hide But what I'm saying is if your input has explained to extend how many new Don't should have the first shooting live No this is not directly connected with us I can start even in fun Mutual These are all hyper perimeters where people have done research and they're still doing research to find out Given a problem statement How many layers should I have on how many neurons formation the hand Is there a way to find that out Documents values There's no there's no formal something like this So all this all right No I saw perimeter Security evaluate using a grid search and then use those now to put it formally This is not calligraphy currencies That's what he said Or on the roof Your 900 years away I guess How did you even think of these things Lord what is it is any function can be represented by to functions which is shown here is G And this one No Look at this carefully Is it not your linear function A mix a mix This is your weight MX plus C summation off a Mex is is a mortal You're leaning function going on here on the output of the linear function You do a transmission using this function which was in black did using step functions not very effective because it failed in X target But these days we do this using non linear transmission It's a combination of these two function can represent any function with cereals Okay So what are diving into the real max behind it on I've completely awarded many of the details What is that is any function in the universe can be represented as a combination of these two But he didn't specify what these functions should be He didn't speak further Okay on that is what we do in your genitals In every neuron it does Summation on the submission undergoes a known in your transmission on The result of all these things is added together in the next new role So this new John a new notebook It's kind of implementation of this data One is that second is the Culver City In the given input dimensions your classes are not linearly separable project them into higher dimensions by giving them to four neurons What subsequent get neurons get this four dimensional space Vera's into into the importers in three dimensions space The two things coming together in fall off the architecture over here Plus the normally transmission that happens in each neuron That is what gives the power Huh Are you all with me Yeah Said you know what Thesis What my You know the question I'd live question Was there supposed the like Four classifications are clustering The big coastal um so poses There ain't no 1000 tens of thousands of features Ben in order transferring the higher dimension Is it possible when that many number of neurons issued you can You can have a power You can have been Doesn't know something One more limits Cynthia Allison Cushion What has been empirically demonstrated is itself having Hominy nuance are there in this network 3 34 plus three Seven You cannot have one single lay off seven and one over Wait You say explained that earlier right It's seeing from different angles So that the first lady you saw something and you can you conjure up something in the second layer again Because of Angela's dish in the output off those four could not be in the same direction But the more exhausted view you have the more accurate you're going to come before this So I can have seven year olds here that you seven different perspective the CNN port that benefited So this new on it get much more cheering formation right So I can have seven new ones here I what in particular has been demonstrated ISS for any given problem statement of classification into whitening Your glares go deeper You will realize that lets less number off neurons You can you can do the same job that with whitening So technically speaking what This is one people letters Make your mirror MacBook perimeter efficient These are going back with less number off overall weights I can do the same job with beaten Will it work Then I can do the shallow there Suppose I want to restrict muscles to want anyone live Then the number of neurons are required to do A job will be much higher than the number of neurons required to do the same job If you allow my couple years Yes What is it If you have multiple years we goingto higher dimensions Yeah in fact a grading descent for what is good in this into here greeting the sentence I will just result that will discuss up incompetence I believe the constraint here is these are not back traceable right So once I get to finding our port I cannot back trace it to where it originated or well where the decision off which wait or which point I cannot Does not it really a right that's a constrained here Correct There's no the over by auditory What she means is when you get a particular how sport there's no way to find out why this output what is a contribution of these neurons to this out You can't do that That's called Black Box There's already created accents right That's it Question what has been empirically the monster did this If you go for shadow You know what that is 1311 layer to lets you need more number off neurons to do a job Then you'll require if you don't get no labels This is empirical There's no research being There's no mathematical reasoning that So what we're saying is if there's a deep place are you know like this are were confident layers probably end up using seven or eight kind of neurons that if we use shallow layer we probably end up using 50 neurons to get her correct output after trial and error sees what were said to get The similar accuracy is what we say Okay well it normally looks up at a magnificient That's what does this Okay this is number of H Okay thanks Hair in this case received two layers on dhe Is it that we're faster projecting it into higher dimension then then bringing it out into lower dimension in this case started Lord dimensions Fast three and then four or five That can also happen And then from 5 to 1 that output layer that cannot be There is no way to find out giving a problem statement How many letters have How many neutrons in each of you should have this unfortunate nobody So these air hi Perparim against a grid search We even Rick please on the problem Ms you're you're a bit of grid search right All of you Ingrate search We're receiving that Each other's hyper perimeters have independent of each other But that is not true The perimeter's they influence each other and hence evaluating one party leader at a time It's not a good approach but then we don't have any miracles That is why creating a Munich book is a very difficult job especially when you're billing bigness It takes a lot of afford a lot of pain to do that right Shall number one heard of France for learning by any chance I don't think you should have heard of translating at this moment at this part time transfer Lenny This is right now the hardest area of research What we do is many of these architectures designed developed and Esther by these big shorts like Microsoft Research Listen it for Google's inception or you have a limit five and so on so forth All these mortals have built that they haven't tested them generalised Very well in production also So in council anymore to do it Okay the date on which these mortals were trained is similar to the date on which I'm going to do my run in production Science of starting from scratch I bought all these mortals I import these models into my modem on without doing any training My model will give me very good scores if I wish I can further fine tune Bill but usually real Lord because they're all exports in this area So if I vision may further find you on get much more accuracy this concept of school counseling ransom money takes away all the paint off during the hyper vitamin testing and all the things that completely takes it It can be like a different moment also We'll talk about that when it comes to transfer money All right We're gonna concept actually on right now that counseling is done well in a vision competition kind of products Norton are literally products I just quickly answer this question because he asked Inc views are merely focal scene and convolution Medicals It's a variant of the evening Okay now when I want to understand what in a given picture Is there an object And I want to understand If you look at that think of order whatever object you re seeing Right now all objects have a horizontal and vertical in the angler Just these horizontal angler vertical edges which is there in all of us including you and me A combination of small these horizontal angler edges combination of diesel you the entire picture These are called gabble features Dear Bur So even if you're literally put this training some other domain for verticals object addiction the first few layers off that make food will identify these features atomic little features which is common in both the dummies So I canceled learning from there I take the first few layers off that model Reject other layers are freaking my letters Very beautiful research Very 88 going on right now we have used it We're seeing it in a book So it's a visit for discussion when you come to see in it Okay General one What's Sofia doing What is it for build on the run They interacted Human The human robot that has maybe sitting and lying and lp all these reports which you see they're called there It's a different orbit as a civilian on there A combination of electronics electricals mechanics night of language processing competition Everything put together Oh so different teams will come together Just both CNN anonymity Absolutely It's a different combination of these mornings running too All right Shelly Moore Yeah Okay So what happens inside each noodle on If you look at each noodle what happens in the region on the non any transformation function It doesn't have to be step function anymore It can be any of the other non Villa activation from Jim But you're going to see now Yeah What is the importance of this activation function What rule doesn't play into rest Merely We'll see that on Let's move Oh by the way this function G this is that only the activation function What goes on in your little It's now this one This one earlier in now 19 eighties nineties and all your network's the Nana activation function used to be signore the logistic function Okay The reason why it has largest in consciousness it is smooth on It is continues There are no gaps in dysfunction minus infinity to flush Plus infinity can be captured by this function smooth and continues That is a very important characteristic off the activation function that activation functions are supposed to have for your mural little toe work You know that the grading descent right and grading descent When that devour Deeks is calculated we've ever dicks cannot be concluded at any point where there's a sharp bend in step Function there to Ben's instead function There are two banks If you look at state function Yeah they're to Ben's here The D Viber dates is not defined here so that great it is and I'll go to let this point do partial better that this point it'll break So for you to be able to play great indistinct automatically to insist the weights and all things the activation functions have to be smooth and continuous on except for in one case which is contrary They're to be smooth and continue So the choice waas sigmoid function in 19 nineties and to thousands more Okay so step functions have been replaced by sigmoid Let's move No be a bit of this all imports We'll go to all the neurons in the first Get in there in something you don't take any new down here inside than you know it'll be first Alina submission followed by non related consummation of the output of the linear submission Every neuron will do the same What will differentiate the neurons of the weeds And one more thing When you read about this neural networks and all the things in books articles and all those places you'll often be shown the weights here like adventuring A lot of people mistake that the weights are coming into the neurons No weights are not coming into the neuron The latest incident explained this way This is that extra distances in X tree to show that relationship between waits an Xbox Trixie We put it on these lines but rates don't floor out off some very good Then you don't know rates are defined in an area inside the new normal like we did for Rosenblat's neuron be created A great sorry Remember that So that's part and parcel of the definition off the Rosenblatts neuron Similarly here all these weights are talking parcel of These are professionals They don't slow in from anywhere Okay once this out this calculation is done then output off Every neuron goes to every other Nero in the subsequent on they look at the subsequent layer Again Same thing happens there Also they opened up The previous lives are multiplied by the respective rates The result is calculated on that resembles on was the no limit activation Okay And finally the court tells you don't put your own tells you if it's a binary classification it is able to draw the line with separates Two classes in higher dimension long lean years space the input space might have in a lenient space But the result of all these actions is you end up in a non union space We have the two classes become linearly separable and you're able to draw a plane *** like I'm not clear with one thing and that is when you're taking an input into the model Why would they not take the weights from the real world as opposed to introducing it into the model again becomes a certain amount of bias elements Why would it be known Just take it from the real world and you take this well First of all already be pervades in the real world No So race is something that we're giving a certain higher consideration to something Let's safe even if its feature selection it is coming from my understanding of what it should be However if I take the universal sample and see let's say I'm doing the diabetes analysis Every individual body composition is different to people can uniquely yada grace instead of me assigning know this person shows a higher body composition of our lord's protein So this is lower rate as opposed to the re deciding and labeling the prioritization What if I take the feature selection from an individual composition and say this itself is the week so Well uh the thing is when I take a sample from the universe on in the universe between diabetic No never leave the tour course on these perimeters There is a relationship with them but I don't know what that relationship the relationship it independently to the input variables on the classes is actually captured by the weights And there is some sick off wait in the universe But I don't know what those Swedes are So to understand those rates I draw sample from the universe And in this sample I do feature engineering feats of selection Okay on in the sample I see that between F one and the classification if one is a very good classic for driving with no diabetic gets a higher week if two It's not such a good classified of diverting non diabetic gets lower week right So I decide That's vase Based on what I observed my data Okay on those weights are actually found out Who iterations using reading this interpose and all the roach The reason why we cannot have the age of the universe is we're trying to understand what the wait are we don't know and hence it is very important That's a sample that you have is a prude of presentation of the universe If the sample is not true representation of the universe that the waste that you have discovered in your sample will not reflect the action rate in the years So your model which for boats very well in a controlled environment will not work in the nose into errors in classifications So the old idea of building the model is to discover the weights If I already know that waits Then why I mean do the morally we don't need the mornings Yeah right So it was actually to discover those rates The rates tell you the relationship with the input variables notebook discovered that relationship Discuss those weights with Bill The mornings I do that great in distant back propagation in all those things But if the sample is not a good representation of the universe then all the exercise that we're doing is going to turn out to be a waste because many put this morning production will predict Diabetic There's no negative dying No never Just excited reading a bit But it basically more Arabs than expected You're saying something way Take a random wait for yeah And then based on the mathematical calculation we try to adjust it to get the minimum on the optimal rates that we have We're hypothesizing that these weights are the bait in the universe That is our hypothesis All models are organised Hypothesis Payroll tomato the null hypothesis We're not like oh just stays between these variables and the classes Latest new relationship That's why you are further do a statistical analysis based off the borders Are this mortals a reliable to be put into courage Tell no one Rates are derived from the features by looking at you Okay fine We'll take it We'll take it off But the fact is I want to find out the relationship within certain parameters and average non damn idiots in the universe Right That's all the factors how to access the universe How do we get the data from the universe There's no way Okay by the way since the point has come to that let's discuss and trash talk What is the difference between a sample of the videos Okay she started first What You mean your sample would be like out of 1000 I haven't leave 500 data and I know they did more than 1000 1000 I don't know What's the number exactly That would be sampling That is the definition which we have given in school Call it everywhere Okay But the real definite difference between a sample and the universe since universe is dynamic change sample is static For example if you're working one of these taxes every sport has stopped me on You are a data centers have been asked to build a border where the model takes as input Tow the points the starting point and in the point be off off a journey You have a you have no is to make How much diamonds don't you think A simple model Okay imagine anymore You have to build a border for this for which the company gives the all past One year later the one your transactions that this is done with various best wars were found from different point days before Point these on that you're trying to build a model today But while you're building the model testing the model and all those things more data points are being gendered into the universe Whatever those points they're not part of your modern really into size That is one point The point is the data given to you one year ago But one year ago there was no construction going on the debates going on now with the bangle doors So the world outside the reality old says exchange safe between It is certainly old on Gorman gliders to take off in our one year ago today takes 45 minutes Right So the universal citizen universes dynamic There's nobody if you can't control it So the features which are important one year ago may not be important features today All the features which is not even there one year ago might be playing a very important role today So universes dynamic their features become important Unimportant new features come old features disappear But the sample on what you're looking is a static sample and you expect the mortal threat to build on the starting standpoint sample to work in the regionals Well your news outside So because difference between universe and sample is not the size size is one of them But that is not the killer The killer is universes Dynamic sample a static more dynamic The universe is more problems You're in motor difficult institution You're kidding Hence coming to your cushion I cannot discover those rates between features and a verdict non American the universe because you know this is changing That's why I'm a sample is to be large I'm hypothesizing that the importance of the feature debates beating the features and the class which I discovered heroin sample I'm hypothesizing that big presents the relationship Finally whether you're boring what's or not You'll come to know are leaving the rubber meets the roar That is when you're deployed in production In spite of all the started sickle analysis everything that you've done you might come up with a mortal of bombs in production It's a possibility So we do all these things to mitigate the risk of failure in production but it doesn't guarantee it will not fail in person Right Sheldon One Yeah Okay So I love to show you this animation took me for needles to do this so I can treat my dear little too Given the imports Find out what category belongs to give another set off imports or can a great belongs to OK Otherwise it's a useless Are people a lot of time to build this That that's what I want to show you But there's a technical flaw in the skin in just over the floor And to be in that Okay Was it a fluke You're right Whenever giving imports to a mural It were that more than new Really not have been roasting birds are responsible When you give any inputs to the new network the data will flow from this neurons to all the nuance And subsequently I told you the output of the neurons goto all the neurons and subsequently But only this They are part of this new Ron If it's a probably if the unions are offering a property values this boulder is high Hence it has been hard for insight This poverty is Lou Hence it's not okay So keep in mind in do it deep in dense networks But you're going to use now all the neurons will send their outpost all the neurons and subsequently Okay Jena Malone Okay So you're saying we're in supervised learning with Yes Thanks This'll one Yeah these awaits No no these are rates of this new role over here on spates of these the inputs are coming from the previous Larrabees rates their rates When you start the neural network these are all random numbers through the back propagation grading descent approach All these numbers get fixed That's like in a best fit line You started the random light Eventually the best decline the most optimal waits upon These become optical doing the back propagation Sze We start with random lovers So be it Yes does it on it So we don't have to do it Okay let me explain this point on the board We haven't your own here Let's take only one Dirac inputs are coming Tow this x one x two on This is the bias Neuron The bias over here this is Rachel started Bias So I need three Rachel here Doubly one flew to Dublin Three This is doubly one shown us W to chemistry So lean operation would happen then you do know only transmission here No political order This the big invade all these are random numbers That's like a growing random line Indian tradition obviously explored the best way So between my hang on why there's an ADA This mirror is again used as Rosenblatt demonstrated he can be used This era is used to it Just all these weights So through the back propagation grading descent level about whatever happens finally will reach a point where the cells minimized order to zero in case Of course Then you'll see that these numbers are the optimal Unger's Opie 10 P to open three These are the optimal rates Then you have these weights please inputs then Europol error is minimalist You have any other leads here they will go up So what we say is the algorithm has learned to represent the packet between X and Y in front of these sweets These are the lessons learned formally All the needles all the wheels Absolutely Yes yes Is all the new Don't start with random rich but to the back propagation and the great in distant and not had gone into the Beatles affect all the neurons learned the optimal Bates Yes And accomplished No our prison finally rose up We'll look into it So in this case we have two hidden layers right I mean in the national depiction Right So does it mean that each of those hidden layers get I traded like multiple times until you find the optimal out Right Just like what you learned in linear regressions Grading descent constant Okay And also a long talk over this Dunblane But yes morning things What happens Yes Question Okay Yeah Hold the reads off Each neuron influenced the rates off the other Next You asked a very important question Uh which the person who designed the back propagation of it from here His name is Jeff Ringtone Along with the teen Okay Jeff Fenton They designed this back propagation on Apparently he wants announced he wants claim that it works but I don't know why It was a very very important statement which will understand Why did you see that on the reason why he said That is the question that you're asking in that algorithm There is no way of finding or what is the impact of change of rage in this new dawn in the subsequent Newton There's no way to find the boat And because of that that something happens here So we'll discuss that when you contemplate interested Yeah give this question in my luggage Well listen let's move Or are you already okay So finally what happens is all these new ones want to actually do to your feature space Just like any other album They split your feature space into compartments where each compartment each block belongs to one particular class If you're doing English alphabet character recognition then each compartment belongs to a different characters of the inner self If you're doing a digit recognition each block belongs toa different Digit zero tonight on this is what all Anderton's do position three also does this naive resulted Does this gain An octopus Is they basically split your feature space Inputs face into compartments Tobe able to classify But his actual noodle committal calls it us A lot of people ask me New life Look is a wonderful classifications The whole research in Italy would started the classifications Why If you look at yourselves day to day activities that you do you'll see that most of the time you do class we start by questioning us So should I get off the bed now or not Then surely go to office or not What should I do about breakfast this back off back So most of the time we do classifications So hence naturally the research that happened to make computers do things for us without me telling them how to do was based on our Kareen You really can do so Regulation ALS You can be with medication The only time we do the graciousness butter getting appraisals and usually the boredom Several Oh it's Rachel We are never ever to find that I think Okay you know all this discussion that we had Let's step back and go back to Perceptron because it all started from there But Citron had two weaknesses One weakness Waas It required the classes Toby linearly separable Which means they should be gap between them in the fetus Peace There will be no gap between them on the individual dimensions But when you put them together they should be a gap If I project these points here there's no gap between the red and the blue No cabbage and red and blue But when you put them together you see a gap between them with the fetus piece So if there is there linearly separable in the given features space then the Perceptron can find that gap for you which rendered like you start for whether you start with the random line here Always start with a random line here you will find the gap for you But given my this is training set in the training set you're trying to find the best best week like okay you're using a person troll so precipitation is guaranteed to find that gap for you What's for supper alone does not guarantee is in the training set to give a good results but will give the same result intestines if not guarantee Why Because the moment it finds the gap it stops It doesn't see that if I draw this line like this you can't do much better because this line is going very close to one of the leaderboard And I told you sample a static What if I take another sample from the universe Do you think the points will remain of the same prevision Possibility of the blue points jumping into the wrong side is high Hence in the other sample the same perceptual modeler the reporters comfort of this one This is a weakness of the positron It guarantees you performances trading but not in testing What is the use of that tomorrow The other weakness of the Perceptron bores It cannot handle extra gate which is not clean Elizabeth from the first weakness game support vector machine it is going to maximum margin classifier from the second weakness game your newly So both these powerful Everton's the route is this Whoa Okay the only this does this I'm goingto on They're never gonna see murals There's something interesting scored over there Please visit the Ural on both of those Hey all this paper these days with you The deck is there with all these beacons of it The reason I'm not giving this as a PdF Is there a lot of any missions here So I want those animations to invisible This origin of Munich poopie already seen this Please visit this Wikipedia site where it discusses why you lived with this old universal function Approximately So now let's get into building blocks off modern You're legal Once we have this building blocks with us then we can go in and start building on The 1st 1 is activation functions in the neutrons The second park The second stage the neuron does is lonely New transmission Most non union transmissions are called Activision functions Okay First it multiplies input signals with weights acts those weighted signals then convert Cemento for the stone steps We need those nonunion activations There are multiple functions available in mathematics which can be used over there The purpose of these Activision functions is to decide whether the new ranch fire or not fire in the origin when the researchers going on But today all neurons fire on letting his properties will be decided But this activation function it is important for another purpose It is to prevent your neural network from collapsing into a single person What you mean by this Imagine this is your new book Fully connected Deaths near little on In this newly work you only have the linear part You don't have the nominee That's how you show only plus Now take any part of this new religion I've taken this part of G I can't represent the G here Suppose these are the way disassociated I can represent Gs Look at this in Portuguese Coming from the it's coming from it's coming from If so I can represent the open of G s really minus two e plus money It's a simple linear addition Nothing else Second person G out est really minus two we just wanted But the day itself Look at the dean You Lord It's taking input from these three ABC So the day itself can be represented as one April's Toby plus three See these are the wait's over There be +18 months to be post pc same EQ and represented as minus three years Two months Same with this Do your simple algebra You'll see that it all results in this but this is a person broke You're implementing a possible on here and a participant cannot handle X or gates So enter noodle It becomes equal into possible on It's no use if you don't So to prevent this new relief from collapsing and becoming a perceptual the non mediated activation functions are introduced into the mules So what prevents a network from collapsing into a positron is the nominee activation functions that we use in today's modern new So that is the important role of this activation function Oh yeah you're beginning between two layers Can't wait to be different for the mutants who definitely is within the layer itself New ones can have different plates across late also So what are the different activation functions that are available to us today have listed on Well if you may They're two different categories of activation function which is called piece wise Linear functions and smooth functions in peace finds Vigna functions You have step function Really Carrie Lou perimeter shifted so many variants of it small functions We have the signboard the smooth three losing more logistic hyperbolic dance which oh fortunately most of these I kind of fuse Either initiate yes or they're not used at all Their function is pathetic Not used it all And once which are used mostly which you've seen many of the implementations is very low Licky really do this You might still see some people using signore in Spanish but rare But these are the two important waas on This is a cortical dashboard off the different activation functions How do they look What is that Expression in mathematics On what Discard the different station of those functions Do you ever the ex that this is where I want to slow down Aren't a picture all if you are on the same beach Do you know what is the director off function Be idiots Anybody wants to have a discussion on back Palffy tow us Don't hesitate Shall we discuss that for a minute Yes Yeah I can sing same start I'm sorry Any questions No Okay Doesn't matter We'll first go through this This is called linear Transformation which is not used for activation functions Doesn't convert your unit Look into possible So you know this Come to the next one step function used by Rosenblatt again we don't use it in place World Ignore it Come straight to logistic regression You're done Logistic regression It's called sigmoid function This is the transformation for lost What happens in logistic regression is Oh should I get into the deacons there Okay The transmission is one by one Plus he lays to pour a mix Plus c All right This is Dr Submission Yes I know I need to do logistic How many months Four months back Three months back Quite a long time back so I can understand your expressions No Okay All right a little quick Take these things So we have ah two classes here Um there are two classes here Suppose this is all triangles This old green points Not trying to pick a long time on that Gordon Density of the Greenpoint decreases on This is all the blue points And there's a golden dancer with the blue point decreases This is your imagery monthly Also expenditures No You're to find out whether you're working as if he doesn't is in the bank You build a border to identify before those of $94 possibly does give it to you One of The attributes in the past is very interesting and reboot It's called Image Month Beyonce All expenditures in that everybody notices on the loose end of energy There are more greens between physical to know the folder on the highest of amity You have more blues They're losing before them Right side door density plot Between this the density alone of green will come like this on density for blue will come like this before they're known for So you see that this entity is able to kind of discriminate between the Buddhist delusions So you want to make use of this image Ito building models So what you do is on the y axis I Plourde here probably be off before I'm always interested in Then before orders I give it a run off one again the value of zero So in this accident this is zero This is one by the way something which people kind of missile everybody Mortals We don't base Morris to detect what is normal We build models to detect what it's not No When a billboard in sadistic before the roses nor before does most of the customers in the bank are normal customers They have known deformities They returned the loans on time Very few exceptional cases Who before But those cases don't want to be very costly too Very busy Morning So pretty diverticular Predict not everybody Population is dead Very few exceptional cases of diabetic So I need to find out who though I haven't been from So when you do this classifications will often see the class off interest to you For Richard building the model is on the past which is not represented equally less represented by your data ports Okay so we're building the mornings to detect what is not normal You're not building models to depict this law with me on Dhe as a practice for produce In case they're in binary classification The non normal classes given label off one That's why you will see in payment Every day is diverted Closes non diabetic No never did Zero And dr when you look at your default bank data sick defaulters is not before you'll see that the fortress the value of one known before Hey so what does Okay I'm finding a relationship The probability of before the increases as image increases So this is a positive relationship So as the image increases probability of before it increases So I call this probably belonged to plus one increases So I see a positive relationship with the truth The express is possible relationship between the two What we do is by the way this is the only training sick in training said I already know who's defaulters nor defaulter So when I used this line over here what unhappiness All the blue ones will get shifted over here All the green ones will remain on the bottom because I already know their classes were in training set We already know the classes So when applaud this this is going to represent probably on oneness class before the zero is known before That means all the blues are already guaranteed to put the forgers So property of before this one all the greens are probably of default a zero because they're already agreed below that So what happens is this distribution which is surely in one dimension Now on this tour two dimensions the distribution books You have something like this Yeah it looks something like this All the greens are left behind on all the blues are there There are some greens here on their sums Now what the largest aggregation does is it tries to fit a line here which will represent the relationship with this and this On that line it Fritz opposes this life This line will tell you how important this attributes is to predict the class off the variables that will tell you the coefficient of this line of smoke The light if the slope it's closer to zero That means this really think this accurate is not a good predictor of the class But a lying will go to infinitely on this side and infinity of the site properties cannot be greater than one or less than zero so line will not give you properties So what you do we send this line through this transmission What it does is it creates the sigmoid curve which goes to zero minus infinity which goes to one that plus infinity in this ignored anybody who's on point Flying point flies this anybody else on this point side of the point fight belongs to class one Anybody on this side of the 10.50 Okay so Sigmund is used to convert your input variables where the data is available Input variables It is used to separate them out into as far as possible So signal is an only the activation from it's actually belongs to a leaner plus classifications The third view sigmoid function is to separate out Look at this two points which are really close to each other on this access on this excess begets appreciative depending on the orientation of the signal to go Even if there is a small gap between the two classes of God and in higher dimensions space the two classes become really close That is a way The signal it boss the choice off Norman Activision functions in a release off morning noon English Are you all with me Then We have damage Also damages almost similar to that but it rains It's a minus one plus one This ranges from 0 to 1 No I just talked about Really Then we'll more Okay Don't need toe No need to memorize any of these You just need to know how they look on There's one particular problem with sick more than manage will distance tackles You don't need to memorize these formulas You don't need to do any of this Are you all with me shall I Don't want any questions Any notes Now you said that night of memorizing the questionable But whatever they interview perspective is Well if you want to prepare for the interview point of view then there are a lot of things which I think are useless But you need to be okay All right No I tell you what If the person was during the interview serious about Port is doing all he or she is doing they last conceptual stuff Clarity on concepts Okay if you go to some of this our innovation well known organization for interview there's a concept It's okay Can you also know Do it on short waas there You need to know the mathematics behind it In some places since this is being recorded I'm not going to record here and not use It means they'll give the white board and asks you to come and write the court and show the court lots of local really court so different from who's entering But the Demory crowd which I come across three drew us If you want to prepare from their point of view level and so many things All right so once again a beat for the purpose that feature will come here we're going to work on the little build models and all we really didn't Don't need to know but he'll always be good The gun explores some of these especially the real the signal manage which I will anyway do while doing this Plus we'll do that Okay So started Sweet answer to this right now It's not apart but be prepared on radoncic Modern times usually the questions of the monkeys Okay Sheldon Mom look at really rectified lenient units This concept is border from electronics If anybody's done from a literal it's so familiar with this value Your ex in electron is the prevent backwards flow of current The coast of current is going in the wrong direction The circuit will search off Okay The same concept is used here in room in really function This is the real function Rectified the new nicks this side off the function is at 45 degrees Always which means at 45 degrees means whatever extra saying will be the wiles in your lean in regression when you have a line at 45 degrees This is 45 degrees Whatever input you get give here you'll get the same output here This and this will be seen always If you give a five here openly loads of the fight The reason for that ISS be right bar d X How much white changes when extensions But one unit extensions by one you're it So this six How much white changes when exchanges By wondering if you'll see that these two are want one each They never exchanges with one unit Why will also change for one unit This will always be one What we see is in trigonometry we say tan off 45 is one reason What if we say this is because of this So I'm really function You should take the input from minus infinity toe plus infinity with a zero here for any values in port greater than zero equal to or greater than zero This is always a fortified cities for any input value off less than zero The Ray Lewis Oh Chrissy So it is a combination off too Linear peace is one based wonders Okay on DDE it is not gonna news at this point but still the bathroom grading descent What's on it Because they're zoom good This this is the viper dates that source of fascists Remember Dates a short Is that what this is At The 0.0 at the point of zero or greater than zero input values 00 deliver dicks is about in exchange Esposito Among wild changes by zero So actually it should be zero But what This is at the point of excess It'll do zero or greater than zero Do you ever take this one always for anything less than zero When it's this negative numbers then the better than zero The line is flat Okay this is your divisional for really We have a variant of this that is called Lick You in Lake Erie Loop Give a small oracle slope to the negative side also Why do we do that Why do we need that small slope Really Discuss said don't let the oldest okay right now Just given mine Ray Lui leak You're losing more damage That's it Secret advantage These two will become important to you Then you use further down the road when you come across LSD in long shot the memory But right now for us in deep new liver these have taken a back seat And it is these two which are usually found in deep mourning for these days Questions Any questions Yeah us using like usually So I'm making one on your left would be applied the same function across All neurons are you can use a combination off So in a neural network Okay In a given live in giving Lear you have to use the same activation function The girls all the new toys But across layers you can use different activation This can't be real This can be Spanish This can be something else Say signore So within a layer all mutants are the same Apparition functions across lays bacon inhibition Shall we walk Yes Session It's not fine Yes it's a grid search That is the new silence is golden Yeah function You have to Yeah a lot of you that there are a lot of things that you need to discuss about this activation functions Which one of these Activision functions will give the results quickly There are some activation functions will take a long time in the training set to give you the results on something here Quickly say when you bury this morning's dip your little piece models They're not off a lot of non functional requirements that can be canning practice negatively One of the known what It none Non sexual requirement is your competition resources the time Time you have to do build a body's Okay now which activation function you use that will have an impact on Lee The time fact at the time taken to do the training if you signore it for instance and you're in a very specific situation where we call the other function is mon convicts They're signore functional slow drastically They'll take a long time to converse and give you the business so we'll talk about these things down the line when we have some more ground to cover A very important points We'll talk about this These are all different from what is it like This wasn't like you didn't use a mike Okay so the evacuation from senses what we actually defined in the later ST Andre will be constant And that's what our intelligence light switch activation function tails Okay don't move What least cost Thanks Okay let's move One of these activation functions do One is the privilege Your neural footfall collapsing The other thing that they do is they help you to classify things in hard times in space where even a small gap is magnified and the classes are pushed apart Which is what I was trying to demonstrate here Losing an animation Well struggling with this I accidentally came across two beautiful sights which I'll show you Don't the light look after this So you have an input coming here This whole thing is one You're wrong This whole thing is second hero This this is the architecture we have This first neuron is this Second you noticed this same input is going to both because of the difference in the weights The lines are oriented in different trees Okay Now the same input which is going here This also going here because of the difference in orientations cost But the difference in raids This line's production is different from this line's protection You see the here It's tight of hits Spit it out When the output of these two they go to the knowledge in Activision functions this only spread out this only state There you see Even a small gap between them gets magnified over here on this also gets magnified A look on when this all 4% of the subsequent nude on the terrible where this becomes one feature this becomes one feature The classes get start getting separated off the classes which are not separable Here they'll start getting separated out I should have shown this in different color They start getting separate It'll just like poor Dasan image but the same thing So this is what happens You're leaning Space gets transformed into knowledge It's peace I'll show you the same thing in the euro's the two euros which I came across Yeah Now you have two classes here The red and the blue The red and the blue are not linearly separable So when you speed this data so the new network What happens in the Newman for there Look at this This is by a gentleman called cola Very famous personality in deep really puts these days So let's see what he has to explain Goto He has given various examples The example which I'm going to show you Is this Okay How your linear space gets transformed into a long Penis face And as a result of that what happens to the classes So he's taken this example Watch this We received from the beginning Okay Inseparable You're leaning spaces getting squashed from all the directions said that the two classes become linearly separable All this is the result off the nominee recreation across all the neurons put together on the class Applicable so the two classes are becoming linearly Separable higher dimensional known in your space Hollywood If the two classes the red and orange are slightly more overlapping than the previous one then even neural network will struggle to separate them out in the higher dimensional only new space It will not be able to separate the lock New little maybe very powerful allegorical But if the input features that you provide toe Alberto are useless the new little cannot help you So that's because it is a powerful and algorithm It does not absolve you of the responsibility of doing features selection all if you throw useless features that it even this will struggle to separate all the players The same is given by another bosom who's also famous in this world For definite Littles it's name is not Buddy So let's look at that one also There you go The 2nd 1 This is interactive You see here you have a new little here where the two classes are not linearly separable at all decision pre nine based logistic everybody'll funk here they will not be able to do it They're not be able to separate the two classes So what support vector machine does Uh let's see if you can use this What support Vector machine does this You have two classes I'll just take a few minutes You're done Support vector machine right So you have these two classes here One is green and oneness Ah Lou So on the two dimensional feature space the classes are not linearly Separable So what You're SPM does this It introduces 1/3 dimension Where the hell dimension is You take the center of these two This cluster You take the center of this Lester find out the distance of all the points for the century The distance of the blue will be less than the distance of the green So if I if I plot on the Y axis one minus the distance of the beater points What lateness The blues will get lifted up The Greenes will get left down So now I can pass a support vector plane through this and so in separate The class is over So SPM generates a feature for you using the properties of the later given features Okay this is called a radial business function RVs same way new liquid also products they timeto higher dimensions No Lena transmissions on in that it tries to classify the two Now look at this diagram You see the difference within the green and the red It's beautifully separated All the greens from the red You see the bordry All this is red All this is being no If I introduce a great point here Backward propagation constant to play The rates have been mortified registered in the higher function on news piece to ensure that the rain goes to the right side That a new red point is not reckless How would if the features are such that the features that yourself Nicholas that's that they're not good discriminate er's then suppose you have a date upon re point here and here you knew the little will struggle to move these It's trying to move these red points on that side You see that A point You Whoa It's almost done it Yeah it's done it man Okay funny I underestimated I thought a lot of good It's done it but it's separated the greens from the Reds How does this happen The feature space that you see here is no total future space The original features place was a linear feet of space There's higher dimensional nonlinear features space right Please go through these two sides Very beautiful sights The way they have discussed all these concepts with you these two are giving it on the people The oneness by cola You come across this name when you're doing a last year Thea Other one is the best time for the education It is uh I think this is gonna party site to famous names in the world off big No no of course There are others also Lisa Yeah yes Which activation function News No Neutrons noodles The more than your own Subsequent Iran's become hired them So two questions I had one Was that the heart the feature you said the projection off features in the higher dimension space These features are coming asked as inputs am I correct Thes are in port features So the original features itself get used in the higher dimension to create the classification Then the second point I have is is it possible that in the I know the hidden layer has no interaction of the outer world But in the hidden layer it is possible that you can realize that Oh since I've created the stratification there is extra information that can be used For example in the California housing data they had no feature that was showing them the place Correlation Then they said Always divide square this and divide about this and I get this number Whatever it means It has a correlation Now in artificial neural network are we using dye features Also can the features we use we changed in the subsequent layers Yeah all the way The one Lee the first student layer uses the input features on the data all the subsequent needles and all the subsequent lives You deny the output off the first layer of neurons That output which is there is a result of the sigmoid activation of whatever it is decoration functions They're all different features right So hidden layer of neurons actually make use of the right features in guys That's not surprising Even your logistic regression is a better future Your input features amici but what your logistic regression uses is not a Michi What it uses is the leader model that you created as a book not just a regression one by one plus e rise to power one by one plus irresistible minus off this thing Let's call it G your lot of six sigma Tsar face this issue Z get us original feature waas emoji But between a machine property you content mortal leaning more host infinity So what you do is we take this in immortal use it as a feature I'm counsel Listen considers Michael right All of her illness So many of these citizens do that the original features are transformed into delight features the dealer features are used for act Immorally shall be one Any questions Okay eso whatever distance too low Whatever discussed since morning Forget about history Yeah distributed but history And on Friday we started discussing the best new liver density Liquid is a network off neutrons but they're all the neurons in a given layer are connected All the movements of the Beatles and all the new equipment Okay then we discussed that uh in the airport play the number of neurons It'll the number of classes you know except for buying a place in burning classifications You need one the one you broke But nobody stops you from having two mirrors But if you're going beyond two classes then you have to have as many guns as many classes Beating your own gets dedicated one plus 100 litigate and your own and output left one class You'll see that No Okay we'll see that when we distance off max function Then I talked about what is still forward propagation with the entire data flows with the river network Obviously when you start the noodle literally for the first time all the way to a random beats hence the predictions and the phone started oration will all be wrong by chance By flukes all of them The difference is era There Dennis used purchase of eights using back propagation How does it happen The technical details are not discuss with You will see that also that Iris used in the back propagation tojust all the base Hopefully the weights adjusted Rachel optimal weights And next time that I used this weight on the Internet that's it Hopefully there will be zero But in reality they even Aaron It's never easy roads many mice What We're happy with it So those sex off which were happy with those sets of eight we sent a borderless land The relationship it in my Amex If you look into each year on each neuron takes the imports linearly transforms them used a linear transformation as a feature sends it to use ignored girl on every new loan business It does a linear transmission all over the overall effect of this ISS back near liquid level You're working in a very high definition space on You're working in a non lenient space and normally you space the classes which are otherwise not separable They're becoming second so we have the Kovar Stadium Command to play informs neurons in the labs We have a common goal of freedom coming into play Inform your records on all this along with the non linear activation function Lady You want coffee No Are you all right Okay All these things put together you're able to see the magic which is so just know happening when other algorithms will fail a neuron network to do a good job Okay All right Some more details are still pending Discussion about nonlinear transformation function but it's too early to business those So I'm going to jump to the next one which is called soft plaques function Have you by any chance heard of this before Soft Max ocean Okay Now let's imagine that you're in my class classification case on you're using different religions so I'm going to show them you didn't really look as a block and the last open clear you have or here Suppose you're doing oh digit recognition 0 to 9 Reminisce Do this Egg zero tonight How many classes are these 10 classes These airplane classes right So I'm very meticulous Classifications 10 closest as many classes You leave that money noodles here because I want to make sure that every neuron is dedicated One particular class I want a fast You don't have a ticket for zero The next neuron is dedicated for one Next one is for too sensible in the Iran started classes Is that number at least Are is equals tow You don't have 20 You cannot have 20 neurons Is it for one class So if you have like 10 class classifications it's always honest Okay The question is how do we make the neutrons dedicated themselves to one particular plants How do I do that for that What you do is suppose your input data that is coming in Then put the times various features X one extra incentive for X N on the new The label over here What are these values Maybe suppose the label is evil There's another record with some values label Say one What I do is I can work this part in tow One hardcore did variables You know what are courting vegetables Well if you know we're not quitting So how many classes possibly take classes So when I can't get this in tow one according what will happen is each level here will be represented by packing Consisting off I suppose this is eagle Tzeitel will become 10 123456789 10 one will become 010000 This is one you will become This is too Okay Are you with me on this Are you all with me on this Okay Now suppose instead of giving this is label I give this as me This is my way So have fast record first record This is the way I have a second record second record This is the way third record This is the way So what are you telling the neural network You're saying boss whenever you get input like this that put you with this or is this the end Iran's here I want this to fire I don't want all of these to fire when the input is second record Second record is one What I'm telling the Newman Network is many of these values Then the fighting should be this You're not fired Only this shit for him None of the other ship fire So when I convert my wife variables and one according and use it as a part of my training set what we're telling the new networkers with neurons to be dedicated for which class So what can happen this after the training is over Supposed query point comes in this court appointed central This quite a point whose class we do not know quite important constant and Caribbean goes to this What will happen There's all the neurons will emit an output The output could be C for example some numbers a Pfizer this 6.36 The celebrity said 101 102.30 So once and for all of them will emit some numbers Some of them might be negative Negative 76.86 I'm just inadvertently pulling some numbers because this is all a nonunion fascination or could be running numbers literally floating point Are you all with me now I cannot see that Since this is the max this is the class that should be in I can't say that because wrong numbers cannot be seen a strong bodies How do we convert this raw numbers into probably bunnies for that What we do is we sent each one of them Each one of these outputs descended through function Corti race to pour whatever the numbers supposed number This is supposed oracle are one are two are nine So I say irresistible Minus off our I I could be one of the president Okay let's start from zero Okay on then Bar the doors either Is too poor are divided by some off Isaac Go 0 to 9 years Support our Sorry I'll make it simpler I'll make it simple You got the wrong number See these are all running us now We can put this Ron emotion The property What I can do is fight 76.36 They arrived with a total of this daughter But this is the wrong approach The reason why this will be wrong approaches this minus and plus they might cancel it A drug The minus numbers and the posting numbers can cancel its growth Okay so this is not a good effort So what we do is we transform all these wrong numbers in tow erased a poor minus and the beauty of this invincible minus Let's call this wrong number either Four minus our number The beauty of this transformation is it convert every number in true positive number two legal possible Even if they put this negative Give Boston Just look at this Supposing put numbers minus 76 here is too cold Minus 76 Is it gonna one by heat is poor 76 house of her small A number it may be it is still a posted No So that is the beauty of this game that you by using us right come into that we come to that There are two reasons why we don't do that One is cancellation There's one more reason So what we do is we send all these numbers to erase your minus The result of that will all this We're posting them Are you all OK When I think this through this irresistible fi 76 verses even stoop of minus 76 Officer this is the very last positive This very small Put me on a few Okay now when I do it is for Faison the six by the total off All the days to pull us all these eating Suppose we're very good Red are in and means totals Similarly I do it for all the numbers What he'll get is probably with this p I We won't be too between You'll want to get all the business probably letters Then Osama ball this case It was some of the one that is a requirement of cover devalues Some awful probably should be one this transmission that you're off raw numbers into property values This transformation is called soft lights A lot of voters linear regression No it's It's similar to but not sissy Similar What modesty Yeah so soft Next function is used to convert output off a multi class classification Your network where the output is raw numbers into probably Juries That is what you saw Max So they know you're doing classifications Neural Littles especially when you're doing Monty class classifications Very a multiple Iran's Now quickly you have to use soft explosions Are you all with me Is that all Yes Okay That advantage of converting them into properties is now I can say for example given the import the probably that it is a cycle these three times the probably that it's a ship So I can do this related comparison all many times more probable This is to belong to this president Other class one is that requirement So I conduced artistically analysis Using this probably varies which is not possible isn't wrong numbers the next Next on one page is when I want to cancel it How do we define ever tyrannous actual minus predictor If when you're doing some Oscar let us It doesn't matter Virginia for put first Next Okay if the actual class to which I expect I expect expected profit everyone right If I'm in putting a zero I expect the poverty of this to be one and rest of them Toby zeros How do we counter terror I can't read That really backfired I expected probably minus predicted Probably this better conclusion I will not be able to do if I use that all of us Because in raw numbers and some of the numbers are negative I'll not be beautiful Defined layers That's what you can return the soft plaques and I'll put the soft Max is used to find the others Axl s the problem The decisions Not to me For your honorably Are you wondering what is going on Sure And in person Yes So here what I understood is it order the hour come from all the player is pastoral function calls off max And then you take that there's actual or put yes I get it So the soft Max will be an instruction with algorithm Whatever outputs come here This is not a different layer of you know something It is It's an instruction to the algorithm Whatever the output of this new network transform it into productivity's Okay So soft Max Okay Uh I didn't go What you thinking Are you with me Sure Okay good Okay let's move for the propagation We already discussed forward propagation Is your entire data set going through Neural network from the initial layers Still doubt declare that is called forward propagation The result of that is an error Okay And too lazy to do me any indication So I just took a snapshot of a white board which later on I realized it's not so white enough I told you in the beginning I told you doing that after the break All neural networks are nothing but Macronix algebra We really don't need to know about these things but I just trying to show you an example here So you're a neural network then put values of these points on appointment Pointed off the cuff No reason why Porn 9.8 There's some example So this gets stored in an metrics All the weights that you're having here these weights are shown on the connections But as I told you these weights are inside the neurons 0.9 point three in 30.4 is inside the neuron similar 0.2 point eight and point to these air inside the neurons they're stored in a day inside the neurons Okay so what we show here is this is the metrics 0.9 point 2.1 belonged to the first You know on second you don't own your own So this forms your layer one Okay When you multiply these two through the daughter operations the result of the daughter operation is some output which is shown here at one point I think 66.42 and 60 that again get stored in this thing metrics which then guilt gets through on which you performed the signboard operation all part of a signal depression for these three neurons and stored here in a Metrix this matrix again gets multiplied by the weight metrics Over here 0.3 point 6.8 point three Ah point Oh I missed it up Imagine this again Wait Matrix this weight metrics get multiplied with this The result of that is an output This output undergoes a signal transmission again here And then you get all parts of what you see here is diagram It's one leaf or explanation It's money for into Shin Nothing of the sort Actually it happens And either what actually happens under the hardest Mavericks All it so entire neural matrix matrix operations have lot of tensorflow by agents Sensible We're going to do tomorrow Tensorflow and care us pencil floor is engine computing engine designed by Google on the world Spencer comes from the fact that in mathematics one dimension Larry even one scaler value one dimension Larry Prudential every three dimensional All these accords sensors on Since the tenses undergo transformation the floor from here to here to give the outboard This whole thing is going tensorflow Hence the name tensorflow toe that engine Okay so we're going to use that tomorrow and see what it is Yes ma'am You earlier said this is a black box So when at every point you're ever toe um given name to the function So you know that you start from Image E and then you applied some function Got the probability and then you have a subsequent explanation which are functions Why do you call it a black box No I want you to explain it in simple English Okay Why are you before God I didn't find this offensive reporter so I can't go there and the court of law and say in a word this new one given rate of this that you don't get rid of this It's in explainable to a layman whereas your data centers my next memorable I wanted to basement Freeman If I use a decision tree in decision theory I can follow the part I can print off those parts is English rules And put that ass my reason for you I did find some days before Yeah So banks because of the laws they have around it you cannot But otherwise mathematically you can say applying these functions we get to this point Yes And when we say English white books it means ordinary implements shall move Okay I'm not going to cover too many concepts Then this is against saying that every step is a lot Bye Stumpy Already discussed I had to jump this old too can have liberty of jumping this night Okay Ever functions very important Rule the play in the definition of all well your your model works inter function in this case I'm sure you an example of square later least quit using the new tradition Okay Now let me explain this to you I think you would have already seen this talk about two Then we'll wind up but yeah another five minutes with my many are better function or defined like this This inter function mathematically has a very good probably the probably school convicts property Which means if I block okay I already discussed this morning This is competitiveness y minus a mix plus c raised apart too That means there is a function off am and see So if a plot a graph between error on the different combinations off MNC that I can have then this plot will always look like a parabola There you will have some combination of MNC refuses The least error may not be zero but least any other combination of MNC will give a hider Okay The child's off error function is very important given the problem statement a tag if I make youself a simple Kordic function Then I have an advantage matter functions We're going to look like this on this What the grading descent elder will do us You start with any random MNC what do the other you're doing It's We'll find out for you It will gravitate the words that combination feminine See which gives us the least er on the morning that you've been using these to that model is the best fit Like Oh live All of okay In logistic regression you have seen another Erica love loss If you're doing bad reclassification using logistic regression there two classes They're zero and one a class which belongs to one Okay in the training that you're going down in the train say a data point which belongs to one the more it is identified as one Okay the more it is identified as one the more confident you are that it is one day every four don't This is area This is the inner call for glass one where this is the probably belonged to class one as a problem A data point which belongs to classman The more the property less of the error in your predictions Well as a dead upon which belongs to plus zero The more confident your model is that it belongs to a class one Your elbows off This is a class here in your training set You know that this guy's laundry photo But your model is very confident that his before it's on the higher side of probably that means it's growing bolder So this girl this world class zero this covers for class combination of these two gives you one point very minimum misclassification So once again no clothes happens to be a convex function A convex function is a function which has one absolute minimum Okay ricin can use this This morning's who us for your project Okay here's a nice guy right This is what I think Useless Okay lets more listen Okay Now the challenge is Look at this I haven't a tribute on this Attributes of I've stopped with misery will continue with this tomorrow on this attribute of years and green points here on dhe we have some new points here We have some green points hidden here Also followed by new points here If I fought the tree short of what I want us to put a treasure somewhere I want to put the Bordry somewhere here where I want all the I want all the black line like men It's in my pocket Okay I want to put a treasure in such a way that I want all the greens to be on one side And I want all the blues to be on The one said this is what might ridiculous So I put a boundary here If I put the boundary here All the dreams have been misclassified So you're in early for drawing the center function You don't leave your very time That's a bunker shifts there will come down as a bonded ships for the blue point start going to little side so they don't go up on As all these blues are getting misclassified that'll go up on once again with the green comes in they don't Gordo once again When you put this on the rates of their real claim up So you're inter function It's going to take not a convex back You're introduced non convexity They introduced local minima severe if oceans the reason why local minimus creep into their function Even using SSC even though you're so dramatically supposed to be like this Mathematically it's supposed to be like this but what this decides whether your function has local many months of not is the Vader data points of distributed features So even if I use all screwed it us But our data distribution is like this I will end up with local minimus on one absolutely mind and the problem is fancy Once you're grading descent gets stuck in local minimal it cannot come up And unfortunately if the local minima happens to be something here and it gets stuck here then you cannot come out of it Neural networks are blown to get stuck in local animals The reason for that is even though each neuron east neuron individually gets an error and it's Bates each neuron a place the grading descent On a function like this the submission off these convicts functions is not going to get up on this The overall effect off all these convicts functions coming together is not guaranteed to the comforts Hence the final Opal Miran What will happen is that a map It's inter function with the number of iterations iterations on this side You notice that the orphan ship comes goes like a six photograph So initial few neurons if you map their error function they might be smooth But as it turned down in the Lear that if it brought their ever function of those iterations you'll see the better function goes down but not smooth It's just me see smolder And there is no guarantee that you're not get stuck in a local really muscle unit It wasn't like these So you know what If we have like multiple points we start with the multiple points at least you know and buy it in a multiple iteration Shouldn't we have a chance that we actually hit a global even with multi link A data might have like 10 20 local minimus I can't It's not that it can have So the newly truck and started only one point Yes it started 100 but we take like 50 or 100 different points Um points starting starting point That's just you're going to run this mortal 50 or 100 different How do you know what In the footprint of illiterates maybe 101 but your chances off us hitting a global Oh yes will you Much higher But the problem is how do you define empirically out How different Objectively we don't know On once we reach a minimum there's no guarantee that way Don't let this go The the good point iss It has been demonstrated Object early that in a neural network when reached the global minimum usually you are in the over figs all so it's better not to reach the global minimum Get stuck in local minimus But the local minimus should be closer to global minutes So this is again a thing which I came across in one of the research papers where they've demonstrated that the absolute global minimum in a duel it can actually be all third kiss So instead of not if you're not able to read the closing in on nothing to worry as long as you're stuck in some local minimus close to global But how do you define global You said you cannot know whether that is the best condition They're define that global money must be reached are likely to be work How do you like no other This graphic we get is an output irrespective of which function we use We'll still get to this craft You will always find that era functions are not If I understand correctly so nicknamed what time parking is The model is nothing but a collection off those who Bates for each of those neurons Finally you're immortal is defined by a collection of grease those weights That is what we call the lessons learned from the best on those weights Express the relationship between in its and out most opportunity Right Okay with that weight circle cartridges portions slopes Bates all does that mean for money class It seemed that there is a similarity it's got Yes it is so easy for buying any class also in the same doctor or you're getting direct Then how we're getting there is no one here Is it true that acting in logistic regression when using the last layer in the last new tone when you use that saw the logistic regression article sigmoid function Not part of that is always a plus The lower one Absolutely one The thing is when you're doing multi class classification then you're any problems There are so many logistic regressions running permanently all of them cannot give zero and one It's there to give some door number So when you're doing logistic regression also if you say predict underscore approval in suggesting predict then you'll see that it also puts the problem numbers which is a floating point numbers That is a roll numbers I'm talking about Now I imagine every output neuron our ports up number running number Then how do I make sense of it So we presented from herself maximum but herding binary Uh listen classifications then you don't need this off next because which are numbers higher it will predict that is a class What modifies the default could off always That's what we don't need that soft Max Later if you're doing vanity but nobody stopping you from using it If you're using to neurons no Any other question Is there any chance that same They have nine in the last example in years and then getting point It's possible then how you determined up I know it was a brilliant physician decision Please notice a decision to me very carefully in the branch Nords Off Decision Tree You'll sometimes see that in the Nords They're equal number of records from both the classes but still the notice assigned one label known defaulter already for two It's still assigned the label that happens through what is going on tiebreak So whenever I could get into a tiebreaking mechanism where you both the classes are equally possible then it chooses one randomly So if their decision to you next time very carefully in the branch nodes you'll sometimes see that there are equal number of records of both the classes But the notice assigned one particular class so this is called tiebreak This happens in K nearest neighbor Also it happens in all algorithms such a trying to draw boundary If any point sits exactly on the boundary then you don't know which class it belongs to So I don't know when this can be done appropriate Know what is appropriate time as a sort of no position like converting one You know a A product No let's say Alexis or anything which is you know and can we say you know the Where is this the your electoral fits into that whole picture like from you know and doing if it is possible just to understand where this company pretty well nobody ever asked me this the first time This this kind of request is coming so off Okay I don't have an answer for that I don't have anything ready to share but let me think about it I think we can do it But as I said yesterday that Alexa Google is instant They're all very high orbits We're in a very lord Great but this is a starting point from here You move into those orbits right on Dhe there It's a culmination of an LP plus vision Plus everything will come into play I'm talking about not Alexander's things I'm talking about the other things which you come across like robotics and all It's a combination of electronics electrical mechanics vision and LP everything together Hi Good morning Right Milty ill I'm not committing but since you asked I'll definitely look into this If I'm not able to present in the class I'll share it with the training She'll pass it on to you So I know any of the question So do you remember what we did yesterday By the way Question comes later But do you remember what we did It's kind of difficult to imagine that you don't have any questions That means probably don't know what you're obviously Okay let's start today I'm going to start with hands on Okay Once we do some hands on and we see how do we implement all those things Then I'll come back to some concepts and two important things which I need to cover today A basic introduction toe tensorflow engine This is not going to be a training on tensorflow engine It's going to be a basic and direction because you can't do justice to tens of flowing for us on Get us These two will secretly after seeing the cool what you're seeing her in front of you actually care us Hear us on Bite on in action Okay so take it through this How do you implement this Will this is um concentrate and I'll come out of this I'll take the intensive locate us What are these things then Once again I'll get into a hands on but I'll use some image data Set a very famous image data center It is often used for training in ah NIU illiterates Okay And then I want to spend a few minutes again on the grading descent and error function These are very important concept so I want to spend some time on that on Then Lastly I will discuss with you what is called the chain of secrecy where when you do nearly books amongst other things that we discussed one very important thing that you need to be a bit off is what is called vanish ingredients vanishing greens and explode ingredients Ah very common problem that beginners in deep neural network will come across Why don't you face those problems and how do you open overcome those problems We'll discuss that But majority of the discussion will be left for another topic called Piper Perimeter Tuning When you do deep need new network hyper parliament returning then we'll go through majority of those things Shall we begin all if it please get into Jupiter And Ah Diana would have shared a bunch of course with you today Today Today I modified the cord yesterday a bit to make it more self explanatory So the name of the final is the same but it's sugary today Morning Oh yes it's the previous There's all open toes the movement Let's share This is absurd People are not really working there for their enhancing those features and all those things says it's open source community which is supporting them Okay in this there'll be two by phone cords I p p i n b chords One of them is called uh be planning immunised modified National Institute off Some technology Apparently I believe this is a body in either Canada or us who collect a lot of data for machine learning The generate a lot of data for machine learning That's why it's called M nus digger Okay don't don't run the court Don't do anything I want all of you to confirm whether you got access to the court It's in today's in class middle Priyanka I got it Now what we're going to do is we're going to use a tool called Cara's Kira's is an open source tool It is basically a kind off on a P I which makes building models for deep learning Very easy Get us get us makes use off tens of flu in the industry out there today there are two very important computing engines recalled and comforting engines which are very popular and very famous One is Tensorflow from Google Another one is by torch from Facebook Okay Both of them are equally good by Dodge It'll be extremely to your advantage Extremely good If you're familiar with both Okay If a family with both we're going to take you through tensorflow So right now we don't need to worry about this Try to gain some more inside some more foothold into this area than what we're going to cover Not very difficult but at the same time you can't take it lightly Tensorflow are you already get us waas A sorry tensorflow waas A comforting engine which has designed and developed by Google engineers for their internal consumption's for their internal research in the area Off machine learning Not just definitely though it's popular for deep in your little it can be used various other competitions Also subsequently they released it open Source Take care us on Uh on just a few Maybe we're not won enough years ago 2015 actually 2015 They released the Russian two points it off This it was not final release It was some kind of al for beta release Whatever Temporary lease But recently in 2019 the finally released the 2.0 worship Get us two points It'll okay till they're two points It all came in Obviously We were using one points between 1.0 tensorflow and two points of tensorflow They're trying to make tensorflow easier to use by hiding some things that are earlier exposed to the user that is called the graphs competition Graphs now competition graphs and all those things are hidden under the hood Okay People who still want to use that methodology of doing things they can continue to do that But when you and I don't know tensorflow too and start working on it we work on a new way of tensorflow to not the old one Okay has by any chance anybody here worked on tools Such a spigot HaIf in big data begin Hi You worked on which one I'm talking to you Hi Um what does I do Correct It translates all the qualities that have given high into my pretties jobs Right on Do you know that I'm sure you know that high is a lazy execution engine Yeah Similarly there's another tool called pig which is a lazy execution engine We use these two on big data technologies to make creator do not produce jobs What it means is you give the set off instructions Those instructions are not immediately executed You declare a number A declared a number B then declare another number C is equal to a plus B These two engines they keep noting Don't I have to do this I have to do this Have to do this at this point out to create a variable called See at this point after added this variable in this valuable to create see sound so it just it's a to do list They don't immediately execute your commands and give the results That concept is called lazy execution So in lazy execution what these tools do is the tools generate a graph from the starting point The tools generated graph and the grafts could have branches so and so forth This is scored ah directed a cyclic graph Dags Dogg Yeah veggies The advantage of doing graphs ISS The tool itself will scan the graph on dhe Optimize your execution steps if you're done the same oppression in two places Multiplication between say two variables C and B If you're done it in two places will know down on little copy that result off scene today into memory and reuse it wherever it's acquired It will not do it again and again looking at the branches it will see which branches can be run in Berlin which branches and which are patients can be running parallel which operations need to be run in sequence Those things which can be running parallel parallel residents those things that that cannot be pearlescent running in sequence So that graph based approach vertical lazy execution had its own advantage Where that wanted was when you optimize the operations the results of us that your application will run faster than other ways Okay But when you're doing research on you're doing some statements or their operations in there and you want immediate results to see what is the impact of the step that was not possible in this graft basement hood So what did it is intensively or 2.0 They gave you what it's called Eager execution In eager execution there is no graph every commander to give the commanders immediately executed on to get the results on the screen However they also have given your facility that if we want to continue to use graph because it has its own advantages then you can still generate graphs in tensorflow two points It also But the fourth behavior of tens of 2.0 is eager execution Eager executions means no use of graphs You'll get immediate results Where's intensive for one point Little You'll notice that after every step you're not getting results You're only getting meta information There's a big difference between the two and the other Differences Both caterers and Prince of Flu actually originated in Google I think they were done by different means on their running properly evolving independently Cara's used to support various other engines not just tensorflow But recently in 2019 when the release washing 2.0 they have taken a decision that Sarah's in Tensorflow will become tighter and tighter integrated Eventually Kira's will stop supporting the other company engines But for the foreseeable future both care us on Tensorflow caters So when you don't know Tensorflow now along with the Tensorflow Kira's comes bundled with it Other than that we also have separate one So we have tens of Lucas Kato's on We also have independent killers available today Both of them will continue to evil But eventually this will I think fear doubt They'll they'll removed They'll start supper Stop supporting it So what they're advising today in the market is they never use a kid Us trying to use tensorflow Kira's as much as possible because eventually this will fade away Okay Venice that eventuality We don't know What we're going to do today is we're going to use tensorflow 2.0 on We're going to use the chaos that comes bundled with tensorflow 2.0 between the TENSORFLOW Kira's and this killer's as we saw it was not in this class it of the class There are some differences in syntax There are some differences in the Norman creature off the various functions that views So there are some differences Looks like the differences eventually start growing bigger and bigger So to be on the safe side we're going to use tensorflow to Pancho on the chaos that comes bundled with tensorflow 2.0 Okay all the 50 All right many of us go get please distribute worked at this time Mr Actually what is care us in intensive Okay Curious You can think of this as a utility using which I'll build my deep learning models as we're going to do know Okay What It will do it Transform all those things into tensorflow language for us We can directly going work on the tensorflow core itself We can directly work itself But the learning curve for tensorflow is much higher than the learning of for Kira's He didn't see me get comfortable with this in a matter of a few days But this is not so easy Sibley Based to caresses it's ah no it's on You based We will use it No it has its own commands Will import those things functions utilities and on will be But it's very simple Any of the cushion selling one Okay Ah yeah The Google column which you're using right now by the former Google collaborates still supporting tensorflow one points total However upgrading to tensorflow two points of us A simple commander here to give the commander here to give us a tip install But don't give the command right now Don't give it Don't use it Okay all If you are in Gurukul No Okay Please go to Bullwinkle I want youto you open both the files Deep learning wind or deduce It also did not goingto type B y and be on deep learning m in ist daughter Be Wendy but use both of the will use book on the wine's data set is what I will start with first Okay That reminds me off another point while I'm waiting for you people When you install tensorflow tensorflow can make use of GP use graphical processing units on that makes things very fast Okay but to be able to use the GP use you have to have another library for NVIDIA called Cued up C U D e this c uta earlier had a full form which subsequently they dropped Okay Andi I've been trying to memorize this It just doesn't fit into my brain every time it slips off Uh it's last a something to do with architecture Okay Development architectural C stands for I think composite Uh I don't know what you stands for Please find out NVIDIA uses this word Cuba c u d a To represent a bunch of libraries which they have designed They have the design Toby used along with their chips When you use them When you install the computer library then tensorflow when your download and install you can install tensorflow for deep use When Tensorflow discovers this cure delivery then it through using these libraries It makes us off your GP use if you install pencil floor GPU version on your laptops without this library Then by default introduce your si pues it lot of intestinal abuse So with artist envious libraries it will not use GPS on dhe I believe NVIDIA If you want to use ingredients this libraries then you have to have their chips No it will not work with any other vendor chips only So we will be working on tensorflow force abuse Ready for what Okay Shall I shall move on all of you Ready Okay What I want you to do is open the wine's data set for deep learning wine We'll start from here Insert course Ill insult Of course L insert Koertzen Move this Course it up What Insert Of course L inserted a bouquet here What I wanted to do is what I wanted to do here is you can either cooperate as it this import tensorflow as stiff on friend Be if not hyphen hyphen lotion So I imported tensorflow ass dear Then I paint a tensorflow worship This version is a special command So you have to give any special functions Have double hyphens in front of the double life before enough run that Phil Yes we're only in Coolum I'm doing it in collapse around the cell We're choking the bandwidth when the sale and you see the ocean is 1.15 Any problems It's ready Okay Okay When you're underscored you'll see that your tensorflow version that is available on cool Abbas 1.15 So in 1.15 I cannot use tensorflow carriers though they released it in 1.2015 I think along with the 1.5 only 1.5 So what we'll do now is we'll update this tensorflow First the updated tensorflow insert cold cell again Exclamation mark Use this exclamation mark Bite on installation package Install tensorflow equal equal to 2.0 Pippen stole dance floor double equal toe If I install it will do everything Yes please upgrade kennels Yeah you can do that Either use upgrade or use this This land in stolen greens Tolliver this is an collab This you're working Collaborate This is Uncle All right No You need to restart the engine Restart the vertical connection They'll ask you Okay Once it's done this you see Restart Run time You're the click on restart Runtime Olive please don't miss this You're to restart the runtime Otherwise it Lord Shock So he started the run time Yes Now go and see your ah tensorflow abortion Now when I would see the tensorflow abortion the sugar two points Yeah Now that tensorflow version should be two points It Oh now we're in a safe territory Now we can go and executor court over David and vote for What is it of You're not a blue Did you know they're under on time No If you if you install it Given time button at the bottom Restart Run Time is there The bottom of the screen are the bottom of the screen in the locked file GC restart You're doing it on Google Collateral at Google Collaborate So just do this again People stole and restart Don't forget to click on this Otherwise he'll get better We also have something all people ist if you look at People list which I think I have kept it here Uh okay I'm not sure that kid this one more call papers you'll tell you List off all the libraries installed and then you go in search Tensorflow what is the future of Tensorflow But that is a long shot So there's a better way of doing this Okay Shall we move on Are you already okay What I wanted to do is come down These are all standard fight on Commons What I'm going to do it There are two data sets available on juicier One is scored The white wine one is called the red wine Have you seen these two data sets earlier No Basically to data sets One day they came to the red wine When did you get to the white one I'm going to combine these two data sets and create 11 single day Does it now Our objective ists looking at the various characteristics that tributes given to us in the wine's data set Can we predict whether this character stick is for a red wine or white wine So we have to date a sex right and wine I'm going to combine the two into one on We're going to build a model where the model is going to take into account the independent variables on it has to predict whether the vine is a red wine or white All of you Okay The reason why I did this is the attributes in both red and white are same Attributes Point number one point number two If I look at their distributions of these with these different wines on these attributes it's going to be a complex distribution not linearly separable Yesterday I surely what is linearly Separable data sets what is not So when your distributions are not linearly separable across the different classes on the various attributes you're simple mission and conventional machine learning algorithms such as your largest a cork A nearest neighbors may not give you the kind of accuracy that new letter just like him to give you Are you all with me Not as idea behind mixing of these two letters It's so what Will Luis will directly don't let the data said read the data set from the urine So important partners a speeding umpires This thing and then I'm using Read underscore C'est rito Read directly from the Europe Please go ahead and execute this line Going Execute this scored So while it's executing the can move on If you want to see Look at the structure of the two fives after it has loaded They're the same structure Same data types save number of columns But keep your eye on the number of records One of them has 5000 records almost rounded off The other one has 1006 100 records The classes are skilled imbalanced Okay it's done We don't I don't need to do this We don't need describe statement here We can just ignore this or you can just fire the selfish Okay let's go in and fire this Describe statement also please fire the day of describe both for white and for the red The reason why I asked you to do is there's going to be difficult But look at this You know to interpret this day of this crime Have you done this before Yes right now Look at the volatile acidity If you look at the distributions off the white wine on distributions off the red boy almost similar on all the columns Not very different similarly or to look at all the clubs But in stuff doing this what we'll do is we'll do a pair plot Okay so before you do that come down read the number of records in each We already know the number of records is 5 1099 Fortunately none of the none of the two data sets have any problems such as missing non values anywhere or any character there in in in vehicles That's what all the all the columns are showing 1599 Do you understand the significance of this If your columns have any missing sorcery Nan's not a number or any non American character has crept into any of this columns Then the numbers will not be same across the columns Yeah okay Fortunately we don't have any problems with those data quality What I'm going to do is on the red wines data set I'm creating a column court type You can call it anything you like and I'm assigning a number one to it The other is the data frame called White in that also I'm creating a column on assigning number zero to it So the zero and one are the labels They're our targets So this will be our target column And yesterday I told you know normal The one which is underrepresented Usually that gets the cold off One There's a practice Okay Halo It's okay then All I'm doing is I'm a pending the two files I'm red dot upend white No index It acquired So what You get us wines This winds is a combination of the red and white wise Let's go ahead and execute this You can have a look at the some sample of the data using Taylor head but the stale or head is too small You can make it Us Ah it depressed me just more Or we can do one thing Insert Koertzen so we can see here wine dot head say 50 You know what I knows Okay Shift in tow Oh I didn't run it Okay Uh I didn't run this strange I told surrenders Okay Wine wines wines W n e is okay But you know what I don't expect to see the two classes again Here It's all one varies in the previous minutos on zeros Okay The reason why Because we just kept the 21 below The other head will show you off One class tail will show you the other class So that proves that we commend it to friends Okay let's move Spreading my daytime two drinks a test it But before you do this before you do this I would like you to do one step So insert after the previous head statement insert a court cell insert a court cell Okay import See bone as a sentence Okay on We'll see a sentence dot pair plot Uh what is this Wine's on Um Katie E Colonel Sorry Dik dik B i g underscore kind is equal Do Gertie Followed by um Yeah You Hugh human sculler Okay Um yeah type So who is paper wines He might be I don't remember the syntax Exactly I hope this is a syntax shift and do Sometimes it works So we're doing a pair plot on wines Data set We're saying in the pair plot the diagnose should be density estimates and we want to use color based on the type How many types of there too So they'll be do colors that will be used in this plot It's almost really okay So while it's doing it let's move on I'm going to split this daytime to X and y independent variables and the dependent variables on dhe Okay Very well We got the plot So if going to the plot is going to a big plot Yeah it's pretty big plot Okay No I'm interested only in the diagnose Whenever you're in classifications in classifications always start your analysis of the paper plot from the bag Nels Okay In this bad blood this is a square matrix Whatever First rule will be the first column Second rule with second call So doing a scatter plot between first true First column scatter Plot is meaningless Will be a straight line Seven should do his program But the fall But I don't like instagram I want this density Estimates kernel density Estelle's Now look at this What is this telling you How do you interpret this plot There are two clusters The types the two types of wines there to natural clusters But what This is what this is clearly taking us is fixed Acidity is unable to discriminate The two classes when the two classes overlap especially the peaks of the two classes overlap If you look at it both The classes are almost normal with orange having slightly slightly longer steals But both the classes are almost normal Okay but whenever you have distributions where the two decisions have overlapping like this the more the overlap the poorer that tribute for classifications So this is at the best of weak attribute for classifications for certain range of values The problem you're finding orange is greater than probably defining Blew this range similarly for a small range of value here But in between the two classes a recurring almost similar density Don't look at the number of points I'm talking about Density density is number of data points per unit lent off this attribute Okay a week after boot Look at this This is looks like it's slightly better than this but even their significant over Matt this oneness Ah almost in my view it's gone Look at this one In none of these attributes are we seeing the two classes separated out significantly for the nightlight up hypothesis to be rejected If you do hypothesis testing If you do hypothesis testing of the first column say for example this one it might be difficult to reject an ally prosthesis where not like photos and stays There is no difference between the orange and blue but we know they're two different classes of lines We know that So this attribute this attribute all of them looks like week attributes They look like we get the boots Let's see if you have some strong attribute somewhere here This one Look at this one This chloride Look at the clue Raid one You see the two peaks are separated out They're overlapping Overlaps will be there But it clearly shows you the two classes are separated All good discriminator family If you look at this one look at this one This is Ah total self for dioxide It's quite very good Attributes may not be very powerful but it's not a week attribute for certain range of values I know it's going to be nothing but orange for other range of values I know there's going to be blue The reason I'm showing you this is this data set off wines Data said Collection of red and blue As you've seen yourselves it has a very complex distribution in their decisions are not linearly separable The two classes have not linearly separable Now in this case you will look at this one Look at the boundary between the two So when you have such complex boundaries between the classes not here to put all the dimensions together and visualize which we can't But what is coming out of this indigent vertical buy Very analysis ISS The distributions are unlikely to be Lee nearly separately in the given attributes So let's use noodle network new network You know it makes us of those items project in daytime to higher dimensional nonlinear space We're hopefully to be ableto separate them out properly And there's one more belief that we follow in ah machine learning that individually that reverse may be weak But together the week attributes become strong And Bruce you have seen committing a nobody Yeah in that you have a help line You have seen this program right I never watched the program What is it Fine watching somebody else become a millionaire If it's coming to me I'll be happy right So in that program there is help line that help Linus polled audience Initially audience may not be very high in their i Q or the general knowledge But put together audience rarely go wrong Right that that same belief is brought in here initially There two birds may be weak but together this week at the Boots might give us a strong classified without hope on with the presence of some strong classifies Let's Gordon see what new leopard can do for us Come down the familiar trained a split Uh okay a point which is apt to be brought out here whenever you're dealing with deep neural network based models The first cut the first version will never be satisfactory Very rare That first version satisfactory So we'll be tweaking hyper perimeters there to make it perform the way we expected to perform Whenever you touch hyper perimeters you should at least have three data sets not to training Validation Christie we make use of training and validation data states for the tweaking off the hyper perimeters The test data set is used in the last step Just before we're about to put our bottle in the production isn't going to give me similar performance Okay You know why we do this I promise to prevent war The score data leaks Data leaks can happen in different ways One of the ways that data leaks happen is when you split your later into training Set test set on Use that data for hyper perimeter tuning Also what are hyper perimeters Can you give an example of five per perimeter in Kaneda Saber que number of a number of neighbors Okay there is phone hyper perimeters Orin decision to the depth of the decision Trees hyper perimeter Hyper perimeters are integral part off your model definition When you define immortal the mortal is defined when it create immortal The model is created with some different values for these hyper perimeters When I go and change the hyper perimeter values whatever model I create that mortal subsumes these values off these hyper perimeters Okay so hyper perimeters are integral part off your model object that they define the model Now I got my training set Test said I build a model on this I tested on this A curious is not good So I go and tweak the hyper perimeters to bring higher accuracy I do great search on I find the parameters will give me good value It's like building model again using the new hyper pyramid of values What is the use of testing this mortal on the same test data Because you're hyper perimeter values were a function of the test later So obviously you're mortal is already experienced The tested of the patterns in the test later based on which you tweet hyper perimeter's not going to run this mortal again on the test later to test it What is the use It is like exam question paper leak Right So the model it gives a good performance here may not give you good performance in the production world so we always split our data into three When we touch hyper perimeters train the mortal on one tweak the hyper parameters on the validation set Once I'm happy with the performance is it going to give me similar performance in the production for that user testicle Yes please Like me for testing Usually it's luxury ritually hardly have access to Usually we don't have access to that But if the access to that facility Please use it That's the best feeling We generally release the model in Al find Peter which is similar to board Easy Yes Sometimes we don't have sufficient data Vitter's to split it into three on yesterday I told you by splitting our data you're introducing modifying the distributions and hence you're introducing biases So when your data is not sufficiently large for you to split it into three without losing too much of us then you scare for the constellations All right so what Your method I'm going to show you here It's good only in the class Don't do this in your capstone projects And don't don't do this in your production in one Splitting their dental training statistic There's only four classrooms All right Okay let's move I'll say run the same again Onyx Who was that cushion Yeah OK no problem See what you do is you do a train to split split Ah on the X and the way Okay The result of the strangest split is we call trains training data extreme by train and we call it X test writers write science of that You call it uh x underscore Train Well you can give any name you like extreme white underscore Trained Well the other one is ex Enter school test Why underscore test Not these two You run the train test again The split again You understood again on these two So I see a train to split on I see x underscore Greenwell comma white underscore Train them This time I'll put you capture it as X underscore Treen Extender School Well bye Underscore Train going to score Well which means you don't run this strange desperate choice If you do this then it's okay If you don't use this train desperate alone then you're using data leaks Shell No one Okay coming back to the court So we're going to split our daytime The prince intestate There's good and do it You can check Check your what Princess Plate does is it randomly splits daytime to training statistic The train tests commercial uses internally random function It randomly selects data to make a training set Maker testing That's why when you do this why underscore test I'm just printing or the 1st 10 labels in wine Underscore test You see the combination of zeros and ones even though we stacked them We did not mix them Train to split command randomly picks data on creates a training set Test said That's how you see the label Savory All right What we're going to do is we're going to standardize the data we're going tow You know what It's standardizing interviews ing the wrong numbers which have coming from your fine begun to standardize that for which I'm using standards Killer What if standards killer excitement is exportable Started division because he used the standard division there That's where the name started skills What he calls he's courting Yeah So let's understand its killer on this and convert our extreme on X test Both do not apply your standards Killer on the output variables A lot of people get good vertical confused here should be scale our output variables Also output variables have to be predicted based on the input variables So what you scale is body scale is why is equal to F X This is the model What the scale is this the white part We can convert in the one heart according and all the things That's fine but you shouldn't skill this one are you Okay Okay Same question comes when people do PC principal conference analysis Principal component analysis is done on the inputs not in the output If you're doing PC removed Output from your analysis first Before you do you see okay coming back to We understand the scaler Look at the size now total of 5017 records including the red and white I'm sorry 100,000 records Now let's get into what we want to do Build a model using deep new liver If I was using the earlier version off Tensorflow then I will say I won't be saying from Tensorflow Cara's I'll simply say import Ah sequential from Kira's I'll don't locate us Then I'll import sequences from Kira's But now since we're using tensorflow 2.0 the chaos comes bundled with tensorflow 2.0 That's all here to say from tensorflow dot carriers lot from the standalone Kira's don't mix the two If you mix the dough down the line in some of these operations you will have a problem Seven So from Tensorflow caters we're importing something consequential What a sequential There are two ways off building your deep new little mortals what is called a sequential approach which is what we're going to use The other one is called Functional approach Functional approach is much more versatile much more flexible than sequential But sequence is much more simpler to learn First okay on functional methodology also is very simple If you first learned sequential then you'll see that Britain functional and secret till there's hardly any difference But functional mythology gives him much more flexibility than sequence so we'll start with sequences So what I'm going to do is I'm going to import sequin Shell Then I'm going to import in Cara's There are different types off layers that come into play in deep neural networks The layers that we have seen in the class yesterday was densely dense New Littles But if you're working on say ah CNN then we have other layers Also such a convolution layers spooling layers various other ladies Those lives are not required here for deep nearly books that were going to do the one Lee layer which we need for deep neural network The model that we believe is dense Yes yes it's the same Yeah then ah from Kira's layers within the layers advanced activations This is basically a bunch of activation Function is defined over here Off those there's a package of activation functions off those I'm importing Okay you can have steak more You can have Ah tien age You're gonna have a list of the so But we started by initializing or mortal that is creating an empty model This is called instance creating the model our initializing the more or less makes this is a low we have important directly from KERA standard Oh I didn't notice that Fortunately it won't matter to us because Betty Ford it's really walls If you want to use any of that one then from tens of locators here to do that Okay Good observation Okay I'm doing mortal sequence in I'm in stand sharing the moral on creating an empty model here One question How do we decide which activation function we have News Billy Hunter here No question No it's not a choice Like you have eye screens in the parlor It's big It's no body Mint waas Your This is a hyper perimeter Which activation function gives it the highest decoration General Izabal mortal So you like to play with different once then see which gives you and sometimes one single activation function a lot support you You're allowed to use different activation functions and different layers Welcome to the world of deep neural networks Fine tuning and training A new mural little bit Knollenberg is the toughest one of the toughest things that you can do indeed assigns Yes we're looking at an accuracy school off obviously 100% How would we define that certain moral Edie or effect His question is how do we designed with the moderates or fruit or in perfect That's what you're asking me Other How do you decide how to do that with over fit around different Probably that it's over for it increases when it goes 200 But how do you decide with the model is or fate or under it I don't know you No no no no no Yes You should always run your mortal both against training and testing simultaneously When I when I say training and testing in this give string invalidation simultaneously on for still both of them get similar results There just about put into production I production is it before that you run it against the third tested the pristine pure tested of which has not been touched a low If the scores continue to remain high on that also then probably it's going to General Lee's Nothing has got indeed okay So the only way to find whether models under fitting a role for Tiggers do simultaneous besting both on training and your validation sit and finally testing on the test It also what is the occasion So united inactivation walking that direction functions just provided by encircle kindof works off Can I write my own activation Yes you can dance floors Extensible Cara's is also extensible You can write your own You can do that Lot of people are trying to do that They're trying to find a different activities and functions because every activation function has a civil limitation For example if you're using mortar tan it's You have flat regions on the surface where if you get stuck on the flat regions on the surface your training will become very small on the rail Ou on the negative side the great into zero It's the developer Take zero there so if you get stuck on the negative side of Feillu than your bureau in cell phone dead They'll stop participating in the training part the footwork So we'll discuss this down the light we'll discuss it So people are trying to do research and see if they have some new activation functions Right Okay let's mourn Ah yeah What I'm doing here is I'm going to add the first He didn't live so that the hidden layer is called dense layer because every neuron in that layer is connected to every input on every neuron in this layer will connect every nuance of the subsequently so model not add dense I'm adding a densely there are different types of less than you can And as I said I'm adding dense live here And I'm saying number off units number of neurons He wanted that layer 30 white 30 No reason because if I had put 20 you last night by 20 right So put some number here starting point Unfortunately there is no guideline on harmony Neurons issued stock but they don't know formulas Nothing We have to try on these things through brute force method using grid search and all What these numbers should be These are all hyper perimeters But what I do is I keep the number off neurons here at least equal to the number off attributes in the benefit Okay What activation function you want to use on each new dawn In earlier All the new ones will have the same activation function we're using real here What is the shape of the input that is coming in the shape of the input is 11 columns 11 attributes because we go and see the wine status Safety test 11 independent attributes coma number of rows We leave it blank A number of rules you don't need to specify It'll automatically find out I can't defend the columns also because there does It is dead with it Uh can you not find the columns No You need to specify the input shape for the 1st 1 Subsequently they'll find out themselves subsequent layers will find out because then this means that you know unit there 28 can select and only something like that I haven't flexibly to select the less number of columns Well good question Honestly I'd never tried that out but that might give you a runtime error You need to try it out Check it out But I'm not that good question I don't have an answer to that at the moment Yeah Can I give less number off value here than the number of columns in your data set But then the problem is which Collins are you looking at Suppose I get five here Which of the fire you want to put here So that's why I am expecting a runtime error there Let's start with the given features If you're not happy with them then I trade back on Do my feature engine feature selection also All right Coming to his other cushion Do we need to give this My feeling is we don't need to give Visit will automatically detect Also I may be wrong Okay because I remember something related to this happening in one of those programs courting which I was doing when I forgot to give the input plane Was it in this or was it CNN I don't remember that Okay so right now I'm giving input ship I'm giving Levin columns Number of roses left Then if you look at the next one I'm adding a densely with only one neuron because it's a binary classification on I'm using the signal on Arctic activation function Largest take a regression So I have in my model I have one Densely I have one output Lee this is hidden Live This is our place The input layer Is your data okay Yes Place Yes So you've taken just one there So if if we suppose we wanted to add one more left side of the immortal not advance and the same set off neutrons can be different I've given example here We'll do that We'll add one more layer to this and see what their efficiency improves The acres improves So I just kept your cable Copy isn't here We decided this is the last day of the last one is Alfred Lee I get it How It will decide Little less ordered the last money without land Ok she's asking How does it know this is the last layer Doesn't know Since you're not defined anything beyond this there's going to be a real quickly No no no no no Even I can start with this as one Right all of you Okay okay Let's go down Yes Makes you killed one because it's a binder Anything What if somebody has given a tree even though it doesn't make sense But somebody has given what will give you an interpreter lumber So you won't be able to just see what deters I will be able to see But it won't be able to interpret The numbers will give you three outputs But how do you design what class is based on that Daniela place off banks But soft Maxie will live to classes so it will become a kind off march march We're even the probably in the values after converting Sof Mexico below Yeah so just keep doing X and Martin cedar Is it like you didn't before him then selected is Well I I actually I wanted to show you something else that makes up Then every list I've actually given you the final one but doesn't matter will trace back and mix It will create the country will create the confession out of this Okay Wait we'll do that I want you to do that Okay On the other thing is since we this is going to be my output layer it cast a basic mournful okay in between I can array Lou and old manage and all these things whatever I want But this one I want sigmoid because I'm doing classifications by the reclassification All right What do you define Pillow is on input layer Your data set hidden layer and that all put live This is more to your noodle network will look like but we're still not completed it We need to define okay when this neural network is used for predictions I'll explain all these things to in a vial and in a bit will do that What you've built is a set off layers Okay But that is not sufficient Push my data through that on on the other end You get why I hired you Predicted values How do you convert back into error function How do you decide How do you call your estimate generators So we fostered to define what ever met function I won't use I'm going to use Bryan Ferry crossing trophy now to reduce this error What optimizer algorithms should I use I'm going to use an optimization algorithm called Adam I can use as giddy If you're a family of this duty we can use as Geneva can use a damn Which one of them gives us the most optimal results is what we need to check again These are hyper perimeters No What is metric I want to keep my eye on when all these iterations is going on on on this error function that I miss working on trying to minimize a little What is the material that you want to keep your eye own We're going to use accuracy Are you okay So what we do is mortal dot com pile So all those layers that have built along with the layers you have these definitions all these definitions put together this one model for you At this point the model becomes an executable object Before that it was only a brew blueprint That blueprint is converting the concrete model at this time at this point question together that in Karen's there are three matrices To my knowledge You can go here You can do that You can do that Yes Please send the loss or that's a function to calculate their And 2nd 1 is to optimize it Yes In that error sir Face what l what logic should I use to move from the highest error toe least there So we know so great in distant But then a variance of great industry One of them is momentum Okay I'll discuss about these things today because it's very important for you to know what this is But these are gently part off our model hyper paramedic unit Very adding bias here We don't need to all it automatically does The oldest bias bias is not in your own vices just a constant in your program So by default bias Constance will be added Some random number will be assigned when you start your noodle network for the first time All the weights are initialized using random numbers That initialization methodology is also there by the folded Xavier Xavier mythology off initializing the weeds When you're doing that the buyers will also gets it Shall we move on Okay No What is this Seat pokes And what is this bad size Now in this case were 50,000 records not a large number The 50,000 can easily sit in tow the ram in the memory But when you're dealing with other sets like imaginary data sets those run into lax of records hundreds of thousands of records They cannot all sit in the memory So what happens is during the forward propagation let me explain it on the board So during the suppose this is your deep neural network During the forward propagation on then the subsequent backward propagation the Bates get digested the adjusted way It's No Let me test based on these weights I can't read the data against Eve orders Ater again using backward propagation Minimums of eights No Let me run against the new set off weights and see borders later You keep doing this every time you read the data from here to test the new set off Bates what is the performance of the model using the new set off Bates Every time you read the data from here that is called payback Oney Polk is one full read off dreaming zit The number of the box is how many times you won't read the training's it Yeah sure It's basically the illustrations that you go through back and for everything We need to be slightly careful with the word integration because their traditions within iterations so that causes a lot of confusion Okay So what I'm saying is if you're deep new let works This is my mortal Deanna I read my entire data set here Data training data are intimidated Sit forward propagation Why hat minus Why That Children is the owner now to minimize the error I do a backdrop and they're just awaits Now this adjusted rates home a traitor Do the gift for that I'd read the data again again to a forward drop again Do a white hair This is why I had one This is why I had to compare it against way This gave me even this Give me e to Hopefully he too is less than even But they may not still be zero It may not still be minimized So let me do a back prop bandages of eights again But know that this new adjusted rates I run the entire day does it again and see what is the performance that is another photo propagation So how many times you read the data Sit that is called e books You're lucky No this this is situation But be careful of the world attrition itself Because many things a retreat inside epochs is the number of times they read the file The data file the training file to train your model There is a box You know the answer It's a hyper about a meter You just Well it it would be carried forward The Rachel Bailey find across Nichols Rachel Berry Find across the books How do we want What sort of time should be Probably This is my threshold in the sterile It will never be zero It might be Yes it takes more time to compute your keeper So how do you decide the number off he pokes It should have There's no way to design beforehand Right So given 20 box here maybe 20 boxes not required Maybe get over within two weeks folks So rest of the 18 boxes of waste off competition resource So to prevent such a stage use what is called early stopping early Stopping is a mechanism off If across the box things are not improving Then you don't do that stuff They books come out of the loop So we have that mechanism OK so beforehand I cannot decide how many books I need So we use a mechanism called early stopping Okay Absolutely It's when you have too many parks and you have not applied a daily stopping Then you can end up in all the pope's got over You will see that your training set is giving a crazy of one 100% While you're testing a critic bombs it goes down so you can be an orphan zone with too many books That's why when using boats only stopping is a must But early stopping brings its own problem right so very uh interesting topics But yes we're going What is time It feels like that is just that there is a There is a certain constrained here if any off your back and things in our lives floors bags it hasn't is going to push the leads in a different direction And then you go forward forward backward to Teaneck like one assumption is you should go down there There's no doubt I might just go up because it has Finally he's killed a lot of the distribution It said So in this Games I don't know if I can In those weeds across is a great you're about outlet and Alison's and handling the class has to be done even before you come to the stage of mortal Don't freak because outlines can bring many any of the linear models on to their knees on a new network uses a linear consolation on Since she docked aboard this topic let's take this topic for a second Okay it's not It's not sufficient It's not enough to deal one Leave it out Lands on university It's on single variables It might happen that you have a distribution on in the distribution You have a no player on the distribution You have an old player where this okla is not visible to you When you do univerity analysis on any of these dimensions this out loud will not be visible to you These are called leverage points more dangerous than old place on the individual dimensions of these invisible leverage points This is okay to see in two dimensions Imagine you have how many dimensions of these 11 dimensions We can't even imagine lemons but in that 11 dimensions if there are any oh pliers called these are for leverage points from certain disabling best foot line The best way plane Will you completely gravitate towards that So the coefficients not a phone for you in the best fit line and she said the coefficients may not be realized but you're a box will keep on moving backward Photo backward forward on Finally the coefficients that you end up with the weights that you enter fit for the different collections in the different neurons may not be reliable If this was not there then your best bet Line 11 This right so outlawed analysis and leverage point and Alice is these are all things that need to be done before we reach the model Not fit Questioned all of you If this outlet is not visible to us on any of the university ID and Alison's then how do you detect them No box brutal before in neutral dimensions Yes clustering is unsurprised by thirds I think I told you yesterday Whenever I get to work on any data sets build models the first thing I do is on supports Methodologies I a plane clustering techniques to see Are there any hidden information in the data set which is not visible in the attributes on when Lulu plastering these outlets will appears small tiny clusters they'll appearance tiny clusters clusters a few data points Comfort of the rest of the clusters Then you're going to investigate those sisters Why are they there All right so yes Play all the idiot now or we're doing this on the feature Wise Yes Is there any day where we do on the like Ro Y's exploratory Data Analytics is putting all the features together to understand how the patterns are The descriptions are Yeah yeah yeah yeah I understood Are always analysis Morty Probably talking about is the by Very It'd multi village analysts putting all the columns together What is going on Because that is what we do it like Now you take like on the roadways the data will be different like all the features in one drawer then multiple rows like so if you take through its data I think I didn't get you all the features in one room But that is what against right All the features are we take like each feature 11 column and then separately you know like you take is one instance that is more discuss straight plastering is robots analysis Yeah that's question But other than that there's no we really other than that I only know about the Bible You'd correlation and Alice is But all Colin spoke together No only clustering comes to my mind Meeting was labors levels Okay So resting or definitely heretical Question is exactly for that heretical question Identifies you clusters inside clusters It's like a decision tree If you look at it the dental grand's Exactly Do what your ass Yes So in this circle of any say iterations example of there could be When you're doing this I'm trying to find the minimize Their probably it has ended up in a local minima instead off global no against should be running multiple times to see if we get a global minimum or should be stuck somewhere There's no guarantee that you will reach the global minimum even if 100 million times right then I knew that little is known for that It is prone to getting stuck in local animals Okay so there's no guarantee that you'll find the global minimum unit for 100 times the point of time Very good Ridiculous is that you deserve on generalize ability is not sacrificed And as I said yesterday when you go into the global minimum Or you might actually we're doing a Norfolk here might Actually we're doing an orphan mortal so it's preferable to get stuck in local minimus closer to the global minimum But we don't know where the global minimum is We have to deal with them because they will bring your new models to the niece So how do you deal with them Whatever strategy if you use different strategies maybe those points are because you mixed up data from two different processes That's how they're appearing as leverage points in your letters It shell more and another don't jump Don't be with us We'll all go toe together Okay let's move Ah what I'm going to discuss with you is bad size What is this bat size The amount of data that we have right now It's very 50,000 Very small Among the amount of data that we have may not spread into the memory when you do this forward backward propagation If for every forward backward for application if you have to go to the hard disk on read from the hard disk it's going to become 10 times slow Your training time will be huge So can I bring the daytime to memory so that when I do forward backward forward backward iterations I read the data from the memories of going to the hardness So if the data set is small I can take the entire data set on dhe say bad sizes This that much records it will try to fit into the room If the data sets in terrorist terabytes then re split the data set in tow Bad size We tell what batch size off each batch should be It'll take your data batch by patch do a forward backward I just awaits Take the second batch Do a forward backward and just wait Thank you Uh it's a business No Ugo What Your function is not a federal issue It's not for battle Interjection If it comes to me all the data points are supposed before one particular features You can create different features base and off it I'll come back to a point that stolen Okay Now look at this The data size is too large This is my data So what you do is we split this into batch I'm showing you this split us sequential But again It's random spritz on now One of the spirits Let's call this batch one b one b two b three Before the fire be once comes into the memory on this your model does the forward propagation a dead one Backward propagation and just the weight's OK Initially the rates of everyone You've got everyone and just await you go W to the new weights Are the new rates good again This time the Batch one has done his job Read match too Send the batch to through new IDs Find out the other two do a backdrop I just the weights Are these weights good enough Read the third bunch That's three Send the best veto this E three So every batch is red forward prop errors and just wait for the batch out Read the next batch Rental rates too See that backdrop Janet Very durable Deli three Throw the bachelor Take the next batch to validate these REITs Okay so now what's happening is under one A poke Bonnie Polk is the raid The reading of one full later Fine Within money Poke Now you have high traditions of batch beauty ch Between any poke you have an iteration for batch Are you all with me So when we're unders you'll see a locked file coming out in the log file If you observe carefully what will happen in our cases since we're treated the entire data set off the Beatles and Records is a batch You have seen the lock Final one injury coming like this I could Is it this the next entry coming like this I could see this I'll show that to you in the run it Okay if suppose the exploiter later into two batches then you'll see this in jumps for first batch some accuracy second batch and advocacy then a poke to first bad second birds It broke three first Bad Second batch on You'll see 20 such lines in the output log file You'll see it here sis Right now since our batch is equal during data data sit What disease 20 lines over here 20 lines and locked file 40 lines If the boxes for 40 years before the lens Charly Gordon play with all these things ready Okay I got the red line Yeah Mortal is notifying Okay give me one second please I didn't run this Uh yeah More little compile Okay now we'll do Model that fit Oh model compile itself I've done the fit Also do one thing please All if you do one thing look at the screen What I want you to do is just remove this line Please remove this line all If you look at the screen don't miss this Control X insert a new court cell and place it there Andranik separately the frit function I want to rent it separately Okay so I'm going to do this again I'm going to initialize the model again and do this again All if you start from models not sequin ship this time Once you pasted the court separately please start from this trip model that compile It's now We'll do the model that fit on the vor boss Okay it's coming out now Look at this model not fit You have this kind of log in front of you First of all homey in a rose Will you have you left 40 Does on in the 40 rose that you see this loss loss and accuracy training loss training a crazy on the validation increases the 0.36 are you all with me You want me to wait Anybody okay We're not talking Hey ladies You want me to rate You're all because okay Oh no screwing down Scroll down What I've done here is I'm going to convert this into box plots OK I'll explain the court to you in a minute so I'm going to convert this in the box plot So please execute this one knows So now let me explain what I've done here The history command here What the history Come on Does this for every e box that you have executed for every park it captures your accuracy Scores on training testing and the lawsuit Since you have 40 runs it would have captured 40 training lost training accuracy under test accuracy Okay that is what it has done No water do Is you asked the question How does that mortal is Or fit or not We build a box plot using trainee Chrissy we build a box floor using testicles on those box plots is what you're seeing or there But before I go to the box plots the history come earned that We have used that history commanders word is capturing all these details for us across the box Okay so if you look at this Ah I'll shorty on screen There you go I'm using mortal not fit Since I'm going to use 40 books here at every port What are these metrics Training Chrissy Training loss and validation A Chrissy that'll be captured into this history on dhe It is that history that I've captured which I'm using here I'm saying from history Get me a Chrissy This accuracy is training a chrissy store it in a separate data frame called training at Christie's from history captured the validation A crazy storage in a separate data frame called valid validation accuracy So I credit toe data friends here Then what I do is I can coordinate these two dolphins so this is no like a data frame of two columns So you have a date A friend with two columns No one columnist for training Chrissy the other columnist for elevation increases How many increase will have Year 40 on this I do a box plot Where do that box floored Look at the two boxes This is printing out the crazies Course the raw numbers Not very useful visual is visualization is much better when you look at the box Plourde What this is telling us Getting better What's getting it The disease in the range off lives then 60 plus our miners for training set for test stick Your accuracy is the reach of 60 plus or minus The green line is a median value Okay And since the two boxes are almost similar trick you see the cemetery Aurea left side and rights ever symmetric So most likely these distributions are like normal distributions and hence mean and median are almost similar So the average accuracy off your training data on training the day average increase he was around 59 58% Well it's untested Er that I could see is around 60% I have rejected the maximum accuracy in both the cases has been around 80 80% accuracy in training 18 testing in one of the box of God 80 But most of the people is that you have The Chris has been running this Now let's see how we can improve this Obviously that's not good Are you all with me Shell Move on a cushion Yeah you're good See you in the histories get capturing only model or fit And I really do exactly that loss And I Chrissy Yeah So the if it is only fitting the plane tests Yeah Okay Look at this Histories this whole command over here This is a my fate study This is where my friend ends Yeah This name I fit this ending But since I'm using this model or evaluate what did Louis the history will capture both training on the validation You see the validation split I've given over here So what you're getting in the output is training and validation Not the best part Testes So this is so Then what are you said Like no splitting into three Set This is already doing right Yeah if you use this option So this is splitting their training toe entertainment Really Yes Yes I agree It is having 30% of that for validation So whenever you touch hyper perimeters have three sets training relegation testing Yes So you know you could go to the box block now what What you see here is probably the 40 iteration it started with Probably would have started with a random number Yes and then he kept out including a crazy So even if it's the box lot shouldn't source anything because it's It's random that they started with and kept on improving back in his box plots not off Wait this is both sport of the crazy school Yeah but when you start with random decorously score will be something not random Yeah but it's it's it's something They saw something so it could be anything So how calculating mean offered very say the most off the accuracy used Once it's this week of regression line Bestwick Lane This week Line first line is always a random link So it s a major So use grading descent to minimize their so that ever also serve some purpose otherwise very liberating descent stock from you know which despite my concern is like the mean accuracy at like 25% or 60% What Something Okay Okay I think you're asking me this but I don't know whether it's that Okay Are you asking me where the distribution come from Yes Of the distribution it's like 60% is already saying Oh probably because of Dr Set and training signatures said you're getting 60% mean accuracy Yeah I mean that kid is he I let it come to that Just hold on Did you hear this Question His cautiousness across iterations If there Chris is going to go down that's what they're asking Improve Basically not good on me when I improved But then because it's improving from a random state What itwas the mean actually doesn't serve a purpose Whatever Meaning you're getting in the boat Rose died Why doesn't a soda pop Yes because it's because you know it started with something Whatever it is you reach out and then from there you and then you keep on improving So probably afterward The last quarter part off it is something we should consider not you know from very No no no Okay Um all right Okay Maybe we can hold this question for a minute Will do further changes and probably that will make sense to you Good question in a way but let's hold for a minute Okay So his question is right No park will come back to the question His question is does the bean or the median off the accuracy score really matter Does it really help That's interesting because it's going to start from somewhere Now think about this Yes You want to say something You're the responded right Or your smoke on the girls I just want to let me finish Please I didn't This just gives in vision Alison's off The current happen If we change the happened stop seeing as they pick up the right ones The our me No more words No no no no What does this telling us if we put this model in the production at 95% confidence water range off accuracy is coarse Like going to be like in careful crime called cross validation or in sampling with replacement that used in any other algorithm When I build a model on my stakeholders asked me what is the accuracy scores you're expecting from this model We never give a point estimate We always give a range under 95% confidence level Same purpose is served heroes Okay However his questions still needs to be answered because I really want here's brought he I don't know whether he's realised that or not There's one very important thing that I want to discuss So just hold on Let me cover some more steps Then I'll come back to that Okay Okay Then you can take any predict any daytime See what is the prediction So this is about predicting printing Let's go in and do it The rest of the lines are actually kind off There's going to it They'll be relevant when we settle down with some scores Now look at this When I do this Evaluate Okay On when a print of a crazy scores on the test data I'm evaluating the mortal against the test data No on test of the modern is giving aggressive 80% Now this is what I was asking you Be careful Don't jump at it The distribution the box plot that we saw they're the performance was not very impressive But here it's This might be a flash in the pan This might be because of the way the data split into training's A test sets You may not get similar score on a test later That's why we never depend on point estimates We always want depend on a range on the 95% confidence All right Anyway let's more Let's generate the confusion matrix since we're in classification the confusion matrix is on the test set Why didn't I run it Oh I didn't know it I'm not Run this Yeah okay Lost function I was playing around with that So that is not important But look at the confusion matrix on the test later Class level matrix is not good The true posters and Prue negatives You have done this right through posters two negatives Yeah class little metrics off recall in position especially for the class which is often underrepresented is the class of important stores The recall of this is true positive A troop of students false negatives So 3 85 by the row total here will give me the the recall of this class which is not very high position will be 3 85 divided by the sum of these two which is again not very high Ideally I would like to have zeros here on largest values here to post a photo negatives So when you're doing classifications on the different classes are skewed they're not equally represented Depending on a crazy score can be risky I'll class distribution of 80 20 I assigned all the records to the higher class My craziness Too late It wasn't right so crazy It does not require any intelligence What we need to focus on its class level accuracies class level recall position of F one score so on so forth And as you can see class level performance is not very impressive Okay so what we'll do next ISS What we'll do next is will add one more layer to this and then see whether that helps one more Densely Go take it easy Score a crazy score I'm thing Look at the classroom It's 97 glistened OK I'll explain that to you Why You're getting 97% harmony forgetting 97% 0 man what an embarrassment will leave Remember this one My own court is letting me don't know What you're gonna do is we're going to add one more layer tow This hidden led to this new network Okay So to add one more hidden layer always make it a habit to type it out don't copy paste other ways and not remember that syntax models not add Vince Okay Modeled out and dance Then This is a nuisance Sorry Molder that eight days Okay Harmony Don't Should we keep here Honestly we have no idea Okay but let's keep something on Say 20 So we have 20 neurons here Activation function is equal to again Honestly no idea which one to use But let's use Let's continue to use real Let's not being changed too many parameters at the same time So let's change the perimeters one by one Okay that's it We don't need to give any input shapes here so just put a closing bracket All right On densely continues to be as it is A sorry The output layer continues to be acidosis No change that So whenever you play around with these hyper perimeters it's always safe toe plate on one night of time saying too many things we don't know which calls What effect Okay so we had to wait Um if I have Yes I have one thousands off record out of 1000 Maybe 50 records belongs to the all clear Okay So in that case do you suggest is to create the two mortals because the output should be to hear activists that outlet Okay okay Because I should go for the to model it should do you think like we should also consider all clear inside our existing model That that can create a bias also right Oakland should never be part of your model building exercise Okay Some investigator Yeah So we can't weaken class Terry I can come up with a little cluster ankle One other class Yeah Yeah you can do that So in that case I should go model Yeah Then they become as many classes as here So we can do that You can do What is asking is if in your data said you see many old class outclassed by me No class he means the leverage points Okay So which you have identified in your k means clustering a separate tiny clusters So you have to be clusters here red and white other than the red and white here Some tiny clusters out flyers also which you don't You don't want to remove You don't wantto handle you don't wonder Then you can call it as 1/3 category others Now my problem becomes multi class classification not vanity classifications So then in that case the number of neurons here will be equal to the number of classes Okay All right let's move So let's go and compile us You can find the mortar Yeah are deliberately nor done the random straight I'll tell you why Okay there's going Compel this So we have just added one extra earlier Nothing else on By the way After this compilation you add one source light Add one line insert court cell and here you see mortal morning Don't somebody Is it a function shift Enter mortal not somebody Why mine Somebody who were getting then seven dense eight invents night Oh that's okay These are the names given internally by the algorithm to your models These names need not match their depends on how many times I've run this already So the number of times everyone that you're you're I traded to your court will be different Sometimes we give the names ourselves That is also profession When you're adding it clear to your neural network you can actually give a name to the clear Okay that naming off the layers That becomes very handy when we deal in When you do something in CNN But I want to do something left specific I want certain layers to be trained there waits to be adjusting back prop other layers I don't want them to be trained I don't want them to get involved in the backdrop So for those things we do that But right now it lots of any purpose Okay so these are the names given to your layers by the Elberton itself Okay so now have Ah two hidden layers One out Quickly The input layer continues to be your data Now let's go into your store to perimeters that inside perimeters Oh yes Total perimeters Okay No it's basically number of rates evades Let's let's talk about this Also suppose I have Okay one neutron I'll start with one neuron on The number of columns we have in this data set is 11 columns So ex want to ex living How many rates Doesn't have to learn 11 +11 is the bias rate It's 11 plus one is 12 weeks Now Suppose I have installed one neuron supposed to have two neurons I have two neurons inside this layer I'd like to learn 24 rates coming to next live in this layer Suppose I have one neuron So the number of lead it has to learn is three reads If I'm more than then it becomes six weights before three neurons Nine waits Okay so what you see here is perimeters is how many How many such waits have to be learned in this morning So the number of ways to be learned in this mortal is some off the weights on all the lives Okay so great is the one Lee perimeter which you know modifies the rest Nothing else It changes nothing It's it's only primitive Modifies a lot of people about it Since you ask this question that reminded me of this bias is not a neuron It's not in the backdrop Nothing happens to this This is not in your own It's a constant declared inner court shown here as a neutron bomb in your own Okay on whatever value here keep in mind this value is not Word goes in here What goes into this neuron is this w into this All right People will think that I come across students who think that the entire B 50 goes to both know it doesn't What goes in here is decided by the weights Okay On total perimeters this perimeters across all these layers put together So if you calculate your in the first layer we have 30 neurons 30 into 11 is so much that incident that be the plus plus one No we have 30 neurons 30 neutrons 30 on We have 11 input variables So the number of rates will be 13 to live in plus one by us The buyers goes to all of them So what you love it could be 13 to 11 plus 30 something 360 Now you take the next live in the next layer You're 20 neurons Every neuron here is going to get input from this noodle 13 to 20 Blessed Wendy 13 2 twenties The number of connections between the two layers as many neutrons that money by Ask Alexis so many total it up You'll see that it comes to run 1001 perimeters But this answer is no uniforms for everybody Number of Pam It is not the same for us All This sort of architecture is Lima Constable But my number my number I'm getting it I'm sure your first Blair is 13 year olds Second ladies 20 year olds Secondly it is 20 neurons all of you on blast ladies only one euro out quickly So you'll get the same number There's only one thing Another part of it is there's only one thing I did not quite conceptually and understand It's about the output layer the all pro player in Iran Okay now if I have a multi class classification binding is simple I keep one It doesn't mean this this feel this way But if I'm attacked last gasification How many neurons didn't have the order Even if it's a multi class classification as many classes in your training sick that menudo neurons and out quickly in the training set If our three classes then output layer ushered off three murals one your own dedicated one class That is why in multi class classification we can write our output variable into are not calling practice living so that tell anyone Okay now we got We got this model with us Now let us see how this performs Don't change the number off a box Yes please What is that Something that's really presented This is a god What do you mean by that So there is some consolation Have eaten your correct Which is It's a Metrix Metrix So what is happening there and then what kind of ghost I don't think that kind off functionality is available in Cara's a remedy but it's all this possible to look at those things bio in mathematical sense So we find this is what happens inside I thought that was I That's what I presented yesterday No in that Remember the white board which is not white enough That's what I was representing How the weights get multiplied by imports to create a Matics output on which you do the sigma get outputs We don't know what kind of a It's all the same Okay you're basically under print owed as a part of this run What's happening inside Uh to my knowledge right My learner's is limited here I never go back and explored Is there anything like that available in Kira's I will not be surprised if it's available You need to explore that part Okay Shall I move Okay so we have this Okay Now we're going to run this on I'm going to do the fit on this morning Let's go into the fit We have everything has to be redone More alert Summary We compile it already modeled outfit Then let's look at the Eckert Is this course has it improved Okay Yeah it's improved Right Okay So what does this tell you Is a new liquid model with one lee one layer Apparently Waas not able to understand all the patterns in your data set It needed more neurons So when you added more neutrons now it is able to understand the patents related the better on Look at the difference between the training and the validation that tested Okay you see that Sorry Training in the validation you have a trillion validation The box plots are almost similar so we can still safely hypothesize that we're not ordering Okay But still all this is only hypothesis Well even the rubber meets the road We will come to know whether you're right or wrong Okay Next What I'll do is go back and let's change one more perimeter The perimeter which I want you to change Now s I wanted to change the bad size that size itself taking the entire data set in one goal Let's J Jane the backsides to proof of the things Why 2 56 No reason I just want to see small bad size help and I'm going to start with initial efforts Sequential steps always start from the sequence In stir Reveal the model company in the morning rebuild the model compile the model and then you can do a summary summary will not change because we change the bad size on dough The fit Do you see the box mark Boxes are almost out of shape You see the box plots almost touching 11 means 100% accuracy Perfect case off or fitting whenever you're mortal Gives 100% accuracy It's guaranteed your orphan ing because data sets have noise on If you If you start absorbing noise one lead then you get 100% accuracy Okay So whenever you come across whether it's on validation percent or test set off training said 100% accuracy is a lot of bill If that's not possible can you guess what's happening here Why this sudden jump 200% accuracy Oh no no One by one of the study So what So much Okay Healthy I bought sea box What did I do I know Well yeah the problem starts in the very first day Poke Okay What happens What is happening here is what is the size of your badge to 56 2 cars What are the number of parameters You have no perimeters Perimeters more than 1000 perimeters Urine 1000 dimensional feature space in which you have only 2 56 data points Most of the feature space is empty sparse on Duren or free zone When the number of data points that you have in foreign iteration of forward backward is not sufficient Given the number off waste theatrical to manipulate the number of features here the country are not features perimeters You're in order for joining the very first run one side in the Orford Zone in the very full strong subsequent runs of just all fighting for the right So that is what is happening here Reduced the box from 40 to 20 Really Is the box on Please start from sequence You okay I don't understand why you're distract from sequence because this'll Yeah that's a good question Why do you have to start from sequence Phyllis If it start from somewhere anywhere in between water weight it has already learned it will continue to work on those which resetting the riches in the cash I remember in memory So instead off refusing each wall kind we use our list talking I'll come to that will come to the I just want its fundamentals to fall into place So go back and change the locks He pokes I'm changing from 40 to 20 on Let's do this sequence will again hope Even with half the balls we're still very close to one The rest of the 20 books they further pull you towards one Yeah so this is a good indication Deck We were or fitting guaranteed in the 40 box in the 20 Also looks like they're all footing How do you know that Now go and change your bad sides to 5000 50,017 Let's go and change the bat's size No it was 50,017 right 50,070 on once again Build a model eat Cloning is the substance of artificial intelligence which is revolutionizing our future from Google self driving car tow Apple City All of these applications of deep learning and that is why top companies such as Google Facebook and Amazon looking to hire people skills in the domain of deep learning So given the Bordens off the planning and mine we have come up with this full course on deep learning Now before we start off in session I'd like to inform you that we have launched a completely three website called Great Learning Academy Over here you have access to complete course is related to artificial intelligence cloud computing distant marketing and the Lord more domains She would be able to have access to different court books data sets and project fights with respect to all of these courses Now that's how quick glance at the agenda So we'll start off with a quick brush up to all the concepts and fightin that as pupils list and dictionaries After that we'll understand one off Luke control statements and fightin Going head will learn about object oriented programming after it will work with library suggest numb by bond US and my plot lip which are very essential when it comes to deep learning So once we're done with brushing up all fighting concepts will dive into deep learning So this session will be taken by Professor Mackay Show Who's the Director Off Education Data science A great learning The location has a word 20 years off industry expedience in data science market results and project management and that's conducted a 100 corporate trainings So when deep learning will start by understanding the importance off artificial neural networks for exactly are they and what is the architecture off artificial neural networks are that will understand the concept off activation functions Going head will learn about back propagation and great indecent algorithms And finally we'll have a demo with respect to board the Tensorflow and Cara's dream books So let's start off in a session Hey guys this is part of me from greet learning Let's start by installing python on you can insult bison from this website over here Www dot by thin dot org So I click on this right so you see that you have the latest version of fighting over here by thin 3.8 point Oh and you can download the python version with respect to whatever operating system you're using If you have a window system then you can download Buy them for windows If you have a line X or UNIX system then you can download fightinfor line extra UNIX And if you have ah my co operating system then you can download Buyten for Michael paging system And since I have a window sister Mile downloaded for windows So I just click on the soul here and you see that that download has started right So now I actually have heightened installed in my system So once the installation of python is done we need something known as an I D So I deviously stands for integrated development environment and integrated elopement Anointment basically makes a work much much easier Why programming So it gives you certain problems and you have all of the tools present in the I D And one such I D which is very famous for bison a spy chump so we can install by Tom from the side over here jetbrains dot com slash by charm So let's the street to the side opens up right so you have the download button over here You just click on this on Dhe for our programming purpose will just download this community was You know we're right So for your pipe and development you click on download and the download would start and again since I'm using off Windows system So this is what up windows system over here All right Now I recognize a python distribution which basically provides you all of the packages in built So you have packages such as Mark Block clip for visualization bond us for the manipulation and numb pie for numerical computing You don't have to manually installed all of these packages when you actually install and conduct All of these packages are actually pretty installed in Anaconda up and for doing all a few according you have something as the Jupiter notebook So first use of Jupiter notebook we would need Anaconda So let's go ahead and install Anaconda All right so this is anaconda dot com and I just click on download now So we need the anaconda distribution and again I click on download Right So God Windows Marquis and Line X And this is the latest version of python 3.7 So that is what we had downloaded or you So this was the old division of Fighting 2.7 But everyone has moved on to Python 3.7 now And that is why I will also be downloading on indefinitely despite the motion which is biting 3.7 So we'll automatically start the download for 64 bit operating system So once the download for Anaconda is done we need something rest of Jupiter notebook which I've already told you So the desert you know here to return your book is basically your browser based interpreter that allows us to intractably work with biting And this is how your jupiter notebook looks like So let me go ahead and open up Jupiter notebook So let me open up Anaconda prom first So I'll die pin on a gondola from So this is the command line interface Now open of Jupiter In your book I'll just type in Jupiter's piece notebook and let me wait till his opens up All right So this is the Jupiter notebook over here right And this is how it looks like now to open up a new notebook We just have to click on new and we'll click this new bite and three notebook and we have successfully opened our new by the Notebook Let me just rename the stew Buyten programming Now Once it's done let's go ahead and write off forced by thin program so we'll just use the brain statement So you just have to type in print on dhe Inside this I'll type and let's see This is Sparta up on All you have to do is click on run and you have your food's program You have successfully printed this a spot out on the console Well you just taken the first step to hacking NASA right So we just have to take the baby steps and you'll be an export bite and programming and you have successfully started with your food Spieth and program All right so now that the average enough Force python program the question which needs to arise in your minders every programming language needs to deal with the Lord of Data So where do we actually store this data Well this is where beatable is common So let's say you have to store the names off all of the students present in a classroom So let's see The names are John Sam Mad Bob on Julian so on And you have 50 such names You have to store all of these names somewhere hearted would Well all you have to do us take available and store all of these names in a variable No you must be thinking we're exactly so beautiful So let's understand that with this example So simply put readable Czar basically temporary storage spaces where you can store data up or values Now let's take this example over here so consider this folder to be available So what you do is you store this value temporarily inside this folder This value us John which is the name of the student suit taken this value and please inside this variable for certain amount of time Now after that since this is only your temporary storage piece you can pick out this variable and replace it with Sam Right So now this variable holds the value some on after some time again you decide that Sam was not the names I want a story and I want to store the name But so can you pick out the name Sam and store Matt inside this folder So this out variables work their temporary storage values where you can keep on changing the values inside it So now what we know what exactly are variables Let's go to Jupiter Notebook on Walk with Variables So again I'll open up a new bike country notebook over here So now to assign a variable I let's create a new object over here and I'll name it as our one I used the assignment operator and I'll give in the name of the first name would be Bob on to print it out I'll just type in wire one over here again What We have successfully stored the value Bob inside wire one Now I'll seems the value inside this forgettable So we're all Louis I will actually store the value Sam inside this wire one on Let me print it out again You know where one stores some so initially wired one had the value Bob and after some time had to replace the value with some new again Let me change the value So inside wire one I will be storing might on Let me print it out again So this time it has the value mad So as you see vegetables are just temper used to read spaces where the values can be changed Now every variable is actually associated with the data type so there are different types of the tablets variable can hold It can be off in teacher type It can be floating or decimal type It could be a 1,000,000,000 It can be a string So it comes to individuals You basically have numbers just 10 500,000 minus stand minus 27 1 and floating are basically decimal point numbers of 3.14 15.97 or minus 2.1678 soup Any such dismal point number would be a floating point number and then you've got bullion values Obviously logical values and true and false are basically off bullion values And then you finally have those string values So what String is basically a set off characters and close together right So Sam is the excuse it off characters It is a string and then you have my Frisbee skills set off characters It is a string and strings are generally enclosed within double courts Single code sir Triple courts Right now let's assign some different types of data Toby doubles So let me create a new variable E And I'll store the value 10 inside this Now I'll go ahead and check the type of this so the type of this variable would be and now inside A I like to use to order the small point number So this time I'll start with 1.4 on get me Take the type of it So die both be Can I take on run So this time we see that there's a floating point number So what you gonna be Skin notices The type of the variable would depend on the type of the D temperature actually storing inside the variable A few store on in teacher type data inside the variable than the type of the variable would be impeached And if you store the floating point or a decimal type data inside the variable and the type of the very well would be floating type now similarly let me go ahead then store of bullion value inside this so I'll store drew inside this Let me check type off eh So the type of years bull Now let me store Oh character value So I'll type Hello world Let me remove out this w over here And then again I'll take the type of this so type off e one type of years string So finally we have one more type of data which is basically complex number so complex numbers You basically know that it has a real part in an imaginary part So let me just type it out So four bless Let's see a G now normally in mathematics is actually present as four plus eight I know when it comes to python programming really present the imaginary part with you So Ford is that he'll part over here on day eight G is the imaginary part over here So just to confirm it I like it in take the type so type offi the type office complex So all of these other different types of data which we can work with and bison so going ahead will you walk with operators and bison So we've got a medic operators relational operators and logical operators Let's start off it arithmetic operators I'll get onto a Jupiter notebook over here on our medic operators are basically leadoff normal mathematical operations which you do so that would be addition subtraction and then your guard division And then you've got multiplication So these other different symbols which will be using to perform these operations so we'll start off addition So let me just add in a comment So to add no comment you will use this hash on Then you'll type in whatever you want to add so common so basically statements which are not executed by the Python interpreter And it's not only to help the quarter order loner All right so I'll execute this cell over here so I'll have one beatable and I'll store 10 inside this and I love unavailable be I'll store to Andy inside this if you go on run all right so I'll start with the addition operation So I'll just type in e plus B and you get the value off 31 is quite simple So is their basic addition operation which you've been doing since your kindergarten right and also will be doing some similar operations and then I'll go ahead and perform a minus B So what you think is the answer Well it's minus 10 because when you subtract 20 from 10 you'll get a value of minus Stan Well let's also multiply these two numbers so I just type in across Be so that would be 10 into 20 which will give you 200 And then finally I'll just type in a divided by B so you get a value of Cedar Point fights so 10 by 20 gives your value of 0.5 So these were the basic arithmetic operations Now Well go ahead then work with some relational operators So I'll just type in relational operators over here So again I am putting down comments so relational operators on relational operators basically help youto understand relation between two variables Now what I mean when I say it helps us to understand the relationship between two variables So let's say when you have two variables the value and one variable could be greater than the value and the second variable Or it could be less than the value in the second variable or it could be equal or they might be no relation at all between these two really appeals This is where we'll have relational operators to find out What is the exact relation between two operates right So again I just type in the equal Stan and B equals 20 over here right If we can run right so I'll start with the less than operator So I'll type in e less than be so here I'm just second of the value off E is actually less than the value of B So we get a value off through this means that then is actually less than 20 Now let me check if he is greater than be regular false value because 10 s not greater than 20 Now I have the double equal to operators With the help of the double equal to operator we check if both of these values are equal to each other again We get a false value because 10 is not equal to 20 now there is a not equal to operator So he is not equal to be so Hee I'll given this exclamation mark and then I'll give in this sequel to symbol and give the second operation which is be so we see that is obviously not equal to be or another term stand is not equal to 20 So these were some basic relational operators And then we'll go ahead and walk with the Lord Can operators while type in large coal operators over here So the two basic logical operators are on DDE or on Sis how you to present the and operator And this is how you representing or operate Oh well actually start with the on operator No I know But it does use to take the condition or the logic between variables and this is how the on operator works So if both of the operations are true only then the final result will evaluate the truth And if either of the operations falls or both of the operations is false then the final result will be falls So I'll just create variables over here And this time I'll be storing the value true inside a and I'll be storing falls inside beat So I'll just execute this over here All right so now I'll type in e and be so we are basically checking through on Dhe Falls So what do you think will be the result We get a false value because we need to cruise and only when we have to Truth doctors one will get the true value Now we'll check B and it so when it comes to be and if we are basically changing the position of these operations that's it So now it becomes false and true and the answer's falls Now let me check E on E This will be true and true So when you compare true and true you get a true value And finally let me check be on B You get a false value So this is how the and operator works Now let's go ahead and walk with the or operator So when it comes to the our operator if either of the operations is true or both of the operations are true denigrate true value and only when both of the opens our falls that is when you have a false value So this time I'll type in E or be this would mean true or false and obviously we have a true value over here Then I'll diaper and B or E to this would mean falls or true and we obviously have a true value Now let me go ahead and check e or E for this would mean true are true So when you have two crews obviously it's a true value And then finally let me check B or B and we have a false So this is the only condition that you'll get a false value when it comes to our Those were their basic operators and python not its head onto fightin strings So fight and strings are the most widely used in our types when it comes to python And as I've already told you strings are basically sequins off characters which are enclosed within single courts Double codes for triple courts and triple codes are used to denote my feline string So as you see this example over here I am going to France tomorrow So you have to put quotes around the string because this is presented multiple lines So hello Will has presented single course This is a string this is part of as present and double chords and again this is a string But when it comes to I am going to France tomorrow This is a my D line string so that's the basic provides for strengths So now let's go to Jupiter notebook and walk with these drinks All right so I create a new really below here and I'll store a string inside this so I'll we're in the string Joey doesn't share is a I can run right So obviously no one likes to share That is up to we right So now let's go ahead band walk with the strength So let's say I want to extract the first character who just g from this entire string Now when it comes to python indexing starts from zero so G is basically present that index number zero So if I order extract G I'll type in the one I'll put in square braces on denial typing zero and how successfully extracted the Force little and similarly if I want to extract the last character from this entire strength So for that you'd have to put in minus one and when I click on run you get the value So this is how you extract the last character from the entire string Now let's I would extract the sequins off characters so I want to extract this and die award which is doesn't so 012345 So the index starts at five and it will go on to 6789 10 11 and 12 So let me type in 12 over here I'll pick on run right Would you have given 12 Because when it comes to the second term over here it is exclusive So five is inclusive Well is exclusive 012345 d is presented Index number five then 6789 10 and 11 City is presented index number 11 But if you only given 11 over here then you'll get doesn't right So what You have to keep in mind us when it comes to the second indexing DM it is exclusive So that is why you have to go and tell 12th on you'll get the end I award which is doesn't now let's see How can we check the length off a string So you check the length of a string We have this land function So inside alien I'll just pass in this variable which is the one on which he had the land of the stringers 24 characters Now when you say 24 so this would include all of the species and all of the apostrophes and full stops and all of those characters as well Right now let's go ahead and walk with some of the inn build functions off strings So if I want to convert all of these characters into our bookies so I just have to type in E one and then I have this function upper so I'll click on Run Right so successfully converted all of these characters to capital Similarly if I want to change all of these two small case so while type in a one dot lower so everything is stolen tow Loki is now Similarly if I want title case so I'll type in Even Dodd I do right So I have successfully changed all of these words Too tight Icky Suji is capital these capital or here since apostrophe is taking us another character that is white is also given capital and then we have SS capital in the U S Capitol Right So these were some basic functions when it came to strengths Now let's go ahead and walk with some non primitive data structures in fighting for the main non primitive area structures and fight in our pupil list dictionary and set So when it comes to all of these data structures you can store my tipple elements inside one beat our structure so tell never work with only variables And when it came to wearables we could store only one value in Von Variable Now let's say if you go to a music concert and you have to store the names off all the people at in the music concert and the strength off the audience would be around 10,000 So to store the names you would require 10,000 variables Now that's a lot of funerals and you'd have to manually store all of these names inside 10,000 variables That's a humongous task and that's her tiresome task So this is where you would need these dear structures where you can store my tipple elements inside one single dina structure So instead of the 40 structure which is basically a pupil so when it comes to do pull it is an order collection Off elements include within around breezes so we have curious seasonal here on He'll be coming in between to give us some pointers So curious isn't tells is that pupils are immutable now What does he mean when he sees that pupils are immutable So basically when you go ahead and create a pupil so let's say you are five elements inside one pupil Now you can't change or modify the pupil which you have created so that would basically mean that Let's see if you have five elements then you can't change the value of the second element or the toward element Or you can add another element inside the tube in which you have already created So this is basically the mutability nature off pupils on This is how you can create a pupil so you'll use this round braces or here and inside these you'll given the values right So as you see pupil is actually you had trip didn't steal a structure So here you are starting a new medical value of character Val you end up bullion value right So let's go to Jupiter notebook and walk with pupils So let me queda do Bill so I'll name that you blast you be one and I given the values right So this is our triple Do you be one Let's see how Kim access individual elements from the stupid accent Elements from Pupil is the same as axing elements from a string The only do is given the name of the people with Stu P One You've given this square braces and then if you want to extract the first element which is basically presented index zero your type in zero or here and you have extracted the first element which is one Similarly if you want to extract the last element you have to type in minus one and you have extracted the last element which is 23 And if you want to extract our sequins off elements so let's say I want a true and be so this would be from index number one going on till in next Number four because we want 12 and three So I'll die pin one colon for rights I've extracted E drew and B right so so you can extract individual elements from our people Now as I've told you our cue Polis immutable So let me go ahead and try to change the value which is present inside of people so I'll type in u P one and let me change the value which is presented Zero What the next and I'll change it to let's see 100 And we get an editor here So the arrest stupid object does not support item assignment And that is because Stupples are immutable Now let me try to other new value Inside this we've got 12345 So that would mean this is index number four Let me try to add something that in next Number five I'll die I've been a reporter again We got the sea matter So deep logic does not support item assignment because of this immutable Now we're onto the next year a structure which is open list So let's send pupils are quite similar The only difference is less a mutable while pupils are immutable Now what I mean when I say less are immutable So this means that less can be changed once they are created So there are five elements in a list So the second element or the toward element can be mortified and against himself said that there are five elements so another five elements can be added inside this list So this is the basic difference between less and pupils and this is how you can create a list So basically given square braces and you're given all of the values Insider square braces Let's hear onto Jupiter Notebook and walk with lists So I'll type in one and I've given some values over here and then I'll print it out Right So this is a list over here on Daxing Elements from the list of Seamus Do Bill So if I want to access though Forest Elemental type and Elena given square braces and then I given zero so have extracted off first element Now let's go ahead and access her sequins off elements So I order access thes three elements are were true Tow N B So this is index number two and then going on until the next number five So Alan and too cool and five writes a true too and be so we have successfully extracted thes three sequins off elements Now let me go ahead and actually change the values inside this list so I'll change this value 1 200 for what happened l 10 and I'll assign the value off 100 Now let me print out l one So as you see initially the value off this element was one And then we have seen the Value 200 No let's say I want to add a couple more elements inside this list so I'll type in Elwin dot happened and I lied an element and name it Do we Let's see toward and then let me print out l one rights are successfully added a new element So I can actually I had a list inside the list So let me again use the pen function over here and then I'll add a list inside this so I'll type in 1234 and five So let me again Look at l one rights are successfully added this new list inside this list Now we can also go ahead and remove these elements So to remove the last element we've got a malfunction so I'll type in Elwin dot bob So as we see this last element has Bean popped out Now again let me type in Elvin dark pop on Let's see what we re popped out right to this time this elements world has been bobbed out Now let me have a look at the modified list rights We are only left with these values because word and this list has bean bobbed out for itself We can work with lists Now Let's get on to the next year structure which is a dictionary The dictionary actually quite different than a less standard people because it Kansas soft key value pairs And these are actually a KN ordered collection off key value pairs which are enclosed within Coley breezes and again dictionaries up mutable So this is how you can create a dictionary You'll print call you braces over here the first you put in the key So we're here The key is apple and then you've given up Colin and then you'll given the value So for the key apple the value is then and then you'll give the next key value pair So after Comer the next key value Paris Orange 20 Orange is the key and 20 is the value Let's go ahead and creator on dictionary So let me create the dictionary Over here I'll type in the one tonight given these call you pieces So we have So I just start giving some names of fruits So let's say the first key as mango and the prize of the fruit would be the value So mango cause 45 bucks and then we've got Apple So let's see Apple's cost us 30 and then with God orange and then orange costs around 77 off that god guava and then it this would cost around 100 and 25 Now let me print it out So this is our dictionary Now what We have us a key value purse So if I want to access only the keys then we have the keys functions while type in D one dot keys So given the name of the dictionary and then I'll follow it up with the keys function even got keys right So I have extracted all of the keys which are mango apple orange in Kuala Similarly if I want to extract all of the values which are basically the price of all of these fruits I'll type in de $1 values and I have extracted the prices off all of these fruits Now let's go ahead then modify some of these elements So I order teens the cost off mango so I'll type in D one on then I'll give in the name off key So the name of the GS mango and the cost would be 100 on denial type in D one So initially the cost of mango was 45 then I've ordered it to be 100 So this is how we can work with dictionaries And then we've got the final leader structure which is a set So the site is an unknown ordered and a next collection off elements in close within curly braces So where do I mean by indexed So when I say a new index this basically means that sets don't have any index toward so we can't really access the elements with respect to that indexing and also another thing to be notice sets do not allow duplicate values So let's see if you are the value then then you cannot add the same value again so it will take the value only once and that's how you can create a set so you'll have calibrate so here and then you'll given all of the elements inside it So let me create my final leader structure over here so I'll type in one e and then I'll give enough floating point while you let's see 3.78 Let me print off the set So this is our set over here Now where l do us I'll copy this and let me try toe add some duplicate values so I'll add one all of these times And then I'll also add a Now let me friend out s one and then see what while you do I get so we see that duplicates are not allowed one Even though I have given around five or six times it has been taken only once and you have given two times But then again it comes only once So obviously said does not allow any duplicates inside it Now you can go ahead and add some new values inside the set So I'll die Pin s one dog ad Hello world right Survived this new element And if I want to add more than one element it or single time then we've got this update mattered So I'll type in a swoon dark upbeat and I'll give it a list off values So while diaper and let's see Sparta up on then I live in 1 23 Then I'll give in Let's see three bless 90 Then let me print out as one All right All of these elements have been added again You see that The order of these elements has not reserved it is random right So three plus 90 comes over here And then we caught 11 23 rates of the random a snort it all preserved All right so we're done with the basic data structures and biting which will basically do pull list dictionary and set So now we're here under the Floo control statements on then flew control statements will start with F statement So in jail World you will come across a lot of situations but I don't have to make a decision on the basis for condition So let's see if this happens then you'd have to perform a selloff actions else You have to go home with different serial factions So let's take this example to understand this buildup So let's say it's raining and you'd want to play football So if it's raining then you can't do anything and you just have to sit inside else So if it is actually not training then you can go out and play football So these are some of the real world situations which can actually be represented in programming with the help off if else statement So let's go to Jupiter notebook and work with efforts So here I'll create up to variables So given the value off 10 Toe E and I've given the value off 20 Toby on then let me check if the value of B is actually greater than the value off So f B is greater than E Then I want to print out b s greater than it So since this condition has been evaluated to troop Maris Wendy is greater than 10 And since this is true this statement has been executed So we get be scarier than a Let me actually flip it So I order check off e s greater than be end of this evaluates to true I will print out e s created then be so don't get any result And that is because this condition has been evaluated Two falls And since this condition has been evaluated toe falls the statement has been skipped So this is where else close comes and so let me use tells over here Now I'll type in If he is greater than be then I'd want to print out ISS greater than be Els I want to print out be this greater than hey Right So here the first condition evaluates to false and that is why it escaped And then we given the else close and this condition sprinted B is great isn't it Now let's see if you have multiple conditions So if you have three numbers and reward check which is the greatest are those three numbers So that's where we would need if else if else So let me actually assign the values again So I'll assign then e 22 bi on d ie Also assigned 30 to see So now I'm more a check of is greater than be in a scarier than see so I'll type in f e s greater than be on DDE e s greedier than see and of this evaluates to drew I want to print out e S t Could he just and this evaluates to falls Then I'll type in which stands for Elsa So I'll given the next of conditions over here so I'll type in B is greater than E on Dhe B is greater than C and here I will print out B is the greatest to be a stuff greed ist And again if this evaluates to false I'll find you Put in l's Andi I will print out See a CZ though Greediest So here are the final result S C is the greediest Now let's understand this whole thing Probably so first we come to the f statement and then we check F e s greater than B and E is greater than C barest a stent greed than 20 and 10 Creative and 30 So both of these are false and falls and falls would evaluate two falls And that is why I will skip the statement over here Then we'll come toe else if and we're checking If B is greater than it for 20 years earlier than 10 which is true then we'll check Is 20 greater than 30 which is actually falls so true and false will evaluate the falls And again this is kept and finally will come to else and will print out See is the greatest So that's how we can work with F else Now let's use the F statement without pupil So let me create a tupelo here So do you be one and let me give some values a be on DSI So I have created the stupid Now after this I ought to check if the element is present and the stupid so f e and you be one then I'd want to print out e s present All right So since this condition is evaluated to true Paris the element is actually present in the stupid and that is why we print this out Now let me just check if the character s s present and this on diffidence present I want to print out as this present So this condition evaluates to false and nothing has printed out Now Similarly let me go ahead and work with F and list So if that list and then I'll go ahead and create a list So l one and then I'll give it a bunch of values inside this So then 22 d 40 and 50 Now I want a check of the first element and this list is actually 10 And if the value is equal to 10 Then I want to change it to 100 So if l went off and Egg zero is actually equal do 10 Then I want to change this too 100 then I'll finally print out this list right So initially though first element in this list will stand with the help of the F statement I've changed They do 100 now Similarly let me go ahead and work with F and Dictionary Dictionary would if I create a dictionary the one and then I'll give it a bunch of key value parents over here So I'll type in the name of the fruit which is mango on the night assigned the value which is then and then the next fruit would be apple And then the cost would be when Deke and then the final fruit would be banana and then the cost would be hurting All right so now I were a check of the value off mango distant and effort is equal to 10 Then I'd want to add 100 more to this value so f d one off mango is actually equal Do then Then I'd want to add and more to this so d one off mango would be equal Do the one off Mango Less 100 and then I'll print out demon over here Right So initially the cost of Mango Winston Then using the f statement I have incriminated the value Do 110 I guess so This cell we can work with the F statement Now let's head onto looping statements So looping statements are basically used to repeat a task my nipple times So let's understand looping statements with this example So you have a bucket and you want to completely fill it up with the mug off water so the conditioners while the bucket is not full you will keep on adding a mug off water to work until a tasteful So here the repetition task us You will have a mug of water and you'll keep on pouring that into the bucket until a chestful repeating a task until the final condition is met And this is how the why loop works so and the new bank statements you basically have while and foot so we'll start with the Why loop So let's go to juvenile book again So let me initialize Available for soil type in I equals one And then I use the Why Luke So the condition would be while I s less than are equal to 10 I'd have to print out I Now after this is done I have to incriminate the value off I with one So we let me print this out So this is the result Let's understand this better So initially I have a variable I onda have initialized it with the value one Then I'll start this Why loop So we're here I'll check if I s less than or equal to 10 And initially eyes value is equal to one So is one less than or equal to 10 So it is true And since this is evaluated to true I'll come inside the wild loop and I'll print out the value off I which is one Then I'll incriminate the value off So one plus one would become too Again I'll check off to West less than or equal to 10 And since two years less than or equal to 10 I'll again come inside the wire loop and then I'll print out too Then again eyes implemented ice value would become three So I'll check of three is less than or equal to 10 again It evaluates to true I'll print out three and then this loop repeats itself until eyes value becomes equal Do 10 right to the final value would become equal to 10 and then I's value would become 11 So here I'll check if 11 s less than or equal do 10 and that condition would feel And when the condition finally feels we will come out of the loop So this is how the why loop works So now you know why loop I want a printer to table let us through Cross one equals two to cross to equals forward and across three equal six and so one So I'll have the first available initialized witches I equals one and then I'll diamond and equal stupid So I have my valuables initialized over here Now I'll start though why Lou on down the slope will go until ice value is less than or equal to 10 No inside this I will print out so end and then cross I as equal Do I just put in and cross I So let me print this out off this I have to actually given one more condition which is I equals eye less one So if I don't income in the value of fight then it will go into an infinite loop So I'll hit around So we have this to table over here So let me explain this properly So initially eyes valueless one So I'll check if one is less than or equal to 10 which is true So I'll come inside this and I'll print out to cross One is equal to do and then I'll income in the value off I would just do Then I'll check if us less than or equal to 10 which is again true Then I'll come inside and then I'll print out to cross Two is equal to four Then again eyes value is incremental It becomes three Then I'll check a freest less than or equal to 10 And since this is true I like in common side and that I'll print out three Cross to is equal to six and the school's on until the eyes values equal to 10 and then I'll print out across town is equal to 20 and when being committed eyes value again It becomes 11 So is 11 less than or equal to 10 Well it evaluates to false because 11 s clear than 10 Right So this is where the loop ends and we have the final value It is to cross 10 equals 20 Now let's use why Loop with the list Obviously create a list with a bunch off elements inside it on with the help off while loop I would add 100 more to each of the value inside the list So let me create a list over here L one and I'll add in a bunch of values over you So 1234 and five So the list has been created Now now I'll go ahead and initialize the variable I to be equal Do zero So this is all Sudan and then I'll start the why Luke So inside the wire loop I will basically check till I s less than so Let me remove these brackets over here So while I is less than length off l one So lento fell one would be 1234 and five So I would go from 0 to 4 and then I basically want toe inclement the each element inside this list So l one off I would be equal Do l one off I bless 100 And then I also have two income in the value off I So I would become I lost one on Then finally I'll print out the value off l one right So initially though by using the Lester 1234 and five and after running the loop the values became 11121314 and one of five So let's understand this group So initially value off I was zero and I'm checking of zero s less than fight which is true So I'll come inside and I'll assign l one off zero to be equal to Elvin off zero plus 100 will be 100 less one which is equal to 101 right So one would become 101 and then eyes values incriminated Why want so eyes valueless one now And then again I'll check if I s less than five which is true So I come inside and then I'll assign l one off One is equal to l one off one place 100 So I'm adding 100 to this element toe It becomes 100 toe And similarly this Wilco Wandell index number four and when it becomes five so far is not less than fight and Irishmen will come or of the slope So this how we can work with them while you now we'll hear under the full you so full uppers usedto I trade overdose sequence So that sequence could be either to pull list dictionary said or even a string And it's no sin takes off for loop So for value in the sequence and then we'll give out the body Now this might seem a bit We got difficult to understand so philosophically had to Jupiter notebook and go ahead with the court So let me start by creating a list So I live in l one equals and then I'll give it a bunch of colors inside this which would be equal to Blue Green on Ben I just sign read through it Now once this is done let me use though for Lou Band I trade over this list So for I n at one I'll just print out I right So I have printed out each individual element off this list So for I N l one right So when I say I this value off I initially would be blue So for i n l one So Ellen has thes three elements Blue green and red And initially eyes value would be blue So I'll come inside this list and I'll print out blue Now it's incremental and I'll go to the next element in the sequence which is green So I will have green inside it I'll come in and I'll print out Green and then I'll and then I'll go ahead to the final element inside the list which is right So again I'll come inside and I'll print out the red So this is how the four loop works Now we can actually create a nested for loop so that would mean a far loop inside a for loop So for this let me create two lists and uh two separate for loops So while create let's see collar and I'll assign some value So the values are cream Yeah Lou on Dhe think And then I'll also another list And then I leaned the list to be equal to item and I'll add a bunch of items to word So let's say the first item is chaired the second item There's book and the third item is Foon Now I'll start a four loop So far I and collar I another affordable here So for G and item I will print out I come a G and this is what we have So let's understand this So we'll start with the outdoor for Loop which goes through this list over here which is color So for I n color so initially eyes value would be green Now when the eyes value is green Welcome inside the four loop and we'll start the inner loop for G and item So initially jeez value this year So I'll print out green chair Now again I'll go back and increment the value off G So then we have book inside you so I'll print out green book Then again geez values implemented It becomes phone I'll print out green phone right So now the inner loop is also done I'll go back to the outer loop and then I'll increments in clean Hello So now eyes value is yellow So again I'll come inside the loop and then I'll print out Yellow chair yellow Book and the telephone again I'll go back to the outer loop and then the value off ice pink Then I'll come inside and then I'll print picture bankbook and pink phone So this is how you can work with nested loops So now that we're done with the flow control statements will Paronto functions So what exactly is the function to simplify this What We're basically doing this You're taking in a bunch of court putting it in a simple model and weaken in book it whenever we want to perform a specific task So let's take this example of an A t M So over here depositing money inside the A team would be one function Withdrawing money would be another function and chicken balance would be another function Now let's see if you want to deposit money on dhe you would have to right around 100 lines off court to deposit my on Let's see if you were deposit money around 100 times then you'd have to write this 100 lines off scored 100 times now Instead of this it would be wonderful if we just had one deposit function on all we did was involved his deposit function and we could deposit our money happy Right So this is where functions coming Similarly when it comes to the withdrawal function we'll just have to add one function well right Or the bunch off court only ones And I never we want to withdraw money will just involved dysfunction Similarly whenever we want to check the violence I just walked the violence function and I can happily check the violence So let's go to paternal book and work with functions so nuclear function and fight and will be using the d E f mattered And then after the e f is given the name of the function So I just stopped create a very simple function on and I'll name that function to be hello And this needs to be followed without big synthesis So after this I'll give in a colon and then I'll given the body off this function So this function just brings out hello world So hello world Right now if I have to involve dysfunction I just have to type in Hello with this parentis All right so if I want to bring it out Hello World oil I have to do us Copy this Piece it over here So I'll have to do is invoke dysfunction on Then I can happily print Hello World How many times there weren't Now off this world of ours I will create a function where I'm taking our input value and adding 10 more toward So I'll type D e f and I'll name the function US ad then And this basically takes enough batter Mito value If you see this previous example you see that I did not pass anything inside the spirit This is But we can actually pass in a value inside the period this is and I'm passing in x which is obviously could be any arbitrary value and I'll put in a cooling over here Now what This does this This three tones then less ex So it takes an X adds intend to it and then returns the final value This is the function So let me in work this Let me pass in five inside this function So when I pass in five it will ard tend to it and it'll be done The final value with just 15 Similarly let's see I'll add an 100 inside this settled redoing a value off 110 So this was another example now going ahead will check fo value is even or odd using your function so I'll dive D E f And then I just named dysfunction does Are you in on again The sticks in a value so I'll use the F condition and I'll check if eggs and I'll check of eggs person to a stubble equal to zero So whatever input value was given I will divide it with two and of the input is equal to zero Then I will just rent out Eggs is even else I will print out Eggs is hard so I have created this function Now let me invoke it and passing a value so I'll pass in nine and let's see where is the result right So this function tells is that nine isn't our number Let me again passing a number inside the soil passing forward So this time dysfunction tells us that four is even right So this is how we can create functions with Fighting Noble Toronto Me Joe Biden and biting witches object oriented programming Now when you actually look around you what do you see You are surrounded with objects aren't you Right So you might have a laptop in front Off you You have a phone in front of you You have ah bike You have a dog All of these are real world objects And if you want to present these real world objects and programming paradigm then you would need something known as object oriented programming Right So simply put you have all of these steel world objects around you And if you want to represent all of these steel world objects and programming paradigm that's where he'll go ahead and use object oriented programming So now when it comes to article in the program and you be slinging to understand who particular concepts which are basically classes and objects so devastated over here a class is basically your template or a blueprint for real world entities now or I mean by So when I see template or template would comprise off two things one s properties off the object and the next test behavior off the object So let's take a phone now off one would have certain properties associated with it and it will also have certain behavior associated with it Now the property's off for food could be its color It's costing It's bad three life So what is the color of the fool in How much does it cost and how long does the battery last So these are some properties which are ASU's So these are some properties which are associated with every single phone that everyone has and then all the phones have certain behavior common to all of them so you can make a call to the phone You can watch the news on the phone and you can also play games in a phone Right so these are the properties and behavior Associate it with the phone What class basically combines these properties and behavior in one single template So that is a class Now let's understand what exactly is a object So objects are basically specific instances off a class So as I've told you a class is a general template and when you want a specific instance off that general template that is when you have an object So when I say food that phone would be your class and the objects off that phone would be Apple more troller and Samsung right So Apple Motorola and Samson would have the general template off a phone so they will have the general properties and they will also have their general behavior So if these objects are of the same phone class then you'll get those same properties which are basically which is Basically all of these phones would have color associated with them costs associated with them and then you will also have back three life associated with them And when it comes to behavior these three phones would have those functional piece comin right So in all of these three phones you can make phone calls you can play games and you can also watch videos So this is what I mean when I say objects are specific instances off a class right So now that you know where exactly is hoops and where exactly are classes and objects Let's go ahead then perform some object oriented programming So let's go ahead then create our first class and to create a class we will have to use the class keyword and then we'll give in the name of the class and by convention the first letter off the name of the class needs to be capital So I'll type in Capital B and then I'll pull it up with hetero any sort this phone And then inside this I will given the properties and the behavior of the class So ah ah phone Be skip the help of a phone You cannot make phone calls and you can play games so I'll start by creating methods So the first method is toe Make a phone call so I will name this mattered as make a call and then this will have something known as self So this self basically means that this method belongs to the instance which invokes it So this might be a bit confusing but once we actually create an instance off this last it'll become very clear to you So we have created this method and when someone in books this matter I'll just type in me can go a phone call on the Nile Given the second method which has a league game again this will have this self attribute So again the self attribute basically stands for whichever instance invokes this method It belongs to that All right so I will friend out laying game All right so I have created this class which is basically the general template off a phone Now I will go ahead and create the object So to create an object I will type and the one which is basically the instance other object off this class and I will have to type in the name of the class forward by the parenthesis And I have successfully created the instance off this phone glass Now if I have to involve these methods from this object so I will type in the name of the instance I use a daughter operator And then I can directly get the name of the method in this class If I want to make a phone call I just have to type and even dot make called So be one is the name of the instance After that given the daughter operator and then I'll give in the name of the method inside this class which is me Call right So now I have successfully involved this matter off this class so be one as an instance off This class and I'm able to access this method with the help of this instance Similarly I'll type in B one dart league game All right so now I have started bleeding Dean Right So this is how we can create instances Now let me actually go ahead and add some para meters to the methods inside this So again I'll create a new class or basically and mortifying this class I'm not creating a new clothes so I'll type in class So this will be phone and then I'll create a new method on debts will be basically toe at the color off the phone so I'll type in add color So now every method inside the class needs to have this self attribute And then after that I'll given another parameter which is basically Carly And inside this Ivan said self dot Koller equals color Now you have to understand that this self dot color and this color are actually different So this color is the value when someone gives while in walking this matter while the self dark color is the in Build a tribute inside this class off that particular instance So this seems confusing Let me repeat it again So this color that you see is basically the perimeter of the value when someone gives and white in working this matter and the self dot color is the value it is being assigned to the color attribute off the instance which is being involved So let me actually go through and this will become very clear to you right So I have created this method and then similarly I wanna do my third called us on cost again This will have to perimeters forced yourself on the next would be caused and then I'll die Pond self dot cost equals cost So this has also done so going ahead I will create one more matter where I'd have to show the color and show the cost rights Until now I have only taken the color from the user and taken the course from the user Now I also have to print it out so I'll create a new mattered called us Sure color This would have self and on this would basically return the color so self dark color And after this I would have sure cost again The barometer would be self and this would be returning the course so that would be Self Dart Coast All right on denial Again create those two basic functions which are basically making a phone call and playing a game So definition off this would be self I am just printing out making a phone call off this I'd have to create the final Mattered Which us play game again This will have those self attribute andan I'll print out playing game right So I have successfully created this class No I'll go ahead then create and sense of this class so I'll type in We do equals phone Let me go ahead and add the color and cost of this phone so I'll type in B two dog collar Let me go ahead then at the color in cost of this phone So I'll type and be too dark Collier and uh all right go ahead then at the color and cost to this phone so I'll type A and B to dart Add color on the color of this phone is let's see blue now Similarly I also want to add the cost of this phone so be too dark at cost and the cost of this foreigner's let's say $200 right now I have a signed the color and the cost Now let me show the color in the course so I'll type in b two dot show collar so we see that the color of the phone is blue Now let me also print of the cost so be towed out show cost So we see on the course of the fullness 200 All right so now what you see is this self dot cost equals cost yourself dot Color equals color So this color is basically this value which we are passing in when we are invoking the function Right So this blue is going over here and this is being assigned to the attribute color off this class phone So make it more clear Let me actually create one more instance off this class on Let me add the color to the So be three equals Foon So I have created this and then I type and be three dog add color on the collar off this phone would be red Now let me show this out Be $3 shoe color So the color off this instance off the phone be three Israeli Now let me die about we do Lord Sure color which is blue Right So this self what you see this basically denotes the instance which is invoking the method Right So were here when we involved the odd color with the Frito instance This self attribute was with respect the p two instance and similarly over here when we were in booking the odd color with respect the p three instance the self attribute was off the B three Instance this how we can add parameters to our methods and invoke them through our objects Now let's head onto an important concept and object oriented programming which is inheritance What comes to mind when you hear the word inheritance So simply put inheritance basically means that when something acquires the property's off someone else's are something else is right So let's say you are inheriting your features from your father or you are inheriting the land or the property from your answer stores right so it could be materialistic inheritance Or it could be the features all the looks from your appearance fruit so inheritance is basically acquiring properties from another person or another thing And when it comes to object oriented programming that pretty much means the same thing Over here you will have two classes are more than two classes One class inherits the features or the property's off another class And that is pretty much the concept off inheritance and object oriented programming So let's again head back to Egypt a notebook and start with inheritance Sure inheritance Over here I just create an extension of the original class So our elders I will create our new class and I'll name this class as iPhone And this iPhone will be inheriting from the these class phone which we had created earlier Right So this is the base class and this new class iPhone would be inheriting from this B's class No this would have one extra method which is cure cancer Now As you know iPhone is already famous and its females because it can I click your cancer so doctors why it cost so much So that is amazing isn't it So your cancer I'll given those self attribute and then I'll just print out I can cure gun So So I have created this new class Now let me create an instance of this so I be one equals iPhone So I have created the instance Now let me go ahead and in Logan methods But as you can see this class for this instance of the class has the methods add color and art course Now even though I have not explicitly stated these methods inside this cars they are still a part off this class because it is inheriting from the bees class which is fighting And since these two methods are part of the beast class I can automatically invoke these two classes So let me a sign off color to this phone So the collar off iPhone is Greek Now I'll go ahead and also said in cost So I p one dog on cost and the cost of five poon would be let's see $899 and then let me involved a method which is Ah only there in the iPhone class So I'd be one dog cure cancer All right so I can cure cancer right So this is how inheritance walks and biting right So we're done with object oriented programming as well Now we'll go ahead and work with some packages in biting so well Sarah Fido numb by package number basically stands for your medical python and is the school library for New American Scientific computing So that's too much off information So simply put numb by basically has a multi dimensional Eric Now to process those multi dimensional areas you have certain functions on you have certain operations pre built in the number I package on That is how you can work with these numb by multi dimensional Cherries so you can perform all sorts of new medical and scientific operations on this number So let's go to Jupiter notebook on dhe walk with this very famous package or less number So start working with the number library who have to first imported so you'll type in import numb by us And this is just an alias so that I can keep in walking this package whenever I need Right So N P is the alias Now before you can actually go ahead and work with this library you'd have to install it so you install it Since we're working with Anaconda let me open this up right Pseudo install this you'd have to type in Pip in stall number Right But they're gonna feel walking with Anaconda numb pipe on dollars in my lower lip All of these company installed in and conduct But then again if you're working with by chum or if you're working with any other python I d Then you'll have to manually installed Mumbai All right so in Mumbai as already in Seoul and I have six really important number into my system now it's time to go ahead and create my first multi dimensional Eric So once you install them by and you invoke the library you have to create a numb by Eric and you can create both a single dimensional area as well as a multi dimensional in them by So do create a numb piper Laurie you just have to type in n p dot Eric have a little U N P is beast leader Elia's Phanom bicycle type in N B Dart Harry And this basically takes in a list off values or a list off list to create a single dimensional area of what you Louis you will pass in a list inside this NP dart airy and this will give you a number I Similarly to create a multi dimensional array you will pass in a list off Lis Right So this is one list and inside this you've given to list right So the first list comprises off elements 10 2030 and 40 and the second less comprises off the elements 40 30 20 and 10 So let's go ahead and create our first numb by race So why create a single dimensional number Hurry first So let me just add in this comment single dimensional numb by area So as I've only told you to create a number I really would have to type in and be dog Harry And inside this I'll give it a list off values Let's see the list off Values are 10 2030 40 and 50 So I'll die Bend for zero over here and fighting over here And I'll store this you know new readable on name that variable eyes and one Now let me print out and one over here So this is our number I worry not Let me also check the type to be sure So type off anyone and this shows is that this is so numb by nd hurry or n dimensional Eric let's go ahead then create a multi dimensional area So I'll diaper and multi dimensional So we're here I'll be storing this value and and do so and b Dawg very hard to keep in mind that you passing a list off list So here So I create one list and inside this I create the first sub list on the values would be 10 2030 And then I create another sub list the values I'm giving our 30 20 and 10 No let me print out and do so This is my my D dimensional area which comprises off to rules and three columns So the force through comprise off 10 2030 And the second rule comprise off 30 20 and 10 Not gonna let me check the type of this so type off and do so type off and do it again Numb by and dimensional Eric And this is how we can create numb by Aries and biting So guys this is just a starting and you can do a lot of stuff with these numbers areas All right I will go ahead and see How can we initialize er number I agree with all CDU's So let's say if we want to create up simple rule Ari which comprise off two zeros then we have this zeros matter So impede or zeroes you are invoking this heroes my third from the number I package when you type in numb So when you type in n p dot zeroes and then you have to give in the dimensions offered So the dimensions of the number area one cross too And then you'll get this Similarly If you want to create a fight cross fight numb by re which comprise off only zeros then just type in and p dot zeros and inside the actual given the values So let's initialize are numb by David Zeroes Over here I'll type in End one and then and B Dawg zeros So I want those size of the number I hurry to be one cross too and then I'll print this out right So how successfully created my numb by area off dimensions One cross two which means one wrote two columns and the values are just zeros now Similarly I'll create an aluminum via race Oh and one equals np dot zeros and I want us to be Oh let's see six across six Numb by early which comprise off only zeros Again let me print in the value of end one Right So I have created this number area which is often mentioned Six Cross six and it comprise off only zeros Similarly let's see if you want to initialize the number I agree with those same number So this is where we have the full method from Mumbai So we have to type in and be doubtful and the stakes into parameters The food's perimeter is their dimension of the number theory and the second perimeter is the value with which you would want to fill up your number Over here I am creating a number Hurry off dimension to cross to and the value which I'm filling it up with this number 10 So let's create this So I'll name the size and one again and I'll type in and we dot full Are you in the dimension I want to create a three cross three numb by Harry and I won't do fill it up with the number seven on Then let me put in doubt and one over here So we have created this three cross three numb by river All of the elements are just seven again We can initialize are numb by a Reno differently So if you want to initialize are numb by a riveter particular every engine mind So let's say I want my number IRA to be filled with all of the values from 10 to 20 So basically the interval as the one on the skiff value is one will have 10 11 12 13 14 15 going on until 19 right So I want to fill up my numb by a repeater particular range So this is how I can do work now another formers I basically give us skip value So when we don't give the third perimeter a range or dramatically peaks the skip perimeter us one So when we look at the second example over here the range is basically from 10 2 50 But the skip value is fight So your first number would become 12th numbers 15 20 And then this goes on until 45 You have to keep in mind that this last number which you see this is exclusive It is not inclusive So when you are five more to 45 if it is less than 50 only then you'll get the last value If it is equal to or greater than 50 then you will not get that value All right so let's go ahead and initialize on them by a with the particle range So again I'll type in and one So this would be and B dawg the range on inside this I will be sleeping in the range with which I want this number IRA to be filled with So I want us to be filled starting from one going on till 11 And then let me bring this out Right So this number I read the value started one and Gwendolyn then now similarly let me create an aluminum by hurry with those specific skip value So N one equals and B dawg a range on dhe Let's see I want the range to be from 100 going on 300 I want to skip value to be equal Do 50 So let me just print out and one now right So this is my number so 100 as the starting value to fifties The last rally Skip values 50 So that's why I get 101 5200 and 50 And when you add 50 more 22 50 it becomes 300 And since 300 is not inclusive that is why you will not have that number over there Now let's see how convenient relies on them by A with random numbers So if you're to initialize our empire with random in Bi Jo's then we've got this rand in sub matured from the random mattered So again you will set the range off the numbers from which you want the random numbers over here right The range of the numbers is one and 100 So starting from one going on Bill 100 you will juice fight random numbers So let's go to Jupiter notebook and walk with this So n one equals NP dart Random dog grand and and then inside this Let's see I want 10 random values and the values should be coming in the range between 102 100 So I want 10 random values let me print out and one right so these other 10 random values between 102 100 so That was how we good initialize our number Irene A lot off different trees Now let's see How can we check the sheep off are numb by on it Checking the sheep off our number IRA would be sleeping the number off rules and number of columns present in the Mumbai So all you have to do is create a number area first and then use this shape mattered So we use the sheep method This will tell you the number of fruits and number of columns present in this name by area Now with the help of this ship mattered you can actually change the sheep off your number on it So initially when you're initializing it this numb pie very hard to rules and three columns But with the help of this ship method you can change it to three rules and two columns So let's call it a paternal book And let's see this visually so again and one And let me create in them by early or here And B dog Harry let me give in some values So let's see one do three and four on dhe actually have to give him the list off lists So let me got those sand beast inside this and then my second sub list would be 567 and eight So I have created and one over here let me check the sheep and one dog sheep So the shape of this number areas to cross for this would mean we have two rules and four columns And this numb by Harry that would basically amount to eight Now it's enough to cross food I want this number I agreed to be off the ship full cross to Or in other words I don't have four rules and two columns so I'll have to do is type in and be dot sheep equals four Cross do So this is done Now let me print out and one right So initially this was our and one hurry which was off the sheep across four and then be reshaped it Now this is how it looks like now once you know how to initialize a numb by reason howto check the sheep off when the empire is let's go ahead and perform some simple mathematics on top of these numb by Perry's So we look at some basic addition operations Soto are too numb by a race We will just use those some function from the numb by package So here I am creating to numb by race and won and and do And when I use those some method over here I'll person anyone and do as a list Right So this will add all of these individual elements from both of these numb by fairies So when you add 40 30 20 and 10 it will give you a complete value of 100 Now you can also said the access that you don't set the access than it will add all of the individual elements which are present So when you said access to be equal to zero then it actually does work Tickle addition right So what I mean by what pickle relish Innis It would add the individual elements off each index about this Terry So Index zero over here for and one and two When you add 10 plays 30 it would become 40 and that is what you have Similarly when you come to index number one and you add 40 plus 20 you get 60 And that is where you have now instead of access to be equal to zero When you said the access to be equal to one you basically are doing horizontal addition doctors You are something of the values which are present in one individual number library So here then plus 20 becomes 30 And that is what you have and would hear when you add to a D plus 40 and become 70 and that is what we have over you All right so let's go to Jupiter Notebook and perform these methods So let me create a new name by three I'll call it E over here so it will be and be Dog Harry and I'll pass in our list off values over here That would be then and Wendy And then I'll create another onem by Harry's Wild I pinned and be dogged area again and the values inside this would be 30 and 40 So I have successfully created my duodenum Buyer is now going ahead Let me use some methods so it would be and be dart some and inside this I'll just parson e comma be which are basically than them by a race which I've created And I got a complete value off 100 Now let me go ahead Dan said The access so n v dot some I type in e comma Be on then let me said the access who I am sitting though access to be equal to zero And when I said the access to be equal to zero as we have already seen we have vertical additional here So 30 plus 10 gives you 40 and 40 plus two antique soup 60 All right No let me go ahead then said the access to be equal do one So I'll pass in a coma Be on dhe I said the access to be equal to one right so 10 plus 20 becomes 30 and 40 plus 40 becomes 70 So those were some basic addition operations on top of the numb by worries Now let's see how can we join Different number varies So we're basically God thes different methods We've got restock which stands for were tickle stock than we've got Head stack which stands for horizontal stack and then we got Gollum stack So when it comes to restock what we do is we join these numb pi r is true wise so over here we have to win Umpire race and Won and Anto And when we use the stack mattered upon thes to numb by Parise We are basically joining thes tune Umpire is otherwise Then we have the head stock function So when it comes to head stag function we are combining these two numb piras call advice So Nesic column vice We will take in this first number library and then will that That's the second number I hurry to the back and off this Then we have column stack very basically taken to single dimensional lump I worries And then we stagger them calling vice to create a two dimensional So as we see over here we've got to wonder missionaries right to end one and then two And when I used column stack on top of this island two dimensional area over here these two are stag Call on vice All right so let me go ahead and use thes three functions So let me create and one over here So and one is a will do And the dog Harry on Let me given the value stand 20 and Cody then and you would be equal do and be dot Harry and the values inside this would be let's see 30 40 and 50 So I have created and won and now it's time to use We stack on top of them so I'll type in and be dogged We stuck and inside those sile parson and one on do So let me get the result right So I have horizontally So I have a stag These two columns otherwise now similarly instead off the stock let me use horizontal stack So I die Pin head stack over here right So when I use head stock I get the saw him horizontally stacking He's too numb by race And then finally let me use and v dot column Stack on and I'll person and one and then do on Dhe I have taken these two individual single dimensional areas for 10 2030 30 40 50 and have stabbed them calling vice to create a new dimension them by Right So this brings us to the end of this number I model Now let's go ahead and walk with another interesting package in fighting which is find us So panda stands for final later and it is the core library for determining police unit leader analysis So as numb by provides us my d dimensional Harry Similarly bond US provides a multi dimensional deal a structure for performing various data manipulation operations So it provides us both or a single dimensionally a structure and a multi dimensional deal a structure So as we see over here the single dimensionally a structuralist call as the series object and the multi dimensional structures called as the deed after him and well mostly working with the data streams and biting so dear friends become extremely important when it comes to deal assigns operations So all of the machine learning algorithms which you apply linear regression logistic regression decision free and so on All of these are applied on the dreams and this is because all of the deed assets which you have all the CIA's we files which you have text files which you have they can be converted toward the stream and fightin and all of the manipulations can be done on the state of him All right so let's start off in the bond our series object So so as you see or hear or serious object is basically a one dimensional labeled area So the difference between this and the num Piper areas when it came to the number I agree it was not legal but the series object is a one dimensional labeled area And that's how you can create a series object So before we go ahead and create a series Object Force would have to invoke Go bond us library So we'll type in import pond as SPD and Petey again Over here is just an alias for pond us So after being broke ponders will type NPD dot series So what You you have to keep in mind that s s Capitol and inside this well personal last 1234 and five And we have created this series object So let me start off by importing pond a soiled diaper and import fund as our speedy So the ministry tell this packet is loaded So that was done Now again since I'm using Anaconda Bond us comes preinstalled in it So if you have to manually installed find us this is what you have to do open up and conduct roamed and then you'd have to type in installed find us So once you do that bound us will be installed All right So I have important the pond A slavery Now let me go ahead then create my full series object So I named the subject as s one and I'll type in BD dot CDs And inside this I'll be sleep arsenal list So the list would comprise off the value stand 2030 40 and 50 So let me print and as one over here So this is my series object So as you see over here these are the values and these values are off type Indy Joe 64 So indeed your 64 bit and these are the labels associated with each of these values So zero as the label associated with 10 1 is the label associated with 22 with the level associate with 30 She can either call these index values or the labels associated with these numbers So you must be thinking that Is there a bee that we can actually change the index off or panda Siri's while you can So all you have to do with include this index attribute and then give the labels which you want for these So as you see over here initially the labels who's you know 123 and four now After that you just use this index attribute and then change these values to A B C D and E Right So let's perform thus So let me go ahead and add the next to this So as you see or hear initially the labels were 0123 and four Now let me go ahead and change the index So this time I'll said though index to be a B C D On dhe Eat now let me print out as one So as you see over here these were the initial in next values and I have changed them Do these over here so we start to clear the CDs object from or less Now let's see How can we clear the CDs object from a dictionary So as you see over here we'll just pass in this dictionary inside the Siri's object And one thing to note over here is if you don't specifications said the index values the key automatically becomes the index and the values would automatically become the actual values inside the series object So I re treated the keys would become the index values and the values would become the actual values off the series object So let me clear Door dictionary over here So the one and uh I'll said the key to be equal to K one and the value to be Then then I'll said the key to be gay too And the valuables 20 than Ke aes Key three and it US toady I have created the dictionary Now again let me go ahead and create the CDs are this so BD dot Siri's and I'll pass in the dictionary inside this and I'll store this in s one So let me print out this one again Right So this is my Siri's object which has been created from this dictionary So as we see over here the keys have become the index values So Ki won ki duk e three other index values and 10 2030 other actual values of the series object Right So that was all about the single dimensional data structure series No one here under the most important data structure and bison which is indeed out for him So other than stated over him A date A famous beast Clear two dimensional label data structure under comprise off rules and columns So that's where you see So you've got three rows over here and two columns over here And normally when it comes toward the tough for him all of the elements inside one column would have those same type So as you see this is the name and the names are normally string So Bob is a string Sam is a string and on a string right And then we've got Mark's So Marxist another individual column And when you look at the values inside this Marks column you see that 76 25 92 all of these are in PGA values right So this is our data from looks like and to create a data for him This is how you can do it So all you have to do issues the p d dot the tough really mattered And then you can create it from a dictionary over here right So the key becomes the column name over here and these values become the true values over here So let me create a deal A frame So I'll name the street after him A student and the first column would actually be the name of the students So I'll diaper and student name So this is actually the key And then I'll give him the list off values So the list off values would be Bob and then the God Sam after that with God Julia and then with God Charles So these other student names and then the on Then let's go ahead and given some box to the students So I really create the next key which would be student marks So I'll die friend student marks over here and then I'll given a list off values So let's see Bob has scored 87 and Sam has scored only 30 marks Then we've got Julia who has scored an impressive 99 then we've got Charles who has scored an average 67 so I have successfully created this dictionary Now it's time to create a deal for him or this dictionary so I'll dive in be the dart to the Gulfstream and inside this I just have to pass in this dictionary I can run and I have successfully created the steel frame where the tea over here becomes the column name and the's list off values for a particle Erkki become the rule values for that column So Bob Sam Julia and Charles are the list off values or the rule values for this key student name which is the column name Similarly 87 13 99 and 67 other rule values for this key student marks So now that we know how to create or deal off him let's go ahead then perform some inbuilt functions on top of this deal after him So we'll be working with this basic functions Just tail had sheep and describe So walk with all of those and build functions will start by reading or CS We file as our data for him first so I'm gonna let me but from the basic steps so I'll type in import bond as a speedy Now you look to see if we file I'd have to type in BD dot read underscore CS Week and inside this out after giving the name of the fight So we'll be walking with this iris dot CS we file on Duh I'll be storing this in a new object and I'll call it object as Iris So now I would have a glance at the first fire records off this Irish dude after him to have a glance of the forest fire records I'll just type in iris dot head right So I've got this first fire records of the deed offering Let's understand the state of him properly So this has got fi columns which are basically CEPAL int separate battleland battle within species So these are basically the different features off the species off the iris plot So I've got three different species said Joseph Warsi Color and War Jessica And for all of these three different species we've got the CEPAL and separate battle lengthen pedal right So as we already saw were here the head function helps us to have a glance at the first fight records for this detail For him if I were to have a glance of the first then records then I'll have to do is type in 10 inside this head function Then we'll have a glance of the 1st 10 records of the state offering right And if I want to have a glance that Let's see the 1st 100 records Then I'll just type in Ida's daughter Head 100 Right So these are the 1st 100 records by though in next value starts at zero and that goes on till 99 Now I love us to the head function We also have the tail function so I'll type and Iris Dart deal Now the stale function would give me the last five records off the state after him So the starts it in next number 1 45 and goes on till index number 1 49 Similarly if I would have a glance in the last 10 records then I'll just pass And then over here right So these other last 10 records of this Ira street off him now these other head and tail functions There is also this describe function So I just type and describe over here on let the seawater does over here So this would be Scully described this entire data frame in terms off all of these different measures So we've got count So this count is basically the number off records present for each of these different columns so that our 1 50 records for several and similarly 1 54 separate worth by the land and brutal word All right so these obviously though different count values off all of these columns and then we've got the mean value So this is the mean value off supple and supple worth better length and Gretel bread And similarly we've got the minimum value standard value 25 percentile maximum value and so one So these are some basic functions which can be implemented on top of any d w So now going ahead we'll see how you access individual Druze and columns Ramadi tough ring So to do that we've got the eye lock and the loc methods So let's start with the I lock matter So Force will give in the name of the data for him and then we'll just type in dot i l O c So this dark I'll obviously stands for index location And this is how we can extract some specific cruise and columns from this entirely different So here what we're doing us We are extracting the 1st 3 records from this data for him and the 1st 2 column straight So the index values go from 0 to 3012 And then the call and values are zero to write to zero and one CEPAL lengthen separate So they said we can extract a subsidy off the data stream from this and I did it for him So now let me again print out the head of this so Iris Start head This is my data for him over here Now let's say I want a subsection which comprise off the room numbers starting from Let's in 99 on going on tell 1 26 and I want only the Bright Island and the battle were to call him So to do that I'd have to type in Iris and then I'll type in Lucy Are you giving this Square Braces were here I'll put in a comma Now whatever you give in on the left side off the com a doctor would denote all of the rules which would want to extract And whatever you put in on the right side off the commandant would denote all of the columns which would want to extract So as I've said that room numbers was able to extract our from 99 to 1 26 So indexing will start from 99 go till 127 and then the call and value should be 012 and three So the signal from 2 to 4 So I just put him to do for over here and I'll store this in a new data for him And I learned that to be Iris one So let me print out Iris one over here right So this is our data from Iris one which comprise off only the columns by Dylan and Petal Word Right And the room number start from 99 Cornell 1 26 now Similarly let's say if I want to extract all of the records starting from room number 10 and going on telephone number 20 And I warned on lead these two columns to assemble and column and the species called him So let me show you guys how it's done So this time I'll named it after him as Irish stew and I'll Die pin Iris start I will type in I lock over here and this would go from 10 to 21 after this I will just given the column value so again I will be in a list over here and inside this I've given the index although First column which is basically zero And then I'd given the index off the final column were just four over here I look on run on let me print out Iris to war here Right So this is my subsection of the end I date after him there I have through number starting from index number 10 going on until the next number 20 And these other two countries have extracted to separate and then species So this is how I can work with I lock matter then I love us too Though I lock method we also have the lock method to extract individual rows and columns So the only differences and to love giving the index values over here be given the labels off the columns over here Right So here when it comes to roost will similarly given though index values of the rules And over here when it comes to columns I will give him the names of the columns So let's work with I Look now let me print out the head again Iris dot Head Right So This is my date after him Over here on this time I warned all of the records starting from room number 33 going on let's say 44 Andi I store this on iris three So this will be iris dot loc And inside this this has to go from 23 to 44 And then the names of the columns which I will extract would be separate Burton But a word Now you have to keep in mind that you given the column names properly right So if you make a spelling mistake then there would be an error over you so I'll type in separate on Then I'll give in the name of the next column which is basically battle word Now let me print out the subsection so I just print in Iris three Right So these are all the records starting from tau number 33 going on till rule number 44 And those other two columns have extracted Several were 10 petals All right So you know what We did this We extracted some individual rules and columns with the help off dot lock and dart loc But now well actually perform data manipulation operations where we'll be extracting records on the basis off condition So let's go out and do that now The condition which I won't specify Yes I want only those records from the state as it were The separate length is greater than five So let's see How can we do that So first I give in the name of the deed offering which is Iris and I'll put in code So here and then I'll give in the name of the column which is basically CEPAL And so I want to extract only do with records where the separate length is greater than five So I will be speaking on condition that the supple and has to be greater than five Now let me click on Ron and let's see what do we get So obviously got a bunch off true and false values Now what does this mean So this means that wherever you have the true label this condition has been satisfied and wherever you have the false label this condition has not been satisfied So we have the true label for the zero it record over here and that is because the separate length is greater than five Similarly we have a true value over here And that is because the separate length is greater than five Right So wherever you have the true value that is where you have the supple and to be greater than five Now we've done this Let's go ahead to the next part where we actually have to extract those records Now we just have a bunch off True and false values Extract the records again I'll type in Iris I really given Praecis I will guard this and I will be Is this inside this iris data for him So what I'm doing us I will be extracting only does records where this condition evaluates to True I'll take on run right And this is what we have Now if you look at the CEPAL end Colum then you'll see that all of these values are greater than five So what will be excluded us First we started off by giving the condition and then we put in this condition again inside this iris to get after him So this give us only those records where this condition was satisfied Right now let's go ahead and perform similar operations So this time I want only does records where battleland is greater than two and the species is equal to war Jessica So let's check that out So let me got this first and given the condition So the first condition would be Iris And then we wonder off Battleland to be greater than two So I'll type in battle underscore length and this has to be greater than do No I will includes this within round brackets After that I will give in the end operator because I want both of these conditions to be satisfied So I'll go ahead then given the second condition So the second condition Iris on dhe this time the name of the columnists species So this has to be equal Do I was gonna go so I just said Raji Nick over here All right so these other two conditions now I will gut this out and again I'll type in Iris and beast it inside this and I will store this in our new deal A free man named that to be Iris Finally Now let me check the head of this So iris final dart head Right So we see that we have extracted only those records where the battleland is greater than two Right So here you see Patel and is greater than two and the species equal towards Unica So we have given multiple conditions to extract these records Similarly as many conditions as possible you could give 234 or five as many conditions as you want So let's complicate this a bit on well given three conditions over here So this time I wonder separate lent to be greater than six CEPAL worth to be greater than three and battle went to be also greater than three So let's given all of those three conditions and let's see what do we get So I will type in Iris and my first condition would be separate Lent has to be greater than six I'll put in braces and this is my first condition After that I'll give in the end operator and then given those second condition I'll type in Iris And the simple word has to be greater than three so wild type in CEPAL world This has to be greater than three tonight given the final condition which is basically the better land has to be greater than six So Iris on then I'll give in better length over here This has to be agreed to Then six Let me got all of this Let me taste it inside this All right So I have given my three conditions over here Let me get this entire thing out Let me type in IRAs over here and I'll be sitting over here All right I will store the Seine Let's say iris random So this would become Iris Random dog head Right So we have these records where they're separate lenders Greater than sex The supple workers realer than three The petal length is greater than three And the better length is real Then six Right now let me actually remove this head and let's see how many actual record satisfy this So see that we are only three records Are these 150 records where these three conditions are satisfied doctors The separate lentils were than six The petal worth is greater than three And the petal length is greater than six Right So these were some different data manipulation operations which we could perform when the iris t does it so that was data manipulation Now we'll head onto data visualization and perform data visualization biting Try to serve packets called us my blood lip And with the help of my clock lip you can create beautiful graphs such as Bob Lord Scatter plots hissed a grams and a lot more So let's go to Jupiter Notebook and who work with these graphs So we'll start by importantly by plot sub model from though my problem library So I'll type in from my Lord Lib I'm bored five Florida's Bld So I have imported this and we also have to create some numb by areas So for that purpose I would not have to import Mumbai So I'll die pin import numb by as and so we have important the required models So now that we have the required packages are first plot which will be making is a line plot So create this line plot we would require X end Why values So let me start by creating the X values so X would be equal to and B dawg the range And I want the value starting from one and going go until then All right so let me just bring this out first So I've got my ex values ready Now let me also create my y value So why would be equal dude two times off x So let me also print out why So I also have my why values Really Now it's time to finally make the line plot So make a line Claude All we have to do us type and b l d Dark Lord So this blog is beast leader Alliance for this by plots of mortal Now whatever plots you're making start all of them you'll be making with this pipe lots of model and make a line plot you will be using This Lord mattered from the reality sub model So you'll just put in this round braces over here and then you'll pass in the X And why values as the initial Param it does You'll type in X comma Why Over here After that just type in b l d dot shoe Go on run And then you successfully have created your first visualization Now isn't this a beautiful line plot So over here what we basically have is the X axis This is the why access right So when you have the X value to be equal to the vie value as four when you have the X value to be equal to four the value has eight And there is word this line plot is telling you now Will this be even better if we are Title X label Lando while able to this So let's go ahead and do that So let me at the title So at the title you have to type in B l T Door title and let's say the title which I'll be giving this a CZ line Blood Now let me give it the X Axis label so this would be really dot exe level and I'll just simply put in ex access over here Now let me also put in the wild label so I'll type in Realty Door Y label on dhe Inside this I'll type in Why access Right So we have part of the title we have out of the X axis and we have also added the why access Now let's say I want to change the collar off this line so I don't really like blue Maybe I want green color or red color So how do I do it So over here So I would have to go inside this main function which is P l d dot Lord and I will use the color at reviewed and I will set the color So I want us to be green so I'll just type in green over here Right So now I have changed this color green Similarly five wonders to be orange I can just type in orange over here and the color becomes orange Now I can also play with the line Were tender lines style offered So I just type in lying right Where were you on Let me send it to be equal to Let's say it Do let me go on run So let me get on with this underscore over here Right So I have increased the line We're so to make it more obvious let me make it five over here Right So this has become thicker so you can give it whatever value you desire I'll given 50 right now This has become quite Thank you So let me change it Back to do you seems quite good for this No I can also change the line style of this so I'll type and line style Andi I'll set the line style to be equal Do Colin So when you put in Colin this is what you get Right So you have a dashed line over here So this how you can basically creator line plot right So first you will type in realty dot plot and then you will give in the X values and the Y values offer that if you want to describe the plot more you cannot the title you can have the x label and also why label So let's say if you also want to add a great to this so all you have to do is certain bld dart grid So this has to be small g over here and you'll just type in true inside this right So you have also added up create So this So this is how you can either line block Now let's say I want to add two lines inside this one single blood So where Louis I will actually add one more Why value So my why I want us to x over here Similarly I'll also create why do so I'll set Why do Toby equal do three x So let me print out Why Ron as well as why do Right So this is why one and why do so I will be making two large store here So first is with respect to why one and X next would be with respect to y two and X right So now we have two lines over here to distinguish them Let me give it a different color over here Let me change their studio Let's see back to blue again Right So this is a line which the notes why is equal to three X And that's the line Which the notes Why is it called a U X So this was a line plot Now let's go ahead and create a bar plot so I'll type and I just given to come into your bar large You create this bar plot I would need a dictionary first So let me again name this dictionary to be student Over here on Dhe I'll have some names of students and the marks of the students So let's see the first student as Sam Agan and he has scored 30 then the God Bob who has scored 50 on Dhe Finally the God Julia who has scored 70 So we have created this dictionary over here Once the stationery is done I'll have to extract the keys and store it into a separate really well and extract the values and store into a separate variable So I'll take this new variable called as names and I will extract only the keys offered now Once I do this I would need the list off the keys because the lot because the Peel Didot bar function only takes a list off values I got this and I'm piecing this inside this similarly also extract the value so ill So I'll be storing garden the marks object again Let me do the same thing So this will be student dart values So let me print out names and marks over here first names and then I've got marks So I have extracted the names and then I've also extracted the marks not to make a bar floor Titus after type and B L D Dart bar So first I would have to give in the categorical values which are stored in names And then I'd have to give in the corresponding numerical values with respect to those categorical values which are stored in marks Let me also put in really the dart show over here right So this is my bar Lord So this graph basically tells me that there are three students forced us some who has scored 20 marks Then that is Bob who escort 70 marks And then there's Julia who has scored 70 marks Now again if I want to change the color of this part I'll have to do is use this color attribute and give it a different color So let's see I want to give it Yeah so I'll set yellow over here right So I've changed the color again If I were to give the X Axis label you access label and the title it does the same process again So I'll type and b a d dot title over here Andi I give the title Eyes marks off Students offered our tiles in the X axis label So P l D dog X label on DDE that would be equal to names off students on DDE we l d dot Why label which would be equal Do just marks right So Marshall Students is a title Marks is the Y Axis label on number and names of students is of X axis leaving again If I would add a good that will be be LD dot great on dhe id Have to just set in True over here Right So this is my bar blood There's also something known as a horizontal bar Blood What Here we have these bars tagged award tickly barred and said If you want to see these bars horizontally then we have this bar hedge function from the by plot model So the only difference which will have to do us instead off realty dot bar We just have to put in real d dog bar hatch And when you do this this is what you get So initially these bars who stag Particularly now when you use bar hedge these bars are stacked horizontally Now let's go ahead and create a scatter plot Let me out the comment over here All right so first I'll go ahead and our Kate to less over here so I'll name the force list as X again and I'll give in a bunch of random values Oh you So I'll take in Let's say six random values So 12345 on Dhe six Now Similarly I'll take one of the last style named Toby Why Ron Now you have to keep in mind that you Diego seem number off values and X and Y because of a scatter plot It basically gives you or point for a specific position off X and Y coordinates Right So again I'll give in some random sex value So 9126 on dhe four and nine again So we've got the X end Why Values ready now to make a scatter plot all you have to do is just type and b l d dot scatter and then passing the X and the Y values And this is what you have to let me also add Big red So really dot grid I'll make it to be true Right So this is what you have So this is the first point where the X coordinate as one and the y coordinate as four right So this is the point which it does denoting And then we have got three Comotto So three commode to would be this point than we've got 4949 would be this point Right So this is our scatter plot Looks like Now let's see if you wanted to pick two different point teams on those same scatter plot than all you have to do us create a new list So I name this to be Why one I said it Toby Why one over here Let me again create our new list Which is why I do let me give in a bunch of random values again So 478126 Right So I've got my bunch of six values over here Let me create another sky deployed over here So this time it will be with respect to X and why you and I will give it a different color so the color would be red All right So I have added to a different team point on those same graph over here Now let's get on to the next plotting which is Oh hissed a gram So Mr Graham basically helped us to understand their distribution Off continues column So for this will be actually loading Though I Z That's it again and understand the distribution or some of the continent's columns off that day does it So again I little bit he does it So I will type and speedy dot read c s we And now I'll give in the name of the file which is irs dot CS week and I'll store this and Iris again All right so let me have a glance at the head of this again So ira start head Right So this is our day Does it Now I want to understand the distribution off this CEPAL length column So for that or Lewis be lt dot make a history Graham we've got this hist function and inside this I just given the name of the column So Iris and I'll give in the name of the column were just separate lint And then I'll just put in B l d dog show So this is the history ma'am And this truce is their distribution off this separate length column Now to increase the distribution off these bins over here they've got the bends attributes Why the stipend Vince So let's say I want to when deepens so I'll just type in bins So I just said the immense value to be called a 20 the inference which we can draw from this plotters So that's if you take this particular been over here than this tells us that there are around 16 records where the CEPAL land off the flowers exactly around five Then we've got this over here So this been tells is that there are again around 16 records with a separate lettuce 6.5 And if you take this been over here so there are very very few recalled So this would be Let's say there's just one record by the CEPAL Enter somewhere between 7.5 indeed So again if you take this been so that would be around four records or there are just four flowers who separate lent US 4.5 So this is the sort of influence which we can draw from artist a gram and the basic difference between oh hissed a gram and a bar floaters So our bar plotters used to understand the distribution off a categorical Buble while hissed A gram is used to understand the distribution off continues really well now Similarly if I want to understand the distribution off Let's see Tell word So I changed this over here and I just put in But it's worth right So this is the distribution off battle word So there are around 34 records who is spittle where it would be somewhere around 0.2 or 0.3 So those constitute a lord of florist right And if you take this been over here so there would be just one recorder There's just one floor rather Patel worth a 0.5 And this seems to be the maximum battle word which is around 2.5 So though maximum by tell world off 2.5 they're around fire records Right now let's again understand a distribution off CEPAL worth So I'll change this and I'll just put in simple over here right So we have Ah big beak over here So there are 20 fi records where those simple worth street on there's less And there is just one regard Who Cepal Where it would be around 4.3 or 4.4 Right So this is history Graham So now we'll go ahead and make some box plots so box plots are used to understand the distribution off How does one continues variable change with respect Oh a categorical value And again we'll be billing box plots on this Isaiah said So I'll type in Iris died Box blood on this basically has stew perimeter So the force para meter is the column who are well assigned the y values or the country news value on the continent value which I'd want to given a separate leant over here So I'll type in separate leant on denial mother categorical value onto the X axis So for this I've got to buy a tribute on dhe They've only got one categorical variable over here right So the species column is the only categorical beauty will which you've got so I'll type in species of you I'll hit on Run on This is the box blood which you get So what you see over here So this line which you see in the middle of this box this is known as the median line This is the 25 percentile line and this is the 75% Thailand Just focus on this median line over here So this tells a start at the species off the floors seducer than the median separate lint off the flower would be around five and again Let's take this box over here So if the species off the flowers were secular than the median CEPAL length would be around 5.9 on will seek this So if those species of the flowers were Tanika than the median CEPAL land over here would be 6.5 So this is the influence which you can draw from a box plot Similarly if I want to understand how this battle worth really with species let me just put in bye till we're through with you right So again we have three boxes over here one box each for the different species of the iris flower So here it seems that the median line would be somewhere over here So though said the species of the florist settles out than the median petal where it would be around up 0.3 or 0.4 than report will see color over years Of those species of the flowers were sick all of them the median battle over It would be 1.2 basic inference is war Janica over here would have the maximum I tell worth And so does I Would have the minimum height L word So that was the same case which we saw with separate Lent as well So what Monica had a maximum Zeppelin and said Oh so hard The Minimum Zeppelin If you want to meet this plot even more beautiful we can use the Seaborne library So let me just import the Seaborne library I'll type and import see von US s anus Then we've got the box Blood mattered from this So s s daughter Bo explored Now where Luis I have all the loaded this Iris D does it so onto the X access I'll be mapping those species called him So Iris Andi I'll type in species and onto the why access I will be scheme at the Zeppelin column So again Iris So the name of the column a separate land right So this is a much more beautiful plot when compacted us again The inference is pretty much there seem All right So where's Nika or here would have the Maximum Zeppelin Although the median separate length would be maximum forward Jessica and the median separate land would remember Sentosa So these other influences with respect to box blood Now will you go ahead and walk with the final plot with respect a visualization which would be a pie chart So before we make this pie chart we have to create two less over here So I'll create first list with the name fruits and Ijust add some names off fruits So fullest fruit as apples that conclude a cz mango than the god orange And then we have God banana over here So I've made the first list and then I will given the cost of fruits over here So I just given some random value So 76 45 90 on Let's give in 85 as well right So I've got the fruits Lestrade and I've also got the cost less ready Now I'll have to do is map thes two indoor by chart so I'll diaper and B l d dot by Andi Inside this I will first mapped the numerical values so I'll type in cause and then I'll map the labels So we've got the labels attributes over here on Dhe for this label's attribute I will map this list to the labels attributes I'm mapping fruits on two labels over here again I'll just click on run So we need this I'll put in P l d Dog Show Right So this is my by chart over here So this basically tells us that the maximum distribution or the maximum percentage is mostly off orange and banana and that is actually true So orange if we see the value is 90 and butter knife received overvalue us 85 If you want the actual percentage we have something known as the Ordo BCD attribute So let me add in the auto PCD attribute over here and I'll put in a single courts I'll put in a person dates symbol on denial Type 0.2 I'll type in earth and then I'll given new person date symbols over here Right So we've got the percentage values over here now where does this exactly mean So this point dubiously denotes the decimal value If I put into over here than this vulture two decimal values Let's see if I just put in one over here then you got one decimal value or here right now I can also add Oh shadow this So I just put in shadow equals true And this is my by child or used to This shows us that the maximum percentage of the fruits belongs to orange We've got 3.4% and then record banana 28.7 followed by apple and then the least us mango Now let's see if I want to increase the size off this blood So we have something on SB LD dot figure I'll type and really don't figure And inside this we've got the attribute fig size So I'll given the value six Come out six over here Right So I have increased the size of this now Similarly let's say instead of six come on sex I put in then Come on then Then this would be enlarged even more Right So this is our final by blood All right So guys the string goes to the end of the visualization model So this brings us to the end of this python tutorial I hope that you've comprehensively learned all of the concepts Really talk about the new levels It automatically means it's artificial neural networks Okay so my object illustrates Ah session is I'll introduce you to deeply religious on to do so I'm first taken through the history behind this big new leaf book What exactly happened One of the limitations of this very early prototypes which they came out with on how did it all evolve And today why is it such a popular Why's it so popular That everything that you see today you Racine Alexa you're a sin city Us in Google assistant Last week I was in China on board The writing was in Tamil I couldn't understand anything There was this guy foreigner He just pointed this theme of elected and he went away He knew what the message was And I'm still waiting for the musical that is online Real time language translators You point a phone towards it Translated into English All these technologies are based on this algorithm Called it a little They're variants off deepness Littles Of course we have such for example are in and recommend new networks We have something called LSD in long short term memory So down the line you'll come across all these things very interesting field but it in just a lot of power popularity But the power can be a boon And being both you miss applied it'll completely mislead you So before you build your models and trying to put these models in the production here to do a lot of testing So welcome to this world of Bittner Lynbrook Before I start on this any questions you have from anything that we're done below Just in case because all these things are connected to each other Heaven linear regression You'll see linear regression coming to play heroes You're gonna logistical regulation all the you'll see logistic also come into play in this not directly indirectly logistic curve you're seeing logistical It's also called Cigarette Girl You know the properties of signaling goof What is important range What ISO could reach seen manage function manages cousin off signore It It also looks the same in port is minus infinity plus infinity output This minus one plus one Yep these two functions played a very important role in the history of deep personal effects But today we rarely use these to function than this because of certain limitations of these two functions Yep So we'll understand all those things and we'll start No Before I start once again any question Shoot Otherwise we'll great it is It is an advancement because along with support vector machine this one is the most powerful algorithm available to us in danger since truly still a few years ago If you If this was 2010 for example 2010 not very far back newly troupe was not very popular The reason for that is we didn't have the hardware technology with us Tobe able to implement new really works It is only after cloud computing Then you're big data technologies on your Internet became robust enough All these technologies when they converged did we find the required context in which we've woken you neural networks The results started in 19 for peace so it's not something new It's actually started in 19 forties but during those times they did not have the kind off support required in 19 forties And your little went through a lot of up sandals until 10 4012 where it really started picking up on it left all the algorithms behind because what you're a little can do even support Vector machine cannot no that is also very powerful So this stands on the top followed best Liam in terms off the power to do things followed with the other Well they're very relevant Uh as we speak now there are lost being formulated in Far East on in Europe where the law requires that when you do modeling your model should be white box It means you should be able to explain on the world conditions You took this decision whether the person's gonna churn or not Before before Nunally Book is a black box It'll tell you the result But it looked really why it reached to the country's You're not able to find the book So other undertones of quite relevant If you're working in finance banking insurance well most of the time find the other vehicles especially decision trees It's barely write books right in execution Like any other elder upon This algorithm is also part of Superboy Sling mattered here Also you have X and a Y in the training site Access your independent variables wise You're dependent variable So like any of the algorithm this also tells you what is the relationship with an X and y How ex gets transformed into a way To that extent it's similar to the other algorithms but this algorithm is based on the observations on whole human brains Work on A lot of research was going on in this field on biology Neurology to be precise We're back in the 19 for peace Even today is going on But today any results that is going on in definitely little It's not related to the research going on in biology But in those days these were tightly coupled A lot of information lot of ideas with border from the world of biology into this However today's research whatever We're coming across tree they have nothing to do with politics So you don't need to worry about not knowing biology If you don't know biology The Iwas in those years 19 forties How does the brain work Was a big question even delay Today we don't know how it works but it works It's one of the most powerful computing systems we have If you read all these research papers it's so him It's so having surprising so mystifying How this brain really book We don't know Okay during those two years when the research was going on there trying to understand how this not a little brain The neural network in the brain works The natural nearly broke out with the neurons were hard Is it hold this process the information And during that time some biologists who were also mathematicians they tried to replicate the findings over there and see if we can make the existing computer systems off that time Smart are intelligent and of mimics the functioning of the brain human brain so that we can make this computer systems learn to do things without being told how to do When an infant stands up and walks for the first time it learns how to walk for the first time on its own right so that Iwas can make a computer system learn to do things without the necessary off training it how to do it without telling it how to do it Now To appreciate this you have to go back to the 19 forties where there was no by phone There was no pass school There was no see There was no Java the only language WAAS machine learning zeros and months I'm not sure how many of provoked on machine learning language machine language Sorry machine Not machine really machine language which is the language of zeros and ones Even to act two numbers you have to manipulate the registers shift the registers left and right and do all the things this to our two numbers Now imagine asking that computer to do for you We're very complex Task what kind Of course you'll have to write in that machine language I know I don't know how many If you're seeing this I have seen this myself So I'm not used it in 19 eighties when I was a student as just getting into the Khan signs and all these two have punch cards punch cards with holes in it It's a punch card would look like an invitation card for managing mutation cards in that you will have Collins The columns will have eight rules A presence off a whole indicates of one No hole indicates a zero so Siris of punch cards will be sent into the machine That series of punch cards it's equal it off You writing a program today on the editor This is eighties Imagine more details in for peace All right So uh can we make computers do things for us without the need for writing this machine Kord machine language That is all on dhe doing that research They studied the human neurons They actually took a neuron from one of these animals I don't remember which And I think it's all screwed up something which apparently lives in your script It looks like octopus The reason why they took the neuron from this honest this is the only animal which has the longest in your own biological neural known to man on extracting these neurons putting under a microscope and observing them while they're alive On doing experiment on this what's very difficult us Because the moment you separate a neuron usually within seconds it'll die Are they new on this No Good right So they underwent a lot of these difficulties And while studying those neurons the realist certain aspect off how this neurons work the biological Iran's work Those ideas are carried forward into artificial neurons that they were trying to build to make the company is intelligence Yeah we really don't need to know about these things we don't need But similar concepts is going to come into What is he On the left side is uh very generous representation of biological evidence that they come in different sizes and shapes This is the baby It'll be depicted in books and articles What does he hear The branches these branches are called Jane writes Their objective is to extract from the involvement the information the information coming form of chemical signals or electrical signals It used to use combination of both All the signals accumulate in the center Some something happens in the center I'm not an expert in biology so I don't know what happens But something happens in the center If that's something crosses a very short then the new nonsense A signal forward Tow the subsequent neurons better connected to this new on through the Dane rights by sticking onto this water's cold accent We don't need to know anything beyond this but you're most welcome to go and study these things available on this Ural Yeah now when the implement artificially Iran it was It is also represented like this in block diagram Either it shone as an oval or it soon as a circle This in your own also takes inputs from the environment on the environment in this case will be already different And these imports that are coming into this environment are the various Collins in your do different that computes So the data were red on inserted your own two things will happen It's a two step process The first step is a simple linear addition Why is it going to m one x one plus m two weeks two plus e em one x one plus m two extra plates See that is called simple in your relations When that result of that operation and one ex unpleasantries to Percy when the result of that operation the Y crosses a threshold if it's greater than this fire of one If it's less than this fire is evil That process of checking whether the output is crossing the threshold ir north that is your stepfather So in every new Ron we have the inputs The inputs are summed up over here as the first part There isn't of the summation If it crosses a thresher Nero outputs of one if it doesn't cross the threshold of your own output Zero This concept is nothing exactly the click off what you see in politically roll with imports are processed and the processing crosses a threshold It fires at the voice it doesn't fire on The simple concept is used even Toby Even today when you're working deep neural networks L s team are ardent and everything everywhere The same thing happens Well the thing is they don't you step functions anymore Views other mathematical transformation functions Such a cig more damage or a Lu Ray Lewis rectified Linear units You may not have seen this unless you're from electron ICS right So those functions have replaced the starter function and there's a technical reason for it Even Sigmund and manage are not used anymore But if it really Ray Lewis or the variance of real But whatever it is the structure revenge sissy What it was in 19 forties The same structure remains even today for the neurons The artificial Littles such a such a simple concept First do a linear regression The first part is always a linear regression If the output of linear regression crosses a threshold then the neuron activates If the output of the regulation doesn't cross official the neuronal concezio images using such a simple concept Today Deep Neural Network is able to do natural language processing vision based projects object identification object addiction object tracking Everything is done using So now the natural question is what is it in it that makes it so powerful that it beats other algorithms hands down when it comes to complex data set So when you look at the history off how it all evil Three names jump out Okay three names jump out on those names are basically Rosenblat's neuron which is called Perceptron I'll talk over it down the line on we have a mecha Nope It's near on McCulloh pits where two people uh who actually started the work on this nearly our Egyptian at all Michelob Hope it's Warren Michael Oh and water picks They're a combination of biologists and mathematicians So they're the ones who came out of this concept off a Kardashian it on first but they're in Iran had a very severe limitation That limitation was overcome by rose and black on the Rosenblatts neuron also had a limitation But all those limitations were surpassed They were overcome eventually on to rest near oral artificial It on bothers a lot of ideas from Goes and blacks Nero But it's slightly modified which So what exactly does we'll see that So we call it N c p R Make a low pitch Nero Okay It's depicted using a block Bagram as this where you have a submission You have us state function The inputs come here That was excellent X two And you get the outcrop Okay all if you remember the gates concept the bullion gates in a bull in algebra us rent about this in consigns All our computer systems are based on bull in algebra Even today it is bullying algebra which comes to work at your chip level where all these operations that we do get transformed mission language and in machine language All this operation's actually undergo Boolean algebra Bullen Gates are nothing Burke A presentation off the different kind of logic that we use in our day to day life If suppose I talk about a student on I consider a student as a pass or leave free passes in mathematics physics So if the student has passed in mathematics on dhe passed in physics then his past Overall if the student has passed in mathematics but not in physics Then all is a fail If student has passed not in physics but in Matt's Eliza free Thank you If a student has neither person that's not in physics or Eliza failed whatever he did write these things Which gate is this This is an and gate logic If the storing process of maths or physics cease pas if the student passes and that's become a physics he still pose This is your organ So whatever we do whatever logic that we use in day to day life all those logic that we use in our discussions can be represented as bullion gets Okay so what These people did this They tried to see if a neuron can rebuild that implements that gets the bullion gates first If you're able to implement bullion gates than using a combination off neurons I can replicate the behavioral comes complete assistance on that computer future build Using this neurons it will be able to do things for me without being told how to do it That is objective right So the first thing that the disease can be used Bullen Gates on represent this Make this neurons mimic the bullion gates That is objective So what these people used to do is suppose he won't implement and I'm get on this on gate on gets her two inputs X onyx too So we have 11100100 This is our POTUS one These are old zeros right This is out Now you tell me if I'm going to send here a one and a zero and I'm doing the simple submission of this What is this Some of these two numbers And if I want this tow or put a zero now Okay 10 This is this This is input we have given if I want output zero What should a threshold be Yeah you just ask trick if some is greater than one If the summation of these two is greater than vendor now put the one otherwise output zero So this will happen One leaving These two are once Then you'll get an output of one Simple Yeah Now if I want implement and our gate in this suppose I go for organ X one x two And why and or get organiz 10101 bond and this is 000 knife I won't implement or get What should this special to be Isn't one believe problem greater than equal to one If emit a 11 leaf is greater than equal to one These tools submission is good too These two submissions want these to submission is one If it's one or greater then emit of one Then this new known mimics the behavior son organ by changing the thresholds Here I can make the neutron mimic and and a gate and Aldgate exhorted Gates on support not an ex target There's a reason why it can't be done for except But using this methodology I can make a new deal on mimic Some of these gates agreed But the problem is they're your own It's not learning anything I'm going and fixing the thresholds based on what kind of behavior I want Your honest not letting in it Seven born American law and pitch They came out of this neuron The showed that it's possible it was a good start but not good enough because it required a human intervention on our object Iwas Without your human in division can we make it learn Can I give this data So this new John and the neuron automatically learns that racial that is objected on that It's weird this you don't wanna make make low pitched neurons was replaced by another neuron by Rosenblatt Very famous figure in the world off artifice a little noodle and works He was a fun who demonstrate her It's possible what it is Same structure same structure your take X one Extras input Same submission here also But he introduced the concept of beads which means inside this neuron you dedicate if they're two connections to inputs coming in there to wait's over here which is shown on the link Okay which is shown on the link Two inputs coming here there to us of age associated this link So what this does is M one or doubly one doubly one x one plus w two extra Isn't this familiar to you Simple Any revision Everything Yeah and he also introduced the concept of by us He was the guy who introduced the by ourselves so initialized by us to some value on this was a way to associate with this also So this is the new three So now the question becomes less w three b Okay Bias is a constant fixed value When you multiply the weight with this dignitary working of bias goes into your question If this is saying initialized to 50 that doesn't mean to be considered What comes here is W three indifferently Are you okay This Lena submission is what he introduced here Andi also introduced the concept Lost again We had stepped functionally and he introduced another concept card Okay the output of this let it be shown us by hat And if the white hair is different from what you're expecting you haven't ever this letter used to make use of this error to adjust these weights not the threshold Using this error can find out what weight should these be so that the air becomes you introduced this logic into the neuron on when he introduced it Logic into the neutron There was no reason No requirement for you to fix any threshold Whatever usually fix the neutron will automatically learn what these weight should be for the air to become zero This is the first version Often artificial neuron very demonstrated that by just giving it the data The neutron will automatically learn what the way it should be And it will It will mimic this It'll mimic these and gets on Gives our visions on the This is the first question first of tar off artificial neuron This is called Rosen Blacks knew Yeah we'll see this in the court will see this in action Why do we need by us Why did he introduce by us Since you people have done linear regression questioned his question is to you What is it Roll off the bias in linear regression What Oh you're talking the bias at him You're talking the bias there That's what the definition for bias it Yes that's how it begins I'm talking about the interested that you have in the Lena Ridge Why Call them Express CC is called interested So why do you need the innocent That interested also goes with the name of bias Our constant right Go back to your Lena tradition case You have a distribution network here Off data points between why and X on these points What kind of relationship is there between my annex Boston linear relationships Boston linear relationship We can also sure Never Negative Also we can do it Negative Also right now what is the best foot line Best red line is the line which represents all of them as accurately as possible Minimized At least some of minimus the summer scholars Right So we want to minimize Uh is this e some off skirt it ISS or development in mean sum of squared errors That line which minimizes this is the best recline ugly And this over here is your interest It which is called Shawn Macey on Called by us in our new Littles Artificial neurons It's called by still the question to you is why do you need this if I suppose I don't worn by us I want this imperceptibly Tzeitel That means I'm forcing this line to go through the origin wonder then intercept with zero But the line which goes to the origin may not be the best front line So there is a hyper perimeter in linear regression I don't know what you're seeing that are not there You can force their Gautam to say by saying that I don't want uninterested when you do that then your algorithm is restricted to evaluate one lead Those lines which go to the point on those lines would go to the point The best fit line which is found amongst them that may not be truly Bestwick had given it the freedom Go and select the bias also Then it would have given you the best fit line where it minimizes the some off predators So the intercept that using linear regression the intercept gives her degree of freedom to the total It gives the additional even lines to evaluate It does not restrict it to evaluate when with those who go through this are you with me on this So by using an intercept you make the algorithm even more Richard even more powerful And the solution that we come up with it's likely to be much more open Then we know that Okay Similarly he introduced disconcerted by us here to make this new one richer in evaluating things If I don't give the bias here then it's a restricted to using only these two weights and come out of the solution Are you with me Yeah So he was the 1st 1 who introduced the concept of bias He was the first turn into is the concept of errors basically difference between actuals and predicted on He was also the 1st 1 to introduce off way off reducing these errors by controlling the weights again Linear regression only So in the direction we have S S E this is equal to a white hat minus Why raise too poor too Some off creditors Yeah Some means you'll have a sigma I still the one to end number of data points you have Then I'll write This is why I wear with me Okay so we have the summer school dinners Now let's ignore all this symbols Let's focus on in these two Why had minus y is the area right now Okay Can I write This is and mix Let's see Minuses Why generate it Yeah okay That means in this if this is it in this manner this era is influenced X And why come from your data set You can't do anything with it X And why I come from a dutiful It's party for training Sit There's nothing you can do about it What you can control is this in on the sea This one these two are want defines your error so your error can be controlled When you control the M and the sea there can be controlled When you control the embassy awaits the raid Socialise em on the sea The cve it goes into your Equus Sh What's he goes into the equation This go w three in Toby's What goes into the question So w three w to doubly one If I manage them I can minimize this edit and then you don't zero Are you with me All of you Any questions So my question is that now with this linear regression the same question is on the Rosenblatt equation also so does that Whitehead on the Rosenblatt equation will give the same result as their linear regression where why you had will give because of this transmission Ok Sam I just wanted to ask one question and since we're saying that M and C are going to change based on the era but X and fire are different data points So which means that for every two inputs off except by that that whole question will keep shifting southward Well very good observation due to get out a question Do you understand what you're saying You're going to adjust the MNC keeping in view one particular record at the time for this recording but need different MNC for this recording Might need different tendency That's a question right What's your answer individually Yes they will try toe find the best it light But what they are actually trying to do is find one line that covers all the really response So they will find error based on one line for one particular data point and then calculate error for all the response that that are available to us to find which which one little one which will be the one line which will have the least error Okay I think you've got me in the right direction But the choice of words could have been different See finally in regulation also what happens Senior immigration Also linear regression that optimal weight that a stone for your lenient model for some records will continue to give another for some records will give you good results Your white hat Reese Amos Why But for some records my head may not be Seamus by even in the best reclines But overall across all the data put together you get the Easter So what drives the M and the sea is overall sum of squared errors not indigent letters So here also really evaluate different weeks and save it and releases that it'll not indigent record level but overall together Unfortunately this particular gate and other gives some of the other gates those gates the way that data is between inputs and outputs We call them Lee Nearly separated data sex Do you know what the meaning off Lena Inseparable Data's it ISS Have you come across this before Linearly separable data sets of those data sets whose classes can be separated our 100% accurately with the linear model and these data sets happen Toby linearly separable data sets I'll show that to you in a moment because off which it is possible by these algorithms to find one set off m one and m two and see which gives a zero error across all the data points Problem happens when your data sets are not linearly separable in that situation you know to settle for a best fit line where the best freight line minimizes and some more squared errors It doesn't become zero which means Ah best freak line will continue to give orders for some off the inputs Good Keep this in mind This is a very important concept which people miss out good Granted your suspicion the best recline will not give you correct answers for all inputs Some input will give a good answer Some important give incorrect answers But the degree of incorrectness across all the data points put together will be the least okay on In this case the given data sets that we have here X annoy their linearly separable data sit and hence there will be one unique combination off MNC which will give you zero for all the edibles Okay so let's see What is that How does it happen Let's see that will come to the court and we'll see that old So one question for leaning inseparable sets that has been happening is happening to ask before we put the deed in the morning it's our it's our exercise and we try to do that using a particle The future engineering and features feature Injuring feature selection is not the most important tasks that you have to do in your mission landing exercise but in practical in reality you'll not come across the street Is is if you come across this data sets which very nearly inseparable Who needs a model Why do you need We don't need Morley right All we need is a room since so I feel lean inseparable courtesy If something listen this then he's going to be a reporter or something more than this is going to be known to fort If you have the factory built with you then why do you need a model You started signed Reinbold That'll ever happen But they did have become across really that they never really near misses All right let's go 10 so these are the gingers necklace and blood brought in This is a remarkable improvement over Michael Opitz Water pits Chino And when he demonstrated this the interested in artificial neuron it went to the roof They're lot off Expectations on board is going to happen You have videos available from the 19 sixties where some of this data scientists were into room on in their interview just going see what All the same how the company is going to overtake the human beings and rule the world and all these things happen All the type happened immediately after Rosenblatt came over this new and he demonstrated that it can learn to implement And in all of these but immediately to gentlemen peppered and Minsky who were working in a mighty land something at the time these two demonstrated their butts A prawn This is small personal Rosenblatt is called possible They demonstrated that this person Tron cannot learn all the hits There are dozens of gates in your Boolean algebra on possible Cannot learn all the gates on to demonstrate that What they Sure boss exhorted Where did I come to accept getting the moment Very Rosenblatt Compass idea of using leads Very interesting story behind this There's a gentleman called William Heads He was a biologist He was trying to find out Where is the memory store In the break Okay On uh what it was He had a pet dog Apparently a potato on He used to feed the dog while feeding the dog history Annabelle He dated my people times on Then when he rings the bell they don't start in celebrity even though there was looking for So the question is what is going on What William had to say This the neurons that fired when the dog heard the bell on the neurons that fired when the dog tasted the food When these two neurons these two sets of neurons the fire simultaneously multiple times they start connecting to each other And next time any fire Only the bill neurons related on listening It automatically fires the ones related to the Facebooks So he came over the famous rule in biology and disclaim assume today neurons that fire together wire together That idea This Rosenblatt bordered and got it into the neural saying that the strength of the connections can be represented as based Larger the weights stronger the connections less in the weeds Porter the connection Pour the connection Nothing new You have seen this in lean integration already in linear regression If Why Goto mimics Les See if this M is equal to zero What is the relationship of the Nixon way They're not related The relationship in X and Y zero it does not influence wife So the lot of this Amis correlation can range from minus 12 plus unless what And the moment it goes towards one this one or that one We say X is a strong influence Off way Same concept feels broaden it The weights are close to zero That means the neurons are not related to each other They don't fire off together If the rates are very strong Large magnitudes that means the set off You don't often find together And he brought the concept off reach here into his needle So I bought her this idea from the Libyan rule on dhe Interesting story behind this and he was able to demonstrate that it can learn or and lot functions But what happened this The two gentlemen peppered in Minsky they demonstrated that it cannot learn all the forces on one of the functions that it cannot learn is excellent This is just a comparison off Michael Ovitz noodle But the Rosenblatts noodle both of them do the same thing But only thing is he uses weights here There are no wait shown here Okay In some books and in some diagrams Elsie's waits shown here also But all those weights are equal leads Equal reach means as good as not having any weights Okay so all the bits of equal weight They didn't give any specific importance to the connections Whereas this guy said No The collections have different Should have different breeds depending on with the bureau inspired together Nonsense Okay And then he brought in the concept of error and using their own How do you just awaits You brought in that photo on Ordell This learned the hitting gates Or and not But it was a short lived exactement because we had This is Michael Ovitz noodle you already discussed These are the bullying gives Is that right Implement Okay I'll come to the court a bit later I'll show you the court We'll see all being discussed All these things but I'll take it to the cordon Become clearer limitations These two gentlemen demonstrated that it cannot learn the eggs or get what is an exorbitant It's our gate iss When your inputs are x one x two and why If the importers say 00 operatives of 1100010111 Don't confuse this with mortgage People get confused nor get Lord or there's no likeness Except this a different point Andi when you include this very asked the principal to learn this gate It fails to London on the reason why Clay fails to learn the gate Iss Let's draw this X one extra Okay When Excellent Next to both of them A zero We have one here Let me show the one with the triangle when both of them one each Then once again we're trying But when any one of them is a zero that means this point At that point any one of them is zero This is a lecture Me This is a circle So now you're given a data set with labels They moved them Are trying the labels to form a circle It this distribution is given to you on As you can see there is no way you can lean your listen You can't draw any line anywhere which cleanly suppressed It'll these data sets eggs or gate is a distribution which is more lenient since it is not linearly separable This guy uses a leader's transformation fails to implement exalted And when this was demonstrated all the interest in artificial neuron collapsed collapse means people stopped doing research Anybody try to publish any paper Hundreds It was immediately rejected no funding nothing So it entered what is called a winter off near a Littles It was indeed Please Nobody was working on this anymore A few people continue to work on this They believed in it The continued to work on this They didn't stop At this point onboard the real Estes tryingto make one neuron intelligent enough to understand all the gates Instead Bishop connect the neurons on a collection Off neurons should learn all the kids When the big Dark they realized that they can implement any dates that revived the interest in artificial neural network immediately Once again the interest went up But something happened Because of this The interest all came down again to zero on That was the second winter for artists So the limitation of this person strong led to the evolution off mural Little Rosenblatt was trying to make this person strong intelligent enough to understand all the gates But what was demonstrated isn't stuff Depending on what you're on We should have a collection off murals And that's what happens in human brain Also we have a collection off neurons that fire together and do something that is the origin off our diction New nickel Let's forget burst So I joined the diagram again So this is a triangle triangle This is clearly not separate bills in two dimensions Painful damages right So what we do is let's have three damages Let's have three dimensions So in three dimensions may none of these two imports extra next to one of these two or 00 Then I want one When is this to our 11 each Then I want our total sense for otherwise I want a Tzeitel Tzeitel in this life in three dimensions What does not separable in two dimensions in three dimensions it becomes separate This concert is called Project In her data points from the lower dimensions of the higher dimensions Many project the data points in higher dimensions The probability that the classes become linearly separable increases This is going over still in mathematics there's a film called Oversteer which say is if you have distributions where the classes are not nearly separable project them into higher dimensions the probably that they'll become linearly separable In cases have you done support Vector machine in support Vector Mission have done colonels and terrible tricks Journals project leader points that is based on the school Is there Colonel Tricks is getting that one page of higher dimensions without projecting it that it's terrible tricks support Vector machine of very beautiful Alberto based on layers and layers of mathematicians sales So really understand that Alberta might enjoy anal and goto unique that mathematical exposure Not very difficult but we don't come across those mathematics in our day to day life so we find it difficult Otherwise you need to know the branches you need to know over stadium on You have one more thing They're forgetting all the stadiums sit on each other like the sandwich which actually empower the support vector machine over Similarly in your network we have both heroes one of school a studio that the one is called Magro to I don't know what he said on whatever he said It's similar to what we do in your Littles on these two is born Give the mathematical power tow this new network to become so far In fact newly work is also a bonus universal function Approximately There's a very strong word Okay Universum function about Senator when we build models when we build models What are we doing by every building models Whatever Aging A building Mortars Yeah we're predicting We're estimating what's happened Correct Right All models they represent certain processes in Dorian World The processes could be tangible or intangible processes if a building models to predict mpg off a car Given that tribute to the car and predicting the behavior of a tangent process for the car If I'm trying to build a bottle and see what is the stock price tomorrow in Bombay Stock Exchange that I'm trying to build a model to replicate the behavior of Bombay Stock Exchange is intangible process So if you look at it this way all models are nothing but representations off processes in the real world If you had every person the process is immortal Then by understanding that if I give this import borders outcrop later to be I can predict the behavior of the process how it's going to be here I take advantage of the beauty that knowledge right So now the question comes what is the process A process is a collection of vilifying steps which act on in input I'm given output given output Okay process Oh the process tells you the relationship between outputs and inputs on this relationship is mathematically shown us Why is a functional expo next to Isn't this what you doing Ah linear regression or any other thing any of the number Why is a function of these to this function is what is a process on models that build They represent the processes that means on the models that were built in mathematics circle functions and when he said Neural network is a universal function Approximate er that means using neural network You can represent any process in the real world Tangible or intention It's a very powerful statement You can't do this with any other With new network You can You can build a more presentable on the stock exchange You can build a mortar to the present automotive the car We can build a model to find out your weather or predict the weather It's a very powerful statement A neural network is a universal function Approximate which means it can represent any process in the world Tangible loading that is the power that it enjoys and where does the power come from the boat come from Be stood here and supporting it And it also comes from another fact that happens in the neutrons The factors This is a Linnaeus emission What happens here Long linear transformations This is linear transformations Vineyard functions all put off Lena Function is transformed again using a non linear transmission and the left and right and a left Right now it is because of this nonlinear consummation Along with these two pills it begins a very powerful too using which you can represent any process in this When you say you changed from a linear toe nonlinear function so are you changing Um the function itself origin either data data data to represent to behave like a nonlinear Okay Sunkuli business A lot of things to business down the line People treat you really focus some kind of black art Black magic It is not If you understand that Link concepts nearly took it so easy to learn and understand what's going on inside Okay little let's go and see the port Yeah it's going to be the court record is shared with you I think this morning something was here before Yeah Okay I'm going to start the first line is important and I put from kind of impulse choice This is a simple bite on statement There is a bunch of functional piece available under life record Right from there I'm importing one particular one Call choice Okay What does Joyce just given a data it randomly picks up on record sensitive The Okay So it's only for random selection of records from the given duty from Mumbai I'm inputting Ari from Numb pine Umpire All off you know what is numb by numerical python It has all the numerical functions in corded there in C So one of the functions that is included there is the dot function What does the dark function do Dot function is basically a multiplication and information together So when I won't write bicycle m bone X one plus in tow X two plus even I want to do this and C is also having in our case w three will call it n three plus B When you want to do this you keep em one m toe on m three In one metrics you keep x one x two and be in another metrics Dot Operation is multiplication of these two Makris and submission So the result that you get here this result is nothing but this e question output of this secret in is more to get here So what you're doing to get this result you multiplying the mattresses and something of the something them up That concept is called dot operation duty So when you do this dark it automatically does all these things and gives it that is it Entire neural network is metrics Algebra beast Okay so one of the first introduction to Patrick's algebra neural it will be the daughter operation Okay let's come back to this So I'm importing dot for that I honestly don't remember what I'm using random for Right Okay I'm importing numb pies and then here I'm going to demonstrate to you the behavior off Michael operates Neuron first make a low pitch Neuron did not have any concept of rates They give equal importance to all them perpetrators So what I'm doing here is just to make this court a general court just to make this court agenda record Ah this is what it's called So what I'm doing here is I'm initializing both these weights with one so keep in mind make a low pitched in Iran did not have any bias live it had one Lee inputs extra next to both of them I'm giving the weight off one right now And in between you have a step function this omission There's no bias in my club It's neuron So we don't have any bias here So what you're doing is not Look at this I'm initializing the weights with one Both of eight are equal one on This is the training data This training data if you observe carefully Which gate is this This is Andy Dick I'm giving an and Gate Day Does it So the new dawn on Dhere I'm defining my step function It's a daughter Operation will give me this the step function after define the step function I'm defining here using Lambda operation all of your family to Lambda Okay Lambda is a function that is used only once After that it's discarded So what I'm saying It's Look at this carefully Input of the land dies X If you're if you're kind of getting confused here you can replace this with some input of the lambda Is X If the X is less than equal listeningto then go to zero All put a zero If the summation is listeningto otherwise output of one Do you understand this life Are you all with me on this Okay so when I add these two up But I do the daughter operation And are these two up Are these two up In none of these three cases in all of these three cases your summation will be listening to So it'll output as it'll one In the last case the threshold will be greater than two equal to do so it'll violate this since it violets this it local the one Yeah So this is good And run this Make sure you run the first important also going and run this You'll see that in the airport We'll be able to print it here This is for Nick's look going through the records one by one and sending them to the daughter operation As a result of that I get the summation The submission over here That summation I'm sending it to the state function If the submission crosses is listen to open a zero otherwise output of one You see this is an and gig The foot is the same as on gate All put on We say that because of the special Michael OPIC Neutron is mimicking an and gate If I won't implement an or get then the changes have to do is first the training data will change You see this is an organ data on Then the threshold will change You see the threshold here If the submission is less than one Output zero If the summation is one on about all part of one you please look at this uh lambda function again What It says this if the import of this lambda function which is a sum if that sum is less than one I'll put a zero Otherwise give out one Go back to this data one In this case the summation will be Lesson one In all other cases Either the submission will have one or greater than one So using this threshold I can meet this make low pitched in Iran being like an organ So when I run this again this is our gate Good start but not good enough because we have to go and change the threshold Can we make the neuron Learn the threshold also Otherwise where is the intelligence Then came your Rosen Blacks knew Don I'm going to jump the ninth gate You can go and explore with this experiment with this I'm going to jump in Russell Blacksmith come to Rose and blacks Neuron on The first thing I've done here is I've given the step function here in Rosenblat's neutron step function I just kept some random threshold value of 30 Right 30 No reason Seven of the submission It's less than her P m it zero brimming with the submission is 30 year about emit a one If you're still thinking why 13 No reason you can replace it for different fields All right so I've just created a step function here on I'm giving it a data to learn from on Observe this carefully In this there are three inputs Why Because Rosen black introduced a bias So this by us also has a bait OK on now This will not be one This is doubly one This is w to this devil it free This is X one This is X two on This is the bias coming in Okay so this is Rosen Blacks Nero So what I'm doing here is I'm saying the input that is going to come in is your 0001 Mondo along with the weight off one you initialize this bias to one But how much will actually go into this will be decided by doubly three and Toby Right You initialize this to one If you want to initialize this 100 you initialize this 100 But this is not the bias that is going to go into the question What is going to go into the questions W three and Toby Are you all with me Yes Okay so what you do is in the next step were randomly fixing the w one w do that were randomly putting some values over there So this development of looting of W three will be random numbers to begin with Obviously when you'd multiply this random number takes one random number of extra in this the output will not be what you're expecting Office A little would be This is like having a distribution and drawing a random line The random line will not with the best fit like so given the trend in Lang I usedto alert himto make the random line orient and become best fit like and to make it reorient itself to become best fit line I love modify the weeds But how much would I have modified the weights That depends on how much air you're living so we'll capture the error Also here on if you see we're creating a provision for capture layers right And I'm also going to use something will eat up What is this Each of this seat I school learning read By any chance have you come across this learning rate You're come across learning great win grading descent algorithm A linear regression Very good So this is the learning rate Okay Why do we need learning rate and all the things we'll discuss in some of the station when it comes to that other functions and all we'll discuss that later Okay On this is and how many iterations you wantto have for your new don't be able to understand The sweeter one iteration may not be sufficient The random line wherever disoriented One set of change in values off w may not bring it to best recline You might have to do it multiple times for it to become Basically I don't know how many times I want to modify the rates to make it best wiggling So I don't know how many attractions agreed So I just put some number here 10,000 I don't think you need so many iterations anything but let's start with pickles Are you all with me on this day Love with me Yeah So now starting for next Look select a record randomly from the given data Is it That record has both the input very well And our target variable This is India independent variable X and y what I'm doing Not the sensory I'm doing a daughter operation here between Nixon Wait Is this clear This is dot operation which is short on the board This is where your MBA next 1% 2 extra bliss MP plus M three b happens here At this point there isn't of back is captured here This is your linear model That result Okay Obviously I compared with expected I send it through the state function I compared the output of the steak function with water You expecting the actual why was a standard way the difference between these two is there So he introduced the concept off which uh those people didn't think off Now given this letter I can use this formula to design what The way it should be This is a great and distant from lighting going to use that word grading descent because I was not sure whether you heard of this before but you see what we're doing here New weight is good old wait plus e trying to ID her It is learning step learning rate for Geeta entering to X So this is where the Bates get adjusted Given the order that you have done in a particular record Are you with me on this Still Oh this simple linear regression coming into play writing for the food So what did Louis given this function Bottle Lewis Let's go ahead and execute the whole stuff This is the same for next Look take a record AmeriCorps dodo dot operation on dhe Send it to the step function Final data motivates go back And for the same record check for that there is reduced That is what this for makes Luke will do Go ahead and run this there's good and run this whole list of one single block So in 40 gators triple zero You see the airport gate is also triple zero Yeah I let me change the threshold I'm going to change the pressure to say from therapy Say I make it 50 Okay I don't need to do this but I'm just demonstrating to you how this neuron learns the weight given the threshold So I modified the original 2 50 So this good and run this the new don you'll see it has again learned awaits The rates have changed These are the weeds Keep an eye on this week's okay In fact you can print your w here if the virus you can bring the w here Okay Drink You can print a W and see the end of weights And the weights changed Modified reads Now let's implement Let's implement an organ Okay So employment or get all I need to do is change the data So what I do is I make this 000 I make this as one I make this one I make this all since one This is an organ I'm not touching the threshold at all I modified the data here This data is no become or gay Data have not more different threshold I'm not tested special Not on this It learned to represent the or gate or his 0111 So Rosenblat's new Dawn You just have to give up the data he learned from the patents Given how to the prison that gave you don't need to go and modify anything So this was first demonstration there Something is learning from the data without us telling us how to do it For example I don't have to write a cord if extra physical zero and extra physical zero then all protest zero I don't need to write such lines I don't need to do such things Keep in mind we're in machine language How difficult it would be So by just giving it the data the neuron learns from the daytime Does it for us But let's replace this with X or gate Which means these two are zeros Make this us ah zero on Make this also is it This is an ex target Now run your neuron Check the outboard You'll never get the pattern that you expected You said the airport Is it all 0111 What do you want This 1001 You learn it as many times as like you change this from 210,000 Also there's no dinner change No Sorry God I'm so sorry Not this one This is wrong This is by a very sorry This is by us Mr Uh Change this too Video zero is one on these two are zeros No right This is an executive Yep No than this It never London get visit output Remoter print Prentiss was in confusion with this spring We don't need this So run it as many times as you like in never land again Okay Even if increase iterations 100,000 still it will not land again The reason why I cannot lend the gate iss But soprano is Alina separator It cannot separate nonlinear classes for a stargate You're right Yeah Show me your output The result is matching them You get No This is not 1001 That is operating No go So they go up in your screen Yeah that isn't it Yeah Okay Yes You can do it No but they didn't know Do it So I'm showing you this street quality board but yes you can do it But all new little straight that I know off their own leader Economics First you're here then Oh yes I lose this What Mike get out in this ex Argue it Oh yeah You'll get my people That's a different as none of them will direct depending on various putting The light will get different answers But it won't give you the right answer Okay Thing is this is not the morning your book is coordinating with the other morning served white box lords for example decision trees A white box logistic is away books in your visions of white boats these old black holes black box mortals sometimes in real world for if you're working banking financial you can't implement a new unit because they want to know on what basis do to decide whether a person is not even before the run before you can take you to court That's what I said Probably not here today as we were discussing these things Now laws have been passed in Europe and Far East where the models have supposed to be explainable Another big problem That research is going on in back How do you make any mortals built out of these technologies Explainable A lot of interesting work is going on that right So those things still have though this is powerful Those things still hold their own ground Shelley Moore Yeah Okay Yes Makes question Yeah What Yeah I guess Patterns predict this principle doesn't live Yes yes The failure of the person from the failure of the person drawn in x our gate and other gates Also the failure of the personal Perceptron led to the evolution off religion A new networks is a universal function approximately your mother What Yes Yes Yes right Okay Yeah All right This'll was a brief history off neural networks Very interesting But what we have today is based on the lessons learned in these experiments What we have today is a neural artificial neural in book This artificial neural network is very generous representation of how it looks saying this What you're seeing here is these are all neurons artificial neurons this what you see here the black dots these air not artificial Iran's These are the columns in your data frame They're also called Dominions On this live that you see here it's your data frame transposed This is called the input layer So when you come across the word input layer inarticulately please understand It refers to your data not the artificial neurons Okay on the first layer After this this is laid off neutrons This is your first hidden live You may have multiple hidden layers as many as you want I've shown you too hidden lives and the last layer is the output layer The output layer will have as many neurons I'm showing you only one new dawn here If you're doing binary classification you'll have one neuron Zero means class A one means last B But if you're in multi class classification 100 digit recognition 0 to 9 you have 10 different classes Then you'll need 10 neurons In this live securing multi class classification you'll need multiple neutrons in vinyl reclassification You don't need multiple neurons but in case you want to have two neurons here for binary classification your choice you can have that also Okay this output layer interacts with the world outside the input layer interacts with the world outside the layers in between they don't interact with the world anyway outside world the data for this new one comes from here It passes on the best this guy positive And this and this interest of the world outside That's why they're called hidden neurons Hidden lives Okay on what is he Here is a concept that Rosenblatt introduced We call them by us neurons But there again Damn In Iran's they're not by nuance it'll they're some kind of Constance that you put in your court as we are done in the court You said a constant value to the bayous Okay but we showed them the students But always keep in mind these are not neurons And if the bike's value here is be one not the entire of even goes to every neuron What goes to the neuron is decided with the weights here the rates every input goes to every neuron In the first written here every input goes to every neuron In the first year in live output off on Iran goes to every neuron In the subsequently output of this neuron goes to every neuron In the subsequently same thing heroes This is called fully connected neural networks also known as dense Newman reports there are cases where we use partially connected networks What is still no sparse knit words way have those also but very specific niche areas We use them but usually when we implement new little based solutions those are fully connected Dense nearly kills So the data comes in from here It undergoes all the transformation Lenient nonunion undergoes under transmitter in Vietnam Dear Output White hat Why aren't minus y is e better That editor it's used to modify all the weights there to see him on the weights get modified in such a way that overall the new little minimizes the eternal on to modify the weights to minimize the others it uses Great indecent before it is great in this you're all familiar with good innocent right questions So you there's no particular reason These are all hyper perimeters how many lives you should have in immortal on within each layer How many neurons you should have These are hyper parameters here to evaluate these hyper parameters using great such on DSI which gives you model vicious most accurate and General Izabal Thank you So we have a possible people by civilization Yes yes yes absolutely So we just No no no Training appearing A neural network is the most one of the most difficult jobs in their sights On the more the layers you have more deeper than minimal effort becomes more deeper than you're in it it becomes more difficult It becomes to train it which is the most successful and advanced new net Today there are two architectures One It's called Google's Inception That woman is arrested from Microsoft Research They're very the 150 lives or something in them Off neurons on they do Very fantastic job Yes Yes On edition is universal addition off negative numbers and minor suffers Yeah Yes Yeah yeah yeah yes yeah yes yeah That depends on the various ways off running it one is called but brilliant descent Which means you read the entire data set find out the other across all the data's had put together that is there s s e divided in means score later And then do the great innocent The other one is many match meaning match means breaker data sort of smaller chunks I read the first batch finder data are just the rates Throw the batch Read the next batch Final data I just went through the batch that is called mini Batch gradient descent And the other one is stochastic Stochastic isn't randomly pick up it a guard Send it to this about forward propagation find data and just awaits I didn't pick up another record So this has three techniques available Which one of them used will answer your question Bus will go into every noodle Okay so what we show here is a bias known for every year That's what we surely chart the block Bagram's Okay so this is just a way of showing on the block diagrams on before I go into what I'm going to tell because I need to tell that to answer this question I just want to cover two more things Depending on which methodology of used letters in backs methodology the entire data set will be pushed through the neural networks That is called forward propagation prediction For all the records for all the records will predict on for all the records to compare perfect person sections So every record suppose your data files 100 records all The under the course of the rate for every record will be white bread They will say OK what is the white prayed minus Why you cross all these records Let's do a square off that and sum it up some off square letters and then it'll do what it's called Okay given errors These errors at this point are controversial but all unions all neurons are responsible for this So now this area we call it every ingredient back propagation We propagate that elevating back I'm eat neuron it just it sweets to minimize the overall air This concept off okay we got there across the data file but we are all responsible for that error So let's all shake take a share of the blame on me I just have a wage to minimize a little later This concept is called back propagation So we have a forward propagation Enter use dictator back propagate data ingredients and all these weights get existed Hopefully next time in the Dhofar propagation there will be zero That is the whole But you know there he'll only many mice Right Then we are best for Klein in linear regression Then we are best fit model in this case are you all with me So we have a new political architecture A very simple architecture input layer hidden there hidden layer off All the neurons are connected to all the Newmans in subsequent mills The only thing and then we have the bias knows return of Benjamin Iran's which give the bias to the leader transformation in every Nero Fine Then we have before word propagation editor back propagation All these things that were showing here on the screen all these things is one way for him to do explanations Do not imagine that these neurons are some kind of things sitting on different CPUs and connecting to each other physically I know all this new loans can be running on one single to you on all this new homes What you're seeing here Actually what is happening under the hardest Mavericks operations It's mathematics Algebra Okay For example if I take one of the first layer if I take the first little beer I'm x one and extra These two inputs are coming to this New York I know what it's going like this So this is the deadly one W two on the bias Be government three Then what you're actually doing is you're creating a Metrix off Three weeks are doubly One w two This Mark Rix is being multiplied by We already seen this extra extra that that comes here Go through the normal function Now suppose you had two neurons on this extra next to go through them all Then this will be two weeks Two sets of weights This is the lift four double If I and W six laterally 4 75 76 this input might play This gives it this this one this equipment plan But this gives it this one This is what you get over here So what We sure as newly let work here is one leaf for understanding What actually happens under the hood is all mathematics algebra metrics off weights mattresses off in port They get multiplying to get out of your transponders and in markets operations everything a sequence of matrix operations Are you all of me Yes I don't We don't need to worry about about its operations at all We don't need to We don't need it But if you understand this then down the line When you started the convolutions of network it becomes slightly easier What exactly is going on there but very very far away from that We really don't need to know how this kind of insight to be able to understand us questions So the non taenia transformation that happens is by default set as a perimeter off again the we decide what transfer me because at the end ofit the output is driven by the non Nina transformation How do we decide that So that is a hyper perimeter Remote activation functions the nominee transmission the world use for their this activation functions I'm There are different types of high position functions It's a hyper vitamins that you have the sect Otherwise it is buying the forward sake sigmoid activation functions But we can change all this activation based on that I think before this is my question Is ah saying a mini batch process If say suppose five rows are getting inside I'm in processed in one short So in the first evidently therefore neurons the first Newman will act on the first record second on the second So what is the point of having four new ones on the same record when X one x two Extremely past With this one's good question can you get us a question again The last part Yes So the question is if all the four neurons in the frustrated Larry's acting on the same sort of values of extra next two extra Yeah so I mean what was the need off for It looks like senseless right Why are we sending the same data to all the Ford neurons All the four students are going to lose Bias also is same getting busted be ones but cushion And a very good cushion of good attempt Also I'm saying I thought you almost came to the answer But then you alleviated The thing is is that you're you're deviating too much Sorry Oh how did you Just different Okay Now look at this Okay This is where the over serum concept comes into play But before I go there supposed this camera hanging on the ceiling from the ceiling OK I don't know What is this entity I can look at this entity from different angles When I look at this entity from different angles I get a comprehensive view comprehensive information off picture about this entity You know that they're in nature There are spiders with six ice The world is the same way It doesn't need six eyes It's looking to say Mom take what you need Six eyes Why do you need to wise By the way you rabble anyone I know more than eyes more You go You get information about the object from different angles right So anyhow multiple neutrons given to you on the weights that connect these neurons examine the next to the rage that connect These new ones are different It is like looking at the same object represented by this extra next to from different angles depending on what is Wait over here So the weights are different Basic waiting Really That next it'll be different But this is a very important question You asked I don't know whether you realize that or not Okay on the other thing is now look at this new tone which is acting over here in this new on there are three inputs coming in Isn't this like three dimensional feature space They're as you started to Dante Feature space exo next room So data point Prudential Pizza spirits is being product into three dimensional feature space where it is likely to be able to separate the two classes if you have having finally classifications like the ex orbit the production into higher dimensions happen when you have more neurons in the layer with inputs are being saying if the number of neurons in the layer is more than the number of attributes you have that is sitting in the project into her damages Oh versatile Where the bias is coming Here we have the biases coming here Are you You don't mean this name Okay Biases this upon stint it's not in Iran Okay so what This bias does this It basically tells you Okay suppose there's suppose biases He kind of folk going forward I'm restricting toe wanted this But if I go forward then I have a better view of the thing than being restricted of this So buys gives the additional degree of freedom using which you can draw those Lena separators which are able to baker different shipbuilding class in class hope to be saved How to decide what should be the watch of the weights be That is where the grading descent comes finally what designs is the error function and optimism L gotta hope it's been able to bring down the other toes close to me So I was just wondering if we are just ring before we build this a n n a Is that a good decision about decision on my biasing know Suppose I You know since you're building these there's a certain learning Parton and what what you said is about fire together wire together objects that have similar attributes will have a certain learning baton asserting evolution So I was just wondering before you build in your data set itself like we did force Sami supervised learning as well You do some amount of clustering now What I don't know is there's a bias which is human bias coming in in the clustering logic So averages questioning that applying plastering here before you build a network is by seeing it in a good way or a bad way Oh my God Okay All right Uh she just don't get the bias every nor the bias here right You don't in the by insiders Okay First of all they never build any models I always do one suppose letting the good spots because I want to do that answer personally matured gaming plastering and others to really understand other than they given relationship it is everything Are there any other hidden relationship moved in these eggs and the wise you don't know you're voting card and picture it isn't Yeah on the guardian period it is that you have done your fair block in the paper float in the diagnose Do you observe in the kernel density estimates anything unique what it was Oh just welcome Peaks So now you only have multiple peaks Sure they were building one single modern archery links of great ones when you don't analyze those things and you're going to build a model of model which is supposed to predict the MPD during the characteristics of the car now after characteristics of paradise If you say this Marty tendered then how can you even think of building a model model Represent the process a tangible process in this case How can you build a mortar Correct Listen to different processes at the same time Money So many colors when it's a city But if I don't do the questioning I won't be able even a veil of these things So when I do the clustering and the cluster stand out and I'm rejecting Our hypothesis is which means those questions are very significantly different from each other Then does it make sense to build one single model are actually build separate mornings for small cars large person since so all this I always do this okay and clustering using different techniques to understand whether there any hidden kind off information in the data set which is not evident to us from the data thing that we have some answer to Your question is yes you should but not coming to your next question Whatever you do in your inner models as a data scientist at every step you're you're mitigate the risk off Introducing bias there's because by insiders are introduced by the data scientist by the different choices that we make For example when you do the sampling from the universe your sample is best When a break that sample in the training set just save your mortifying the distributions going check Look at the distribution of the origin later on After splitting into training sitting look at the discretion of data on the Vegas attributes You will see that and some of the articles that discretion to change the center Well it's a change The standard fusion has changed You're introducing by several but modifying the distributions You think that in the given data say the feet of selection that you're doing you think feature affirmative to its We are important But have you taken more data Secular known that if four also is important But you dropped that they fall from your day Does it Because in your letter said it didn't appear is important You're introduced by sir You detested the relationship then by an ex appears to be lenient But actually it's known to you there So whatever decisions we take be introduced by service That's what they have to be very cautious and careful in understanding what we're doing A simple case A very simple case Let me I'll answer that cushion Then I think we'll break for pee Yeah Now suppose you have tour distributions okay Oh this is a small car This is large car and this is mpg Okay One large car claims say of this thing off mpg mpg rose 46 kilometers per liter Mpg is a different unit from this X kilometers but leader And then you also have a case off Ah small car polka Which planes to have empathy off say 02 kilometers per meter Does it ring a bell Can you have a tortoise returned from this excluded Rosalita Looks like an old time Similarly a small car Marti International given coagulants Proletarian What is it getting that also looks like an old Claire Love to fix the whole clan What do you do One of the studies is that people say is a replacement median meeting off What Didn't the interrogators it You should replace a meeting of the cluster So when you look at a small car beep message meeting of the small car Well look at large Tariq Assad meeting of the lodge What people do is they don't even do this analysis They look for meeting extreme value on this side and decide they treat this whole thing is part of one distribution which is absolute blunder on By doing the street involving as one single distribution and replacing outlasted central values you're going to bring these two together on the more together these two distributions are the more useless this dimension because in classifying so you're started These are fixing applies your started user fixing Missing on this will interest biceps Yes we deviated the big but was important to business So we discussed on the various ways you can do so minus symptom especially new network It's a very powerful Elberton You need to be very careful You can very easily Basile's it on You know you won't realize it until you put in production Barry Bonds magnificient Was this the future's like with like tens of thousands of features onda ne the first hidden layer Also will it be proportionate are like What is the relation between the number off future There's no relationship between the number of neurons in the first on the inputs If you have less number of neurons than your number of features then your project in your data into lower damages which is very popular Possible situation Also you're done PC principal component Analysis Your project You're trying to lure damages and in the Lord I'm sure PC world you're modeling your mechanisms but generally what happens is when the classes are not Cellini really separable We project them to hide But what I'm saying is if your input has explained to extend how many new Don't should have the first shooting live No this is not directly connected with us I can start even in fun Mutual These are all hyper perimeters where people have done research and they're still doing research to find out Given a problem statement How many layers should I have on how many neurons formation the hand Is there a way to find that out Documents values There's no there's no formal something like this So all this all right No I saw perimeter Security evaluate using a grid search and then use those now to put it formally This is not calligraphy currencies That's what he said Or on the roof Your 900 years away I guess How did you even think of these things Lord what is it is any function can be represented by to functions which is shown here is G And this one No Look at this carefully Is it not your linear function A mix a mix This is your weight MX plus C summation off a Mex is is a mortal You're leaning function going on here on the output of the linear function You do a transmission using this function which was in black did using step functions not very effective because it failed in X target But these days we do this using non linear transmission It's a combination of these two function can represent any function with cereals Okay So what are diving into the real max behind it on I've completely awarded many of the details What is that is any function in the universe can be represented as a combination of these two But he didn't specify what these functions should be He didn't speak further Okay on that is what we do in your genitals In every neuron it does Summation on the submission undergoes a known in your
