 [Music] hey there it's been household here and here in the series of videos sponsored by FX Factory we're gonna be having a look at how we get data into Final Cut Pro 10 in a few different ways so we're gonna be having a look at some of the built-in software and plugins that you'll get in Final Cut Pro Tem and on your Mac and so that you can do it with the built-in tools that you already have access to and then we're going to be having a look at some other very awesome plugins are available on FX factories such as beta pop such as simple info graphics buy premium VFX and also lastly the awesome nodes plugin and that is just insane in terms of the amount of amazing functionality it has in this first video we're going to be having a look at how we import a basic graph into Final Cut Pro 10 and we're gonna be having a look at the workflow from keynote into Final Cut Pro 10 looking at how we export our video with transparency and get this type of effect where we have a graph flowing over the top of our video we're thinking about a couple of different ways in which we can incorporate that into our edits in Final Cut Pro 10 we want to present data in our edits so you can see here that this is gonna work in Final Cut Pro 10 but it's also in this particular method going to work in iMovie as well so this is useful whether you're working in iMovie or Final Cut Pro 10 and we'll cover a couple of those different kind of techniques as we go through this so the first thing we'll go ahead and do is start with a blank timeline so we have these two simple clips on the timeline here one of this drone footage and one of myself talking about nothing to do with real estate but that's the kind of data we're going to use as an example of how you might like to incorporate this into your videos so first of all let's dive into keynote so keynote is an application that comes with your Mac when you buy a new Mac it's installed by default along with iMovie and numbers and pages and a couple of other applications that are super super useful and this is where we've created this graph that were working on here we're gonna start from scratch in keynote and set this graph up so that we can kind of see a few of the settings that you need to consider when you're wanting to move something from keynote into an exported movie and into Final Cut Pro 10 or higher movie particularly with the transparency there as well so we're gonna close up this project and we'll go to file new and we're going to create a new presentation it doesn't really matter too much which presentation we choose and then we're going to add a slide in here and just a blank slide so we can highlight this first slide up at the top left and delete that so let's begin here by adding a chart to our slide so we'll add a 3d chart just to be a little bit fancy well drop this up here and then we're going to replace the data in here and I have some data prepared in Google sheets and we'll just come and copy this selection so you can see if you're using Excel or Google sheets or numbers then you can easily copy and paste that kind of spreadsheet data into the chart data here so we can delete this and we'll paste in up at the top here and then we need to change a little bit of our our layout here just so we kind of get this looking a bit better so we'll close our data up I'm gonna stretch this out a little bit so we have a slightly wider graph a line is the center we can change things like the chart depth we can change the gaps between our columns we have a slightly bigger gap we can also kind of change the rotation of our graph as well and then if we come to our axes here we'll go to the x-axis we're going to add in the series names so the year here and then we'll just turn off the category labels here so I'm just going to change that to none just to keep the bottom a little bit cleaner now we can change the size the numbers here so I can select these numbers and then you can see I've got the point size here that I can modify and I can also make it bold and that's going to show up nicely on there the video that can also do the same on the right so if I change this to bold it's going to show up a bit better in the video and then we can also come back to the chart options here and change the color scheme so we can have different kind of color schemes for our graphs we can also also choose different image textures as well so we'll actually go for this first image texture and now we just want to change one more thing so I'm going to add some text up at the top here and we'll just add this title for the data so I'm just copying this come back to keynote and we'll paste that in there a little bit of fun formatting here so we'll just clean this up a little bit and align it all to the center okay so now that's formatted we can again just kind of get that to snap to the center so once that's ready we can actually export this right away to Final Cut Pro 10 but when we do that there's a few things that aren't quite going to work in the way that we want is so we have a white background here if we export this now it's going to keep that white background which we don't want we want to kind of creep your transparent background so one thing we need to do here is come to our slide and the background option so you can see I'm under the format tab here and we'll change the color fill to no fill and you can see we have a little bit of an issue here with our type and this is gonna pop up when we come into Final Cut Pro as well in that this text that appears on the column on the right here and at the bottom probably needs to be white to start with it's gonna make it a bit easier to see it and to manage it so we'll just find those numbers a bit of guesswork with my clicking and we can change that and then we'll also change the color of this text up at the top so white and you can use other colors as well but white just makes it nice and easy the other thing will change here as well is the width of those lines so if we come to our chart options we'll come to the axes we'll come to the y-values and we're just going to change this grid line option here so we'll just increase that it's just gonna mean that it shows up a bit better in the video so if we save this now all right so we've saved this off and now we just want to add a little bit of animation here so I'm gonna select my graph and come to the animate option and you can see we've got a building and a build out and I'm just gonna add the build in for this example so again I had an effect here and you can see we've got different wipe effects that we can add in we've got some different kind of crane effects that we can work on mash that's quite cool we've got a grow effect here and that works really well let's use this one so we'll use the 3d grow and we'll choose the Cascade option so it's going to go from first to last so if we preview this now that is super quick so everything is happening within one second so actually what we might want to do is really lengthen out the duration of this here so let's go for 15 seconds and preview that and the reason for kind of having it nice and long is that we can then actually in Final Cut Pro 10 we can actually get that to speed up when we need it to so actually I'm going to make this 20 seconds long let's go through the export process and we can come back and kind of play with the layout if we want to so we'll go to file and we're gonna go to export to and movie and basically this is where we kind of do a couple things to set up the transparency for the export so we're going to go to the resolution and change this to custom we're going to type in 1920 by 1080 and then we're gonna go for Apple ProRes and you can see this is going to export with a transparent background so we've got no fill in the background and we can click Next and we're just exporting out that one frame so that one little bit of animation so let's jump into Final Cut Pro now so we'll come into Final Cut Pro what comes at the beginning of this video a little drone shot here and we'll come into the folder we've exported to and we'll grab in this export here so now you can see what we've got here in Final Cut Pro is our animation fading in we will need to change the speed of this but having it run a little bit slower definitely gives us a bit more opportunity to kind of slow it down at certain points in time so let's change a couple of things here so we have our animation happening around about here so I'm gonna trim my clip a little bit at the beginning I'm going to do command and T to add a stay at the beginning just for the type at the top actually will disable the background layer here I'm just going to tap V to disable that so we can really see what's going on so we're fading in then our animation is beginning and I'm gonna retime this so I'm going to come to my speed change options here and we'll speed this up to two times so now you can see fades in and then we start to animate in so what I'd like to happen actually is for it to animate in 2014 to 2017 quite quickly and then for 2018 2019 and 2020 to slow down a little bit so I'm gonna grab my range selection tool here and we'll range select this and I'm going to change this to four times as fast so you can see here we've got this much faster at the beginning and then it slows down at the end when we might be talking about 2019 2020 those kind of later dates and then we have it disappear at the end so we can't stretch this out any more here what we can do is if we click and select our clip and do shift at H it will add a hold in there so basically that's a freeze-frame and I can stretch that out as long as I want so shifting H will had a freeze-frame on that clip and then we could have had an animation in keynote for the end of this but I'm actually just gonna fade this out so I'm gonna do command + T and we'll fade this out at the end I often find that nice animation the beginning is important but then just a little fade out at the end works quite nicely so we're holding on the data there so now if we turn on our background here tap V you can see we've got that nice bit of animation over the top here slows down and then we have that nice hold and this might be the point at which you talk about the difference between 2018 and 2020 in the Regina property market I'm not going to do that so now that we have this set up and playing over the top of our video in Final Cut Pro 10 let's have a look at a couple things we can do to improve the contrast between ticular text at the top and also some of that kind of text along the sides that we can really see our graph so we're going to jump into a couple of color correction options that we have for our video in the background so if we select our video and come up to our inspector at the top right if you don't see your inspector just go to window showing workspace and make sure the inspector is checked and now we're going to jump into this little triangle here which is going to show us our color inspector so in here we're gonna work with the exposure and basically what we want to do is kind of mute the image a little bit and that's going to allow the text to stand out a bit so I'm gonna make the blacks the darker Ayers image a little bit lighter I'm going to make the lighter is the image a bit darker and you can see as I start to do this we kind of meet the image and it becomes easier to read that text so we'll drop down on this and we can play around with the main brightness here as well but that's looking pretty good so when we have this kind of color correction setup we might want it so that as our video fades in or grass fades in at the beginning that we go from normal color to our kind of color corrected version so I'm gonna keep my clip selected and I'm gonna come to just as the graph is starting to draw itself on here and we're gonna add a keyframe for our color board and then we're gonna go back in time and we're gonna set all these values for the exposure down to zero so you can see now we go from our normal drone shot and as the graph plays on we get that kind of muting of the image in the background which is going to really make that graph stand out nicely and we can do that the end as well so we'll come somewhere towards the end just before we fade out and we'll add another keyframe up here at the top right we'll come to the end of our graph showing on screen and then we're gonna set these all to zero again and that will reset our color so at the end from the muted color graph aids out and we're back to the normal video so let's have a look at a couple other things here so if we want to say take this same graph and I'm going to duplicate exactly the same thing so I'm going to hold down the Alt key and duplicate this connected clip or a connected storyline and essentially now what we have here is the same graph playing over the top of this video of me but this isn't going to work very well we need to kind of position this so that perhaps I'm to the right and then we have some graphic to the left as well so we'll set this up we're going to come to our generators up at the top left here so you can see we've got our titles up at the top and then if we scroll down in this panel we have our generators and we're gonna come to our solids and we're gonna choose the custom solid which lets us choose any color that we want and we'll drag this down and drop it below our graph here so instantly obviously that's gonna be much better contrast we're gonna move our graph so this is a video and we can use the transform tools just like any other video so I can turn them on here in the middle of my video and I'm just gonna move this graph so it's a little bit to the left so it's actually gonna have me to the right here or someone talking about residential market activity and then we're gonna crop this custom layer so I'm gonna come to my video options up here with that layer selected and I'm gonna crop that from the right until we've got that graph nicely in there and then if we select a background layer I can move myself across the right there not the most flattering frame okay there we go a bit better so now you can see as this plays on we've got a nice contrast on the left and the video is playing back on the right hand side and again we don't want this to be completely black at the beginning we want to have a little animation there so that when our graph animates on we kind of push myself to the right there so we're gonna set this up first of all we'll just change the color of the background here so I'm going to come to my options up in inspector and we'll pick out a color that's fine one that works so that looks pretty good okay so essentially we have animating on the right are graphs are animate on and we want to basically have this start to animate on just a little bit before that graph starts to appear so essentially around about here we want this shape on the the left to be in position so first thing I'm gonna do select it keep my transform options on and then come up to my keyframes here they'll come back drag this all the way to the left so you can see now this is animating on my graph starts to animate on and then we just need to nudge the position of me as well so I'm going to use my keyframe navigations up here so that I'm making key frames animating me at the same time as I'm animating the shape as well so I've just moved back to that second keyframe I'll select the layer in the background there the person talking we'll add a keyframe for that and then we'll come back to the beginning of this clip and I'm gonna come ahead one keyframe just where I can still see that so I'm gonna have my background layer here with a person talking all the way to the left at this point in time I'm actually just gonna change the position by typing it here and typing zero and once we've added one keyframe then basically any other keyframes will automatically be added when we make a change so you can see now we get those two bits of animation it's really good we get our graph animating on and then at the end we stop talking and fact let's trim this down a little bit so I just use alt on the right square bracket with nothing selected so trim down this layer so we finish talking we start to fade out and then around about here I'm gonna add a keyframe for this laya I come ahead in time and then quite quickly we can drag this off and then again we'll come back a couple of key frames and we'll do the same for this layer so actually I do need to come back to this keyframe and then select my background layer and add a new keyframe and then I'll just play forwards and I just want to find that spot just before this disappears off screen so we're leaving a little bit of overlap there between this video and the background layer and I've dragged that and you can see when you drag things sometimes it just ends up at 0.1 rather than 0 that's why I like to type in a 0 up here so now we have a nice animate on from the left the graph plays on we're talking about the residential market activity and then we finish talking and we had a mate off and we continue to talk about the next thing so that's a quick overview of how to get our graphs into Final Cut Pro now as I mentioned before these graphs will drop into iMovie as well so if we come to iMovie I'm going to delete these layers here and you can see essentially what we've got perm is that same video and I've had it a little bit of color correction here in iMovie I don't use iMovie a lot I'm mostly editing in Final Cut Pro but over the top of this video we can essentially if we come back to our folder with our export in there we can drag this onto our layers and you can see it will play back in iMovie just as it does in Final Cut Pro we can also right click and show the speed editor and we can then kind of speed this clip up as well just as we can in Final Cut Pro so we can have this play through a little bit quicker and obviously we don't have all the different levels of control in our movie that we have in Final Cut Pro but if you're looking at adding more advanced features in iMovie then looking at the link between things like keynote what you can export from that and adding that into iMovie is gonna move your head quite nicely we can also in iMovie as well as we can in Final Cut Pro if we're doing this video with an overlay come to window and record a voiceover and we can do that in Final Cut Pro 10 - and then we can record a voiceover for market activity in Regina in January over the past few years so that's a quick overview I've also got a solid here which this will play over quite nicely - so we can duplicate that across so you can see we have a solid image or we can have just the the kind of basic image in the background there as well so as I mentioned at the start of this video this is the first of a series of different videos to do with getting data into Final Cut Pro 10 this first one shows you a free method so using software that we've already got ie keynotes how we can modify the graph there add some nice animation and then how we can get that into Final Cut Pro 10 looking at the different settings that we have available in the next few videos we're going to be looking at some of the FX factory plugins and for working with data and also some other tips and techniques for doing this in Final Cut Pro 10 with the built-in or free software that's already available on your Mac's there's a mixture of those two different types tutorials so follow along if you have any questions leave them in the comments below otherwise I look forward to seeing you on the next tutorial
