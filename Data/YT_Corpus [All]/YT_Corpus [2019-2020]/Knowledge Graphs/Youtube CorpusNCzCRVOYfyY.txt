 now we're going to do something a little bit different from what we've been doing in the last few problems we're still going to work with equations of graphs and graphs but up to now we've been taking a formula or an equation for a function and we've been trying to draw the graph that goes with that now we're going to reverse things we're going to start with a graph and try to come up with an equation that describes that graph so here's number one we have a graph that should look an awful lot like a sine wave to you so in these we got to decide whether to use sine or cosine this certainly looks like the shape of a sine graph so i'm going to say looks like sine and now we want to try to identify those constants a b c d if they're involved in the equation for the graph so here it's not too hard to see the 5 negative 5 that the amplitude is 5 we can set our a constant equal to 5 here we can also identify the period of this graph the period looking at the way the x-axis is marked goes for one period one cycle goes from zero to four pi what we can do is we can work backwards through our formula for period to come up with a value for b so we're gonna take this period equals 2 pi over 2 pi over b formula that we've been using and instead of plugging in for b we're going to plug in for the period we're going to put down a value for that equals 2 pi over b so 4 pi equals 2 pi over b now we can solve for b i'm going to multiply both sides by b 4 pi b equals 2 pi divide both sides by 4 pi so b is 2 pi over 4 pi and that's going to reduce to the fraction one half so we have a value for a we have a value for b now c and d have to do with phase shift vertical shift there's no phase shift or vertical shift for needed to get this graph so all we have to do is plug a and b into the formula for a sine function y is equal to 5 sine half times x and there we got an equation for the graph and number one let's go ahead and do number two now this graph starts up on the y-axis and comes down crosses the x and plunges to negative y and then back up this looks more like a cosine graph to me now you can use sine or cosine for any one of these like you could always use sine or always use cosine there's always a way to do it but we want to avoid phase shift if we can because phase shift is always more complicated so so here if i want really wanted to use sine for this number 2 i'd have to incorporate a phase shift if i use cosine because we start at a max point here on the y-axis i don't have to use phase shift so that that's definitely worth it right let's see amplitude is 0.3 i think here so my a value is 0.3 and a period is looking so we start here we go all the way to we're at a high point again with cosine that's pi over 10. so now we can solve for b like we did in the previous one we're going to say use our period is 2 pi over b formula but i'm replacing period with pi over 10 is 2 pi over b and we want to solve this little equation for b you know you can cross multiply if you want here since we have one fraction equals another we could say pi b equals 10 times uh 2 pi which is 20 pi divide both sides by pi then b is 20 pi over pi or b is 20. and so i got a b value for this second graph and let's see i don't see phase shift don't see vertical shift i think we're all set for a cosine y equals 0.3 cosine of 20 20 x okay so we got our second graph equation separate that off and now let's look at number three now this one is a little bit trickier to deal with one thing i notice it's not centered on the x-axis i see that the midline cuts through here and the midline looks like it's y equals two that tells me there's a vertical shift and that's our d constant right uh d equals two we we're going up two and uh now do i use sine or cosine uh if i wanted to use cosine i have to move over to 4 or over to 12 i'd have to have a phase shift so i'm going to use sine so i choose sine but because we start at the midline and go down and then up what's the amplitude here by the way let's do the amplitude first amplitude is not six the amplitude is the distance from the midline to the top or from the midline to the bottom would be the same so it's actually six minus two which is equal to 4 4 units and so the amplitude is 4. so we had to work a little bit to figure out the amplitude for this one because i want to start my cycle or period by going down first i have to choose a value that's negative so i'm actually taking a reflection of the sine wave through the horizontal axis so i got a d i got an a it's my period period goes from x equals 0 out to x equals 16 okay so here we go again using that formula for b backwards right period is 2 pi over b we're going to plug in 16 equals 2 pi over b and solve for b 16 b is 2 pi so b is 2 pi over 16. my b value is going to be pi over 8. i reduce that so i got an a and a b and a d i would only have a c value if we had a phase shift in number three i don't see a phase shift so um i think we're ready to write down our formula so it's we're using sine but we have to write y equals negative 4 sine of bx so it's going to be pi over 8 x close parentheses plus 2 on the outside to represent our vertical shift for that graph so we got number one number two and number three and i'm kind of running out of room here so i think i'm gonna do number four in a separate video
