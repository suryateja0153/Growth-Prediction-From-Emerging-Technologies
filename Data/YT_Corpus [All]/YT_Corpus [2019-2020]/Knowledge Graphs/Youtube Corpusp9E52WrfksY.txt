 [Music] okay so now that we have these reporters now we can start to talk about the graphs that are present in the simple economy model to explore right so let's start with the line graph because that's maybe a little easier to understand so we're gonna call it wealth by percent because just doing the top 10% first at the bottom 50% and all we did really was just put the community up 10% and plot bottom 50% now we did have to add a pen to create that bottom one because it defaults to only one and we changed the color to red right so that it could be a pretty distinctive color from the blue that we're going to use the other that these commands are like the simplest possible plotting commands you can have right and we also changed you can play around with the scales but doesn't really matter because we're gonna auto scale which means gonna show all the data it can and flop when you use it it's just gonna plot the next y value versus a X tick value every single time so top 10% at 0 whatever the time is 1 whatever that is to whatever the values and so on right and so that's how it's gonna generate that and as a result you get this graph that where the top 10% wealth curves up and then bottom 50% more wealth curves down they started at the same point right but eventually they cross on the top 2% is more wealthy than the bottom 50% so that's that graph the other graph that we have here is a histogram which is a little more complex and in fact it even has it even has some some interesting data on it so if you look at it right what it does is it first sets the plot Y range between 0 and 40 this is just to kind of show like we know that roughly the plots are gonna be in that range that roughly there's not going to be much more than about 40 individuals per bucket of wealth right and then it's going to do a histogram of the of all the turtles which is just a built-in net Lulu command to throw all these barb plots now the one thing you do have to do is change the plot to a bar because otherwise again try to a Mayan histogram which is gonna be a little confusing so that was modified there right the other thing that was modified is that the x max was set to 500 because we know that at least you know we can't really dish few individuals beyond 500 so we're just gonna limit of that now it is set to auto scale so if anyone goes over 500 will adapt to that eventually and the Y X label is just set to 40 right so it's just the number of Turtles and then if you run this basically then that logo code for histogram just takes over dividing up the number of intervals and all that kind of thing for you automatically right and it's gonna figure out how to plot the history of a net wealth over the entire development yeah and so there we have our histogram we have our data we have everything there you may be curious how we got this little total wealth button there well that's actually not part of the graph that's actually a text field which are note field that we just dropped on top of it right so that's another interface element you can use if you want to link annotated graph but the but the standard legend or whatever is not useful for you you can always just create a new note field right put whatever value you put whatever you want it histogram of wealth right this is kind of redundant with what it actually does but and then I could just put that wherever I want right that kind of helps explain a little bit more so that's kind of a cool thing that was added in here just to explain that the total wealth can't exceed $50,000 to as we talked about in the previous videos wealth is neither created nor destroyed in this model so there you go we have all the components of this model at this point the only question left is what do we do if a how do we analyze the data and we're going to talk a little bit about that in the next video
