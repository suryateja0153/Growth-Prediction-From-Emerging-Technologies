 hello my name is Kaley today we will be doing graphing number two part one about bar graphs no matter what kind of scientist you are the first thing you do is ask a question scientists can ask two types of questions the first type of questions are quantitative questions and quantitative questions have to do with numbers like how many how much and what's the majority and what is the minority the other type of question scientists can ask are qualitative and qualitative questions have to do with trends or patterns like did it get bigger did it get smaller was there improvement and how did it change do you see how these questions can be different one about numbers and one about patterns today we are going to ask both kinds of questions first we will ask a quantitative question one that has to do with numbers like what color eyes are the majority in our family meaning which eye color is the most popular in our family brown blue green or black before we ask our question let's build a table to keep track of our answers we know what to put under eye color brown blue green and black we will make a tally mark for every time we get an answer for one of our colors this is our data we will ask everyone in the family what color their eyes are and their answers will go on our data column the how many people column well let's get to it what color are your eyes we will start to log the answers or data in our table like this under our data column how many people the more family members we ask the more data we collect let's keep going now our table looks good lots of data we have asked everyone in the family what color are your eyes and we have filled in a lot of tally marks in our data column now it is time to remember that we are asking a quantitative question a question that is about numbers and then in the case of our question we want to know what eye color is the majority or occurs the most in our family but this table is kind of hard to read so let's use a graph to make it more clear which eye color is the majority in our family we can use a graph like this one it's called a bar graph a bar graph has an x axis on the bottom it's that yellow line down at the bottom of the graph do you see where the arrow is pointing the x axis tell us us the things we are asking about for us our x axis will show the different eye colors we are asking about brown blue green or black a bar graph also has a y-axis on the side of the graph it's that purple line that you see see where the purple arrow is pointing this axis tells us the number of things for our graph the y-axis is our data or the number of people that have each eye color in our family we can find all of this information from our table the x-axis is the things we are asking about the different eye colors and the y-axis is our numbers the data we collected about how many people in the family have each eye color so let's draw our graph the orange bar is our x-axis with the eye color names-- and the purple bar is our y-axis and it will be the number of people so let's graph it we draw a bar for each eye color that is as tall as the number of people who have that eye color on our table we can see that brown eyes has seven tally marks see where it's circled and for the bar for brown eyes goes up to the number seven on our graph see the dotted line that's seven on our graph and we can see the same thing for the other eye colors blue eyes has four tally marks and the bar on our graph goes up to the four on the y-axis green eyes has three tally marks and the bar goes up to three on the graph where that dashed green line is and black eyes has only two tally marks and the bar goes up to two on the graph so now it's really easy to see which eye color is the majority in our family it'll be the eye color that has the tallest bar on the graph I can easily see which one is the tallest do you see it so this means that the majority of people in our family have brown eyes brown eyes are the most popular and the same is true for the minority or the least popular eye color in our family this means the least amount of people have that color so it's going to be the shortest bar on the graph and I can see which one is the shortest it's the black eye bar so that means that black eyes are least popular in our family great job you used a bar graph from data that you collected to answer a quantitative question
