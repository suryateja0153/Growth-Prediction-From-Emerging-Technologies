 my cousin told me that her baby girl started walking yesterday and I was so excited I asked did you record it how far did she walk and she said yes I recorded it and I was like show me show me and she showed me this a velocity time graph of her baby walking so let's see if we can use this graph and figure out how far she traveled we've seen velocity time graphs before it's a graph that tells us the velocity of an object at any time it's like looking at a speedometer so imagine we had a speedometer attached to the baby let's see what the graph is saying the graph says at time T equal to zero at time zero the baby has a speed of 20 meters per second so it's already starting at 20 meters per second and then as the time passes notice the speed remains a constant it does not change it remains the same until 5 seconds but then what is what happens then the graph goes down which means the speed decreases can you see that I mean if you were to go to somewhere like 6 seconds and go up and go to the left can you see that the speed is decreasing so the speed keeps decreasing decreasing until at 10 seconds the speed goes to zero so if we could look at that speedometer at time zero it would be 20 meters per second and it will stay like that for the first 5 seconds and then it'll start decreasing and decreasing and at the 10 and the end of 10 seconds it goes to zero so now we can kind of even visualize what that baby is doing imagine here's our baby girl she just learned to walk so that's it has the speedometer tor let's see what she's doing at time zero she already has 20 meters per second speed I don't know how that happened that information is not there what happened before that but that's she already has a speed of 20 meters per second and so she continues with that for 5 seconds for the first 5 seconds and then she slows down slows down and comes to rest at the end of 10 seconds and I will go on now is to figure out how far she has reached from her initial location so how do we calculate it well we can start with what we know about velocity we know velocity is displacement over time and by the way if you're wondering why I kept using the word speed earlier well velocity is just speed with direction which means if I said the kid has moving at 20 meters per second that's speed if I say is moving at 20 meters per second upwards that's velocity so don't worry too much about that but anyways we know velocity is this one right time and we need to calculate how far that kid has traveled that means we need to calculate the displacement so we can multiply by time on both sides of this equation and we will get displacement as velocity into time and we can calculate write just one problem you see this is easy to calculate if velocity is a constant like for the first five seconds for the first five seconds I can plug in velocity as 20 time as five and calculated no problem the problem comes for the next five seconds because the velocity is changing it's decreasing if it's decreasing what number would I plug in and how we like he'll clear displacement that's the big question we want to try and answer over here so you know what we'll do we'll worry about that a little bit later let's first calculate from zero to five seconds and see what we get so let's calculate the velocity or displacement sorry from zero to five seconds from zero to five seconds the velocity is a constant which is nice so if I plug in velocity is just 20 minutes Orr's per second multiplied by time which is five seconds that will give me ii cancels twenty times five is a hundred I get hundred meters so that's the displacement in the first five seconds but now what to do for the next five seconds from five to 10 seconds how to calculate that's the big question right well here's what we will do we will try to figure out what this means in the graph so think about this 20 meters per second what is that in the graph what have we calculated what is that 20 represent in our graph well in our graph if you just focus on this rectangle because you're only calculating from 0 to 5 that 20 represents the length of this rectangle right this is the 20 and what is this 5 represent well that represents the breadth of this rectangle and so when you multiply and we get a hundred what is that hundred represent over here in other words what do we get in a rectangle when you multiply length by bread you know this one it's the area when you multiply these two you get the area and that area is 100 right that's our 100 meters ooh this means to calculate displacement we just have to calculate the area under the graph that's how you do it why does it work it works because displacement is the product of velocity and time and in our graph when you multiply velocity and time you're basically multiplying two lengths in our graph and that gives us the area and so that's the secret to calculating displacements in from a velocity time graph you just calculate the area under it so from five for ten seconds I'm no longer going to use the formula instead I'll just go to the graph and I'll say the area from five to ten seconds that represents this area okay let me use white again this area that represents the displacement from five to ten seconds so we can calculate that area in fact I'm pretty sure you can calculate that area as well so you know what pause the video go ahead and see if we can calculate this area all right let's do this so that area which represent the displacement is going to be half its area of a triangle is half into base into height this is going to be half into base and the base is this length which is 5 into height and the height is this length again 20 so this is 5 seconds into 20 meters per second and what is that equal to that is equal to let's see second cancels 2 goes 10 times you get 50 meters tada done and so this means the total displacement is 100 plus 50 which is a hundred and 50 meter so somehow this kid ended up walking a hundred and fifty meters in ten seconds all right let's try another we have another velocity time graph totally different and we are asked to calculate the displacement from two to four seconds again if you look over here notice that the velocity is changing it starts at zero and then it's speeding up it's speeding up so we're not gonna use this formula directly instead we will calculate the area under this graph because that represents displacement and since we are asked from 2 to 4 seconds we should only calculate the area from 2 to 4 under this graph how do you do that well 2 is here 4 is all here so we calculate area only in that section that represents the displacement from 2 to 4 seconds so this area gives us the answer so you know what can you do can you give it a try see if you can somehow figure out the area of this shape all right let's do this so what shape is this this is a trapezium so we need to use the formula for the area of trapezium now if you don't like trapeziums another thing which we can do is we can draw one line over here and calculate this as the sum of two areas a 1 triangle and our so again if now you feel that okay now you can do this again pause the video and cry alright let's do this let's do this so the displacement is going to be the total area which is the area of the triangle what's the area of the triangle it's half into base what's the base of the triangle well that's two two seconds two seconds into height what's the height of that triangle if you look carefully this represents the height right this one what is that equal to well if you look to the left this is 40 this is 20 so this height is 20 meters 20 meters per second 20 meters per second Plus that's the area of the triangle now we have to do the area of the rectangle again it's going to be length into breadth let's try with the breath breath is again two so that's two seconds into length into length can this linked what is that equal to that's this length that is this length which is 0 20 that's also 20 20 meters per second and so we can go ahead and calculate now these two cancels and the second cancel so we get 20 meters over here plus you get 2 times 20 that's 40 meters over here and so total displacement is 60 meters and so in this case this lesson from 2 to 4 second is 60 meters so I guess the moral of the story is if your cousin's ever provide you a velocity time graph representing their kids motion then you can figure out how far they walked just by calculating the area under that graph
