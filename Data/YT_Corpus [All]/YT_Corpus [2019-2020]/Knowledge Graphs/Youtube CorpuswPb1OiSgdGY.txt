 hello students today we're going to look at graphs of logarithmic functions and in particular we're going to compare these two graphs of exponential functions so what i want us to do is use a table of values to sketch two graphs we're going to sketch the graphs of f of x equals 2 to the x which we've already seen and then g of x equals log base 2 of x which will be new to us so for f of x equals 2 to the x power we can pick negative two negative one zero one two and three for our x values two to the zero is one two to the first is two two squared is four two cubed is eight two to the negative first is one half remember a negative exponent moves us across the fraction bar into the denominator and two to the negative second is one fourth so if we plot these points we've got 0 1 1 2 2 4 3 8 negative 1 one half negative 2 1 4 and we know what this graph looks like because of course we've already graphed it we've already seen this and we know that it has a horizontal asymptote for the x-axis so it's getting closer and closer and closer to the x-axis but never crossing it so this is our graph of f of x equals 2 to the x now we want to make a graph of g of x equals log base 2 of x and so it's important for our x values to make things easy for these to be powers of 2 because remember the logarithm is asking what power do we need to raise 2 to to end up with x so in this case it's actually useful for us to choose our x values to be 1 4 one half 1 2 4 and 8 because these are all powers of 2 and that will allow us to take the logarithms easily let's actually start at the bottom and work our way up if we look at log base 2 of 8 that's asking 2 to the what power is 8 and we know 2 to the 3rd power is 8 so that's going to give us the point 8 comma 3 which is right here then if we look at 4 we're asking what power can we raise 2 to to get 4 and we know 2 to the second power is 4 so this gives us the point 4 comma 2 on our graph then 2 to the what power is 2 the answer is one so this gives us the point two comma one then two to the what power is one we know that two to the zero power is one so this gives us the point one comma zero now if we look at one half this is saying two to which power is one half and we know that that's going to be negative one so this gives us the point one half comma negative one and if we look at one fourth for x two to the what power is one fourth well we know that that's negative two so this gives us the point one fourth comma negative two and as we connect the dots we get a graph that looks something like this and our function is not going to go to the left of the y-axis because if we try to take a logarithm of a negative number it's not possible to raise 2 to any power and end up with something that's negative so our graph is not going to end up crossing the y-axis and in fact our graph ends up being asymptotic to it now if we want to see what the relationship is between these two graphs we can quickly draw in the line y equals x i'm going to do this as a dashed line and we notice that our graphs are actually reflections of each other across this line here we have our g of x equals log base 2 of x and this should not be a surprise because i've told you that these are inverse functions and we know that inverse functions have graphs that are reflections of each other about the line y equals x which i'm realizing now i wrote y equals y it's y equals x and also if we look at our tables of values we can see that in our logarithm we've just switched the x and the y values so we've switched the inputs and the outputs and so we can see that these are definitely inverse functions of each other and this will be true even if we looked at a different base if we looked at 3 to the x and log base 3 of x if we looked at 10 to the x and log base 10 of x we would still have inverse functions and the graphs would still be reflections of each other now i really want to quickly talk about domain and range before we move on for our first function the exponential function notice that the domain is all real numbers from negative infinity to infinity but the range is only the positive numbers from 0 to infinity because this graph never goes below the x-axis we know that when we look at a function's inverse the domain and range switch so in this case the domain should be from zero to infinity and the range should be from negative infinity to infinity and that's exactly what we have if we look at this graph it's only to the right of the y-axis so the domain is only positive numbers and the range is all real numbers because this goes infinitely far down and then as it goes to the right it's going to be growing and growing and growing and getting bigger and bigger and bigger it's going to be getting bigger slowly as it increases but just like the square root function it's going to continue to grow as x gets bigger and bigger and all logarithmic functions no matter what the base is will have a domain from 0 to infinity and a range from negative infinity to negative infinity the shapes will be a little bit different depending on the base either steeper or less steep but all logarithmic functions will have the domain and range in common
