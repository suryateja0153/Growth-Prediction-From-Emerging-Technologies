 the Cartesian coordinates brought math into the real world as a tool that helped scientists to make major discoveries subscribe to follow the series the history of mass on our YouTube channel now for a long period of time you had like two main streams in mathematics geometry came from Egyptian to the Greeks and the other one algebra coming from the Arabic world bringing some new concepts like the zero the unknown etc one day a French philosopher Descartes had an idea say why don't we merge the two disciplines geometry and algebra that is a great idea in order to do so he invented something which is called Cartesian coordinates which suddenly made something incredible possible it's possible to see mathematics to see equations so if you take the X and y the dot 2.4 sits here and you can see where is the dot you can visualize things you can slowly start visualizing physics Galileo said nature is written in the language of mathematics so it was the stool developed by the CAF became a fantastic possibility for many scientists including Galileo because you can draw you can see you can picture things let's take another dot 1 1 and then 3 9 you can put the two dots on the same system and what you do slowly you draw a curve and the equation is at any X you take the power of 2 for Y and you can slowly draw what we call a parabola you can mirror the curve so suddenly it was possible to see a parabola and of course this major breakthrough because what 17th century people starve to find lots of flaws in physics as taller Mira and the parabola for example was used as a tool in physics for example if you take a table like this and you push a bowl and then it falls on the ground this curve is more or less a parabola so it was suddenly possible to calculate where like for a cannonball exactly the same an incredible tool for scientists and a good example still today imagine you want to capture the energy of the Sun you have raised those rays are parallel and of course you'd like to have all the Ray focusing at the same place the answer a parabola because whatever the distance here the angle will rush the Ray to the focus on the parabola so there was another major break from in mathematics thank to the CAF's mathematics suddenly became the ultimate tool for science Thank You mr. Descartes next time we will have a look at paradoxes math blind spots why for example it's impossible to cross a square subscribe now to watch our full series on the history of math
