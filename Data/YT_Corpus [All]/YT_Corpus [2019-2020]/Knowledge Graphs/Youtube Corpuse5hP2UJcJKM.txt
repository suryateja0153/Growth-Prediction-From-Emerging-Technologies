 In this video we'll consider what the multiplicity of a root does; this will be  a largely graphical video. Let's head over to desmos.com And here we are. So we're looking at this polynomial; it has a root at 1; that  root has multiplicity one. If we think of this polynomial as  being a "path" that we walk along what happens at 1? Nothing special really. We walk right through, and we keep on walking. What if we change that multiplicity to two? Well that changes the shape of  the graph because it changes the degree of the graph and  it changes the leading term; but from our point of view, looking at this route, the important change is what has happened to this route? We walk down  the path, we reach the root, and we no longer pass through the axis; we turn around and come back the way we came. What if we had a multiplicity of three? I really ought to be changing these, shouldn't I? Well now we walk along the  path, we reach the root and we keep right on walking. If we have a multiplicity of four, we walk down the path, we  reach the root, we turn around and go back the way we came. Maybe this is enough to see the pattern here; if a root c has odd multiplicity, then the curve passes through   c. By contrast, if a root c has even multiplicity, the curve "bounces off"   the graph, sorry "bounces off" the x-axis at c. Returning to desmos you see: even multiplicity, the curve comes down and then goes back up without  passing through the x-axis. Odd multiplicity: it passes through the x-axis even multiplicity, bounces off odd multiplicity, passes through.
