 we want to use the graphs of the lines to determine the intercepts looking at the first graph we begin by determining the horizontal intercept or x intercept which is the point where the line intersects our crosses the horizontal or x-axis and therefore this point is the horizontal intercept or x intercept and notice how the access is scaled by twos the ordered pair for this point is 5 comma 0 any point on the horizontal or x-axis has a y-value or y coordinate of 0 the vertical intercept or y intercept is the point where the line intersects the vertical or y-axis and therefore this point is the vertical intercept or y intercept the ordered pair for this point is 0 comma negative 5 any point on the vertical or y-axis has an x value or x coordinate of 0 looking at the next graph notice how the line intersects the horizontal x axis at this point with an ordered pair of negative 4 comma 0 and the line intersects the vertical or y-axis at this point with an ordered pair of 0 comma 100 so the horizontal or x intercept is negative 4 comma 0 and the vertical or y intercept is 0 comma 100 let's take a look at two more examples notice here we have a horizontal line and since the horizontal line does not intersect across the horizontal or x-axis there is no horizontal or x intercept so I'm going to go ahead and write none however in the homework system you are told to enter DNE if there is no intercept and notice how the horizontal line does intersect across the vertical axis at this point with the ordered pair of 0 comma 20 so the vertical intercept or y intercept is 0 comma 20 looking at the next graph notice how the line passes through the origin the ordered pair for the origin is 0 comma 0 the origin is the only point that is on both the horizontal and vertical axes and therefore the horizontal intercept is zero comma zero and so is the vertical intercept I hope you found this helpful
