 today we're going to talk about graphs and banking the idea for this really is to encourage graph thinking and help people who may work in the banking industry understands how their data naturally forms graphs and how graphs you know can improve their business in a number of areas as well as a sybian said in her intro you know where there's an opportunity for using graphs you know with more advanced they designs techniques like machine learning and AI so we'll start first with an introduction to graphs and neo4j just to make sure everyone is on the same page then we'll take a look an overview of the sorts of data that a bank would have that will then carry forward into some particular use cases so we're gonna drill into for use cases for graphs and banking first will be fraud and with that we'll see a demo then we'll talk about risk knowledge graphs and the customers 360-degree view each of those we'll take a look at a graph put together from the types of data we talked about earlier and we'll explore you know how that graph can then be used for each of these particular use cases and then we'll wrap up with some some Q&A at the end so to introduce graphs so everyone is probably familiar with relational databases they've been around for ages it's it's what many businesses run on there they're really kind of quite structured columns and rows powered by sequel query language so you select some values some columns from a row that matches a particular value and you get that very table oriented a lot like spreadsheets you put data in you get data out if you want to join entities together you can do that with joins and join tables there's a known design pattern for this normalization but that joining a very complex sets of relations together can really be quite slow and cumbersome and difficult to build a query for on the other side we have graphs and graphs are really built for connected data highly connected data all right so where you have very connected data sets things entities they're linked with other things in very complex ways graphs can help you leverage the contacts the additional information that's held in those relationships and the query language for that is cipher it's our query language from the o4j and you can see an example of it there but there's someone a man who loves someone named ants today we're not really going to get into a cipher as a language we're really going to focus on the graph data model and understanding that representation of data so you know the idea of graphs is as I said leveraging the power of the relationships between data and a neo4j you know we always say relationships between data is important to the data itself and we believe the next wave of competitive advantage in businesses all around the world and across all industries will be powered by using those connections between data to identify and build knowledge and what you see here is a graphic that spans data silos right so often the relationships between your data can be difficult to see and certainly difficult to use because your data lives in all sorts of different databases across your business right so you have customer data you have your product data you have third party data like market data maybe social media data credit agency data joining all this together in one coherent view to allow you to leverage the power in those relationships is what neo4j offers so you might be thinking how how can graphs help me then right so we're gonna take fraud as an example so you know in the olden days fraudsters were maybe less advanced right before there was the internet and all the technology we have available now fraud was maybe more straightforward and so where the techniques used to identify it right so if you have a loan frauds there maybe steals that someone's credit card goes out and start shopping with it you know we have techniques to be able to find that sort of transactional fraud fraudsters have grown you know advanced over the years and the techniques they use are now much more advanced the technology they use is a lot more advanced so the problem is you got to find these guys you have to find a fraud ring fraudsters now often work together to try to fly under the radar to avoid the old techniques that were aimed at old fraud and instead you know are using their new techniques working together and what you need to do to find the patterns in your data that can show you the behavior of that fraud ring and that's what neo4j really does right we are the number one database for connected data and enterprise-grade graph database and we say we're native graph database which means we are built explicitly for working with graphs for working with connected data and everything about our database from the ground up is really engineered to work with those relationships and that highly connected data so we allow you to store that data to access it to understand it to traverse it to visualize it and to manipulate it live on the fly I add add data very easily it's highly performant it's it's scalable it's everything you would expect from an enterprise-grade database so to introduce the concept of the graph data model for anyone who's not familiar with it it's really built of three very simple components all right so first there are nodes and that's what we see here the circles we have two person nodes and we have one car node nodes in the property graph model tend to be nouns they're things they're entities and the the labels that we have on them person and car are just a way of doing that of labeling them so that they're easy to query and group together but it doesn't necessarily imply any kind of schema so like in the relational model where your schema is fairly rigid you know every car every row has the same columns in it and if you don't have a value for that column in a particular row you have to fill it with no graph databases are more flexible so one person node doesn't have to look exactly like another person node between them we have relationships so we can see here this person loves this person here and this person loves this person here relationships are always saved in the database with the direction and you can see that with the arrows here and each relationship can only have one label so you couldn't have loves and lives within the same relationship that's why we have to the directionality is sometimes important so for example love's is important right so we have this person here this person here whose name is dan loves this other person in and luckily for him and loves him in return but if she didn't that relationship would go away so it's important to know the direction of that love's relationship whereas lives with it's kind of implied that is bi-directional so if Dan lives with Anne then of course and lives with Dan it wouldn't be it would be logically impossible for it not to be that way so we can ignore the direction at query time and therefore we just need the one relationship so we had nodes relationships and the last part of a property graph is the properties so that's what these are appear nodes can have properties as well as relationships and properties are just key value pairs so here we see we have a property called name and the value in that is Dan you know Dan was born on May 29th 1970 and we have his Twitter handle which is at Dan we know this person has a name property of Ann she was born December 5th 1975 we don't have her Twitter handle and that's okay like I said there's no schema enforced out of the box although you have the choice to to apply a schema to your database if we get Ann's Twitter handle down the road it's very easy to add if instead we want to add her Instagram account or her Facebook account you can do that too and we can see as well there's a property on this relationship so Dan drives the Volvo the an owns and he has driven it since January 10th 2011 so those few components give us all the tools we need to be able to to build a really complex and expressive graph data model which we'll get into in a bit we're really gonna focus today on nodes and relationships a little less than properties although as we go through each of the graphs we're going to look at we can talk about the sorts of properties that would be there so now we're going to take a look just a high-level overview of the sorts of data that a bank might have before we then start putting that data into different graphs so first we'll look at organizational data and this is data that you as a bank hold you know about yourself really it's about your business so you probably have lots of documentation and that can live all over the place you know maybe you have SharePoint maybe you have an intranet you might have documentation at various levels so you could have global documentation regional documentation then there's processes and and the same would be true of that you probably have global processes as well as more regional processes you'll have employee data and information about the people that work in your company as well as the organizational hierarchy so where do those people fit into your organization who reports to whom what projects do people work on then you'll have KPIs and reports and you know obviously this is really important for running your business understanding how those KPIs are calculated how you report those internally as well as reporting them to to regulators and governing bodies and then you have systems and databases so this is where your data actually lives or the applications that you actually use to run your business next we have data about your customers so you know you'll have personal data about them they live there their phone number so when they were born so on and so forth you'll have some documents from them so this might be the documentation they provided when they open their accounts or when they applied for a mortgage you might have some information about their relationships so you can see here is already a little graph maybe you know their spouse maybe you know details about their children any information you have about other people they might be related to so far we've been kind of really talking about personal data right this is kind of retail banking but of course you could have commercial banking data as well right so you might be working with companies you'll have information about those companies their corporate data and we'll explore both scenarios I think most of it we're going to focus on retail banking because I always think that's kind of the most relatable most people have the bank accountant and work interact with the bank and so they understand those processes but we will look at a particular scenario for corporate banking as well and then you might have information about assets but you know especially if you're looking at corporations or businesses but also individuals right if they if they put up security for loans or something like that next we have information data about your products and your services so again you have documentation about those products and services processes related to them you know what is the process that you go through when someone applies for a current account or a mortgage you have the details of specific products and services as well as the hierarchy so you might have you know an extensive set of services and products that you've offered over the years you might have like a close book of services you know offer anymore but people still have them so being able to relate all those together and understand the details of each of those products of services is quite important and then you have the information and knowledge that you use when you're pricing individual products and services next there's event data so kind of grouped together a few things here there's money movements transactions there's web and app activity that you might be tracking when someone logs into their banking websites or uses an app and then there's you know call center or customer contact information and lastly you might be using third-party data so you may be track social media mentions of your bank of your organization you certainly interact with credit rating agencies you know both for retail banking as well as you know for corporate corporate customers and then there's market data again which is more in the commercial banking space you know you need to watch the market movements and understand how that will impact your business so certainly not an exhaust exhaustive list but this will definitely give us enough to work with where we can understand how you can build graphs from all these different bits of data to then power individual use cases right and again it's important to remember this data could live in a number of different systems across your organization and so if that's true if you have very siloed data sources and right now is probably quite difficult to join together all this data and to get that holistic view that you need for these individual use cases so hopefully you'll start to see how the graph can really change the way that you can run your business okay so first we're going to look at fraud so this is a graph that I've built to illustrate you know that sorts of data you might use for detecting fraud or for investigating fraud I using a tool you can see there's a link on the bottom here and it will be included on the resources page at the end but we have a tool called arrows which some of my colleagues are built and it's a really great tool for kind of dragging and dropping and and these are really building a data model in a browser so it's quite convenience right and here we have the the color-coding matching the different classifications of data that we talked about before so you can see in the right hand side we don't have any organizational data in this particular fraud example so this is really looking at the potential for credit card fraud or money transfer fraud or something like that you could of course have a separate graph that would include organizational data if you were looking for fraud inside of your company right if you were looking for your own employees committing fraud so here we have in blue some customer data what you know about your customer so here we have customer that customer has some documents that they've submitted so we have a copy of their council tax statement and their passport from and they set up their account we know their home address and we know their phone number so when we look at our fraud demo this information is quite useful during you know this is the information you've gathered during kyc know your customer as you're setting up an account and you can use this to then detect fraud one of the ways that fraud rings operates is by signing up for multiple accounts and they do this using bits of synthesized identities bits of real identities so that when they sign up for an account it looks real but actually maybe some of that information is stolen or it's being reused it's really difficult to fake one complete false identity that will pass through the KYC checks but using simple synthesized IDs or bits of real IDs fraudsters have a better chance of success then in green we have some information about the products that our customer has so here for example this customer might have occurence accounts they might have a credit card through their bank that current account has a debit card and then all the rest of the data that we have round about here is event data which is not surprising right fraud investigations fraud detection is usually driven by suspicious events that happen around an account so starting here at the bottom we can see this credit card was used at an ATM to get a cash advance to take cash out from the credit card so that may or may not be suspicious behavior for this particular customer we're not showing companies here but at you know you might want to know where this ATM was located is this customer typically in that area is this ATM has it already been flagged as suspicious has other fraud been associated with the ATM these are the sorts of things you would want to look at here we have some purchases from two different retailers using that credit card again you would want to look for a pattern of suspicious behavior often what people do fraudsters do when they get a hold of a credit card information or debit card information they might make a few small transactions to verify that the card works before going all in and buying you know something really big really you know going through the balance of that credit card so you might be looking for patterns and transactions that would indicate potentially fraudulent behavior or again you might look at these retailers and understand if they've recently been associated with fraud on other customer accounts same goes here with the the debit card it was used to make two purchases at a retailer on the same things apply cash withdrawals from a different ATM so again you'd want to know the location of that ATM this is probably that's suspicious you've got a money transfer into the current account from that person's employer but then we have a money transfer here that was made during a web session by this customer from a particular IP address and the money was transferred to a foreign account and again that may or may not be suspicious depending on you know the typical patterns of behavior for that particular customer and again whether there's anything about that IP address or that foreign account that ties it to other incidences of fraud so hopefully you got a sense of how the connections between these different pieces of data can actually be used to you know to do some really advanced investigations around fraud looking for patterns of behavior that are unusual or if you've identified some fraud before seeing if this matches that same pattern so to think through how we might use this right you might be thinking you know can I find patterns in the graph indicating fraud in a particular account yes I think we've talked about how that can be done you can look at one account look at all of the activity and the patterns in the data around that if you find something that's suspicious you know maybe withdrawals and short timeframes from multiple ATMs you know purchases from different IP addresses as well using using that same account going to suspicious ATM machines that have been linked to fraud before looking for a pattern in a particular account is is definitely a use case here then the next question is if you find a pattern of fraud in the graph for one account can you then look for that pattern on other accounts the answer is yes once you identify a pattern it says when I see these things happening then you can apply that pattern to your entire graph all your customers all your transactions and see where else that pattern appears right so then you can find more incidences of fraud potentially that you hadn't known about before once you identify that pattern next you might think okay I've detected fraud but can I use the same approach to prevent fraud and the answer is yes so once you've identified a pattern that that it's typically fraudulent or that is at least worth investigating you can then set up alerts so as you see that pattern starting to form you can raise an alert and you can prevent fraud right so it's kind of shifting from detection after the event into prevention being more proactive stopping fraud before it happens again by identifying patterns of behavior and being of the spot those patterns as they develop and then lastly you know could you use this graph alongside some more advanced data science techniques things like machine learning to find new patterns of fraud you didn't even know about and the answer is yes this is a really exciting area for us and for graph databases in general the ability to link the graph with machine learning you know really is more powerful than the sum of its parts so the graph can be used to feed information into your machine learning pipeline so you can identify features and their relationships in the graph that you can then feed into the machine learning pipeline use that machine learning to find patterns to create a model that can then be applied back to the graph right so you can use that to identify new patterns of fraud apply that into the graph look for those patterns where they may exist again try to prevent those patterns from happening by spotting them as they form and then that becomes a loop so as more data gets added to the graph you can see how successful that machine learning model is you can then feed the graph back into your machine learning to refine it and continue that cycle continuously you know looking for new patterns improving those patterns using that loop that feedback loop between the graph and ok so now we'll take a quick look at a fraud demo in neo4j just so you get a sense for how you might actually use the database so this is a tool called bloom this is a more business user friendly way of interacting with me okay what you don't need to know the query language it's all powered by this search bar and I've set up a few queries for us to take a look at so first we're going to look for some fraud rings and I can show you the query for this it's something I've written in cypher as I said before our query language I typed in five find fraud rings which is the search phrase and what it does is it kicks off this cipher here which basically looks for rings of individuals rings of account holders in our database that share contact information amongst themselves so we can take a look at a few of these and see why exactly they've shown up in our query results so first we have to account holders no three we have Caroline we have Simone and we have je je and Simone share a phone number not uncommon maybe they live together what is uncommon is that they also share a social security number so in the US social security number is a unique identifier it shouldn't be possible for two people to have the same social security number and so therefore straight away that's a red flag Carolyn shares an ID with Simone so both Carolyn and Simone have submitted the same passport details whereas Carolyn has her own social security number and we can see Carolyn and J and Simone all have the same address together right so this is an example of what I was explaining before synthetic identities shared bits of identities being used together to set up accounts take a look maybe at one more example so here we have two individuals Kathy and Chang they share an address again not very unusual what is unusual is that they have the same driver's license details their ID is the same so again another red flag right two people can have the same driver's license - Tom Bruce here shares a phone number with Chang and Kathy so even though he doesn't have the shared driver's license or deed any kind of major red flags he is implicated in this ring because he shares a phone number with Cathy and Chang right so even though you doesn't share a passport or driver's license or whatever we would still think he's probably part of this ring because he's tied to the other to buy this relationship just to show you a little bit more about how Blum works we can drill into some of these entities so if I double-click on Chang I can see the properties associated with him so his details his birth dates his full name he has a unique identifier in our system I can see all of the relationships that are associated with him so they don't think they're all out and we can see the neighbors so these are the nodes is sit at the end of those relationships and we can see some of the details for those so if I wanted to I could then reveal any that are not so his bank account details worked out I've not brought those out on the display ok we'll take a look then at another type of fraud so this is more kind of e-commerce oriented fraud this is using transactions that look suspicious to identify potential fraud so we'll start by by saying find ecommerce fraud and what this does is it's pretty straightforward it's just looking for events that happen within a certain time of each other you know where so here we have a particular card a bank card that was used in two purchases this one at oh nine fifty five thirteen and this one here at oh nine fifty 509 so within four seconds of each other from different IPS which are located in in different US states so potentially suspicious maybe you need to know a little bit more you know it could be a parent and their child who are using the same the same credit card the same thing card so you know we have some additional details here we can see the accounts that were used to make the purchases we can see they were both delivered to this st. address which is in Maryland even though one of the purchases was in Idaho one was in Rhode Island so you know again this may or may not be suspicious but if you tie this together with other information you have in the graph you know it might it might build a bigger pattern of fraudulent behavior we can also see ecommerce fraud with subsequent purchases right so we identified the behavior that we thought was suspicious which was the two original purchases made from different IPS in such a short time frame from each other here we have two other purchases that were made subsequently one at 9:58 and one at 956 if you think the earlier ones are fraud the knees to you know might also be something that you want to dig into and understand whether or not they could also be fraud all right so again we have a third account a third delivery address however this this note down here at the bottom was made to the same delivery address so you know maybe it's maybe it's this one here that's the outlier so it's a quite a visual way to perform your investigation very easy for a non-technical user to be able to use as long as you understand that the domain and a little bit about the data model can be quite easy to visually explore the graph and look for patterns without having to know any code okay so that was our neo4j bloom demo now we're going to go through a few more use cases again looking at the graphs that we can form from our banking data understand how the graph can power these use cases so next we'll look at risk in this scenario this is really focused on a business customer right rather than a retail banking customer a personal customer so again in blue we have some information that we have about that customer we know some information about you know their business they own another business so they have a subsidiary we know some information about their primary contact their phone number you know their business address so on and so forth we also know who owns them and who the ultimate beneficial owner is right so this is quite important to understand how companies relate to other companies particularly if you're looking into anti money laundering or you know indeed and risk if you know if you need to know something that something that affects that subsidiary you know if their business goes down or their business shuts down or they go into bankruptcy or something like this it certainly could affect this particular business customer we know their risk rating which we have assigned them using our internal risk rating process so here in red we have more of our organizational data we can see that this risk rating is aggregated up into a KPI which is then included in a report that would be given to the board or indeed maybe a regulating body here in black we have some external data some third-party data so we have a credit rating that that business gets externally maybe from Moody's or something we have information about their share price which could certainly fluctuate so we probably have lots and lots of instances of share price data about them so we can see historically how their their share price has fared and maybe we have some press releases about them maybe we track information about this company in the news or that they released the news you know it could be their quarterly earnings reports or yearly reports things like that so we can understand how their business is doing and how that might impact their risk rating right whether or not we need to adjust that then we have some product data about them so they have a business account they have a business loan we can see they've made loan payments from that business account into their business loan we can also see this foreign accounts has transferred money into that business account and also this business account has transferred money to their owners account so a little bit of event data some transaction data so what sorts of questions can we ask about this graph then how what might we be able to use it can we use the patterns in the graph to help improve the risk rating process and I would say yes the the more you have a holistic view of your customer and all the data associated with them and the more real-time that view is you know the more effective you can be in your risk rating process the quicker you can react to things that may be changing so that's the answer to number two as well it's our more quickly react to changes you know if you're if you're tracking external data press releases share prices you're looking at patterns in the behavior of their accounts and money movements all of these things will help you quickly react to changes that may alter the risk profile for that particular customer so next can you use the graph to understand the lineage of data which feeds your KPIs in your reporting and the answer to that of course is yes when you know where your data lives you know when you have this map across all your systems of your customer and you know where the data lives you can prove the lineage of that data and how it was how it's been fed into that that risk rating and how then all of your risk ratings are aggregated up to a KPI and to reports and so this is very important you know can you use the graph for regular compliance and the answer yes be CBS 2 3 9 specifically is all about this how you report risk how you aggregate risk being able to demonstrate you really understand how you determine overall risk profile where that data comes from how you know that it's accurate and how you know how it was calculated aggregated next we look at knowledge graphs which is another very exciting area for for graphs you can see this is this picture is very green a lot of this is about product data so this particular scenario is a knowledge graph that's customer facing so here we have our customer a retail customer they have a current account they have a mortgage and they're interested in a nice F maybe they want more information about an ice ax so from their current accounts there's a lot of information that we can offer them right so a knowledge graph is really a map of information it's all the information that you have about your services your products their documentation and building a map of that so you can understand how it all fits together and find the information you really need most effectively so for current accounts in general you might have general processes you have a web page that has information about current accounts maybe have an FAQ page about current accounts so this is all kind of generic information about current accounts here because they have a specific current account you need to know the definition of that particular current account right what what are the things that make up their current account and is it different from someone else's cards account do they have a premium account or gold account are there specific benefits that come with that accounts is there is there specific fee are there any charges that get applied if certain criteria on that so all of that product specific information is probably more interesting to this customer than some of the other more general information unless they're interested in moving now now so we want to know what are the processes that are associated with this particular product and what is the documentation associated with that particular product so if this customer you know comes to us and they want to know that the information about their current accounts and all the details we can get that information for them then we also see this current account is is managed by the current accounts team who have specific contact details so if this customer needs to reach out to someone specifically that they can talk to about their current account this is how they can find that information it's a very similar set up for their mortgage we have a mortgage page mortgage Suffolk Hughes general process is about mortgages in general and then we have their specific details about their mortgage project and what are the processes associated with that and the documentation associated with their specific and again that's managed by a mortgage team with their contact details if they're interested in Isis then the general information is probably where they want to go or if they don't have a nicer yet so the the general eisah process is the general general ISO webpage and the general ISO fact we'll all be applicable to them along with the team so could you use that knowledge graph to then improve your customers experience an answer would be yes no customer wants to struggle to find information so being able to get the information that they're looking for you know quickly and and with accuracy is very important so you can use this knowledge graph to power a search engine to improve search results could you also use it with a chat bot as well as the search engine absolutely we have lots of use cases eBay in particular is a very interesting chat bot knowledge graph implementation where they use a knowledge graph that describes all the attributes of different products that are for sale on eBay and the chat bot uses that knowledge graph to then make recommendations and have a conversation with someone about the products that they're interested in what attributes might be most interesting to the so if you're interested in implementing a chatbot maybe for self-service help building a knowledge graph to help that chat box reverse all the information and find the most specific information that would be applicable it's certainly a great way to go and can really again improve your customer experience by giving them the right information in a very easy format could you use a knowledge graph internally as well absolutely so we only looked at a customer facing example that you could do the same thing with all of your internal documentation you can build a knowledge graph that describes the hierarchy of your company all of the documentation that's available and then again you could use that to power search results to give you additional additional context to be able to recommend documents that might be applicable to a particular person or indeed you know if you wanted an internal chat bot to help power that chat bot and give it an understanding of all of your information and how it's linked together so that it can traverse that graph and provide the right information during its conversation at the right time and finally customer 360 view so this is the idea that you want all of the information about your customer and kind of one easily accessible view and whereas often this can live across the number of systems right so your your customer data might live in a CRM system the information about their accounts might live in another system event data like transactions could live in a payment system so being able to gather all this information together in one place so that you can view it can be really powerful and can really have an effect in a number of different cases in your business so this is the kind of the biggest and most complex graph that we've looked at again still in blue we have information about our customer so here's our core customer here we can see this customer is has a spouse they're married to someone they both live at the same address and they are both signatory to more that mortgage was for the purchase of their home where they live we can see documentation that they they have associated with them some mortgage so here's their sign mortgage agreement here's the documentation that the spouse supplied a passport and bank statement here we can see the main customer supplied passport and council tax statement I can also see the customers marketing preferences so maintaining this sort of information you know particularly in the context of gdpr is really important that right it's you need to know how your customer has given you permission to use their data and how how you're able to market to them to remain compliant with GD P R in black we have some credit score information that would have been retrieved during their mortgage application we can see that in addition to their mortgage the customer himself or herself has a current account and a credit card can see each of those products has a specific definition we can see a few transactions so we can see the current account has paid into the mortgage twice as well as an overpayment and we can see the current account has some debit card activity a few purchases from a single detail so of course this is quite a small view we have only one credit card purchase in our view but normally you would have lots of historical data neo4j does provides the ability to stamp on all of your relationships and nodes with the time so you can maintain a historical view and you can also take a snapshot of the graph in a particular time range so certainly there would be a lot more data that would sit behind this and then lastly in red we have internal data organizational data we can see this customer has a mortgage advisor who works at a particular branch and that customer uses that branch we can see there's been some customer contacts as well they've made some increase so we have a record of all the contact points all the times they've called in to our call center or email this there's even more information you could add to this you know you probably have information about your customers phone number maybe you have information about their social media interactions with you if they've ever mentioned your organization and a hashtag or something like that the idea is to have a map of you of all your customer data and then you can use that and you know to improve your interactions with that customer so could we use the the customer 360 view to improve the customer experience again absolutely I personally get very frustrated when I contact an organization especially when I've been doing business with for quite a long time and the person at the other end of the phone doesn't really seem to know anything about me customers expect you as an organization to have access to all of their information and they don't it's not really their problem whether or not they're talking to the right division you know or that information is held in another system if you want a really smooth you know and delightful customer experience you really need all the information you can get about them in one place and having this 360 degree view graph can really help you do that what else could use that graph or could use it for anti money laundering for example and I would say absolutely having that 360 degree view of your customer gives you a full view of all of their behavior and all the data you have about them which can then be used to spot anomalies right so if you start seeing strange behavior you know different accounts sending money into them and they're they're not business you know that could be suspicious right if they start opening all sorts of new accounts and sending new money all over the place that could be suspicious so when you you have a full view of all their data you can more readily spot outliers different behavior than the norm can you use that 360-degree view to detect and prevent churn yes so again when you have that historical view in that complete view of customers behavior you can identify patterns that tend to indicate churn and you can identify that potential churn in advance and work to correct it before it happens right so some obvious things that could indicate churn you know someone starts draining their their bank accounts and maintaining a very low balance maybe they're paying off their credit card or their mortgage from a different account rather than from their account they have with you maybe there's a series of calls into the call center you know they have a negative score where they've called to complain maybe there's some social media activity where they're being negative about your brand whatever that looks like you know if you can identify those patterns of behavior again potentially using more advanced data science techniques like like machine learning using the data you have in the graph to inform your machine learning and then finding patterns of behavior that could identify churn then once you have that pattern or those patterns that indicate churn you can apply them to the whole graph find people who may be about to churn and correct correcta or again set up alerts right where as you see a pattern starting to form you can then be proactive and then finally can we use the customer 360 view to improve upsell and cross-sell absolutely when you have a view of your customer you know and you a view of all your customers you can start segmenting your customers comparing customers to each other you know if you have customers that look or behave very similarly and and a portion of them are buying a new product maybe you can recommend that new product to others maybe you can identify pattern that's in your customers behavior that might indicate you know maybe they have a new employer they've gotten a raise maybe they're in the market for for a new house all these sorts of things you might be able to detect from patterns in their behavior again potentially using machine learning and then proactively use that pattern detection to approach your customers for opportunities so there's there's other use cases that we could go into for the for the sake of brevity today we won't but these are more general I think across a number of different industries so there's Identity and Access Management you know it's sort of like an internal knowledge graph where you can understand your hierarchy when maybe when someone joins your organization where they fit in the complex relationships between you know global and regional reporting lines what projects they work on and so forth and then identify therefore what systems and what documentation they need access to and we have a published use case from UBS on this it's what they've done quite successfully I think they were able to reduce the onboarding time for new joiners you know by five weeks so that when you hire someone they're able to get up and running more quickly human infrastructure Network management managing your IT estate understanding the connections between all of your servers and your networking equipments and being able to manage that master and metadata management which is very similar to the customer 360-degree view that we talked about before so being able to understand where all your data sits across all your systems how it fits together and then that of course can lead to regulatory compliance so gdpr is very much about that understanding your data where it lives being able to demonstrate that you're using the correct data and that if someone wants the data you hold on them to be removed that you know where that data lives in your various systems and and the the power of the graph is really not just at the small scale that we've been looking at you know very small graphs of the power of it is when your graph looks like this you've got to scale to the size of a very large Bank very large financial organization lots of transactions lots of customers tons and tons and tons of relationships that's really where the power of the graph comes into play right you can identify these patterns at that sort of scale across your entire business
