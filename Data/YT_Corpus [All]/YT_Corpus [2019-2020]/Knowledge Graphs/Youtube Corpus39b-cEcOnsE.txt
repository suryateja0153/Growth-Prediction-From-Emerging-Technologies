 to find out why the recent rises in measles cases are causing so much concern we'll need to look at the data for particular countries there are big differences between countries but these differences are lost when we combine the data for the entire world media reports often mention statistics about the size of the increases in measles cases for example the united states saw a 240 increase in cases in 2019 compared to 2018 but what exactly does this mean this is an example of a percentage change which compares the size of a change to the original value you can calculate percentage changes for yourself using the data in line graph you just need to follow two steps first calculate the amount of change then convert this into a percentage first we need to focus on just two points in the graph in this case we have a graph of measles cases in the u.s and we want to compare 2019 to 2018. the number of cases in 2018 is the original value for the time period we're interested in the number of cases in 2019 is the new value to find the size of the change we need to find the difference between these two values which means subtracting one from the other we write this as an equation the amount of change is equal to the new value minus the original value in this example the amount of change is 1276 minus 375 which gives us 901 this is a positive number so it represents an increase a negative number would represent a decrease so the number of cases increased by 901 in 2019 compared to 2018. we can get a better sense of how big this increase is by comparing it to the original value that we started with we calculate the percentage change by dividing the amount of change by the original value then multiplying it by 100 in our example the percentage change is 901 divided by 375 which is 2.4 multiplying this by 100 gives us an increase of 240 percent you can see on the graph that a 240 increase is a big rise in measles cases from one year to the next for comparison this is how the graph would look if there had been a 100 increase or doubling 0 or no change or a 50 decrease or halving so according to this graph 2019 was the worst year for measles in the us in over 20 years but it's also important to step back and put this into perspective if we look even further back we see that there were far higher numbers of cases 60 years ago the introduction of a measles vaccine in 1963 caused a dramatic drop in the number of infections the vaccine was so successful that measles was declared eliminated in the u.s in 2000 so even though we're not seeing the huge numbers of the past any large percentage increase is cause for concern especially when the disease can be prevented by a safe and effective vaccine
