 hello look laughs yes hi farmer Pepito good luck you this can't wait to learn guys are pumped yeah so we are going to know today the lot of work on linear grass and when I say linear groves what kind of wife's my talking about who in the first four levels yeah to do great by straight lines okay that's kind of reports than any of is just for straight lines and keeping one sort kind of make clear and remind people of that literally straight lines can be made in Euclidean geometry budget joining two points okay energy points create a straight line and all those points have got an equation related to them I think that's something that we'll be looking creation of a line I feel you guys might know what is it anyone why the YMCA No thank you very much for listening we have oh this is be aware if I were to draw a quick axes like this a horizontal is correct and I call it a Y and that's kind of a key thing to racists do with these these are Max's em it's for gradient which is art so perhaps deep eye shadow a line is and I kind of remember it is the French word Monte which is to climb so and let's do just like and then the C this is our y-intercept okay and that is where it crosses okay and so these things are what you need to kind of name a line so we have a look at example on our graph see so what is our y-intercept from this line that is going through one really access fantastic so our C is equal to 1 okay so our equation is going to be something like y equals you haven't gone yet Thanks and then okay so that's the first part what so if we look now at this line what's the C for this one so going to across act minus 3 so it's easy two minus three so our equation for this line will be y equals something we haven't got around yen's X and then minus three and that's this as simple as that so do you find your y-intercept the list you saying work courses or is simple okay come back to this in a minute so now we're going to look at the idea of the gradient okay so if we look back at this example here the gradient is how steep our line is right so what that kind of means is for every one you go across how many do you go up so for this line if we start at this point one where they only want like the y-intercept is if we go along or what x-axis one how how many are we going to it's super light and so our change in Y divided by our change in X is how we work have agreed so I am to this one is to total one so the equation of on line is this is yeah right so if we have a look at this one let's go a little bit further so if I say here and here so what is our change in Y 1 2 3 and then what's our change in X that's also to the two so upgrade u is equal to 1 so that's effectively 1x take away 3 but do we need the one you know invisible why is he okay so this is how we work out the equation of a line what do you notice about the lines and this that one sleep in a nun yeah so I'm going to say that must have a large gradient but multiple and then compared because these ones are going in the opposite the top right-hand corner these ending towards the top left-hand so they're kind of going can you see the lines are effectively going yeah yeah let's have a look at this one now okay slight change the kiss the light for the line is going in a different direction but our intercepts what three easy simple so plus 3 and that upgrade is slightly different because for this I've changed from one to two on our x-axis is positive one for this one that the direction is going the opposite way so we're going from two to one so we've taken away so this is minus one so what's the gradient for this this is minus 1 1 so minus 1 divided by 1 is minus 1 and say that's just done you know I'm pretty much the basics right there gradients intercepts thank you for introducing us to the world of the now we're going to controversial what was the equation kindly y equals MX plus C so M represents the gradient monta represents so we with this set of two points we can see work out the gradient which is their steepness of the line how would we do that so the same working out the convenient using those two points the way you showed us was to take the difference in Y so difference in Y also a change that's the change in the Y yeah over that the change in X so change that little triangle doesn't change what's the change this is controversial and then the change in the X to the gradient is to how we go back to the equation we do what we call plugging in plug in plug in Y finest directs us okay wheeler so we've got this but it's not quite quite full yeah complete because we're missing well then why interceptors you know how steep it is not how steep is this - I am - it doesn't - so we can use either these points and substitute them like a football team get them onto the pitch get the final result so who can substitute two five so why is what this one five five equals two times X or 2 times 2 is 4 Oh classy for watch mr siva we owe to take forward both sides c is equal to 1 yes equals 1 and then what are you for the final plug it in plug it in 1 equals 2 eggs 1 and then it even works for 9 to try it so 9 is 3 times 4 is 8 plus 1 thank you very much Susan you're amazing lesson on straight lines linear equations gradients climbing Monta I'm never gonna forget the French word so what I'm gonna do is take your brilliant knowledge you've given to us and apply it to finding a route around the treasure map so I have found a treasure map in my attic this treasure map it's actually set on a graph Oh sir we have we start at zero zero and now on the treasure map you can't just go straight to the treasure it'd be too easy we know where x marks the spot right that's over here as seven zero so we know where the treasure is but it's locked in a sealed chest so before we can get to the treasure we've got to pick up the key and the key is up here three four so here's the key monkey's guarded by an evil witch so let me give you the key if you solve the riddle carved into the stone this is a hole this is a good a good job and the stone on the side of the mountain is it worn - what we need to do is starting from the origin we need to move first of all here yeah then we need to move the second line up to give the solution of the riddle - the way to get the key and then we've got to go down use the key now to do this we need to know the equations of our lines we need to know exactly the direction that we're going to move it so first of all starting from the origin we need to go to here okay to solve the riddle so in what direction what is the equation so we to work out y equals x plus y equals MX plus C so y equals MX plus C so you defined first of all what saucy it's zero zero good-day up and then so to get great chip you want the change in Y divided by the change in X so height is 2y and then our change in X is 1 so M is equal to 2 over 1 so quick it is just 2 so starting off from our current location right so we get the riddle Bobby what's the riddle what starts off for four legs moves to two legs two legs ends up on three legs three legs I'm clean I'm just gonna start calculating where we're going next Susan you can work on that one good there the end so we we have a little bit of time because we gotta travel from the mountain with the stone where the riddle is carved to the which one to exchange the answer for the key so we need to go from one to two three four don't we want to use Bobby's method now don't we because we have two points it's miles so what is that equation between those two points okay so we don't have ones that we find that off that you defined the great universe yeah so great work I was changing the Y to the X yes so changing the Y is 4 minus 2 which is - and the change in the X is 3 minus 1 which is 2 so the gradient is 1 so and then to find out what the C is we substitute our values into white was an X plus y a probably easier one try the one - yeah so that Y is 2 yeah 2 equals MX which is 1 1 times 1 is 1 plus C so 2 equals 1 for C between C is 1 yeah and y equals x plus 1 does that work with our new point so for n equal to 3 plus 1 yes perfect right y equals 2x and we traveled along y equals x plus 1 and now do we have the solution yeah it was a person yeah okay right fantastic so we can exchange the riddle we've got the key from the witch fry which right so this come back to the end of your lesson Susan how we're going to do this one what type of line is this one yo it's negative ok so again it's still the same idea there isn't it we're gonna do the gradient so a change in Y we've gone from 4 to 0 so taken away 4 divided - former top pop okay and then we've gone from 3 to 7 to add it on four yep - then our gradient is minus one plug in our values 7 0 yeah so 7 is that minus X plus what gives us 0 7 perfect so we start off y equals 2x first part we solve Bobby's riddle it's a human we give the answer to the winch we get the key we go on our negative gradient y equals minus X plus 7 we open the treasure chest you
