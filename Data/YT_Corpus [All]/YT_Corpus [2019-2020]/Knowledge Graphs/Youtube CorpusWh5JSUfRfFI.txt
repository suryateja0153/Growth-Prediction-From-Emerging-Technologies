 In this video, we are going to be interpreting graphs these graphs show us how busy restaurants are at different times of the day for each graph, explain what it tells us about the restaurant so first we're looking at restaurant A and first I want to identify what my x-axis and my y-axis are telling me my x-axis is hours after 8 am so for example, the 2 would represent at the time 10 am and the y-axis is number of customers so looking at this graph, I see that the number of customers is increasing pretty rapidly up until this point which is at about 3 or three hours after 8 am would be 11 am so the number of customers increases rapidly until 11 a.m then the graph starts going downward, and so that means that the number of customers is decreasing so then it's decreasing between 11 am, and it looks like this point is about seven and a half hours after 8 am which would be about 3:30 so then it decreases between 11 and 3:30 pm and then the graph starts increasing again but it's not increasing quite as rapidly as it was at the beginning so people are coming in at a higher rate at the beginning of the day than they are after 3:30 so then it's increasing again between 3:30 and this point which looks like it's at about 11 and a half, which would be 7:30 pm so then it increases again between 3:30 and 7:30 and then it is decreasing again after that so this part here is again decreasing rapidly which means that the number of customers is decreasing at a fast rate, or people a lot of people are leaving the restaurant in a short period of time so one thing that we want to pay attention to when we're analyzing graphs is where the graph is increasing and where it is decreasing and what that's telling us about the situation so this one is restaurant B, so when we look at restaurant B we see that the number of customers is highest when the restaurant first opens at 8 a.m and then it's steadily decreasing throughout the day so another thing about graphs is that when we have a straight line that represents a time of a constant increase or decrease so the rate of people, in this case, leaving the restaurant is consistent looking at restaurant C, now this is another straight line but it's different because it's a horizontal line, and so looking at this horizontal line I see that it is between 24 and 36, thinking about the scale halfway between 24 and 36 would be 30 so this graph is telling me that at all times, there are 30 people in the restaurant so a horizontal line means that whatever your y-axis represents is not changing let me write that down horizontal line means the y-axis is not changing that can be very helpful when it comes to analyzing graphs in the final graph, restaurant D we can see that we start with zero people in the restaurant at 8 am, and then the number of people in the restaurant is gradually increasing at a steady rate throughout the day because the line is going upward, and the number of customers is increasing so it increases steadily throughout the day
