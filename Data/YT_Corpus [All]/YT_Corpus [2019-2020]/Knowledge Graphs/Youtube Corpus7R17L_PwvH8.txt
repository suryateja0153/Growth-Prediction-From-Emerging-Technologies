 [Music] my encoder from LPL Financial I am a senior vice president leading the data group at LPL Financial technology we are using neo to essentially group entities together so we have a lot of accounts that have persons associated with those accounts it could be the adviser the account holder secondary beneficiary and what we're doing is using our graph to house this data and to sort of construct different types of groups so that we could consolidate alerts and do a more efficient reach out if in case the areas of fraud alert or any kind of notification that we need to work with with our users graphs are incredibly powerful structure and really neo4j brought us I think three key advantages one was that the data modeling can be iterative without really breaking all their use cases so you can sort of Lear in nodes and edges and relationships on to an existing graph grow it both in terms of its scope of data as well as the scope of its meaning very very iterative lis and that allows us to work faster better I think a lot of our problems because the relationships can be very convoluted are better served with graph constructs than they are with with relational stores so those are our main drivers for using your fridge a [Music] I think for us we got to secondary benefits that we were not planning on but but perhaps had thought about we started to see data quality issues because of centrality of certain nodes and we also started to see two great create a system that gave us a historical path right so John started as an adviser opened up these accounts moved to a different group those accounts over taught under that group or Joe as an investor open that account closed a consolidated into a different wine so that that change history and being able to visualize that change history and find that path very quickly we're very powerful secondary benefits that we derived from it [Music] yeah I think I think two or three things one is understand graphs as a data structure I know all of us in Comp Sci school at college went through these but I don't know if at least for me personally the applications were difficult to see we all learn about the Traveling Salesman and so on but how they can apply to other business problems was crucial so my initial introduction to graphs was through this book called no sequel distilled and I really talked about graphs as a structure and the emerging databases there so definitely learn about graph and graph theory I think it's deeply deeply powerful and it starts to make that shift of relational models because most folks think in terms of models to instance data and connections between instances and dynamic connections between between instances I think the second thing is to learn the tools set from neo4j there are really very few craft databases and to me from an enterprise scale enterprise level neo is the only one many people have tried and it just hasn't worked right so really learn the tooling out-of-the-box new for J comes with a great browser my opinion right it's something that you can query you can visualize off of it start to get into that definitely right and I think the final advice I would give is is really around iteration you're not going to get a perfect model it's not going to be a waterfall style project where you'll have everything well-defined you're gonna iterate and gonna make a lot of mistakes and you have to make changes but understand that the graph is actually making it easy for you to do that I think those would be my key advice to anybody starting out ah the knowledge graph we really think so if you think about if you look at Google and how good they have become at search there's a deep amount of obviously underlying engineering mountain systems and data gathering right crawling the web as it were but they've turned that into an internal knowledge graph that is driving the majority of their search results right I think there's 57 steps that they take typically different algorithms they call and half of them are against a knowledge graph so that to me a knowledge graph that is specific to our user base to our company is gonna be mind-blowing I cannot imagine that if I can get this to work I think there's so many applications and benefits derived from that for us for our users you
