 sketch graphs of f of x equals one-half to the x and g of x equals log base one-half of x on the same x-y plane then find the domain and range of each function for f of x equals one half to the x i want to use a table of values to sketch the graph and the values i'm going to pick are going to be negative 3 negative 2 negative 1 0 1 2 and 3. and i'll start from the bottom up one half cubed is 1 8 one-half squared is one-fourth one-half to the first is one-half and one-half to the zero is one now when we raise one-half to a negative power that negative power causes us to take the reciprocal and so when we do that we end up with a whole number one half to the negative first is two one-half to the negative second is four and one-half to the negative third is eight so we end up with the points negative three comma eight negative two comma four negative one two zero one 1 1 half 2 1 4 and 3 1 8. because the base of this exponential function is less than 1 instead of increasing to the right and asymptotically approaching the x-axis to the left here we're actually going to be going up as we move to the left and then asymptotically approaching the x-axis on the right-hand side so this is the graph of f of x equals one-half raised to the x power now because g of x equals log base one half of x it is the inverse function of f of x and we know that when we have inverse functions their graphs are reflections of each other across the line y equals x so we can take advantage of this when we sketch the graph of our logarithmic function and for every point we have on our original graph we can take the point where the coordinates are swapped for the other graph so here instead of zero one we're gonna have one zero instead of negative one two we're gonna have two negative one down here instead of negative 2 4 we're going to have 4 negative 2 instead of negative 3 8 we're going to have 8 negative three and then if we look to these values to the right of the y axis we've got one comma one half which becomes one half comma one we've got two one fourth which becomes one fourth two and we've got three one eighth which becomes one eighth three and as we connect these dots in a smooth curve we can see that we're asymptotically approaching the x-axis from above and then as we move to the right we're going further and further below the x-axis so this is our graph of g of x equals log base one half of x you could also do this with a table of values if you want it would be good to pick values of x that are powers of one half so we could do one eighth one fourth one half one two four and eight and you would end up getting the same output values as the input values for the inverse function negative 3 negative 2 negative 1 0 1 2 and 3. you would end up getting the same graph either way but i want us to get a little bit of practice looking at graphs of inverse functions and using these reflection properties so that we can get more comfortable with them now one more thing we were asked to look at the domain and range of each function for the exponential function the domain is all real numbers and the range is the set of numbers from 0 to infinity the positive numbers this is the same as the other exponential functions we've seen so it doesn't matter if the base is larger than one or smaller than one it'll still have this domain and range and we know that for the inverse function the domain and range will swap so here the domain will be positive numbers and the range will be all real numbers and we can see that represented by our graph the graph does not move to the left of the y-axis so we know that our domain does not include negative numbers and as far as the range goes we do go both up and down it just looks a little bit different than when we had a base that was larger than 1. instead of going down asymptotically we're going up asymptotically and then instead of going up as we move to the right we go down as we move to the right so the graph does look a little bit different but it does still have the same domain and range as the other logarithmic functions
