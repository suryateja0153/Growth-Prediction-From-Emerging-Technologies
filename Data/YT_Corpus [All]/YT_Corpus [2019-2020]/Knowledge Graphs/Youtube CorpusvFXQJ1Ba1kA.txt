 hello everybody welcome to the neo4j online Meetup Karina's busy at sparks summit this week so you just get me again so today we've got we've got Alex is going to be talking to us about using grass to fight diabetes but before before I introduce himself just a little bit of housekeeping we've got a live chat on the right hand side if you're watching this live right inside of the video if you have any questions you can you can ask them on there and I'll pass them on to Alex when desert when there's an appropriate gap we're gonna be showing some examples from the near video browser so you want to make sure your the resolution is set to 720p so you can control that on the little cog on the bottom right-hand side of the screen but of course we'll make sure that the the screen is suitably zoomed in as well other than that I guess I guess maybe Alex like and maybe you can introduce yourself I guess maybe just quickly quick introduction to yourself and maybe a few sentences on how you got into neo4j in the first place is usually where we get where we start yeah so can you hear me yeah okay so my name is Alexander I'm working at the German Centre for diabetes research which is which is a Federal Institute in Germany studying diabetes and we try to develop prevention and therapy strategies in order to have healthy people so my background is I'm a vine from attrition I did my PhD in biochemistry and structural biochemistry doing a 3d reconstructions of microscopic images and and modeling and since 2 years now I'm I'm the head of the data and knowledge management and as I said at the German Centre for diabetes research and first of all what is diabetes and diabetes is a metabolic disease where the insulin which is a little protein in your body that controls the sugar level em that comes from the pancreas and the intra insulin production is reduced or your body responds pretty poorly on the on this little insulin molecule and the consequence is that you cannot uptake any sugar from your blood into your body cells and the sugar remains in the in there in the blood which is called hypoglycemia and this causes tremendous complications especially on the long term and unfortunately diabetes is not curable in general we have type 1 diabetes which is mainly with children so you you are born with it and there the more patients we have for type 2 diabetes which is closely related to obesity and there are some rare forms of diabetes especially gestational diabetes [Applause] so just quickly to give you some numbers what we're talking about so worldwide we have 420 million patients spread it across the globe and that's had the number has quadrupled as since the 1980s which is very alarming and we have another 200 million diabetic let's say patients that are undiagnosed that I don't know that they have diabetes and yeah in the former times it has been assumed that two-thirds that that diabetes is more related to elder people but actually we have two thirds of all the people with diabetes in the working age yeah and that costs the global health insurance is 700 billion dollars per year when we have a comparison to the US and and I only compared because we are Germany so in Germany we have 7 million patients in the u.s. it's thirty million and there are another 84 million that have a pre-diabetes so they are kind of obese and tend to have diabetes in the next year's and when you see the number that that America spends for for diabetes per year which is 300 billion dollars it's quite a number that could be spent somewhere else so this chart shows you the distribution of obese and overweight people in the u.s. between the 1980s and 2009 and you can already see that the legend had to be adopted for it so we have a lot of obese people which is mainly the the cause because diabetes air and comes to you and when we talk about complications of diabetes and it's usually the fact that you have diabetes for several years you don't feel in Europe in your blood you don't feel you don't feel bad but there are many complications where you see okay one of the other people one of the other person dies because of a heart attack or because of a stroke and that mainly comes from diabetes we also got complications in the nerve so diabetic patients often lose their feed or their hand because the nerves are degraded by the immune system there are Co complications to other disease areas like like Alzheimer's and this course in the brain also the stroke is related to the brain and many people have problems with the kidney because there's so much sugar in in the bloodstream and it can't clear it with you with your kidneys so who we are and maybe to spend some words on the German Centre for diabetes research and you see the map of Germany we are an academic Federal Institute M that is nonprofit and we have several locations spread it across the country our main Associated partners are in Berlin Potsdam which is the Institute for nutrition research we have university clinics in in Dresden in Dusseldorf and in Tubingen and we got the Helmholtz Research Institute in in Munich where I'm based and altogether we have more than 400 researchers and there are [Music] either medical doctors or basic research scientists our our research fields are our mainly nutrition or diet we have research in better cells and multi-omics data so genetics proteomics multi-omics and so on we have clinical studies we have data from cohorts and where we just gather data from you know like healthy people or other disease areas and we collect data from them and we we try to find connections between these diseases and our main goal is the prevention of diabetes so we are not a pharma company we don't earn money with this we try to provide specific diabetes treatments to different kinds of people and we try to prevent these long-term complications and that I that I spoke two slides ago so as I said the goal is prevention and in the individualized therapy of other people and what we usually have is a population here and they have different subtypes of diabetes and we want to cluster them and identify the clusters so the subtypes of diabetes if they respond to a specific therapy or to a specific prevention strategy and we want to provide individualized treatment of these subtypes so the we're coming more to the technical partner so how do we fight diabetes and usually the the institutes and university clinic Sam have been classical data silos with relational databases and here in the hospital part we have relational databases with patient's data like what what kind of track is a patient taking or how how large or how much weight does a patient and then we have clinical or basic research where we have animal models like mice or pre-diabetic pigs we have genetics we have small molecules research we have different kinds of cells that we are looking to and and analyzing and studying and the third part is more the let's say the data analysis something like microscopy data on like statistics of of different data sets and they were all siloed which is the classical thing and we had the idea to connect these data points together and we call this the DCD connect which is a neo4j graph database and that's why we are here today so when I started like 2 years ago I was visiting all the different locations and partner locations and it turned out that we have a lot of data I don't want to say big data but we have enormous amounts of data and this is basically very heterogeneous because we have patients data and we have privacy problems with a with sharing the data and analyzing the data we started with connecting the meta level and providing a catalog for our scientists where they can browse what kind of data sets we have within our organization and so we don't touch the raw data and we have a closer look to what kind of data we have in the specific locations and I started to classify them let's say to animal to animal model data here as in yellow and here we have a basic research data here and there and there's pretty obvious to give them labels and this is where we come now to neo we label and classify the data sets and we connect them and this is basically our our data model can give you your a short example what we store at the at the notes here on a meta level for example when we look on the right side we have literature data where we have scientific publications they have a title they have an identified in the database and they are published in a specific year and they have different keywords and journals and we connect this literature data to the people and that are performing the the analysis and writing papers and these peoples are our researchers they are doing experiments and in these experiments we capture different parameters or we acquire different bio samples like blood or urine or even nerves from different organisms and we can browse here in the neo4j database and how many samples do we have what's the size of the data sample and so on in which Freeza are they so all this kind of metadata we have image data where we can say we have a microscopic image what can we see on the picture how many pictures do we have and the main focus here in this data model is the per are the parameters so which parameters are measured or captured in different experiments across the locations across the disciplines and across species so what kind of questions can we answer with this usually these questions are pretty easy for our medical doctors and they are very complicated to query for relational databases with graph databases it's much easier to answer these questions and one of the first questions that our medical doctors had was how many bio samples and were acquired in in a visit which is a visit number 17 of our clinical study which is called plis and in which parameters are measured on on these bio samples and there you can see we have we have samples that are in a freezer and we have a visit which is kind of a yeah patients come to a visit in a University Hospital and there are experiments performed on these bio samples so it's pretty much connected data and this is the query to the database we have our clinical study place here and we got different patients in red that you can see and with these patients these patients go to a specific visit here purple and in these visits we have different experiments that are sometimes repeated so for example they go to an MRI em so like magnetic resonance imaging or they are measured in terms of their height or weight or how old they are sometimes in a visit and they they got they do take a urine sample or a blood sample and according to the sample and we have some parameters that are measured and for example here in the blood we measure the glucose level in on different time stamps and so we have time series data for for specific patients another query that we can that we can realize is because we couldn't our database our new 4j database to another new 4j database from a little startup company called knowing this is the logo here and what they are doing they have a graph of roughly 800 million nodes and edges where they connect different that's a life science entities like genes or proteins we have different metabolic pathways we have what else do they have metabolites these are small compounds that affect these other molecules here and we connect this near for data database in order to in order to query different molecules from different species and I hope I can explain it well to you what what we trying to answer there when we start on the left side we have a human patient that has some genetic variations it's called a snip SNP and in the public databases they have roughly a hundred of these so-called snips that can cause diabetes and these snips have to be these are positions in the genome that have to be mapped through different databases here so we met two genetic database and from there we mapped to a metabolic database and from there we map to different enzymes these are little proteins and these molecules here they are connected to even smaller molecules here in red and that are interesting now because when we come from the other side from our animal model where we can do experiments that we cannot do in humans we can measure these small molecules here that we have in in a in a diabetic pig or so and we can map those identifiers back and build a so-called joint and this is what's interesting for us in this example we ended up in seven small molecules that are overlapping between a diabetic Pig and a diabetic patient and what we can do now is we can identify those set those seven metabolites and these small molecules and do experiments with it and maybe we can do some predictions a very new prototype we build according to natural language processing that I guess most of you have heard about it so we want to understand large amount of texts and so that we can learn from these texts and and gather information and one example here is that we have a database with 30 million scientific texts it's called PubMed and where we have yeah out comes from from basic research from medical research and these texts are usually quite long as of between four or twenty or thirty pages and they are very complicated to understand and there's much going on as I said 30 million publications and usually when when the people are or when our researchers want to query this database they look for diabetes and obesity and usually what they get back is like 30,000 articles that they should usually read and of course nobody is able to read 30,000 articles and what we want to try now is to automatically understand what's going on in these scientific texts like is it is it talking about genes or a disease or a specific animal model or whatever and we we try to build connections between these texts and when we have a look on the right side we have a text here in purple that is described by a certain amount of keywords and you see that between different texts there are overlaps here in these nodes and they are over living in keywords and this is what what we are doing with graph aware and one of the long-term goals is to understand scientific texts between diabetes and maybe cardiovascular diseases like stroke or heart attack or also between diabetes and Alzheimer's and so we try to find the connections between different disease areas I want to I don't want to overload you with too much of this scientific information that's why I just wanted to be briefly give you some some take-home messages and so in in our scientific field we are moving from this classical relational databases towards a more sophisticated solutions also with the data model so this is obviously graph technology and with this we are enabling not multi comics but multi-omics multi of mixed data analysis and so that we can connect different research areas just a just to to think Anya and Tim so this is this is my teeth so we are three people that are managing this database and I can maybe give you a short a short glimpse of what we can show you from the neo4j database for example when we click here on studies from the chat so this is from you Lee the question is how do you get the publication of data did you pass the room somewhere or do you link to the publications after the research is conducted so the database PubMed is yeah publicly available mostly we are getting the abstracts so like a short summary from the text but we also get the full texts as a as a database dump several gigabytes and what we are starting now is with together with graph aware and to analyze analyze these texts and bring them in in this form of the keywords does that answer the question yeah I think so there the live student behind where we are so I guess we'll find out in a sec okay yeah I think that was are they more questions before I before I give you a little glimpse on on the on the meta database uh yeah we got a couple more so follow up from that one did you pass all the PubMed data or just the diabetes focus well actually all the text that we get and as I said maybe to switch back to their to their slides what we are trying to do is not only focusing on diabetic research but also on let's say lung diseases so we got lung fibrosis as a complication as a long-term complications from diabetes and so we take all the publications that we get from PubMed can can also be from not from Life Sciences but from I don't know there's something else physics or something and we try to find new connections that we didn't see before yeah so we are not focusing on only diabetes okay and then another question systems from satg does the graph of the patients and research articles will be are the graphs of the patients and research articles linked or are they different databases so we are just starting with graph aware and and I did only a little prototype on my machine so they are not connected yet but in the future of course we want to connect the literature data or the literature connection neo4j database with our results that we have in our organization cool and then we've got another question back to the previous one so it says you have six keywords and then you pass them I guess this is linking back to the today natural language processing question and the different diseases mm-hmm so I guess yes so it's not like it's not a query for diabetes or for cardiovascular diseases what we're doing we're doing it unbiased we are processing all the text that we can get and then our researchers they can query for diabetes and a gene called ABC one or like a phenotype we got mice with green hair and it got ineffective diseases in Africa do we have connection there so these kinds of questions we can we can hopefully answer with this cool we got another questions uh which I guess maybe actually can be answered by your queries in the new feature browser so question is how many nodes and relationships do you have in the database and what's your approach to writing data in and so um as usually the the one database that I usually would try to try to show you is not online right now so here we have an on developers database six-and-a-half thousand nodes and twenty thousand relationships but I must say these are mainly parameters that we measure so I would say six thousand seven hundred parameters roughly or six thousand and they are quite a lot that we measure and what you can do as a researcher as you can go there and and ask the question and maybe we can we can go to the example here what we can do here is we can ask the question what kind of parameters are overlapping between two different clinical studies that we have for example here and I will show you that life one clinical study that we have is the German diabetes study gds and another one which is basically study is live offset which also causes diabetes and these are two different studies and we have different patients in there and now the question is who our dataset to to merge it together and are they have some parameters that we can you know like merge together that we have a bigger dataset and just did a query here and so we are we are jumping from from one study over the visits or the patient's goes to a visit and in the visit several experiments are performed in each experiment different parameters are measured and so this is basically the data model and what you can see here are these what's it like two four six six parameters are measured in both studies and so you can merge these datasets from from different clinical studies this is the the kind of curves you can you can do with the meta database and once you are interested in that you can you can go to the specific responsible and medical doctors and asked for forgetting the raw data yeah does it answer question yeah I mean as far as I'm concerned it does like let's see if I get any any follow-up questions well yeah I guess you can carry on [Music] yesterday's that's basically what I can show you right now and I I have several little prototypes but running on another machine but long long story short and all these little prototypes are built in neo4j and we are you know like making a big puzzle and sticking them together so that we can query through different types of data and can connect our medical doctors with the clinical research and with the animal models in in the basic research field and yeah hopefully we can we can contribute to to to any yeah better prevention or or therapy using it like they'd be writing queries directly and in cipher or would they be interacting like through a UI of some sort so the main users are the medical doctors right now because lots of the lots of these integrated data is clinical data when I showed them the the neo4j database they were quite amazed that this is now graphical you know like not huge excel sheets that nobody understands and has to join something here and there and copy paste and stuff like that so and they were pretty amazed of the visualization tool although the visualization is pretty simple here and when we take some time with the medical doctors they are starting to understand what's the data model and that the data model is very easy to to translate into a cipher query so some of the doctors can can right already some cipher queries we recently tried out the Blum application on top of that so that they can start to write like mark how would you say it like human-like queries yeah yeah and I guess you can also if you had some queries that you're repeating you could you could save those exactly like this shorter sentence to do yeah I do like the idea of a doctor writing side video that's quite cool yeah so they are only a few doctors that again write cipher but they say it's much easier than then yeah like SQL or something like that and so you mentioned like when you were describing this approach like towards the beginning of the talk there you mentioned relational databases and it was was the data previously accessible from a relational database because you've also mentioned spreadsheets I just wondering others oh yeah we have all kinds of data so there are spreadsheets there are paper files from patients there are yeah all kinds of CSV files relational databases just folders of different pictures and then a little text file saying in this picture you see I don't know this and that so there's all yeah everything basically everything so it's a it's wild let's say it like this and so what this database is trying to do is sort of make it easy to search across all these different types of data exactly so so the meta database is is meant to be like like we say yellow pages like you can ask where is the data and who's responsible for that and what's the kind of content that we have let's say for specific clinical studies so can I use the data can I use it for another purpose and usually you you you just use the phone and call the the medical doctors do you have this and that data and they say no oh yes or maybe and so it wasn't transparent enough and and that's why we introduced the metadata base as that we can query the data itself so the datasets between the different locations and between the different disciplines and we are now starting another graph with raw data from from time serious so when we measure glucose data or other kinds of clinical parameters and we are trying to find patterns there so yeah and I guess I guess this might be a question with a few people on but we have at least one person asking like if they want to get in contact with you to talk about your work and the way other people do what's the what's the best best way to do that um so on a technical side it's pretty easy just drop me an email or or connect wire LinkedIn or you can find me when you google my name and then we can exchange about the ideas or how we get to this specific model and this and that I often get some questions can we get the data and this is not so easy to answer so since we are Federal Institute and we have patients data it's not that easy to get data to query the neo4j database you know like to to get information in general and to get in touch with our organization I guess this is possible yeah so is there even the one that you and I have been interactive oh yes yes yes we can okay we've got some more questions um I think I think you may have asked us answer this one before we can try again and so what were their nose relationship counts on the production database thing he said it was I was a production database was roughly a hundred thousand or something like this it depends on when you ask this question because we are integrating more and more data and since we're only three people you know like it's ongoing work so it grows okay and then so this is sort of another follow-up question how often do you update the database like are you putting new stuff in every day or is it yeah so unfortunately the production server is not running right yeah but usually I wouldn't say days but I would say like every second or third week or so we are integrating some some new data and then we're trying it out and then we are talking to their to the medical doctors and to the basic researchers and see if they like it if they like the data model then we are kind of adjust the data model and try to write more efficient Kerra stuff like that so it's growing slowly yeah and then the second part of the question is about the NLP library so the question was did you create your own one which I think the answer is no but maybe you can shut you could share this idea came on a conference where we talked about several publications and and then I said yeah I can't read all the publications so I have to try to find a solution for that and then I saw a graph aware with with the NLP technique and I just tried it on so there's a free like tutorial that you can do on github and you can input your text there and let let it run and so we are now working together with graha we're on you know like as I said on these several million articles now so it we didn't develop it ourselves cool hopefully that answered that that question I don't think we have any more any more questions at the moment oh yeah we think you may have uh how do you research his interface with the data so I think that was what we talked about before that some of them arriving cyber queries and some of them are using Oh bloom right yeah exactly cool a new question do you still have something for the last one oh yes maybe also to answer this question some some researchers if they don't have a specific question but they just want to browse for dataset so what do we have in the organization especially when they are new and they just go to the browser and click there which is okay but you know if you have several thousand nodes and and and relationships and at some point it gets messy and then they are starting to to do cycle queries and get in touch with me and yeah so in the beginning they do a little bit of clicking and it's really nice because you have this visualization and you can do screenshots which you can use in your presentation so this is mainly the at the first how do you say the first connection to the database base discovery DVT is new clusters no just large amounts of nodes and relationships okay no you but I guess given you said this size was like in the hundreds of thousands of okay it's reasonably easy to fit a lap dinner on a single machine yeah so this is pretty much on a on a single machine we get six cores 128 gigs of RAM several gigabytes of of SSD so it's not a problem at all and and as I said so these are the this is the small database with just the metadata so we have yeah a hundred thousand nodes easy when we start to integrating integrating raw data it gets much much bigger another question do you use the community or enterprise version of the graph where an LP stuff if you've got that for you can you repeat the question do you use so the question is do you use the community or Enterprise version of the graph yes so we started with the community edition but we changed one and a half years ago to the enterprise yeah I mean I guess I guess we can start to wrap up let's people have any more any more questions or any you have any like I thought from the NLP stuff is there any other sort of areas that you're looking to extend the database in the yes so we have a maybe a new researcher coming who's interested in how do you say the pattern of movement that people are doing let's say when you when you look on your Google Maps a time how do you say time line let's say I used the subway to go to work and then I walked for one and a half kilometers and then I took the bike and then I go on holiday and stuff like that so that people are sharing their data and sharing their timelines and we try to integrate that into new for J and do ya grass analytics so how are the people people behaving on movement and how is it related to some clinical data and for example when we have patients and you give them an Apple watch or a Fitbit and are the ones that are that are more supportive are they healthier or not on what kind of diet do they get and and we try to connect this data with health insurance data and that we get so this is a very new field that we also try to integrate now yeah cool that sounds that sounds like a fun I've played around with the timeline dated boys a bit it's a bit of a weird one to write about because you're it's really personal data yeah they're like exposing everything that you do if you like warehouses or your offices where your supermarket is I never I never ended up I still have it just on my machine yeah so these are you know like just ideas how we could how we could study diabeetus because it's closely related to obesity and yeah nutrition sports and stuff like that I always said that the cocktail of evil so physical inactivity and and bad food habits and alcohol this is there you have a cocktail of evil which causes diabetes and on the other hand this is the most interesting the most interesting kind of data you can get right you see that you see we were data people are going to mix almonds people are there Polly's in having alcohol and or are just hanging out on the couch and on the other hand you have sportive ones but they are also am some interesting data points that we see so we have healthy with healthy let's say women that are lean and they have diabetes and we have we say the happy obese we have very very obese people that do not have diabetes and these are not only outliers but they are very interesting to study and obviously you can't give them the same therapy or the same prevention strategy yeah that makes it much much more interesting yeah I guess you would put don't really want to see your timeline if people are working from anyway yeah and my timeline doesn't look good on those days yeah you didn't move it all um we've got a question from CB can you talk about the import of data in turn it's an everyday life to do is it important I guess maybe is it imported using cipher is it some other approach depending on on what collaborator we have and but what how the data looks like so sometimes we have like spreadsheets and that we import why our cipher then we have databases where you have a an API it's really depending on on the data set that you try to integrate yeah variety of different approaches all right so I guess um I guess we can we can probably call it a day there so thanks Alex for coming and presents lesson 5 everybody is watching if you enjoyed the talk don't forget to like it on youtube so that other people can find it and otherwise we'll see you on the next one we haven't got one channel yet but I'm sure we'll get that sorted out that's not a Nazi though thanks again Alex thanks for having me and everyone who has questions just drop me an email um and I hope I can answer that and yeah enjoy evening thanks bye bye
