 thanks everyone for joining today's webinar will be about graphs in retail we're gonna do a brief introduction to graphs and neo4j for anyone who's joining who is not already familiar with graph databases and with neo4j graph database then we'll take a look at some typical data that a retail company might might have across their organization from there we'll dive into a few specific use cases so we'll start with customer 360 which then feeds into recommendations when we talk about recommendations we'll do a live demo as well so we'll see a recommendation system in action we'll then talk about supply chain management and we'll touch on a few other industry agnostic type of use cases that might be applicable in retail as well and then at the end we'll answer as many questions as we can during the Q&A so to start an introduction to graphs and neo4j so most people are familiar with sequel databases sequel databases are tables that it's like excel you have rows every row has a number of columns you put data into that you use sequel to pull those tables out there tabular format quite structured data and you have to do joins between tables to be able to link together different entities the graph database model is is pretty different so in graphs you focus on the connections between data and you organize your data you know from the disk all the way up as entities and the relationships between them so it's designed for working with highly connected very complex data sets with a lot of relationships instead of sequel but neo4j you use a language called cipher and you can see a little example of it down there it's a language specifically designed for working with graphs and connected data so the benefits of working with connected data are many and you know now we're starting to see as data grows the complexity of data grows the number of sources of data grows how important it is to leverage the connections tween your data in the context that gives you so you know it's the the next wave of competitive advantage really and we're already starting to see this will be about using connections and if you look at some of the big early movers and shakers that defined the Internet age LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Google all of these use graphs to power to power their technologies and their services and the great thing about it is and often you know if you're an organization that's been around for quite a while you'll have a number of different data silos different systems in which data lives so your customer data could be in CRM system you might have third-party data market data another system that holds your product data so being able to combine on that data link all that data and understand the relationships between it across all those systems it gives you a really powerful view across your business you can't really get when you approach your data in a siloed way so neo4j who are we we have the number one database for connected data we've we've been around for quite a while kind of created this database genre really we're also number one in terms of production installs customer base overall user base so neo4j is an enterprise-grade native graph database which means we're designed explicitly for graphs as I said it's graphs all the way up graphs from the file system up so it's not a layer on top of another database type it's not something designed to do many things once it's not multi model it's specifically designed for graphs so we can leverage the power of that that architecture that graph paradigm for our high performance where acid compliant so that means you know when you get your data into the database you can trust it's going to be there your data won't be corrupted and it's got security built in developer tools scalability all the things you would expect of an enterprise-grade database you know to work in a live production retail environment so it'll give you a bit of a taste of what the graph looks like before we dive into some of the examples the graph database model is made up of three different things there are nodes so that's what we see here are circles they represent objects or entities in the world usually they're they're nouns and they they have labels so this is just a way of contagion the object labeling it to make it easier to query and work with so here we have two types of nodes two node labels we have persons at the top and we have a car at the bottom nodes can have properties so here we see the node the person node in the upper left his name is Dan he was born May 29 1970 we have his Twitter handle at Dan so those are just key value pairs properties that you attached descriptively to a node the person on the right her name is Ann she was born December 5th 1975 don't have her Twitter handle and that's okay having a label doesn't necessarily imply a schema it's not like a relational database where every row has the same number of columns and if there's no data in that column you have to put in a no neo4j out of the box is a little bit more flexible and allows you to have different kinds of data so it makes it very easy to evolve as more data becomes available as new data sources come online to be able to add that data over time and iterate your data model there are ways though to to enforce schema if that's important for your use case lastly we have relationships so relationships are with linked entities together and what really give the graph model is power so you can see the person on the Left Dan lives with the person on the right and and every relationship when it's saved in the o4j has a direction so that relationship goes from left to right but it's kind of logically impossible for an not to live with Dan if that's true so we don't need a relationship going in the other way we could ignore the direction of query time and just say you know there's and live with Dan to stand live with an it doesn't matter however sometimes the direction is more important we see that here with her example loves it would be possible for Dan to love Anne but for Anne not to love Dan back so here luckily for Dan and does love him but we need the relationship in both directions because love the direction of that relationship is very important then you can see you can also have properties on relationships as well so Anne owns the Volvo and Dan drives it he has since January 10th 2011 so those two components really give the graph its power give us everything we need to be able to model really complex data sets and take advantage of the relationships between entities in a way that's really difficult with any other type of database okay so we'll take a look now at an an overview of the the types of data that a retail company might have so that we can talk about how we can build graphs from that data to drive different use cases so first we have organizational data so this is data about your company documentation you may have internally processes you may have internally information about your facilities maybe these are warehouses maybe their factories maybe their retail stores the places where your business operates you have organizational hierarchy and kind of information about the people that work for you in the departments and how those are structured KPIs and reports obviously this is the information you used to drive your business and make important business decisions and then you have systems and databases your IT architecture your IT structure and kind of where things live what data might live then you'll probably have some product data so you might have information about brands either your brands or brands that you sell product hierarchies so maybe within a brand there's several layers of kind of product groupings and product lines data about pricing how you come up with pricing how things are priced what things are priced promotions so on you might have documentation about individual products maybe that you need to provide to your customers through through a search engine and then there might be processes associated with certain products how they're sold how they're supported their warranties work then there's some customer data so of course you'll have information about your customers their name where they live maybe some financial details some information that allows you to segment them according to kind of various aspects of their profile then you'll have Purchase History so what have they bought from you before if you're a brick-and-mortar store and you might keep track of this through a oil tea card and then of course for e-commerce or online retailers that's easy to track what people have bought through their through their account history and then really interestingly you might you might have some information about the relationships between your customers so maybe you know customers are married or family members maybe you have a social aspect to your business and you know who are friends of who so being able to bring in these relationships when you're looking at customer views and making recommendations can also be really very useful event data these are kind of individual events things that happen so here we've listed a few I you know ecommerce sites might have clickstream data what did people click what did people view what did people search for you know when did people contact you and you know what was the results of that customer contact third party data so I've called this local data often it can be quite interesting to bring in weather data information about what's happening in a particular area is there a sporting game or big event or something like this that you can combine with the rest of your data to make decisions about promotions or what to recommend to an individual of course social media if you know if you yes Twitter feeds about your company or what people are posting on Facebook and how they're interacting with your various social media entities that's very interesting to combine and you know with the rest of your customer data and then of course market data you know what's going on in the market what's popular what's happening to the companies you work with in terms of their business and finally supply chain data so you'll have information about your suppliers you know where do you get your supplies your goods your resources logistics how are things it and information about your inventory so what you have in stock and where so from this sorts of data and of course it's not an exhaustive list and there's other types of data that might exist in retail as well from some of those different components we just talked about we can put together some example graphs to illustrate how you could use graph and your data to power specific use cases in a retail environment so first we'll take a look at customer 360 so this is the idea that you know you have access to all the information about your customer that you know you can access that holistic view you know maybe when you're interacting with your customer and when you're making decisions about recommendations promotions being able to see everything you know about a customer at once is really powerful so here you can see in the middle we have our customer around that we have a number of relationships right and you can see on the right-hand side here we've got the same colors and the same types of data that we talked about in the previous slide so that's how we're grouping everything together so we can make sense of what's going on so we we have a lot of information about a customer in blue right make sense if its customer 360 so we might have some segmentation information if we've done some community detection run some segmentation algorithms classified a customer in a certain way then we'll know what segments they belong to and how we might be able to approach them based on that of course you can use the graph to to support that segmentation there are graph algorithms for community detection that run natively on okay it's part of a free package of graph algorithms that we've written and published so you can do community detection on your graph based on what things are connected to it so it can be a really powerful way of extending your existing segmentation then we have contact details and contact preferences so this is really important of course in the context of gdpr and a lot of other data privacy initiatives not only do you have information about how you can contact your customers their address their phone number their email you have to know how they want you to approach them and when so do they want marketing did they want email do they prefer SMS so we have some address information so this customer ships the two addresses maybe a home and work address and we can see they're also related to another customer who's a family member there's and ships to the same address so you can start to infer even if you don't explicitly know that someone is a family member of someone else you can start to infer types of relationships from the graph right so if we know these two people shop at the same address what based on what else you know about them you know you might be able to infer are they partners are they roommates or at least they know each other and you can connect them in the graph and look at them look at that relationship we have the similar here with friends and then we get into shopping basket information who's bought what so you can see the customer has a number of shopping shopping baskets that they've bought there's some SKUs that we're in there there was a promotion on one of them we can see we also know this customer tweeted about that SKU about that product that they bought so we're starting to see kind of interesting pattern where they've they've bought something that was on a promotion they then tweeted about it we can also see this to support contacts about that product to that order so maybe we would need to know if that suite was positive or negative look at the look at the results of that support contact to understand you know if there's anything else we need to do in this situation or if there's something about this product maybe that it would need to be addressed if there's a pattern of this sort of behavior let me can see there's there's some interesting stuff going on here as well so from another one of their shopping baskets that customer bought this SKU they also raided and they had searched for it so it sounds like this customer really kind of wanted to buy this and could have been fairly happy with it and then we see their friend and their family member also had shopping baskets and that those shopping baskets also had that SKU so it would be interesting to know if there was an order that this happened in did the friend and the family member buy that item after the customer did after it was rated and then we can start to think about whether or not this customer might be an influencer right did these people buy this product on the back of a recommendation from that particular customer how many other people as that customer connected to and then you can start to consider whether this is a really influential customer in your graph whether you need to you know go above and beyond to make sure that they stay happy maybe offer them special promotions things like that and then to wrap it up up here in the upper left we have some web web channel information so what did the customer view what items were on those pages so that we can again maybe think about you know if they're looking for the same types of items maybe but not putting anything in their basket maybe it's time to send them a promotion for for something along along the lines of what they were looking at and finally we have a store location that that customer visits so you know obviously I think a real customers graph would be probably more complex than this and then certainly have a lot of different data points maybe lots of shopping basket slots promotions this I think gives a good idea of how you can you know how you can take a look at everything you know about your customer from all the different systems that might be in and that one holistic view and what sorts of things you could then do with that data so could you use the bat graph to improve customer experience absolutely you know when you have access to all the information about a particular customer when you're interacting with them that gives you a lot of power it gives you a lot of ways in which you can delight your customer so you can follow up on on open tickets you can talk to them about you know maybe you know there's a special promotion you want to give them so you know maybe some extra rewards and a membership program there's lots of ways that having that information can inform decisions you make about how you interact with your customer and make that interaction a better one for them can you help can the graph help you determine customer lifetime value absolutely so when you when you have that view of your customers behavior you can start to predict what they're likely to do if you see a pattern or behavior they buy you know certain things that is some time of year maybe you know that's birthday time you know you can start to infer you know didn't have children or partner do they splurge a lot of Christmas you know being able to predict what they're likely to do based on what they've done before can give you that view of customer lifetime value and again can inform decisions about how you interact with that customer and conversely can you spot and prevent churn using the graph yes so as you start to identify patterns in the graph that lead up to churn events a loss of a customer things like first they bought something that means we did about it then they contact to support about its ways when you can see that pattern of behavior then you can predict who's likely to turn or who might turn as that pattern appears and you can start to become proactive in preventing that churn rather than just analyzing it as a KPI after the fact and finally we talked about spotting influencers in your customer base absolutely and again the graph I'll go can be really handy here if you know about connections between people there are a number of centrality algorithms between the centrality PageRank things like this that can help you score people in your graph entities in your graph how central they are how important they are in your graph and then you can again start making decisions about how you treat those influences and what extra value they might bring to your business next is recommendations and this is a really big use case for graphs and for neo4j some of it depends on a bit of that customer 360 view that we just talked about um so that informs this to a certain degree we can see here again we have our customer and we'll start by looking at a very typical I think way of approaching recommendations anyone who uses an e-commerce site we quite familiar with with this approach so collaborative filtering basically what we do is we take one customer let me take another customer we compare what they had in common in their shopping baskets right so our customer here is browsing they have a shopping basket with three things in it but they haven't yet bought any they haven't bought yet they haven't they haven't paid they haven't checked out so if we want to make recommendations what else they might want to add to their shopping basket a very natural thing to do is say you know other people who bought the things that are in your basket also bought these other things so here we see this other customer has a shopping basket with two things in common with our customer and then two things not in common so we could recommend those things that weren't in common as potentially interesting to our customer to add to this to add a bit more context we can see that this customer has a family member who previously bought one of the items that our other customer also bought so maybe that particular item that shares the relationship between this other customer and our family member is the most interesting thing that we could recommend so we can add even more color to that so what do we know about that SKU you know what's our margin on it what's the price that we present to the customer what's its rating do lots of people like it how many do we have an inventory and what are the shipping options so all of these things combined together can help inform how you rate things how you order things and your recommendations right so if this particular item is high margin is you know in a price range you think is reasonable for this particular customer has a high rating inventory it looks good maybe you have a lot of it and you'd be happy to get rid of some and the shipping options you know align it's not gonna take six months to ship then maybe this is a really good recommendation to make great so you can start not only taking those relationships between people into accounts but also some of the details about individual items and so you can make business decisions about prioritizing margin maybe you know if you had a lot of inventory you want a shift all of these things can come into play as you're making an ordering recommendations additionally we have some product hierarchy information so this item this SKU is in a particular product line which belongs to a particular brands maybe we have some external marketing information about these things if there's other SKUs that are in that product line starting to understand is you know is this a popular item you know right now are these companies doing really well or conversely you know I press about them in the news right now are they in trouble are these items becoming unpopular all these things can be taken into account as well coming back to our customer and their shopping baskets so we can see there's some other information we have there's another item that's in there and we can see we've got other SKUs that's related to one it's related by a completed by relationship and the other one is with frequently bought with so these are additional ways of helping us understand what we might want to recommend so if someone is buying a pillow maybe they need a pillow case right so the pillow case would complete their purchase or if you're buying a television maybe you need some additional HDMI cables your HDMI cables would complete your purchase so that you have everything you need and of course frequently bought with again might might take the same approach look at what things are bought together there frequently you can use machine learning offline to calculate this to understand why items are frequently bought with other ones and then you can feed that into the graph so that you know when someone is browsing or has added something to their carts what other things people typically we can see this customer has previously bought some other items so you probably don't want to include those items in your recommendations to them I've already bought it and it's a big one-time purchase you don't want to recommend a TV to someone a week after they bought a TV from you it's kind of a waste of an opportunity just not very clever so we can as we're starting to understand what things we might want to recommend using these other factors that we just talked about we can start to understand also why have they previously bought in therefore what should we exclude what do we not want to recommend and then there's you know segmentation information so what items are popular with the customer segments that your customer belongs to so for example I'm a gamer so you know any retail organization I interact with know that by the number of games I buy and therefore when a new game comes out and that game skyrockets in popularity with other gamers then that would be a wise recommendation to make to me we can see what what web pages this customer has viewed what items we're on those pages so again we can start to make recommendations about things they previously viewed but didn't buy so we can tell they were you know looking into a stereo system to go with their new TV but never bought one but that might be something we want to offer up to them and again down here we have some social media activity what do you know about your customer outside your direct interactions and locality data so where does this customer live what's happening there you know is it the one week of the year when it's really sunny in London and should you recommend some cream to them you know is it skiing season you know have you being able to use local information about where your customer is to also inform those recommendations so we're going to drill into a couple different types of recommendations specifically because this is such an important use case for retail so we've talked about product recommendations you know when someone's looking at something what else might they want to buy to be able to you know increase the size of their basket and their overall so there's promotions which is similar in many ways but quite distinct although some companies are doing both you know across multiple channels so this is you know maybe giving someone a coupon when they're leaving your store to to entice them to come back something that's relevant to what they've bought or what their interests are or maybe this is helping you to decide what to to put on promotion in your store so I heard an interesting story once an analytics team was working for a retailer on the east coast of the US kind of well the regional division of that beto and they were doing some analytics and they were trying to figure out you know one of the questions they wanted to figure out was you know what do we need to stock when there's a big weather event when there's a hurricane and and of course there's a number of things that are just completely obvious right everyone needs water everyone needs bread batteries you know there's there's kind of a set of things everyone knows you're gonna need but what what is it that sells aside from that and interestingly what they found was that when you filtered out all those other things the most popular items were beer and strawberry pop-tarts which maybe makes a lot of sense I don't know but you know then they were able to put those things out promotion get more of them in stock so they use their data to recommend to them you know what they should do in the case of this weather event which I think is really interesting and then finally logistics so how can you choose amongst all of your shipping options you know what is the best route to get something to a customer and there might be a number of definitions for best it could be shortest it could be cheapest it could be easiest being able to take all the information you have about logistics and about the route to your customer and make an intelligent decision about how to how to ship goods to your customer and of course the the really promising thing about this is being able to do it across channels right so being able to power recommendations for an app if you have one being able to power recommendations on your website being able to power recommendations in your brick-and-mortar stores and being able to do that in real time across channels so if someone's on your hat one minute and they're on the website the next you want to be able to carry over that context you want to have to wait until tomorrow and you've done a batch import from a data warehouse because then it's too late you've missed the opportunity so being able to do that in real time live across channels is something the graph would excel at and you know for J certainly already does in production scenarios and the only do you need to do this across all your channels you need to do it at scale you need to do it for all your customers seamlessly which is really the promise of the graph so can you use the graph to improve sales with better recommendations absolutely and we've seen this the better your recommendations you know it's kind of self-explanatory that the better your sales you can expect to be can in the graph help you make real-time recommendations across channels absolutely near for J is designed is a real-time database as I said it's an enterprise-grade asset database designed for these real-time scenarios so you know real time not just in being able to respond with the recommendation in real time the end users experience of real time but also being able to deal with the real-time data as I said coming in across channels and being able to make those connections and update the graph gain that additional context in real time can you integrate your recommendations graph with AI or machine learning techniques absolutely you can use the graph both as a data set to input into these sorts of tools or as the place to store the output of them so I mentioned before frequently bought with that sort of thing being able to understand how often being able to score how often things are bought with one another understand those kind of behaviors between features and then persist that in the graph so that you can then use that to serve your real-time recommendations because you can't do machine learning in real time and can the graph help with other types of recommendations besides products yeah so we already talked about logistics and how you can make recommendations there they're you know recommendations for content if someone is searching on your site of maybe looking for something about a particular product or a particular product line being able to recommend to them the most appropriate documentation or the most appropriate part of your site for them to go to the highest-rated recommendations working in that sort of scenario as well so now we'll take a look at a quick demo you okay so here what we see is kind of a representation of a retail retail site we'll start with a clean slate so we haven't added anything to our basket we haven't looked at anything in particular so these are just kind of generic sets of recommendations popular products and popular brands so this what you would get if someone just you know just started at your site you don't have any information about them maybe they haven't logged in or if they haven't started browsing anything if you don't have any basis at all for making recommendations this is the minimum that you want to want to do and the way we power this so this is neo4j recommendations framework what we do is build a few different engines for powering different sets of recommendations so this lets you do the sort of thing we just saw we have multiple rows or multiple areas for holding different kinds of recommendations but it also lets you do things like a be testing you can set up two variants of a particular recommendation approach see which one does better which one converts better turn that one into your production one you know put maybe put another challenger up against it and iterate that way by running different engines on different users and seeing what happens so we can take a look you know popular popular products the way that the recommendation engine works there's a few phases that you go through and this is kind of quite logical in approaching recommendations so first you start with a discover phase discovery is when you find the initial items that you want to recommend right so here you don't have a real retail data real purchase data so we're mocking it up basically you start by pulling back the the nodes that you're interested in discovering then you go through the boost phase so boost is when you start making decisions about reordering things which should be the first which should be the second the third based on some scoring criteria so again this might be margin you want to boost things at a high margin maybe you want to boost things that they're very high in stock maybe you want to boost things that are part of a particular promotion there's any number of ways that you might choose to boost things that you found during your discovery of his then there's exclude so there are things you might not want to show in your recommendations so a good example would be like what I said before about excluding things that someone may have previously bought I'm somebody just bought a TV you probably don't want TVs in your recommendation so you can exclude in particular items for different reasons and then there's diversity phase so diversity is when you kind of introduce a few different things mix it up a little bit introduce some serendipity to see if you know you can entice your customer to buy something maybe they're not they're not looking at something unrelated and this could be a popular item it could be particular things that you have on promotion and you really want to push so you know you insert then 20% of the time it's a recommendations list another good good way to look at this is you know if someone is looking for a stereo and you present them with 20 different stereos it can be really hard to choose amongst those 20 right you get overloaded by the choice and therefore you kind of get frustrated with all the recommendations so using serendipity you can introduce you know different things to alleviate that right so maybe you only want to show five stereos and then you show some related things some other technology things that are popular to mix up your recommendations so those are the four phases here we only have Discoverer phase four for popular products and popular brands what we do is our initial discovery and then we boost based on popularity so that's how we order the popular brands here okay now if we take a look at some of these items we drill into one so we can see here we have the details of this particular canon lens telephoto lens we can see one of the ratings here someone gave this quite high rating now we can see there's some different information here right so we can see products with similar categories so these are items that are related to what we clicked on you can see there's a lot of lenses and lens caps and things like that other users also liked so these are things that the people who gave this five stars other things they gave five stars two other things that they liked popular products again pretty much the same as we saw before I think and popular brands right so those haven't really changed what has changed is that we now have products with similar categories and other users also liked which is bringing in the context around this particular item that we looked at and using that to drive a completely different set of recommendations so we can take a look at the cypher for that so similar categories is pretty straightforward we find the the categories that are in common between different items and then we return them and we also score them based on how many categories and collaborative filtering this is you know what other people also liked so here are things that other things that they bought so people who bought the item you're looking at also about this what they also viewed so you can see here where we're adding a score so when we find the items that other people bought that they bought at the same time is buying this one we scored that as five because that's that's a pretty strong correlation other things those people viewed is a lower correlation right so we give that a score of one so it's interesting that people view two other things when they view this item maybe they were comparison shopping between other lenses but maybe they were looking at completely unrelated things so it's interesting but it's a lower score bought together is obviously it's quite high and here we're not using this but this is also like I said the the ones that were rated highly so this is all discovery phase but we build into this the concept of scoring automatically so that's a taste of how many o4j can do recommendations and you know obviously do them in real time all of this is calculated in real time based on on what I click and once in the graph right so if we chose something different than the the in the the lens we might get different recommendations right so products for similar categories we don't see lenses anymore now we see computers right so it's all being done in real time based on the context in the graph and if that was being updated in real time with purchases and pageviews then our recommendations could change in real time based on what we're seeing in real time okay so we'll talk about one more one more use case and this is supply chain supply chain management right so we're looking at a particular item really so we've got a particular item it's UPC which would be used as kind of the universal code from all the suppliers and then here's our ski which would be our internal reference so with we can look at the different suppliers that we get that item from here we have two and then we get into a bit more detail on this supplier over here right so we can understand what shipping options might be available from that supplier can you get it quickly is it expensive have we had any previous shipment issues what events are related to the supplier you know even things like arguments over payment or you know issues of a new in contracts or whatever and here we have the contract and service screen information as well what country is that supplier based in which of course you might have to take into account if new tariffs are coming in inline or if they're shipping problems or arrests in particular country how that might affect your your ability to get the things you need the products for you and then you know of course again market data so what is the market saying about the supplier are they in good shape you know is it is it in your best interest to continue working with them or you know should you maybe consider getting these from another supplier and then of course you know crucially of course we know the cost from that supplier all right so that's how we can start to calculate margin use that to make our recommendations and also to do some of our reporting here we see information about our organization right our facilities so that UPC is an inventory at this particular warehouse that's also this store location we have some sale information about it so how much is it sold at that particular location how much is it likely to sell at that location so that we can start to predict demands and how much we should we should order next how much we should have in stock or can we get it from the warehouse and then again there's some locality data about individual stores so again my example about the Hurricanes on the East Coast you know is there things are there things going around locally around that store that might influence both your ability to get things in as well as how much you might need you can start using this additional data and this context on the graph to make this reasoning about where when and how much you you buy from individual suppliers so can you use the graph to help you improve your ordering and procurement process absolutely even just being able to have a view of all your suppliers and their relationships and the data about them and what they supply you that in and of itself can sometimes be difficult to achieve across lots of different data sources where there might be different kinds of touch points Excel files or emails or whatever can the graph help you save money on orders absolutely so we have a lot of customers not even just in retail but more generally who use neo4j for supply chain management to help them you know optimize their orders being able to know when they have to buy in bulk so they're not taking a siloed view of their need across different business lines or across different business entities but instead having a holistic view of how much they need you know all in one go so that they can drive better bargains when they purchase individual things can you optimize your inventory using a graph absolutely so when you have a view of your inventory where it lives and how that matches against expected demands then you can start to make decisions about how much inventory you should maintain where that inventory should live so being able to optimize not just your supply chain but your own inventory and we're you know being able to reduce your costs by carrying less inventory by needing less facilities if you could start to picket to need versus demand a supply their system in and then can the graph help you with comparative analysis of your supplies in their products yes so again having that holistic view of all of your suppliers understanding your terms what issues you might have had with them in the past cost any geopolitical risk then you can start comparing suppliers and making better decisions about which ones to work with so just briefly some other use cases for graphs that might not just be retail specific but may be applicable to your business so identity and access management this is understanding you know access rights maybe not just for your customers but especially internally who can access what data who can access what system you know who needs what documentation you know in multinational you know multi-tiered organizations Identity and Access Management could be very complicated infrastructure and network management so the graph is a very natural way of modeling infrastructure so where your your IT estate lives how things are connected together what applications and what data live on individual servers and how do those how do those things fit together and have this data flow or on your system can be extremely valuable for large organizations with significant idea states master and metadata management being able to understand all of your data how its described what your intelligence are where it lives how it fits together you know what what is your reference they don't know how does not fit together all of this is a very good fit for the graph as well and then of course regulatory compliance especially when you're looking at customer 360 use cases and sort of thing GDP are you need to understand how data flows between your systems if someone chooses to be gotten by your company then you need to know where their data lives and how to delete it you need to know on the day you have about them so that you can report to them if they ask for it so the graph can power all of this can really help you understand how data fits together across those silos so that you don't have to go to 15 different system owners and ask them if they have some data about your customer you know you have that map and then it's important to understand you know we've been talking about some very small example graphs individual customers very small slices of their data for the ease of demoing but really the power of all this is when your data looks like this when you have really big datasets lots of customers lots of products lots of transactions and still being able to do the things we talked about the things we saw on our recommendation demo at that scale in real time and that's what neo4j brings quickly to look at some case studies real world production case studies for neo4j so first we have Walmart Walmart uses neo4j to power online recommendations you know it can it can do this at scale and of course with high availability which is really important for these sorts of use cases all right if your recommendation engine becomes unavailable you can't make recommendations to your customers then they'll have a poor experience your website might not render properly I overlooked a mess but also you know you're missing a huge opportunity because recommendations do drive additional revenue that's all wasted you know wasted opportunity then there's another top-tier US retailer who moved to neo4j to really power its real-time promotions engine and it does this across across channels so both online and retail in in sync like I was talking about before and really they found near 4j was was the only way to be able to do this right you can see here they have more than 35 million daily transactions each of them you know the graph query is 3 to 22 hops or 3 to 22 relationship as long and and neo4j there's 90 percent of those in four milliseconds or less so you know they've been able to to run a cyber monday or Black Friday peak volumes promotions online and in their traditional retail channels real-time promotions using info changes really exciting really good and then finally Robi which is maybe not a traditional retail company in the way we might think it's a price comparison website so they have used neo4j to develop they call whole customer understanding so it's very similar to the customer 360 use case that we talked about take all the information they know about their customer and this can even include kind of how much they're spending every month on a water bill or our electric bill and then they can start making recommendations using their price comparison platform to individuals right so maybe if they see that your electric bill has suddenly gone up maybe they could find you a better tariff or a better offer with the company that you're with so using the whole customer understanding and developing that that customer 360 view to really you know Drive what I think is quite innovative right being able to make those sorts of really intelligent recommendations based on all the data they have
