 Okay I thought it might be easiest if I did a Screencastify video on how to do this. On how to add charts to a google sheet like this. So I'll show you what I have been doing. I'm going to add another one for objective 5 even though I have already done one. I'll just show you how to do it that way. To do that you are going to highlight all of objective 5 here. All of the boxes I just clicked on I’m going to click and drag to highlight them. Once I have them all highlighted you will select insert and then you are going to select chart and once you insert a chart it will pop up like this and of course there is no data in that set so that's why nothing is appearing here but if there is data it will be charted on this right here in this no data area. So, if you want to make sure that it's on a tab at the bottom you go to the right corner to the three little dots and click move to own sheet and it will have moved it to its own sheet. When it does that it is going to move it to chart 7 right now. You can rename it by right clicking on your computer and renaming it. I like them in order so I would click on it and drag it as far over to the right and drop it where you want it. I hope this helps.
