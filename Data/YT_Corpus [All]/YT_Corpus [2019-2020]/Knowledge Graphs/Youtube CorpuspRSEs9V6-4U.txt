 [Music] all right good afternoon it's my first time in Mexico City so I'm very excited to be here with you I wish speak about knowledge graph in action because there is the word action I have 0 slide so is everything live demo maybe we can start with what are knowledge graphs which is actually a very controversial topic because nobody knows what our knowledge graphs we all have our own explanation of what is a knowledge graph so if you go to Wikipedia you have one explanation Google has its own explanation and every I company has explanation about what is a knowledge graph so I will give my explanation of a knowledge graph it's actually the definition of your business your domain the problems you have and the solutions that you're trying to put in place to solve those problems to me a graph is a good representation to expose domain solutions and problems and the fundamental aspect of expressing a domain for us is a schema of course you heard that new Fugees key - but your domain can have a schema right so you have to express actually what you are what you know what you want to know etc so for the demonstration today I will take some news from the web like here BBC news for example but it doesn't matter it can be any data right so it's just a demonstration so I will Express what is my time in what I know so I will take those news and actually my domain now is a note news all right I can say that this note has an ID for example has a title and has some text for the sake of beauty I can even put an icon on this note in a color so up to now this is my dummy all right and I will create a knowledge graph based on this domain based on my schema so I create a new knowledge graph let's say demo Mexico the schema I'm gonna use is the team of schema and I will import some data I will give a set of news that I downloaded from the internet because I'm doing big data I will import to news so I imported on my filesystem some data actually if you want to know what it looks like it's a JSON file so I scraped the website put the text into JSON and I uploaded those files to the system okay then actually I want to take those Jason's and transform this into a graph structure very very complicated graph structure because we have only one node right so I have my news here so I want to say that the URL of the article becomes my ID because generally it is unique it's not always the case but because sometimes you have those parameters very fancy the title becomes the title and the text becomes the text and now I would import my data so you can see on a big data set is going pretty fast right so and now this is actually a knowledge graph to news but this is very very sad right because those two notes even are not connected there is no relationship it's a knowledge graph right a node is a graph but there is no relationship so what what can we do actually to extend the knowledge that we have about the data we know it is textual data so we know there are things inside the text that we are interested in right persons organizations locations names of diseases things like this so we want to extend this game the domain the scheme so we go back to the schema and we say okay maybe I can use some tools to take the text and extract information from the text so taking our structured data and outputting a structure from the text right so let's say we start with I want to find persons in the text so I create a person in my knowledge graph here and the person must have a name okay and then I can create a relationship okay between the news that mentions a person in the news this is my new schema and I will do the same for organizations for example organization and mentions organization so how we are gonna do this so we're going to use a tuning that is doing actually natural language processing so how does it work really is you give some text and it returned new things that he knows about the text so for example for this phrase the French president McCrone landed in Madrid for his cottagey visit in Spain the software will return us that French is a nationality president is the title McCrone is a person Madrid is the city Spain is a country so it will give us a list structure that we can use to create new notes and relationships with a graph ok so if we take the same mental path with our graph we go back to a knowledge graph and I just going to delete the data to be sure so if we look back at how we the part of the graph that we could actually create from the data originally here is in blue all right so this is this represents what we could take from the structured data and creates notes and relationships so this is in blue so really the exercise is to be able to create those relationship to define how to create them by using natural language processing so it's the next step in the application so we say ok I want to have to create those relationship into my graph mentions person and to be able to do this I will analyze the text of the news right I will use default English natural language processing engine and I want him to extract person from the text and they will become dimensions of the person so if we take this text no no that one Emmanuel macron here it will become the name on the person note ok at it and I do the same for the organization so I say okay for creating this relationship I will analyze the text in English extracting Organization mentions and those mentions become organization note with a name property into the graph alright so we have this is what we can do with structured data this is what we can do by using natural language processing I will import again the graph okay so where is the stress moment so and so we can see that now the graph has become much more interesting right so we could extract from two news 23 person names and three organizations names and now if we actually see or the graph that we have previously we have those two news but the real interesting aspect is that now they are connected they have connections between them because this news and this dooms mentions the same person and I can show even more this becomes a graph like this we have news and the enrichment of the text that appears as a relationship into the graph and here we have only two documents so you can imagine if you have dozens 100,000 a million documents the graph that can be constructed from this this is another example on Twitter for example so you can see once you can extract persons organizations locations from tweets for example simple tweets I mean this is 1600 tweets so this is nothing the graphs becomes very interesting just by making being able to create new relationships and notes all right now there is a I mean this is easy because you use tools that are trained on Wikipedia dbpedia wiki data newsfeed on the web so it's very easy to extract persons locations and organizations for example it's very easy so there is always some problems because it's very based on linguistics grammar so but I mean you can find this for free on the web but in 99% of the use case you don't want to extract any persons right you want to extract speak things specific to your domain money financial grounds funding rounds or a name of technologies things like this so so we actually provide a tool that helps organisations annotate new data so here is very simple text that is taken from this news actually here from this TechCrunch article and actually you can see that it's very interesting the everything that you can annotate in text that this is an organization that develops the technology that receive a founding that receives some money from a from a founding perspective and actually here the same organization competes with another organization so and the goal is to provide not one but two hundred three hundred documents for example with examples and try to really create new capabilities in your organization for being able to create because everything you see here will become nodes and relationships into your graph because the language is a graph if I take the same text here but I add more things you really see that actually the language itself is a graph the grammar of English and any language Spanish Arabic whatever is actually a graph it's a dependency between words and the words have additional labels to describe additional information all right now in base of action it is really cool we can visualize the graph we can search so I can open the graph here and search for Emmanuel macron and then you double click and it will show new nodes and relationship I can even double click that one and the program most of organizations face is that they will arrive to the point of visualization it's nice generally it makes a very cool effect because graphs are news to some organization seeing the connections you it's really reveal new information on new connections that you didn't know oh this person is connected to that person it's crazy how then you can see it but at the end you want to to be able to be more efficient or do something that is not provided by the products on the market for example and so we I mean we provide some capabilities but then our customers ask ok can I do this can I do this can I do this so we could say I don't want to maintain code for you in my product right so we can say no no no so or we could say yes yes yes and then we have a team of developers very angry so and so we arrived with another solution how can you modify the platform without touching all code how can you can we let you create new features without us maintaining this technical depth in our software so this is what we call very fancy knowledge graph actions what our actions they are actually things that you can add in the visualization you describe them in a small JSON you can even create a cipher so you saw some cipher queries from max before you can even do this in cipher you just store the actions in the database you can do it so let's say that or goal today's here I have my search bar oh wait I will first delete the action ok because you saw nothing here there is nothing except that you can click you can display person organization or news or their relationships so the goal is that I want to add something here that can do something for me so let's say I want to have an input a form where I can type start typing the name of a person and it with autocomplete it will show me your options and what I click I want to show the person and all the surrounding graph ok so this is what we will do so we will create an action here with an ID and this action has input parameters so when we define this it say it has to show a form to the user that he has to fill in and we say ok he has to select a person from a autocomplete and when he selected the person it will execute this cipher query so it will find a person find the news mentioning him and the other persons that are mentioned by the same news he is mentioned in ok so we will just copy this and go to the new photo browser and create a new action right now we refresh our browser because we have to refresh and we have something here global actions global means that you can execute the action without having to select a node or relationship global local the name of the action that was defined in the JSON is show me ecosystem of a person and when I click it ask me select the person so I can start typing ma then it will find all the person starting with MA and I click one when I submit it will find Emmanuel macron somewhere here find the news so it will execute actually the cypher query that we define here and return to graph the new graph like to okay so this is one type of action now I want to say you're not limited to execute cypher you can even call an API that can connect to your CRM for example you can call weather information whatever everything that you can do with cypher or a POC or even writing your own Python application that will serve as returning the information for the action fine now I will take another graph which is a supply chain fixtures graph so we have products order of products countries and products located in warehouse and we created a set of action so here I want to right click on a product and say show me the stock of this product or show me actually the demand of this product over the months for example same thing we create here an action that can return a chart for example so it's the same the cypher is a bit more variables but so it's already created so I will display the product here and I can say ok show the demand for this product or I can display a chart ok amazing now we're going to make something more complex so there is this new information that is returned but the user still has to know the data maybe we want to do something more complex or giving hints to the user based on rules based on information that is in the graph so for this there is an example I mean I want to take a product I want to right click and say ship this product to this country then it should show me an information that I cannot ship this product to this country because it comes from a specific warehouse so the actually the graph will exist because this product has been shipped from another warehouse to this country but you need to show the user that is not possible so same thing oh I will come after we create an action where we have to right-click on a product select the country it will execute the cipher and return the information so [Music] I hope it's the good one so I can say ship product to Germany for example and it finds a path from this product to Germany however there is a small insight happening here that tells me the stock is not sufficient for shipping this product Avenue the inside this is what we call all down knowledge graph insight so knowledge graph actions knowledge graph inside and I can go to the inside and it showed me that it's forbidden all right so we can also return more information so if we click it it will pop up more information but so far the people didn't tell me why the stock is in ship is sufficient so I know that I cannot ship this product right for the chart I want to mention that we found a very interesting way of doing this that of course we don't want to create new code in a software to say now you can return a chart with bars and then we have to create a cell phone you plug in now you can return the chart with a pie chart for example so we actually use a library where we've using the same grammar so from the cypher by just returning clicking on this and checking what type what format you have to return we can actually automatically support all those charts returned from the cypher like that so we can display all those charts by default without having to write too much code ourselves we want you to write codes so of course we can assist you alright okay so this is good I showed you a demo where everything was working right however in let's say 80% of the type people expect magic I'm not a magician but and this is where the problem from their surprise come is when they believe too much in this artificial intelligence magic that it will solve all your problems also there is a thing with artificial intelligence is that I mean I'm an engineer so there is a cool coat recently that on Twitter who says when it's written in Python it's a machine learning when it's written in PowerPoint it's artificial intelligence nobody got it no so so I mean natural language processing is super you can do amazing things but you need to understand language this is why you need also I mean people telling you we have the project that will solve your problem it's it will automatically find you you can pass any text I want to work for them really because I never saw this I will give you a very practical example so I have this text I have I have a a language a 30 inch piece of wood laying in the back of my truck all right so if we come back here are we sorry it's not that one if we come back here there is something that you need to know is that for example here there is the end of the sentence you cannot say hey this is my entity actually we cannot even do in our software because an entity cannot be on - sentence right it's not possible and here because the natural language processing in natural language processing there is language sometimes it can treat this more point here as a sentence separator so it means that you will never be able to understand 32-inch because for him is two sentences and not one sentence and this is a huge problem right because I mean once you want to add a relationship in the same sentence a different sentence it actually mess up all your software so those are the things that you need to know I mean not the business people but it the people I mean not believing all the promises because this is one example example with parentheses slash things like this there are millions of them so this is why you would need always to be assisted by people knowing whole language or natural language processing software will behave based on your data right I can give you another example if we take writers News for example it starts always like this Reuters Google announced the acquisition the acquisition of eBay let's get crazy they have money all right so sorry here named entities Reuters is an organization but if you think you will take this new information and you will put it in your graph what will happen if for example your source of data is writers you will have one rotors note and it will be the most important note in your domain because it's connected with all the news how important is this rotors as a node in your domain no second example I cannot show with the with this but let's say that we want to find relationships between the entities so we want to find the relationship between the rotors and Google between rotors and eBay between Google and eBay so based on the model we have training here for example who is investing in what company for example well these rotors and eBay is a perfectly valid combination actually because the text inside is valid I mean based on examples you've given so you will arrive with a set of information that is irrelevant because it will create automatically in your graph that Reuters acquired eBay but also Google acquired eBay because let's say the prediction score is 92 percent right so you will actually make your new knowledge graph garbage so this is why you need to understand this that there will be always preparation and check there is no thing that can solve those solution except humans all right I think I'm done actually why let's do it we don't take question $5 the question okay $5 the question whoo yes what context Multi emoticons yeah I mean emoticons it is part of our language in a way this is true so you have to turn to other type of NLP software so there are models trained for understanding emoticons but it's mostly based for sentiment analysis for example rather than understanding what is emoticon means but it exists so there are software other train on emoticons in text for example yes so but we it's not really a use case we see often in the industry so five dollars yes like to do this we use a artificial intelligence software so Java and Python and JavaScript also view Jess yep all right take your chica [Applause]
