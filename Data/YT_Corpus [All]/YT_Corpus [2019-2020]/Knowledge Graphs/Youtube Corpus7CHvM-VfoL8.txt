 check out this race between a snail and a rabbit and see if you can tell which one was faster clearly the snail was faster than the rabbit and we could easily tell that because we are looking at an animation but in this video we will see how to put this entire information that both are moving and that the snail is moving faster than that rabbit all of that information in a single picture not an animation but a single picture in physics this picture is called a position time graph and the secret to drawing such a picture is we take photos of this motion at different different moments in time and stitch them together here let's take an example and we'll make a lot of sense but before we do that let's put some markings on this track you can think of these as meters 10 meters 20 meters it would be easy to keep track of location and let's only focus on the rabbit first we'll think about the snail later what we'll do is when the rabbit comes at this position 0 we will pause the video so let's do that so rabbit comes here or pause the video and since time is also very important to understand how fast something is moving we'll have a timer with us and let's say we start our timer from here so right now our timer is zero and when I play this video our timer will start so we'll take our first picture at this moment and we'll keep it to the right so let's do that let's take a picture there it is and since this picture is taken at time T equal to zero we'll put a zero over here somewhere at the bottom oh it's coming on top of the rabbit let's move this thing a little bit to the left excellent now we'll play the video and we'll pause again when the time hits one second so we'll pause for every second and we'll take a picture like this so keep an eye over here when it hits one second we'll pause again there goes past the take another picture and keep it to the right and this picture was taken at one second so let's mark that at the bottom and we'll continue we'll keep on doing this for every second we'll take a picture where it is now look at this picture this picture tells you where the rabbit is at every instant of time for example I know at two seconds the rabbit is at twenty at four seconds the rabbit is at 40 and so because the picture tells me the position of the rabbit at every instant of time this graph is usually called the position time graph sometimes it's also called the distance time graph because it's giving me the distance of the rabbit from the zero mark also before we proceed notice that all these rabbits are lying on a straight line a single straight line that's not a coincidence that's happening because our rabbit is moving in a uniform motion meaning it's having a constant speed and as a result it's covering equal distances every second we'll see if the rabbit is changing its speed then this wouldn't be a straight line all right now notice that we took the photos at every second interval right but there's no reason to do that we could have also taken the photos at every half a second we could have taken photos at 0.5 second 1.5 second 2.5 seconds and if we did that and if you put them over here then even those rabbits will be on that same straight line again because the rabbit is moving with the uniform speed and we can put more photos in between and so if you put photos of this rabbit at every single instant of time and put them all together then we have constructed our position time graph now this is great but how do we draw this on a piece of paper for example I mean writing all of this and drawing all the rabbit is going to take a lot of time right well we can reduce the first of all notice we don't have to write 1020 all the markings everywhere we can just write it once to the left so let's take all of this and put it to the left that's sufficient because now again if I want to know what is the location of the rabbit at three seconds let's say all I have to do is go to three seconds look at where that rabbit is and the marking is to the left so I'll know how it's at 30 meters so great secondly we don't have a drawer Abbot's at all we can just draw a straight line representing all of these rabbits together so let's do that let's get rid of the rabbit and draw a straight line and now that our rabbit is gone we can bring the zero back to where it was supposed to be excellent and we can also get rid of this background that's also not needed and there we have it this is how we draw it on a piece of paper usually we like to draw one axis over here we call that as our position axis because it tells me the positions and we'll draw another line over here and we call that as our time axis and this is how we draw it on a piece of paper again just to be clear for example I want to know looking at this graph what did I wear the rabbit is at say three seconds then I'll all I will do is come to three seconds go up and I'll say the rabbit is over here but where is that to understand that I'll go to the left and I understand aha it's at 30 meters so the rabbit is at 30 meters also another important thing I want to point out is that when I look at position time graphs I should think that this line literally represents the path of an object for example over here I would think that the rabbit is actually traveling this way but that's not what's happening you get it right I mean if you bring back the original picture you see that the line connects the rabbits at different time instants the rabbit is always traveling upwards so this is the path in which the rabbit is traveling this line does not represent the path it's just a connection of the rabbits at different different time instants and now that we understand position time graphs let's see if we can draw on for this me if you go back to our animation what is the difference the difference is the snail is a lot faster than the rabbit but it's also traveling with uniform speed it also has a constant speed which means its graph should also be a straight line but since it's faster it's gonna be a little different so can you pause the video for a while and think about or visualize how different would it be what would be the graph for the snail all right let's do it let's do it the same way we did for the rabbit so let's bring back the racetrack and the rabbits so that will become easier to understand just like with the rabbit when the snail comes to zero that's when we'll take our first picture and in this animation both the snail and the rabbit come to zero together and that's when we call T equal to zero so at time T equal to zero our snail is also at zero so let's take that first picture and put it over here and just like with the rabbit we will take pictures every second so next picture we'll take at one second who notice the snail is much faster than the rabbit so let's put that picture at one second we're putting it under one second again that's played for another second it's now reached at for T so at two seconds it'll be at forty and after this it'll go out of our frame so let's stop over here again notice that these snails lie on the same straight line because it's traveling with a constant speed and again if we were to take pictures in between all of those pictures will lie on a straight line and now we can replace that with a single line and if you bring back our old graphical picture this is what the graph looks like for our snail and what we see is that the graph of this nail is a little bit more slanted compared to that of the rabbit in physics terms or in math terms we say this graph has more slope compared to this one and we say that because if you think of it as a mountain it's not but if you think of it as a mountain which you are climbing then can you see that climbing this we'll be more difficult because it's more sloping compared to this mountain and that's why we say this has more slope than this but anyways this means that in a position time graph if the graph has more slope it's faster if it has less slope it's slower and that's why position time graphs are awesome because just with a glance you can tell which objects are faster and slower alright the last thing we'll do is remember we said that this graph is a straight line only when objects are traveling with the constant speed well now let's look at what happens if they are not traveling with the constant speed if they're not going at a uniform motion and again we'll concentrate on one of them let's look at this nail so let's get rid of the rabbit and let's bring back the snails and the racetracks okay what if our snail doesn't travel with the constant speed but let's say it slows down and stops let's say it look some more like this slows down and stops non-uniform motion how would this graph change well here's how I like to think about it because the snail is traveling slower the distance that it travels every second keeps decreasing so let's say in the first second it traveled 20 from here to here then in the next second it won't travel another 20 maybe it'll travel only another 10 so this will be somewhere back over here maybe in the next second it will travel only another five means it'll be somewhere over here as an example and so on and now notice the graph looks like this which means they're not on the same straight line and again if you were to fill in in between then notice the graph looks like a curve and so this is what the graph looks like for an object which is slowing down and again it kind of makes sense right because notice if you look at the sloppiness of this graph initially it's pretty high if you were to climb this mountain very high slope very high speed but then as you go further notice the slope in s decreases the graph is becoming more and more flat indicating that its speed is reducing and so in short if objects are traveling with a constant speed in a uniform motion then their position time graphs are straight lines and if they're traveling faster they will end up having more slope on the other hand if objects travel with non-uniform speed like this snail slowing down then the graph will be a curve and now I'm pretty sure you can drop position time graphs for all sorts of things like objects speeding up or maybe even going backwards or even the ones which are not moving at all have fun
