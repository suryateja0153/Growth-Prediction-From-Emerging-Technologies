 we are now going to learn more on bipartite graphs in Python now as an always the first step is importing Network X as NX right now I'm going to create bipartite graphs let me tell you how to do that first now network bipartite is not present directly inside networking's like how we did for oil alien and all they cannot do it that way here so what I'm going to do is from Network X dot do you see all these here these are sub libraries right network X dot algorithms I am going to choose this from Network X dot algorithms I am going to import bipartite so in the sub library called algorithms bipartite is present now so bipartite has got loaded I am going to create this graph B let's say as an X dot graph so it was caps so let me do it in next dot graph this way now I am going to add notes to this graph from and nodes from this list 1 2 3 4 & 5 right so this is it and I'm going to tell that bipartite is 0 so this means that this is the first set or the first partition clear you see that and bipartite there are 2 sets right so this is going to be my first set now I am going to again give B dot add nodes I am going to change this list now I am going to give it something like this say a comma B comma C so this is going to be my second set and I am going to name it as bipartite equals one so did you see what I just am added notes one set from this list another set from this list clear now the next step is adding edges V dot added just from I'm going to specify a list now again so it's going to be something like this one comma a and then okay there is a small trouble area one more bracket 1 comma E and then let's say 1 comma B let's say 2 comma C ok and then let's say 2 comma B and then 3 comma let's say C itself and then 4 comma a and then five comma B so these are the edges in my graph and now I'm going to draw an X dot draw B okay we will specify the labels with labels as true so do you see the graph here so this is a bipartite graph with the two partitions 1 2 3 4 5 and ABC right if you probably write down properly as 2 sets like how we have showed in the videos you can verify this then by that method now let us check another graph let me say we are going to verify if the given graph is bipartite or not how are we going to do that let's say J is equal to NX dot path graph and let me say 4 nodes I have created this so what am I going to print print bipartite dot you see we can check various things here so I am going to check is bipartite now so print bipartite dot is bipartite so what are we going to check if this graph G is bipartite or not it says that G is bipartite so a path graph on 4 nodes is bipartite now let me say G path graph 1 let's say 5 vertices let us check if this is bipartite or let me call it as H here ok G itself fine so let it be G now this is also bipartite on 5 vertices now let me consider another graph say H is equal to an X dot star graph on let's say 10 nodes right let us check print bipartite aspect exodus now this is again bipartite so bipartite dot is bipartite is the command where we verify if a graph is bipartite or not let me take a random graph let me say K is equal to an X dot gnm a random graph on let me say let me say 1550 nodes and say 16 edges right now let us check if K is bipartite so how are we going to do it ranked bipartite dot is bipartite of K it says it is not bipartite now let me clear the screen we will now be seeing if we can check if a particular vertex or if two particular vertices are in a set or not what I mean by that if a graph is given and if we see that the graph is bipartite then we can check if particular nodes are in a partition or not in one particular partition you'll be able to understand once I do it now let me say create a graph G is equal to n next dot path graph on let's say 4 vertices so the graph has got created now let me draw that in next dot draw G with labels as true so this is the graph now observe what I'm going to do let me take this set X as set 1 comma 3 if you observe here 1 & 3 these two vertices are not connected hence they will fall into one part I'd set right so we are going to verify that now bipartite dot is bipartite underscore node underscore set and of which graph this graph G and the set X so now this is going to give me the answer if these two nodes 1 & 3 are in a bipartite set or not see it says true so 1 & 3 fall into one part I'd set now I'm going to go ahead and create this set let me say 1 comma 2 okay and I'm going to check if this set forms a part I'd set or not G comma Y see it says false because 1 & 2 are connected and hence these two cannot fall into the same part I'd set I hope with this it was clear to you how we create a bipartite graph how we can verify if a graph is bipartite or not and how to check if particular world Isis fall into one part I'd set up
