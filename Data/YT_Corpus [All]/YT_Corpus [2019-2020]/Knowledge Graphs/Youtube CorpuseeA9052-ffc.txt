 here is an interesting game for all of us to play it is basically to check if two graphs are isomorphic so open your web browser and go to the place where the URL is displayed so this is Safari you can also go to Chrome or Firefox and then type their github dot Anik mickelson dot-com so you just type github.com ickle send.com and then you will see a window appear like this I recently made a graph isomorphism game and a video about it this is the video so if you click on this you can watch the video so I request all of you to watch the video and now here is the game so this person Eric Mickelson has created a website for playing a game on isomorphism so we should thank this person to help us understand this concept better so let us play the game now so play the game you see here two graphs are displayed and you should check if these two graphs are isomorphic so this graph looks isomorphic you can basically pull and push the edges and vertices like this so yes so it says correct click to continue and now these two graphs yes they look isomorphic now correct so do not worry there is our time which is being kept here there is a timer but please do not worry about playing it really fast you must understand the concept so once your game is over you can post your scores on the discussion forum it will be really interesting to see all your scores so this graph is isomorphic you must all play this game on your machines so look here this is a star graph you see but this side is a path graph if I arrange it this way you see this is a path graph so these two are not isomorphic it says correct now let us check this one it is a c3 with a node there's also a c3 with a node it is now you see the graph was initially like this I pull this node and I pull this node to I am going to ask you a question at the end of this particular game so I'm going to pull this and this like this well you must be able to guess the answer this what it says in correct those two graphs were an isomorphic so I told that I will be asking your question right so the question goes like this do you observe that we are able to learn another concept with this game which one is that yes it is planarity right you can observe the number of regions here with these graphs displayed it is very easy to learn the concept of clarity here right now so you can continue playing this game like this there are 25 of 25 pairs which will be displayed you can play all the 25 is going to get tougher and tougher as you continue please play the entire set of graphs check if the graphs are isomorphic and post your scores on the discussion forum please don't worry the scores are not going to be considered anywhere not in your exams or assignment it's just for fun that we get to know about this course
