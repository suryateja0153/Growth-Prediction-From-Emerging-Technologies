 because everyone for joining today for our presentation on graphs in the automotive and manufacturing industry so today we're gonna start with a general overview about graphs and specifically about neo4j for anyone who is new to this area who's not familiar with graphs are familiar with what we do it neo4j then we're gonna dive into an overview of some of the types of data that an automotive or a manufacturing company might have often this will live in different systems and it'll cover different areas of the business and we'll talk about how these can be linked together using the graph then we'll look at some specific use cases some examples of combining that data into a graph so we'll talk about supply chain management I will talk about warranty and warranty analytics customer 360 view and then knowledge graphs and and we'll touch on a few others that are maybe less specific to automotive and manufacturing but would still be applicable in those industries as Alexander said at the end we'll have a bit of time for Q&A so please do ask any questions that you have okay so first our introduction to graphs and neo4j so what is a graph database so we'll define that by comparing it to relational databases which have been around for decades and most people are familiar with so relational databases are table oriented right rows and columns so every row is a thing columns are attributes of those things and then you link together different tables or different types of objects in your database using joins and foreign keys or linked tables so very similar to excel you know kind of very common data storage and processing model and you query that using sequel near 4j it takes a different approach to data so new for J is a graph database and what this means is we focus the connections between data so rather than storing everything in this kind of square shape of rows and columns things are linked together dynamically and directly so there's no joins no linked tables when you write data to neo4j you link it directly to the things that they're related to and then that allows you to understand those relationships and follow them very easy easily very intuitively and you know when you talk about performance at scale on very large data sets and we'll take a look later on some examples of that to really bring that idea of connected data to life and then compared to relational databases and sequel the query language the query language for neo4j is cipher so it looks a little bit different it's specifically designed for working with graph data and the patterns that can come up in that and this this model this graph database approach is really very powerful in today's era of you know lots and lots of data high volume of data velocity of data and high variety of data where you have data coming from all different places or you might have data stored in all sorts of different places in your business different physical data silos on different lines of business being able to combine that data together and understand the relationships you know that are inherent but maybe not very easily visible using a different approach is extremely powerful right and we think that this will drive the next wave of competitive advantage right companies who are taking graph approaches to some of their problems are seeing lots of benefit and we'll take a look specifically at the automotive industry later on about how we can use this connected data to drive that sort of competitive advantage and really get new value out of your out of your data so a little bit about us neo4j is the number one database for connected data we are the leaders in the graph database field you kind of created the category really we are a native graph database which means that's what we do is graphs so from the file system all the way up it's all graphs there's no translation layer there's no different underlying model we store data as graphs we processed it as graphs we present data as graphs and we do that in in the same way that you would expect any other enterprise-grade database to do it so we can do it at scale we can do it reliably so you won't lose your data or acid compliant and it's a very agile environment in which to work so growing you know starting with a small neo4j installation and then growing that is you have more data and more use cases come on is quite easy to do just a quick example of some of the terms of a graph and what a graph database will look like so that makes sense when you look at some of our examples later graph database is really made up of three main elements so first we have nodes and nodes are usually things they're nouns objects and here we're representing them as circles that's kind of a typical way of showing them and we have three nodes and nodes can be labeled so you can give them a label a tag so that you can work with them make it easier to classify them so here we have two types of nodes two node labels we have person nodes two of them and we have one car node next there's properties so properties are attributes of those things there are key value pairs really so you can see the person on the left has a name property which is Dan he has a Bourne property which is May 29th 1970 and there's a Twitter property for that node as well which is at Dan so that's his Twitter handle on the right we have another node the name property for that notice and she was born December 5th 1975 we don't have her Twitter handle and that's okay it's not like in a relational database where every row has the same number of columns and you have to stick a null value value in that column if you don't have a particular property type you just don't add into that node out of the box neo4j doesn't really enforce that every node with label has to have exactly the same properties and the same times and then finally the the real power of all this is by combining these nodes and properties together with relationships so you can see here we have a number of relationships between these two people you can see dan loves and and love stan and then lives with Anne so these show how these nodes are related to each other when you write a relationship to the database in neo4j it always has a direction and sometimes that's important and sometimes it's less so so here we see that Dan loves Ann and that moves in that direction from left to right it's important to know the Ann also loves Dan which is why we have another relationship going the other way it would be possible for Dan's eleven but sadly not for her to love him back which is not the case here however dan lives with Ann again moving left to right it would be possible for for Dan to live with Ann and and not to live with Dan so in that case we don't need a relationship going in both directions it's enough to just just have the one relationship and then we can ignore that direction when we query the data and then you can see as well you can have properties on relationships and not just properties on nodes properties on relationships we can see Ann owns the Volvo at the bottom here and Dan drives that car and he has driven it since January 10th 2011 so that relationship has a start could have an end date any number of other properties as well so those three things nodes relationship and properties are what make up the graph the property graph database model and that gives us everything we need to build really complex and really rich data sets that we can then query to to gain new insights so now we'll take a look specifically at some of the types of data that an automotive company or a manufacturing company might have we are kind of focusing specifically on automotive in this particular discussion as we go through some of these use case examples but I think there's probably quite a bit of overlap between automotive and any other type of manufacturing company we just chose automotive because it's probably easier for most people to understand and gives us something something to go into a bit more detail so first we have organizational data so this would be data internal to your company you know you probably have lots of documentation in your own company processes that you follow information about your different facilities your different factories warehouses and so on you might have an organizational hierarchy not just in terms of people management but also in terms of how different departments or lines of business fit together and interact KPIs and reports quite important you know obviously go to leadership go to the board you know determine lots of important things where lots of important decisions are made on those KPIs and reports so it's interesting to know how that how that data gets generated where it comes from and then there's your systems in your databases your IT infrastructure where data is held where the documentation is held so on and so forth then we have data about products so these are you know the things that you make and you sell they'll have their own documentation and and perhaps their own processes maybe for how you deal with customer contacts or claims or how you build your products then there's the product details so ed you know everything about that product that you know that either your customer might want to know you might want to know you could have a product hierarchy so this could be families of products it could also be brands so you might have quite a complex set up between those things and then there's bills of materials which could almost be a category in itself we could we could do a whole session about those materials I think because they're so naturally a fit for the graph right when you if you wanted to draw a bill of materials all the components to do into a thing how those components fit together it would it would naturally form a graph so here we have Bill's materials alongside the products that you know you can keep track of all the things that go into your various products and of course there can be multiple Bills of materials right so there could be an engineering build materials there could be sales building materials that could be kind of an as is and as was view of the building materials as things are maintained over time or get upgraded so quite a lot of data to be held in there and then we have customer data and this is a this can be a little bit of a tricky one often automotive companies might not have you know manufacturer of cars might not have a direct relationship with many of their customers because those customers will come through a dealer so sometimes you could consider customer data as their party data here we'll look at whatever data you do have about customers or not know what a motive company might have a different set of relationships with your customers that could be personal data it could be a person or it could be a company so in this case you know if we have a company who buys fleets of cars from you and then relationships between those customers so where you might know either persons are related to each other or persons are related to companies you might have a personal customer who works at a corporate customer so and so forth then there's third-party data so we mentioned dealer data you know data about your partners the dealer network that you work with social media posts information you might get you know publicly from Instagram or Twitter or Facebook and then there's market data and this could cover lots of things it could be market data about your competitors it could be press releases and news stories and and so on about you or about your products or it could be information about your suppliers macroeconomic data you know tariff information things like this then we've separated out some specific event data so these are kind of things that happen in time you might have sensor data or telematics theta and this of course is is only growing as you know it's the concept of IOT and attaching sensors to everything really takes off so every time you interact with a vehicle or when your dealers interacts with a vehicle you might have a chance to get some of the sensor data or telematics they guarantee it if you know there's some other way of transmitting that data from the vehicle or from a customer's device there are individual warranty claims these would come through the dealer but as an event in time we'll cut it treat them a little bit separately and then you might have a customer contact so these are calls to your call center or emails or individual contacts between you and your customers and then finally we have supply chain data so this might be information about your suppliers materials or parts there's logistics data so how how these things move about what your options are how long they take costing so and so forth and then I've included here as well inventory data so this is data that you have about parts or materials that you have in inventory facilities you've purchased already and have available to you in in some way whether it needs to be shipped or not okay so this is not a comprehensive list of all the data that our manufacturing or an automotive company might have but it's certainly indicative and it gives us you know enough to then drill into an example of how we might be able to combine these different parts pieces of data in a graph to to achieve certain use cases so we'll start with supply chain so we'll look at some ways that we can combine the data that we've already talked about to to manage our supply chain to have an overview of it and be able to interact with that data to make decisions so in in this kind of yellow color over here the right we have a lot of information about suppliers and so here we have suppliers that that we buy components from they supply us with components we can see the cost of those components what options we have for shipping we already have some inventory of them so we can see we have some inventory here in facilities and some inventory here in facility B we know that the component that we're talking about here is the same as another component so maybe you have different names for these components or you label them differently because they come from a different supplier but the form fit function is the same so they can be used the same way and then we have here kind of a basic way of demonstrating a bomb so we have a component component goes into assemblies that's probably much much much deeper in a real bomb but just to kind of give you a feel for how you might take individual components or individual parts and combine them and work your way up the tree until you can start to understand you know how many orders you might already have taken they include that components as well as how many vehicles you've already sold that have that component which brings us kind of more into our product data set right so we have our BOM or component and assembly groupings we have some information about orders and and vehicles already made the product that they go in and of course that that can be chained up to a a view of the product line so ultimately this this kind of gives us a way of understanding the supplier and and how that can impact all the way up through to two orders two products we can take a look at sales figures for what we've sold already a sales forecast for what we expect to sell and then this gives us the opportunity to you know towers to start understanding how we might want to make purchase decisions right take what we know we have an inventory subtract that from from demand right which is more here on the left-hand side how many orders we know we have to fulfill how many we're forecasting will need to fulfill and then make a decision between different suppliers maybe based on the shipping cost the cost of the parts the the contract agreement that you might have with them as well as any impact of like I said tariffs or things like this so it really gives us an end-to-end view of of demand through to supply and gives us lots of options for how we manage that down here in the lower left we have sort of our link to what will be another use case so here we've shown that there there can be some claims that claim can be related to a particular component there might be a number of customers who have made some of the claim related to a faults in the same component and this gives us a way of approaching suppliers perhaps if we think that there there are a number of claims that are down to a fault in the component we're getting from them right so gives us the data we need to be able to trace all the way from from customers and the claims through to the components from a particular supplier and then lets us understand whether we have other options you know for replacing those components buying from a different supplier perhaps that won't be faulty in future so some of the ways we might use this type of a graph so can we use it to help improve ordering and procurement processes absolutely having this data at hand and understanding these relationships you know at the data level can really speed up the process of procurements and ordering and understanding what you need to buy based on forecasting if that's a manual process if that has to cross a number of different systems that can take a really really long time to do here we're looking at instant access instant insights because we have that full view all the way from the left you know demand all the way through to the right where the supply is and this type of a graph help us save money on orders absolutely but you know if you understand especially if you have a longer view of demand and how that compares to inventory and how much you're going to have to buy in a particular time period I could let you leverage economies of scale so you know maybe you're making smaller orders more regularly because you can't you can't execute this kind of long-term view across that whole supply chain but if you do have that longer view which the graph can help you help you visualize then you can buy in bulk you can make more intelligent buying decisions and therefore you can save money can you optimize your inventory using the graph absolutely again when you know how many of each parts you have available to you where those are how long they'll take to get to you and what vehicles those are going to have to go in in terms of your forecast you can then move your inventory about so that it's it's in the right place at the right time you can use that to fill demands rather than making fresh purchases and leaving your inventory sitting where it is and then you could certainly refine your your inventory planning so that you don't hold quite so much you have again that view of your forecast and how that's gonna play out in terms of how many parts you're gonna need then you can plan your inventory effectively and not buy more than you have to store and can the graph help you with comparative analysis of suppliers and their products and absolutely yes when you when you have that view of the suppliers against all the the parts and the components that you're using you can compare those two warranty claims you know again to see the kind of fault rate from different different suppliers you can understand how they compare in terms of logistics whether there's any tariffs or any other regulatory compliance issues you might have to face you have that whole view you can make a much more informed decision about which suppliers you work with and which of their products you purchase now warranty claims and claims analytics so here in the center of the graph kind of at the heart of all of this is our event data relating to the claim that claim is for a particular fault which could hopefully ultimately be really be associated with particular parts or a particular component so we can then start to understand how many of these things have happened by looking in the graph for other claims that are for the same fault and then we can start to understand if that part is faulty because we've got a lot of claims here for it how many other vehicles is that part in can we predict how many of them might be likely to fail based on how many claims there are against how many vehicles that are out there and the velocity how you know how rapidly these claims are coming in and then start to predict you know are we likely to get more claims this is likely to be an expensive issue how can we resolve that more quickly if we think that's what's going to happen we can then take a look at the supplier that these parts are coming from again this is kind of our link here to the previous the previous slide where we talked about supply chain management how we can start tracing back claims through two suppliers and have that conversation with suppliers within their parts that parts are faulty we can also take a look at customer and dealer behavior again related to two claims and particular faults fraud is a is a strong word and G illusion and automotive manufacturers are more partners than than anything else so we don't really want to use the word warranty fraud here but there could be cases where we think the claim is it may be inflated it's for more than we think it should be we have the documentation about the fault maybe this is something we've documented and and said you know when this happens here the parts you need to fix it and here's the approach and how long it should take and so on and so forth so we can start looking for whether or not there are outliers in these claims whether any of the dealers their claims for that particular fault are out of line with kind of the average of everyone else and whether or not we think that means they might not be following that following the documentation correctly or making the repair correctly and so maybe we need to have a conversation about that could also be you know we might see patterns of claims maybe as the warranties coming to its end and in the final four months of the warranty we might see a burst of cosmetic issues or specific specific faults consistently being addressed within that time frame which we might want to we might want to have a look at investigate and then again we have potentially we have telematics data and sensor data which might help illuminate some of these faults and understand if there's a particular pattern of either driver behavior or things happening in the car that lead up to a particular fault that we can then forecast for then of course we do have some information here as well about the vehicle in question so you know we can hopefully have a full view of anything that's gone into it we might have the history of repairs we know what parts has been have been in there over time so we can take a look historically what's happened to that vehicle and understand the impact that history can have on this individual claim we'll need to know you know how that car is configured so what options it has what makes it different than all the other cars and and then of course we do have the basic information about that particular product with the generic definition for that vehicle and then finally we have social media down here which could take investigation into a warranty claim into accounts if you can find social media posts about something that happened or maybe do some sentiment analysis and social media post leading up to that claim can also help illuminate the history and context for that claim so how can we use this this type of warranty analytics graph so can we find patterns in the graph indicating inappropriate claims or warranty front absolutely and once we once we find those patterns we can we can then keep an eye out for them right so we can take a look what you know are there patterns are there things that lead up to this particular type of claim or to this claim being inflated or taking too long or what have you when we find that pattern we can look for other instances of that pattern in the database so look historically through and we can also then create a trigger keep an eye out for formations of that pattern in future so that we can be proactive before the situation ends up reaching the points of the inappropriate claim can we use the graph to help predict future claims yes absolutely again when we understand the pattern around the claim be that telematics data and sensor data other repairs that have gone that have led up to that the parts that that have been involved again when we start to see this pattern forming then we can we can predict claims happening in future and so that can help you manage your warranty risk or indeed in serious cases your recall risk right you start to understand how big the problem is likely to be how quickly you can put an engineering fix in place so that it doesn't get built into any new cars how big the population is that's likely to be affected and then you can take steps proactively to deal with that situation and yes I think we've already talked about how we can use the graph to help understand whether faults might be caused by supplier issues so we have that full view of claims of parts and the building materials and how that maps to suppliers it gives us a much better view of whether or not supplier issues might be a play and helps inform how we react next we'll take a look at customer 360 view so this is a of course a hot topic across most industries and that the goal really is to develop a holistic view of your customer so that you have ready access to all the information that you have about them and understand how it fits together so of course at the the heart of the graph we have our customer we can understand the relationship as we mentioned before to other customers so you know this customer might work for one of your other corporate customers they could be family members so maybe husbands wives children you know I'll have cars from the same company we have contract information maybe between our customer and you we can see not only information about their current vehicle its its current BOM and how that's been serviced WAP shion's they have product definition so and so forth but we can see the information they have like that about any previous vehicles they build so we can see historically what vehicles they purchase what options has had you know their their past claims that whole history of all their vehicles that we might have and that could include sensor data telematics theta claims data any customer contacts pulling together all the data you might have about someone from all your your different systems so you can really understand that customer what products they have from you maybe get a view of what they like what they don't like how they related to other people even down to social media posts maybe they interact with you on social media or you know maybe their influencers so what can we do with this sorts of data how can we put that to use so can you use it to improve the customer experience absolutely customer 360 view you know one of the fundamental things it's meant to do is help you improve your customer experience customers get very frustrated for obvious reasons when they interact with you and you don't have the information about them that they expect you to when they contact you they expect you to know what car they have their claims history any information you have about them so on and so forth so being able to interact with them intelligently with all the data available definitely improves their experience can you use it to identify high high lifetime value customers absolutely when you understand your customers behavior and you can see that context both in the past and currently I can start to understand you know is this a customer who you know every two years buys a new car you know at the top end with lots of lots of options and and makes very few cake claims you know versus someone who buys their car much less frequently makes a lot of claims you know has maybe posted things about you on on Twitter you know being able to combine all this information together to get a view of how likely your customer is to buy future products based on their past behavior and then you can focus on serving those high lifetime value customers especially well and this is kind of where the relationships come in and to play as well as being very handy you know if you know someone works maybe is a c-level individual in one of your corporate clients I'm not saying bribe them but I'm you know you would want to treat them well as your customers if you give them personally a bad experience then that could translate into your relationship with your corporate customer and likewise you know if you've got a high-value customer and then you have information about her her husband who's also a customer may be looking at him individually he doesn't look personally like a high-value customer but you want to give him good service as well as his wife because as a unit together they're both you know they're both lifetime value is very high can you use the customer 360 graph to detect and prevent churn absolutely so the same way that you can identify a high-value customers you can also identify customers who are likely to churn I can look at past behavior you know can you find patterns of claims patterns of social media posts and customer interaction that have led to someone not renewing the contract or not buying another car from you and then you know can you find other instances of that pattern forming can you watch for instances of that pattern forming so that you can identify potential churn and then again taking that together with your view of a customer's lifetime value you can make decisions about how you want to interact with that customer and whether or not you want to go to great lengths to prevent that churn and likewise you can use the graph to improve upsell and cross-sell you can identify what people are likely to buy what sorts of options they like compare that to other people who have bought similar products from you maybe make recommendations about what other options in my wants or features that they might want to add or maybe try to get them to buy then the next step up in a line of car based on what you've seen before both in their behavior as well as and then finally knowledge graph so knowledge graph is quite an all-encompassing term but we're seeing lots of lots of uses for knowledge graphs not not just in this industry but across many many industries the idea is taking your company knowledge and and combining it together so you can see how it all links which makes it easier to use can generate new insights because that data was never linked together before and really gives you a way to kind of persist this so it's not just in engineers heads or you know it's a paper or you know on a file system somewhere so this is really taking a look at a kind of a product based internal knowledge graph we could we could extend this to include more organizational data HR data so on and so forth it's a this is big enough I think so we'll focus on more product type stuff here so we have product at the heart of this we can understand all the different variations of a product how the product families fit together ultimately follow the documentation links to find out where this documentation is stored and perhaps who owns it who's responsible for it and this can enable search engines it can make it much easier to find information that you're looking for you know when it just lives on maybe just slips on a file system isn't isn't tagged or categorized in any way or really linked together I'm putting it into this sort of review makes it much easier to work with and that can be a real a real time-saver and save money in fact because you're saving time then down here we have again more of kind of a bomb view of a product some some parts and assemblies that go into it so on and so forth we can see where this product is made it could be in one facility or more than one facility whether or not we have parts in inventory we can see the supplier information for those parts here just as we noticed earlier here we have more the claim information and false information we have marketing data and social media analysis that might be related to your brand or to your individual products we have sales figures sales forecasts bringing all this information together and making it linkable so that you can understand a full view kind of across all these different sets of data so how can we combine these together to make use of a knowledge graph in this industry so can we use it to improve your products and services so absolutely when you have access to you know lots of information you might have documentation design documents notes decisions things like this stored for from many many many years across all sorts of different offerings and when you put that into a place where it's searchable and gives you the opportunity to take those things into account as you're designing and building new products so what worked in the past what didn't work in the past what was the solution to problem X that you're facing now even looking at suppliers and understanding how that maps to different faults and so on and so forth can you improve the things that are going into your products to to reduce those number of faults all these sorts of things can be understood from the knowledge graph and looking at the combinations and the relationships between the data in that graph likewise in the same way you can improve your product time to market right so when you can have the right documentation and the right understanding at hands it means that you can finish your you know you JSON cycles and your engineering faster it also means you know your your engineers people who might be looking for this data or need this data are wasting their time searching for it and trying to figure these things out instead they get the information they need quickly which allows them to focus on you know on their actual their actual job the things they should be doing can we use that for a customer facing uses as well sure you know if you create a portal that contains information about your products documentation historical information about your products that that people might be interested in you can expose all of that you know externally as well give that you know that ease of use for that information directly to your customers again improving their their experience in the process and then of course you know there's other use cases like I said that are less specific to the industry but are applicable across the number of industry so Identity and Access Management when you have your hierarchy information your system information your data maps who has access to that doesn't infrastructure network management you know across your IT Estate's different facilities master and metadata management so you know mastering your data understanding where it lives where the golden sources if they don't know how it moves through your systems and then regulatory compliance kind of fits in with that depending on your industry you might have data compliance everybody has gdpr compliance concerns these days so you can also use the graph where you have compliance issues to help resolve those issues so now we'll quickly take a look at a few case studies these are companies that use neo4j in some of the ways that we've talked about so first there's Volvo so Volvo uses neo4j to understand the connections between every components in their vehicles and how that maps to a customer need so not just viewing the bomb for the sake of being a bomb or for meeting particular engineering metrics but really understanding how everything in the vehicle meets a particular customer need which is quite an interesting use case and I think probably involves quite quite a lot of data highly connected data we have the US Army so the US Army uses neo4j for supply chain optimization not think of them really is a typical manufacturer but certainly they need to understand how they make repairs what spare parts they need where those have to go and of course in this sort of a use case you know lives are really at stake so having the rights the right components making the right pairs in the right place at the right time can literally save lives so they use neo4j to be able to understand their building materials to manage their supply chain and make those sorts of decisions much faster than they used to be able to using an old system then there's like such like uses neo4j to do integrated product data management throughout the value chain so that's both looking at supplier information things that come from there they're the materials that come from their different suppliers and also as it moves through you know their entire production line their entire company so again this gives them access centrally to to all the knowledge they have about their different parts the things the things that go into their different products even how that matches up against regulations for you know particular materials in different countries NASA so again perhaps not someone that you would think of as being a traditional manufacturer but actually they use neo4j for a lessons learned database used by their engineers and their scientists they have loaded decades of documentation into the database made all the connections between that information with neo4j to understand the content of these lessons learned what it relates to the metadata about it and then that's used to power searches so that their engineers and scientists can go back through those lessons learned and understand how previous problems were fixed and in fact one of the outcomes they highlight is that they used the search engine to find an issue for the capsule that they're building for Orion the mission to take man to Mars and the fact that they were able to find this information so easily literally saved in two years and a million dollars from the effort to send man to Mars because they didn't have to re-engineer that they didn't have to try a bunch of things they were able to find the data that they needed straight away graph and then Lockheed Martin so Lockheed Martin uses neo4j for product 360 we talked about customer 360 before product 360 is the same idea but really looking at looking at their products understanding all the data that sits around there they're their product and how it fits together so having that 362 view a 360 degree view of their product has generated a lot of efficiencies for them and it generated new insights so that they can use that to improve their and and really the the power of all this my final slide out trying to convey you know we've looked at some very simple examples some very small graphs that I drew by hand the power of this comes when your data looks like this when you've got a massive data set highly highly interconnected and you need to find these patterns across all of that data this were neo4j really really shines
