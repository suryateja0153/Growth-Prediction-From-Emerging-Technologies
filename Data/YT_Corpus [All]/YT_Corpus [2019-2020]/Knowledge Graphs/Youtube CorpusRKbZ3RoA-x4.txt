 - [Narrator] Welcome to a quick introduction to the Desmos graphing calculator, Whether you're just beginning to explore the coordinate plane or your diving deep into advanced topics, there's something here just for you. Let's take a look at a few graphing Basics. I'll start by plotting a line, Y equals X. The results appear instantly in the coordinate plane and update on every keystroke. Next let's plot a curve, Y equals 1/3X squared. Let's call out two specific things here. First to enter a fraction, I press the division symbol here on the keypad. You can also press the forward slash key on a physical keyboard. It's located between period and shift. Next there are several ways to enter exponents. If you just need to square something, press the A squared button. Want to raise something to a different power? Enter your base, press A to the B, and then type your exponent. You can also enter exponents from a physical keyboard by holding shift and pressing six. To identify points of interest like X and Y intercepts or points of intersection simply tap or click and Desmos will reveal the coordinates. Adjusting the viewing window is easy too. Click, hold and drag to move the graph paper around or use zoom in, zoom out to get a close-up or big picture view. Want to go back to the default? Just press the home icon to reset the window. That's all for this quick introduction. But we've really only scratched the surface.
