 this lesson will use a decimals animation to make the connection between the cosine and sine function values on the unit circle and their graphs on the coordinate plane remember on the unit circle X is equal to cosine theta and Y is equal to sine theta you can find the file I'm going to use by searching online for desmos sine and cosine animation or just by typing in the URL listed at the bottom of the screen when graphing the cosine and sine function values on the coordinate plane the key points on the unit circle are where the quadrantal angles intersect the unit circle which are the points 1 comma 0 0 comma 1 negative 1 comma 0 and 0 comma negative 1 and again remember on the unit circle X is equal to cosine theta and y is equal to sine theta so we take a look at one revolution around the unit circle at 0 radians the cosine function value is 1 at PI over 2 radians the cosine function value is 0 at PI radians the cosine function value is negative 1 at three-halves pi radians the cosine function value is 0 and then at 2 pi radians the cosine function value is back at positive 1 now let's animate a point around the unit circle and look at the graph of the basic cosine function on the coordinate plane at the same time we will see the point on the unit circle in blue and we'll see the point on the basic cosine function on the coordinate plane in purple so again keep in mind the x-coordinate of the point on the unit circle is giving us the cosine function value on the purple graph let's do that again and focus on the five key points to graph one period of the basic cosine function at zero radians the cosine function value is one indicated by the ordered pair zero comma one as the angle increases from zero to PI over two radians notice on the unit circle X will decrease from one to zero which gives us the first 1/4 of the graph of the basic cosine function in purple as theta increases from PI over 2 to pi radians the x-coordinate on the unit circle will decrease from zero to negative one which gives us the first half of one period of the graph of y equals cosine theta as theta increases from PI to three-halves pi the x coordinate is now going to increase from negative one to zero so notice how the graph is back on the x-axis when theta is equal to three-halves pi radians and then finally as theta increases from three-halves pi/2 to pi the x-coordinate will increase from zero to one giving us the final piece of one period of the graph of the cosine function and then from here the graph just repeats so again I'm graphing one period of the basic cosine function we take the period and create four equal subintervals we begin with a max midline minimum midline and max and now let's take a look at the graph of the basic sine function and again if we look at the sine function values for the quadrantal angles starting at zero radians the sine function value is equal to zero at PI over 2 radians the sine function value is equal to 1 at PI radians the sine function value is equal to 0 three-halves pi radians the sine function value is equal to negative 1 and then at 2 pi radians the sine function values back at 0 as we animate the point around the unit circle we will see the graph of the basic sine function in green again the y coordinate of the point on the unit circle is giving us the sine function value graphed in green now let's go back and do that again and just focus on the quad dental angles so at zero radians the sine function value equal to zero giving us the point zero comma zero for the graph of the basic sine function as theta increases from zero to PI over two the sine function value is going to increase from zero to 1 which gives us the green piece of the sine function graph as theta increases from PI over 2 to pi radians the y-coordinate or sine function value will decrease from 1 to zero leaving us this piece of the graph of the sine function as theta increases from PI to three-halves pi the y-coordinate or sine function value is going to decrease from zero to negative one which gives us this piece of the graph of the sine function and then as theta increases from three-halves pi radians of two pi radians the y-coordinate or sine function value will increase from negative one back to zero and we have one complete graph of one period of the sine function and then from here it just repeats so in graphing one period of the basic sine function we take one period divided into four subintervals and the pattern for the basic sine function is midline maximum midline minimum midline and just for the fun of it let's animate the cosine and sine function values at the same time as the point animates around the unit circle twice so we have the graph of the cosine function in purple and we have the graph of the sine function in green remember on the unit circle x equals cosine theta and y equals sine theta I hope you found this helpful
