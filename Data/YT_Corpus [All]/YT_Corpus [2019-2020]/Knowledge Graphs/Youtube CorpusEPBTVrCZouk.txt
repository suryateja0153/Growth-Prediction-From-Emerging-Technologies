 hello and welcome to Nana's crafty home my name is Tonya I am going to be showing you how to use a free service called stitch fiddle that you can find at stitchfiddle.com this service is free for the basic service that I'm going to be showing you today and essentially I'm going to be working with how to create a crochet corner-to-corner graph that you can then print off and use to design your own personalized corner-to-corner graphs so it's a really simple and easy website to navigate but I am just going to show you the basics on how to create your own graphs it's a free signup so you don't need to pay anything in order to sign up for the service this would be your main page before you've created your online login so just go ahead and click free signup and I'm gonna go ahead and login with Facebook because I want to make sure that it isn't showing you the paid I also have the paid version of it but under a different name so I'm going to use a different login name which is going to show you the free service and won't let us have any of the premium options with this tutorial so when you get to your main screen after you've logged in you see this sidebar over here and you have several different options and one is to create a new chart so we're going to want to create a new chart we want to choose crochet as our craft and corner to corner crochet is what we're going to want to choose for today's project you have a few options here I'm going to show you today how to create one from an empty chart with your own design so go ahead and click on that this is where you are going to choose how large your grid is how many pixel blocks your grid is going to be you can use the size calculator to help you make a sample swatch and then put in what you want your finish size to be and it will tell you approximately how many boxes you will need to to do to get the size with your swatch gauge but for today I am just going to do a very simple graph here it automatically defaults to 20 by 20 which is of course a square you could do a rectangle if you wanted to it tells you here this is 20 going back and forth and these are top to bottom so if we wanted to make a scarf of course we'd want this the number of rows for it to be taller if we wanted to make a rectangle blanket we'd probably would want to make the columns wider as well so basically we're just going to choose the 20 by 20 and create chart and then it comes up with this blank grid and you can see over here I have several default color options but you can add more colors if those colors don't work for you you can click on the +1 and when you click on the plus one it brings you to all of these different options here and so you can just choose one of these you can run through the spectrum of colors if you see something that you like if you want something kind of in the green range you can go to the green and then click on something that appeals to you in that picture here's the preview of that color and then you would add that to your menu over here I'm going to go ahead and add in mmm dark blue and I'm gonna click Add you also see here you can add in symbols if you'd like to add in a symbol you can do that primarily these are going to be for other craft options but I have used symbols in some of my graphs when I wanted to show like a diagonal where half of the block is empty I have used symbols and those graphs so once we've picked the colors we want to add to our choices on our menu we just click Add now all of these are the colors that we have to choose from here from our palette if you click on the color palette box let me click on that again if you click on this box here that's going to tell you what the colors you have on your menu what their abbreviation is and what it stands for the description once you've selected some of these colors and had them in the graph you can see here right now everything is white and the graph so 400 boxes 400 pixels are white but you can see here this color that I added in does not bring in an abbreviation does not have a description I will have to give it one so since B has already been taken for the other blue I'm going to go ahead and put BL and then put dark blue here for the description you can go ahead once you've finished you can click this remove unused and it will automatically delete any colors that you did not use in your graph but we don't know what we're going to be using in our graph yet so we're just going to click Submit and now we're going to go ahead and do our graph and simply to do that all you need to do is click on a color so let's say I want to start with that dark blue and I want to make a balloon if I make a mistake I go over here I click on the white and I can go and remove anything that I don't like if you have a lot that you want to get rid of at one time you would just left click hold and it will easily remove anything you can also do that to add colors if you have a lot and you want to do do them fast instead of individually clicking you would just left click and hold and you would be able to color in a large portion of your graph so I want to get rid of that pink let's see what we get with green here so let's see what I want to make and you can see I'm just clicking on a color and then I come down here and click on the box that I want to be that color and fill them in so of course you can do any kind of graph you want and this is pretty abstract I'm liking kind of the the round shapes here almost looks like abstract little flowers blobs of paint interesting little designs and let's see what happened remember when we clicked on that color palette there it brings up a list of all the colors that I have on my menu and you can see that the count has changed over here so I have 15 red boxes 18 orange 21 yellow 16 green and so on and then at this point if I didn't want to do anything else with this I would just go ahead and remove all the unused it would automatically delete those out of my list and then click Submit so you can see here now the only colors that are over here in my menu are colors that I actually have existing in my graph that I made so when we click on file here I have several different options I can save it and even in the free version it will allow me to save it however I have a limited number of charts that I can save I think it's 15 or so once you get to that 15 number you either have to upgrade or you have to delete out previous saved graphs in order to save new ones then if you wanted to download it you could go ahead and click download when you click download to print it you have a file type over here of options that you can choose the only ones that are available in the free version are the ones that are without the asterisk so the PNG the PDF looks like those are the only ones that are available in the free version both of which are completely usable the PNG downloads really nicely you can when you go to download you can tell it where you want a legend maybe you don't want to legend you want it on a separate page on the right side or at the bottom I'm going to go I don't leave it at the bottom then of course you can click on edit you can change in any of the symbols here the descriptions or the colors and then click apply and when I click apply it's going to go ahead and download that into my downloads and when I click on it there is my graph that I downloaded so that's perfectly printable I could enlarge that if I needed to and then I have it on my computer as well you can also go ahead and name it by clicking on chart settings title and layout if you wanted to give this a title let's call this paint blobs graph and click apply now you can see up here this has a name when I go to my charts it's going to show here as one of my available saved charts with the name down here at the bottom so if I go back into this now that I've saved it in order to edit this you can just go ahead and make any changes that you would like to you can add so let's say you decide after you created your chart that it's not quite the right size you want to make some adjustments you would just click on edit and you would put add one column to the left or add one column to the right add multiple columns and one row above at one row below add multiple rows so this is the fast way if I if I click on add one column right it automatically added one column over in this direction I now have twenty-one columns this direction if I were to add one row above you see here it added one row up above and now I have twenty-one rows going up you can also zoom this so you can look at it a little bit closer and there's lots of other different options in my opinion the ones that I am showing you today are going to be the most used really just simple options I'm not delving terribly deeply into stitch fiddle you can get a lot more complex and complicated in here and there's a lot of other things that it will do but this is really just a brief overview of how you can do this to create your own charts now some people like written instructions for their patterns if you don't want to get the premium you are not able to get written instructions for your pattern but let's say this is my oh it logged me out okay so if you have the premium version as you can see I have a premium version here when I click on written instructions it doesn't have that premium version off to the side with that premium version i click on written instructions and it will automatically give me row by row instructions which are completely customizable by clicking on the rows if I don't want to see the arrows the direction arrows I can delete those off if I don't want right side and wrong side on every row I can delete that off if I want to change the corner text to where I go to the decreasing I could change that to corner begin decreasing I can show a legend if I want so it'll show me the abbreviations for the colors that are in the graph I can it can say what the stitch count is you can always show how many stitches you're gonna have at the end of every row or never show it you can also change the stitches how you want them divided it defaults to the comma if you want to show the count for single stitches you would click on this box and it will show you the count even when you're just doing one box for that color if you want to change where you're seeing the count so here you're seeing white one if I want that one before I just change that to before if I have long descriptions they automatically enclose them by parentheses but you can change that option as well you can change how you want your count text do you want it to say times two or do you want it to say let's see well how would we want to say that well we could get rid of the times and then it's just pink one pink - pink - here pink three but if you want that times you can put that back in there as well you can show the count after or you can show the count before and you can change the descriptions again from this button so lots and lots of different ways that you can make adjustments to the written instructions and then once you're ready you can just print those from here you can download them if you download them they will download with the name of the project that you gave it so you'll always have it on your computer if you wanted to refer back to it as well so that's another great option if you're gonna do the premium version of stitch fit all it is not terribly expensive I think I paid for a year as of today I think it's around 21 dollars a year so if you're gonna use it a lot and you like written instructions I think that that is very reasonable I love the fact that I can have both the color full graph as well as having the written instruction so it's extremely worth it to me but we all have different comfort levels with that right and you know if you only work off of color graphs and you want to create your graph and then print it this this the free version is absolutely going to be a great option for you you know especially if you're not wanting to save a lot of graphs for the future and you just want to make something and then be done with it of course you'll have it on paper if you print it off but you won't have it in digital form unless you saved it to your computer which you can do that as well even in the free version so I hope this tutorial has been helpful for you today please subscribe to my youtube channel so that you get notified when I post a new video as always thank you so much for being with me today take care everyone bye bye
