 we illustrate here a recent result about the generalized pointer 1/2 result in graph theory it relates it deals with the problem to count complete subgraphs of a finite simple graph this is called the clique problem it is one of the classical 21 problems of car which are np-complete this means that if he could solve the clique problem for us we could solve any NP problem fast one could hope is a result in differential geometry is usually formulated for vector fields on a manifold the Euler characteristic of the manifold is the sum of the indices of the field it's a theorem it's important in more severe ii where the vector field is a gradient field of a scalar function g in the more sir case the indices are in either 1 or minus 1 at critical points of g in the discrete we deal with the general finite simple graph the Euler characteristic of the graph is a super some of the clique cardinalities in terms of the F function which you see here are the characteristic is 1 minus F of minus 1 it is minus 10 in the example which is given the discrete Poincare Hopf theorem deals with scalar functions on the vertex set of a graph it is assumed to be locally injective the index is 1 minus 2 owner characteristic of the part of the unit sphere where G is smaller than the value of G at X the result holds for any graph here's an example with a random graph the F vector is 14 36 16 at the Euler characteristic is minus 6 the indices are given at each point they add up to the Euler characteristic I obtained this result in 9 at 2012 here is another example which is a more geometric as it's a discrete manifold case it's a 2-dimensional sphere the form of an icosahedron we have chosen a function G where the indices are either 0 1 or minus 1 new is that we can formulate these in function form the F function of a graph is the sum of the F functions of stable spheres as G multiplied by T so that's the new result mmm here's an example with a house graph we see the function values of G in red and index polynomials are given at the center of the notes they add up to the F function of G in the special case T equal minus 1 we obtained all the result for scalar indices and Euler characteristic but now we can use this to recursively compute the F function and what is nice is that it in every step we have them n smaller graphs usually half of the unit spheres of the nodes which in general are much smaller and in general can be computed in some exponential time so here is a kind of cliche cliche example with Taurus the function at G is given by a linear function of the ambient space leading to a more say setup with four critical points the maximum to several points in a minimum so this is the classical case now in the function case discrete manifold the torus as a discrete manifold and we have given the polynomials at each point and they add up multiplied by T with to the F function of G thanks for more information you see you can look at the paper which is on the archive
