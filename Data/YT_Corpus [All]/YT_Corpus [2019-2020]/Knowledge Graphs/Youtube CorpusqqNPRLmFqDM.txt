 a dynamic graph models changing relationships between entities over time in this work we present multi-scale snapshots a visual analytics approach to provide an overview of a dynamic graph at multiple temporal scales the approach consists of three steps creating multi-scale temporal summaries applying graph embeddings and the semi-automatic visual analysis the combination of these steps lets us visually explore how temporal and structural properties affect the overall dynamic graph
