 there's a mathematical equation that would  take the fastest computer in the world   a half a billion years to solve until now   hello and welcome to what the what the show about  fun facts and a little bit of science and today   we're talking about quantum computers it was just  recently in december of 2020 where scientists in   china were able to take that half a billion year  equation and do it in 200 seconds um i'm no math   doctor but that seems like quite an improvement  it was probably said best by quantum physicist   fabio scherino of sapienza university in  rome when he said my first impression was   wow okay then man a few words i guess so how did  they do this how did they take a dell computer   from best buy and make it so slow bro if you've  made it this far in the episode i hope that you   click the subscribe button and maybe share it let  me know your thoughts down in the comments below i   love getting engaged with you so far us humans  we've been able to create two quantum computers   that could defeat this incredible math problem the  first one was in 2019 by google and the second one   was december 3rd of 2020 in china the  chinese quantum computer jiu zheng   uses light and particles and photons google's  computer sycamore uses superconducting materials   on a chip more like a standard computer we  know today so what's so special about zhu zheng   if google was able to solve this in 2019 it seems  like the chinese team was a year late to the party   well this chinese quantum computer is 10 billion  times faster than google's and i guess the lesson   we learned here is that if you're going to  show up late to a party you better be dressed   to impress so how does the juicing computer  work contains light sources beam splitters   mirrors and a hundred photon catching things  basically you take a bunch of fancy optical   devices and then you shoot them down these  railways kind of like a fancy monorail   so knowing a computer can send light around a  bunch of mirrors and solve a tough math problem   it's cool and all but how does it work and why  does it matter our typical computers operate on   binary and you've probably heard that word before  it means that information is displayed or gathered   in zeros and ones that's the language of computers  but with quantum computers they're not zeros and   ones they're both zero and one at the same time  meaning they can calculate multiple possibilities   simultaneously where traditional computers can  only do one at a time and the challenge with   computing is that the harder it works and the  faster it does stuff the hotter it gets and this   is why your techie friend that built that gaming  computer is so excited about that liquid cooling   part that they just installed those insane gaming  computers create a lot of heat so cooling it down   gives them the best optimal performance quantum  computers are no exception in fact they are   calculating so much that they are blisteringly  hot and they need to be cooled at negative 460   degrees fahrenheit and that's colder than the  coldest parts of the moon and that's in space   but you'd already know that if you watched  that episode about the moon and the volcanoes so traditionally these super computers or quantum  computers have to be in a isolated room that is   constantly cooled and left at these extremely  cold temperatures she was saying i don't know   how to say that that computer can perform 100  trillion times faster than any other computer   on our planet and it can do it without needing to  be in a super cold room and that right there is a   massive leap forward in computing but why does it  matter quantum computers can test new medicines   at a molecular level giving us new medicines that  truly solve a problem and do so in a faster amount   of time does that mean that we might get vaccines  faster sure and it might be one of the best   vaccines we've ever received and most scientists  agree that quantum computers are the best chance   that we have to survive the challenges of the  21st century with climate change it can help us   find ways to remove carbon from the air and much  like watching hurricane predictions on the news   where you have all these different possible  routes quantum computers could probably predict   before we even know that a hurricane has formed  letting us know exactly where it's going to hit   and what we need to do to take care of ourselves  and the planet and batteries today's batteries   lose power too quickly and aren't able to hold a  charge that meet our demands much like in our cars   the calculations from these quantum computers  will help solve this problem giving us the most   efficient batteries we've ever had while having  less impact on our planet and then there's quantum   internet which obviously it's going to be super  fast but the most important thing is that would   be more secure than anything we've experienced so  far and that is very important as we become a more   and more connected society to the digital world  and while the g zing is a massive leap forward   it still has a lot of time before it's a usable  product for say the medical industry it's going to   be 10 to 15 years before we can see these really  be utilized to help give us a real benefit in   science or technology which they're kind  of the same aren't they and it's not going   to be something that you carry around in your  pocket you're not going to have a quantum iphone   at least not yet as always thanks for  watching and what did you learn today fine
