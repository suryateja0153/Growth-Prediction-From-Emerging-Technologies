 hello world i'm imagination in this video  i'm going to talk about ibm's plan to have   a 1 000 cubit quantum computer by 2023 the  point at which quantum computers transition   from expensive science experiments to a technology  that could reshape the future always seems about a   decade away but a new technology roadmap from ibm  suggests that the timeline might be getting more   concrete despite hundreds of millions of dollars  pouring into the field today's quantum computers   are still pretty rudimentary ibm's largest quantum  processors today are 65 cubits a shade behind   their biggest competitor google which is a 72  cubit device that's a long way from the millions   of qubits likely to be needed to do practical  computations those numbers could tick up pretty   fast though wrote ibm's head of quantum j gambeta  in a blog post outlining the company's vision for   the next few years it plans to launch a 127 cubic  processor next year with a 433 cubit machine hot   on its heels in 2022 and by 2023 they expect to  hit 1121 qubits with a processor codenamed condor   which they think will be the inflection point  for the commercialization of quantum technology   the development required to build condor will  have solved some of the most pressing challenges   in the way of scaling up a quantum computer  right scan beta we are releasing the roadmap   that we think will take us from the noisy  small-scale devices of today to the million-plus   qubit devices of the future it's not just  about boosting the number of qubits though   one of the biggest problems facing quantum  computers is their susceptibility to disturbances   which can easily introduce errors in their  calculations director of ibm research dario   gill told techcrunch they hope to bring error  rates down from one percent today to around 0.001   in the condor processor while it's not officially  in the roadmap the company has intimated that it's   targeting a million qubit device by 2030 the same  timeline google is working to and it's already   building some of the supporting infrastructures  the release of the roadmap also saw the unveiling   of a 10-foot tall six-foot wide cryogenic fridge  codenamed goldeneye that would house such a device   getting there won't be easy though it will require  breakthroughs in everything from materials science   to cryogenics and software to run these devices  gill tells techcrunch that's exactly why they've   released their roadmap to give other players in  the quantum computing industry the confidence to   specialize in specific areas rather than everyone  trying to do everything but it's still far from   clear whether ibm will be the passa sitter in  this race industrial conglomerate honeywell   also burst out of left field earlier this year  with what it claims is the world's most powerful   quantum computer the honeywell devices choose  the superconducting qubits used by ibm google   and startup rajetti in favor of trapped ion cubits  and only has six of them but the company claims   that it outperforms all other devices announced  so far in a performance measure invented by ibm   called quantum volume this metric takes  into account not only the number of qubits   but the level of connectivity between them and  how error prone they are ibm managed to pull level   on quantum volume in august but honeywell says it  expects to be able to increase the quantum volume   of its system tenfold every year which would  leave rivals in the dust if it comes to fruition   several other rivals have made bets on different  quantum technologies that could yet see them   rapidly overtake the current leaders intel  is pursuing silicon qubits built using the   same raw materials and processes as today's  computer chips which are still considerably   less advanced than alternatives but hold the  promise of massive scalability and microsoft   has made a hail mary for topological quantum  computing which would sidestep the need for error   correction regardless of whether anyone manages  to come upon the inside of ibm though the roadmap   they have released suggests we are now in the  final sprint towards practical quantum computing   rather than decades it seems we are now talking  years that's all for today thanks for watching
