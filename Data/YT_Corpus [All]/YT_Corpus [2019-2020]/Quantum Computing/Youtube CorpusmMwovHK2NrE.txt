 we're not transporting qubit zero two cubed - but teleporting the information containing qubit zero on two cubed [Music] hey welcome back to coding with Kiska this is Abe in today's video we'll be talking about quantum teleportation now the word teleportation might be familiar to you from pop culture references and in particular one that's very popular is Star Trek's beat me up technology and more recently quantum teleportation has been in the news as a result of developments in the field of quantum computing in general today we're going to explain how to build this quantum teleportation circuit on Kiska now you might think that a circuit like quantum teleportation might require several complicated gates but in fact you've done most of the work in your hello world application so we'll build from that hello world application and add a few more gates in order to do something very useful so before we begin let's understand what quantum teleportation means so quantum teleportation is the transfer of quantum states from one qubit to another now let's not get too excited this does not mean physically transporting a qubit from one place to another but in fact this is the transfer of quantum information from one qubit to another now you might wonder why we're even doing any of this now in a classical computer copying something and transferring it from one place to another isn't a problem in fact we do it every day however in quantum computers the act of trying to transfer by copy is not allowed because the moment you copy you're actually implicitly doing a measurement which destroys the quantum state that you're trying to transfer from point A to point B in order to get around this problem we're going to take advantage of entanglement as a resource and build a circuit which is the quantum teleportation circuit so as always we begin by importing kiss get into our workspace and I do that by typing from kiss get import everything I'm first going to build a quantum circuit made up of three classical bits and three quantum bits so it's written down in this compact form quantum circuit three three I want to point out that this is slightly different from what you've seen in the hello world application it's a more compact notation and what this language is saying is I want to build a quantum circuit made of three quantum bits and three classical bits all right so as I've mentioned before we're going to be drawing our circuit at every step and looking at how it looks and so I'm going to type Matt plot live in line and then circuit dot draw output equals life so as you see our circuit doesn't look too exciting at the moment these are the three quantum bits and these are the three classical bits so now what we're going to do is begin the teleportation circuit so I'm going to take q0 which is this one in bit I'm going to take the state in that quantum bit and transfer it over to q2 which is this lower quantum bit q1 will be a resource that we use in order to do this process so let's start a bit simple what I'm going to do is teleport the state 1 from Q 0 to Q 2 you might remember from the gates video that the way to take us from the state 0 and Q zero to the state 1 is by applying an X gate so let me do that first as you see here we have now our ex gate which means at this point right after the barrier we have the state one on q0 and we're going to teleport that state to q2 alright now here comes the teleportation protocol so the first thing I'm going to do is create entanglement between q1 and q2 and this is very simple we're going to follow exactly the same procedure that we did in our hello world application so what I'm doing first is applying a hedemark gate on q1 and then I'm applying a controlled ex gate between q1 and q2 so I'm going to draw the circuit again to show you what it looks like and as you see here this is the familiar entanglement circuit that we used in our hello world application okay so now q1 and q2 are entangled the rest of the teleportation protocol dictates that we apply the following two gates a controlled xscape going from q0 to q1 and we're going to apply a head of our gate on q0 okay let's draw our circuit again so now this is our circuit looks and there's one more missing aspect to the teleportation circuit and that is to do two measurements the measurements are going to be on q0 and q1 so i can do that by writing out circuit measure take the measurements in q0 and q1 and put them in the classical register it's q0 and q1 before i do this just so that we see things more clearly i'm going to add a barrier and i'm going to draw the circuit all right so as you see here these are the two measurements that i've started off with and now for the teleportation protocol to complete i need to add two more gates these gates are shown here so i'm going to add a barrier first and then I'm going to apply control X going from qubit 1 2 cubed 2 and a control Z going from qubit 0 to qubit 2 here's how our circuit looks and that's it so this is the quantum teleportation protocol so what I'm claiming to you at this point is that the state one here that we have at the end of this barrier has now been teleported to this state to this cubed q2 we can verify this by applying a measurement to q2 and seeing the outcomes so what do we expect you might notice that q2 starts off in the state zero and I'm claiming that I've teleported the state 1 to that qubit so if I measure this qubit what I expect to see is always 1 so let's do that simulation so we can now take the circuit and simulate it in one of the chasm simulators in the air back end [Music] I'm going to execute the quantum circuit on the back end being the simulator and I'm going to say I want 1,024 shots of this experiments really this number could be anything so I'm going to add dot result to execute and then I'm going to say the counts our result get counts and then I'm going to take the visualization tools in kiss kit so from kiss CAD tools visualization import plot histogram and then I'm going to plot histogram counts so notice that so far I haven't added the measurement on cue 2 yet so let me quickly add that before we move on what I'm saying is take the results of measuring qubit 2 and put it in classical register 2 ok so let's see what happens so these are the results first of all to understand these results let me point out something to you so these numbers here are red ass C 2 C 1 C 0 so just like they're pointed upward you can read them off as the result in this one and this one and this one so the result 1 0 0 the results here are 1 0 and 0 on these lines so as I mentioned before we've taken the results of measuring q2 and put them in situ and that's this last number and as you see we only get results where c2 is equal to 1 and that I hope convinces you that the measurement results always have the state 1 in that particular cubed cubed 2 if you actually want to see what the counts are you can always print the counts and as you see all the results have this first digit as 1 and just as a reminder we're seeing the counts here being 223 for the result in 1 0 1 for example and when you look for 1 0 1 here you see something that's a zero point 2 1 8 and that's because 223 is 20 1 8 point 8 percent of the total number of shots that we asked for in the measurement and so at this point I think it's important to remind you again what we've done so we've built this fairly complicated circuit but at the end of the day what we've done is taken the state in Q 0 and teleported it to the state in Q 2 so at the end of this complicated circuit what you've done is taken the state here and brought it down here and you can see this has tremendous applications so we haven't mentioned so far the key element of this circuit which is that there's entanglement here which allows us to take these two qubits far apart from each other and so what this allows us to do is transfer quantum information over long distances and this is one of the key application areas we're applying the quantum teleportation circuit can become very useful I hope this has made sense to you and in fact one thing you can try out here to make sure that you've understood how the circuit works is the following challenge so you've noticed here that I've teleported the state one on this qubit down to this qubit so instead remember that you can teleport any quantum state that you'd like so in particular here's a challenge why don't you try teleporting the state 0 plus 1 over square root of 2 so remember again this is the quantum state that you get when you apply ahead of our gate onto the zero quantum state so why don't you try and apply the quantum teleportation protocol to this particular state and see what the outcomes are and tell us in the comments down below what you find so I hope it's been clear to you that simple modifications on top of the already simple quantum algorithm that we built in the hello world application can lead to a very useful quantum circuit and in fact that this quantum circuit is the basis for more complicated quantum algorithms in the next video we'll consider the Bernstein buzzer on the algorithm be sure to subscribe so that you don't miss out thanks for watching and we'll see you in the next video [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
