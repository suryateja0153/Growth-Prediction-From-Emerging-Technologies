 I work on the physics mostly of stuff, of solids, and what happens when you take lots of particles and you put them inside a material you make them interact. There's a lot of interesting problems in physics where the data you would need to store to solve the problem is just far too big. And this is one thing that quantum computers are good at, not because they have better memory but because they store things differently. So it's like if you had a combination lock you could try all of the combinations at once rather than just one at a time. We would like to be able to understand the physics of interacting systems. We need to be able to model them, and they're usually too big for us to handle. With quantum computers we have hope that we can do it. Having the Q Hub here, the benefits for NC State is that it allows us earlier and better access to quantum hardware that other people don't necessarily have access to. All sorts of large companies are very interested in using this to solve their problems. As students, they'll be able to get into this stuff earlier on, and that'll make them better set up to make contributions wherever they're going to work in the future. I solve complex problems in physics using quantum computing, and that's how I think and do at NC State.
