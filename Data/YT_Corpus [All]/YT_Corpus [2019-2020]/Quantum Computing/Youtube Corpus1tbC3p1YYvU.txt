 so this is Dave Schuster's lab behind me you can see four dilution refrigerators all operating that is the noise that you hear is pulse tubes operating to keep these fridges close to zero degrees Kelvin specifically they're close to about millikelvin which keeps all of the qubits that we have in the quantum regime. so let's go into here and I can show you the experiment that I've been working on now I'm taking out one of the chips that I fabricated and each one of these chips is technically one of the whole experiments and I'll talk about what's going on on each of these chips in a bit but the way that we manufacture these chips is using the nano fabrication facility here at the University of Chicago the metal that you're seeing on here is niobium that's the silvery gray material that comprises most of this chip the gaps that you're seeing in between pretty much allow us to form each of the microwave elements that you're seeing the niobium and aluminum that we use for the qubit circuit both have transition temperatures at 9 and 1 Kelvin respectively and when I say transition temperatures I mean the transition temperature at which each of these metals goes from a normal metal to a super conducting metal. As in inputting current into the material has no loss no matter how far that current travels So I actually have a device similar to this on the top of this little cabinet here and it just pumps out some static that current flows  from this device to the top of any one of those dilution refrigerators if you put your experiment in there and that current flows from the top at room temperature down each stage of the refrigerator where each stage is at a lower and lower temperature and it makes its way all the way down to one of the lines on those chips and then it makes its way very close to the qubit and that proximity of that current to the qubit induces a magnetic field so it's it's kind of a strange effect but we use classical current on the outside of the fridge to tune the transition energy of these qubits on the inside of the fridge and they're very close like the spacing between this current of qubits on the order of four microns that's how close these these and that's like a that's a classical source of current outside tuning the magnetic that is an inherently very quantum discreet object which is still kind of nuts when you think about it but in order to make that happen we put each of these chips inside mounted IBM board caps and mount those caps to boards like this each of these cables run out of several layers of shielding like this and these SMA wires connect to here and we place each of these boards on the inside of these layers of shielding and these wires connect to the base stage of the refrigerator and when we put our chips in here and connect these wires out to these SMA cables into the fridge this essentially allows us to interface with our quantum experiments classically at room temperature out here but then into the fridge at cryogenic temperatures at 20 millikelvin but these guys are mounted all inside several layers of sheilding so in this refrigerator we're downstairs now from the main lab and we've taken apart this adsorption refrigerator which gets down to about 850 millikelvin which is just past the transition temperature for aluminum which means the qubits that we put in here made of aluminium are just past the point where they turn into kind of well-behaved quantum qubits so when they're placed in this refrigerator you can actually use this to do pretty good quick debugging for you know proposed designs or proposed experiments so my sample is actually in here right now and you can see attached to the base plate which is the coldest object in this fridge there is a copper post coming from the bottom carrying that cold base plate temperature up to the IBM Board where my chip is mounted inside and you know wire bond and mounted and essentially connected to these SMA traces coming off of the board I have a solenoid connected on the top here which means the global magnetic field coming from the solenoid talks to all of the qubits on the surface of my chip so in this case I have neglected to hook up basically individual tuning lines to each of my qubits instead choosing to tune all of them at the same time with one solenoid for debugging purposes the rest of this is basically just filtering microwave electronics to make sure that the noise coming from our experimental measure apparatus and you know thermal effects from higher temperature stages of the fridge such as this top stage or this 100 millikelvin stage do not actually influence the rest of our experiment down here one such circuit element is a circulator which is based on the back here which is a 3 port element if you put in power on one end it comes out on the other end and not the third end putting power in on this end flows it out third port and not on any of the other ports and the third port close out the first port so if you're putting in power here you can put your measurement apparatus here then the measurement signal comes out here and your output is here and that prevents noise coming in on the wrong directions such as if noise came back on the output line who would actually flow to the input line and not to your sample so devices like that can be used to kind of help isolate and clean up microwave signals that you use to kind of measure what has happened with your qubits and technologies like that plus the readout resonator that we discussed before have kind of increased the qubit lifetimes that we see from you know the tens of nanoseconds to what what we're seeing now which is the hundreds of microseconds and you know who knows where we'll go next
