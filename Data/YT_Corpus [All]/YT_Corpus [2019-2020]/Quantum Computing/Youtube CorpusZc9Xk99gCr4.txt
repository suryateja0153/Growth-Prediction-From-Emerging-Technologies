 hi everyone Jade here today I'd like to introduce you to a new and exciting field of research it's still quite speculative but it's growing rapidly in popularity it's called quantum biology and it asks a very interesting question are there biological processes which need quantum mechanics to work now this question is surprising for a couple of reasons quantum processes generally need very specific conditions to work when physicists explore quantum effects they work in pristine conditions usually at temperatures of near absolute zero with very expensive equipment in complete isolation so it seems odd that these same processes take place in the hot wet messy world of life but experiments over the past decade have shown mounting evidence that this is in fact the case quantum biology is also interesting because it brings together physicists and biologists a friend of mine Pat Kelly who runs the biology channel called Copperas actually came to me with this idea together we've crafted a three-part miniseries which explores different instances of quantum biology this first episode is about how plants may use quantum mechanics to perform perhaps the most important biological process on earth photosynthesis on Pat's Channel we talk about how the engines that run our bodies enzymes may use a process called quantum tunneling and finally in the third episode we talk about my favorite phenomenon how some birds may use quantum entanglement to navigate the globe so then let's get started how some plants may use quantum mechanics the story starts in April 2007 where a group of MIT physicists were sharing science articles they'd found that week one of the articles was suggesting that plants were many quantum computers the group exploded into laughter the world's brightest minds have been trying to create a quantum computer for decades and now it was being suggested that some dumb plan had outsmarted them but as we'll soon see they were foolish to love first let's talk about why someone would even make that claim plans as quantum computers it does sound a bit far-fetched well to understand this we first need to understand a very old puzzle in biology why is photosynthesis so efficient Pat can explain this much better than I can so I'm gonna let him handle it life on Earth is only possible because of photosynthesis you've heard of this phenomenon before it's the synthesis of energy out of light or photons trees do it green algae do it all kinds of plants do it all the time to produce over 15,000 tons of biomass every second and even on such a big scale photosynthesis comes down to just a chemical reaction a plant or green algae takes carbon dioxide water and sunlight and turns those ingredients into sugar oxygen and usable energy for the organism itself sunlight along with the whole process of photosynthesis happens in an organelle within plant cells called chloroplasts inside the chloroplast are stacks of disks called thylakoids that are filled with little green pigments called chlorophyll to understand how sunlight goes from a photon to usable energy we need a little background on the chemistry of chlorophyll these molecules have a long carbon and oxygen backbone with a big grid of carbon and nitrogen surrounding a lone magnesium atom this makes it so magnesium has a single electron and its outermost layer that just barely hanging in there so when a photon comes into the thylakoid its energy knocks that electron off the magnesium here's where things get a little abstract usually we think of that magnesium ion as a whole as positively charged it just lost an electron but for all this to make sense we need to reframe it a little bit think of it more like a neutral magnesium a negative electron and a positively charged hole where the electron used to be this is called an excites and it can store energy those negative and positive poles make it work like a battery but in order to make energy out of sunlight the plant needs to get that exciton to a reaction center for a process called charge separation this involves taking the electron from magnesium and transferring it to some nearby molecule so it can create a stable molecule from there the chemical process of photosynthesis can happen but transferring that exciton is the hard part chloroplasts can transfer energy from chlorophyll to chlorophyll until it gets to a reaction center but that might be really far away plus chlorophyll are packed together super densely so how does the exciton know which way to go for years we thought it randomly stepped from molecule to molecule until it landed at a reaction center but if that were the case the excitons were more likely to get lost than to perform photosynthesis and that was kind of a problem because in the real world photosynthesis happens with nearly a hundred percent efficiency almost zero electrons ever get lost that's more efficient than any human technology we've ever come up with plus classical chemistry couldn't explain how such an efficient process was possible this is a long-standing puzzle in biology and the article that the MIT physicists were all laughing at was suggesting that plants used quantum mechanical effects to get around this see one of the main ideas in quantum mechanics is called superposition and it's the idea that a particle can be in more than one place at a time in the macroscopic world we're accustomed to if something is in one spot it definitely can't be in any other spot but in the quantum world things aren't so straightforward a single particle can simultaneously exist in many different places with different probabilities it's kind of like if you have a hedgehog in a box and you have to guess where it is you might say there's a 70% chance it's where the food is a 20% chance it's on the bed and a 10% chance it's on the treadmill these probabilities represent the likelihood of finding the Hedgehog when you take a look but the thing is the Hedgehog isn't real in all of these places it's only in one you just don't know which but quantum particles are different before they're measured they really are in all places at once with different probabilities we can view these probabilities as a spread out wave at every point in space there's a different probability of finding the particle there an important point is this probability wave only remains intact before it's detected as soon as it's measured it collapses into a single particle at one location yeah there's a reason quantum mechanics has a reputation for being weird now this idea of being in many places at once can be extended to taking many pubs at once if a particle reaches a fork in the road it doesn't need to choose it can take both if it's presented with many paths it can take all of them like a wave spreading out over space this is exactly what the paper was proposing that the exciton takes all possible paths to the reaction center and that's how it gets there so quickly this explanation actually kind of makes sense when you think about it so why are the quantum physicists laughing their heads off well the biggest enemy of all quantum processes is something called decoherence remember how we talked about how the superposition only lost until a particle is measured well in quantum talk measured doesn't mean the same thing that it means in everyday language here measured means when this wave particle comes into contact with anything else like another particle a molecule anything when it's in this wave state it's said to be in a state of coherence when it's broken or measured the decoherence decoherence is the reason physicists need to work in such specific conditions when they're dealing with quantum mechanical effects in the macroscopic world we're used to there are so many particles and molecules bouncing around so much jostling and wiggling due to the heat that coherence doesn't last long enough to be detected this is why we don't see quantum mechanical effects in our day-to-day lives it's also one of the main struggles with the creation of quantum computers physicists come up with all kinds of clever and expensive ways to shield their precious particles from the evils of the outside worlds cooling them to near absolute zero temperatures and attempting to keep them in complete isolation but so far nothing has worked to keep decoherence at bay and now this paper was suggesting that plants could ward off deacons at normal temperatures and conditions it didn't make sense the MIT physicist sent one of their members Seth Lloyd to investigate this claim what he came back with surprised everyone let's take a look at this paper which caused such a stir an experiment was performed at the University of California Berkeley using a technique with the very impressive name of two dimensional Fourier transform electron spectroscopy the research team was able to probe into the inner structure of a photosynthetic complex they fired three successive pulses of laser light into it which generated a light signal which was then picked up by a detector if there really was coherence among the excitons they should be able to see interference between the different pathways a so-called quantum beat the leading author on the paper Greg Engel spent the entire night stitching together the data and found exactly what he was looking a rising and falling signal like the interference pattern produced when waves interfere in other words this quantum beep showed that the exciton wasn't taking a single route through the chlorophyll maze but was following multiple routes simultaneously this was a huge shock to the scientific community the MIT physicists were forced to admit that they may have laughed too soon numerous experiments have been performed since then confirming this results however the story is far from over although this quantum beep keeps showing up there's still debate over how to interpret it some experts in the field think that the beats are caused by molecular vibrations not coherence others think the observed coherence was too small in amplitude to have originated in excitons and then there are others who think that this quantum beat is in fact direct evidence for quantum biological processes let's just say there are mixed vibes research is still going on to understand how photosynthesis is so efficient and may lead to insights to create quantum computers and other technologies quantum biology is an amazing area of research rich with possibilities this video was about the biological processes that plants use but what about the processes that govern our own bodies in the next part of this series over on Pat's Channel we'll see how a quantum biological process may be responsible for the engines that run our own bodies enzymes I've linked to it in the description make sure to check it out and subscribe to pat while you're over there I will see you in the next episode of up an atom where we talk about how birds may use quantum entanglement to navigate the globe as always a huge thank you to all my patrons on patreon who helped make these videos possible thank you for watching and I'll see you in the next episode bye you
