 now that you've seen that this execution gives us the same result that we explained before I want to show you two additional ways that people discuss the quantum state [Music] hi welcome back to coding with Kiska this is Abe again you might remember in our last video we talked about how we could build quantum circuits using Kiska to manipulate qubits quantum circuits can be used to make qubits do all sorts of interesting things the key to understanding quantum circuits where they're complicated or simple will be to understand how quantum gates act on the individual qubits and how they work together the point of this video will be to enable you to learn how quantum gates work on your own luckily with the right tools you can understand how all of kiss gets quantum gates work as open source software kiss kit has a number of gates programmed into it already so looking at my screen here I'm showing you an overview of the quantum gates available in kiss kit the link to this page will be available in the description below so you can see here this list contains gates like the H gate also called the Hadamard gate C X identity you three gates u two gates u wan gates and so on and in fact in kiss kit you can even create your own custom gates there are many different ways to think about quantum gates some of them are more visual and some of them are mathematical so one of these gates for example is the ex gate so let's get right into it saying the ex gate applied to state zero gives you the state 1 and the ex gate applied to state 1 gives you the state 0 so this is one representation that you'll see around the other representation is to take note of the fact that these gates are actually unitary operations and all that means is that they can be represented as matrices unitary matrices in particular and their operations can also be seen as operations on vectors which are the states so by doing that the ex gate is represented in this way the zero state is represented in this way and if you write out the matrix multiplication you'll find out that the result is the following so this is exactly equal to that representation the third and fourth ways that you'll see people talking about how a quantum circuit works is in terms of both its visual representation and how the circuit works as a result of measurements to see these will go straight into kiss kit as always I'll start off by importing kiss get into my workspace so that can be done by typing out from his kit import everything I will also be using the visualization tools in kiss kit so I can do that by writing out from kiss kit tools visualization import plot block multi-vector okay so now that we've imported kiss kit and the right tools that we need to do our work I'm going to do the following so I'll create a quantum circuit with one qubit and one classical bit so that quantum circuit will have one operation on it it'll just be Circuit X applied to that qubit so what I'm going to do is take this quantum circuit and simulate it and see what the output of that quantum circuit is so the way to do that is to say the simulator is air dot get back end this time I'm going to use what's called the state vector simulator if you're curious the state vector is the vector that describes the quantum state of our qubits so that's where the name state vector simulator comes from and I'll say execute this circuit on the back end that I choose to be the simulator and I'll say the results from this execution will be stored in a variable called result and the state vector will be result dot get state vector and just so we can see that this is working I'll say print state vector all right so as you can see the state vector that's returned from the circuit when it only has one X gate on it is the vector 0 with 0 imaginary component and one with 0 imaginary component this state vector is exactly what you saw in our representation before where we wrote out X applied on the state 0 is the state 1 so let's look at our quantum circuit so what I'm going to do is say circuit dot draw and I'll be using the mat plot live output and I'll be saying just before that mat fought live in line so what we're saying is the output of this quantum circuit is the state vector 0 1 now that you've seen that this execution gives us the same result that we explained before I want to show you two additional ways that people discuss the quantum state so the next way that I'm going to show you is a bit more visual and tends to be the favorite of a lot of people what I can do is say plot block multi vector and the thing I'm going to describe what this is the state vector and this is what the state vector looks like when it's plotted on a block sphere so one thing you'll notice is that people refer to operations on quantum states as rotations on the sphere and in fact what that ex gate has done is take us from the state zero to the state one and that's why that vector is pointing down in the direction of the state one so it turns out that quantum states for individual qubits can be represented on this sphere as any point throughout the surface of the sphere and in particular the one that we're working on here the state one is the very bottom point of the sphere and finally remember that you can always run this quantum circuit execute measurement and find out what the results of those measurements are so in kiss kit this is done as follows so what I'm going to do is add a measurement to the circuit and I'm going to measure qubit zero and put that result in classical bits zero and I'm going to say back end is err get back and chasm simulator and I'm going to say execute this circuit on the back end and I'd like to do 1,024 shots and the result of this execution I'd like to take out and put in a variable called result and I would like to take the counts from this result and plot them out by using the plot histogram tool which is available from Kiska tool stock visualization import plot histogram and there you have it the result is that for a hundred percent of the results you get the result of one and that's because we have the state one represented by the output of the circuit and just real quick I also want to show you how to get the matrix representation of a circuit and the way to do this is very simple what I'll do is go back here and instead of state vector simulator what I'm going to do is say I want the unitary simulator so I'll just copy over this section of code and I'll say unitary simulator here and I'll say the unitary is the output and I'll change get state vector to get unitary and I'll print out the unitary that results from this operation and as you see here the matrix that's printed out is 0 1 1 0 and this is exactly the matrix that we used when we described the second method of talking about this quantum circuit which is that the ex gate is represented by the matrix 0 1 1 0 and if you're curious the meaning of these items 0 J is simply because each of these matrix elements is actually a complex number so it has a real part and an imaginary part and the number that you see here for example 0 plus 0 J means the real part is 0 and the imaginary part is also 0 this particular number has a real part 1 and an imaginary part 0 so that corresponds to the one that we've been seeing in our matrices before so we showed four different ways to talk about a quantum gate one ways to describe its operation by writing down as we saw before for example for the ex gate by saying X applied on the state zero gives you the state 1 the second way that we used was to describe the linear algebra behind how this gate works by saying the matrix for the X gate which is 0 1 1 0 acting on the vector for the 0 state which is 1 0 gives you the vector for the 1 state which is 0 1 the third way that we use to describe the operation of the X gate was by showing you something more visual by plotting out the state vector that results from applying that gate on a Bloch vector and the fourth way that we used to describe its operation is by running a circuit through a measurement and seeing what the measurement outcomes are so hopefully with all these tools you're now equipped to answer the question of how a quantum gate works and every time you encounter a new one you can ask yourself the question of how it's actually working in a quantum circuit so now that you know how to understand all of kiss gets quantum gates it's important for you to know that you're ready to move on to building more complicated quantum circuits next week we'll be covering your first quantum algorithm and this will be quantum teleportation let us know which method of talking about quantum gates made more sense to you for me personally I like to see the quantum circuit represented as a matrix so I like to write coding tisket and find out what the matrix corresponding to a quantum gate looks like thanks again for watching and we'll see you in the next video [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
