 special shout out to surf shark  vpns for sponsoring this video   keep your entire digital life secure on all your  devices with just one account using surfshark vpn since the dawn of our existence humans have  harnessed the power of nature to advance   our place in the world from using fire  to cook food and power steam engines   to channeling electricity to power homes and  send humans to the moon over the past century   computer technology has allowed humankind  to advance further than we ever imagined   now scientists and engineers are on the cusp  of taking us to our next evolutionary step   by harnessing the power of quantum mechanics to  create machines that can achieve the impossible   quantum computers are not just a more  advanced version of our current computers   they are something entirely new and different but  how do they work and are they really better than   our current computers traditional or classical  computers use binary digits or bits which are   the smallest units used to measure data bits are  like tiny switches that can either be in the on   position or the off position which are represented  by a one or a zero all computer data from cgi you   see in movies to the apps on your phone even this  video you're watching right now are made up of   millions of bits and some combination of ones  and zeros however even our most powerful super   computers have their limitations largely because  the actual physical world doesn't always exist in   an on or off or binary state the world is a bit  more unpredictable sometimes full of all kinds of   uncertainty over the last century physicists have  discovered that as we get down to the smallest   building blocks of our reality things become even  more uncertain the field of quantum mechanics   has evolved in order to help study and understand  strange phenomena that exist in the quantum realm   by harnessing these principles scientists and  engineers have been able to develop quantum   computers instead of bits quantum computers use  quantum bits or qubits which are often made out   of subatomic particles usually photons electrons  or ions these particles have a magnetic field or a   spin similar to a bar magnet with a north  and south pole when you place one of these   particles in a magnetic field it will align with  that field like a compass where the needle points   north because the magnet inside aligns itself with  the earth's magnetic pull when the compass needle   points north it is in the lowest energy state  called its zero state or spin down if energy   is applied to the compass needle it can point  downward against the pull of the magnetic field   this charge state is its one state or spin up so  like classical bits qubits have a one and zero   state but they have a very special attribute that  completely set them apart imagine that compass   needle again what might happen if you flick the  needle and it started to spin around rapidly   while it's in motion is it up or down the truth is  we might say it's both the quality of being both   up and down one and zero is called superposition  and it's what makes quivets so incredible where   classical bits can never only be zero or one  qubits can be both simultaneously why is this   quality so special imagine your computer is trying  to figure out a password that is four bits long   that might seem relatively simple but even just  four bits can have 16 different combinations   to figure out the password a traditional  computer would try each combination one at   a time until it found the one that worked but a  quantum computer could try all 16 combinations   at the same time because all four qubits can  exist as both a one or a zero simultaneously   essentially four equivalents have the same  computational capacity as 16 classical bits   this means a quantum computer can solve problems  like these in a fraction of the time it takes a   classical computer it also means that the power  of quantum computers grows exponentially the more   qubits you add the truth is that quantum computers  won't be universally helpful at least not at first   they won't for instance replace the computers in  your smartphone or laptop as they generally don't   handle very complex problems however there  are many areas where our current computers   really struggle and where quantum computers could  have a chance to shine the first is optimization   finding the best solution to a problem among many  possible solutions for instance trying to find the   most effective route between two points current  computers need to explore every possible solution   one at a time until it finds the most efficient  route this process would obviously be incredibly   time consuming especially if more complex data  points are factored into the equation however a   quantum computer in theory could explore every  possible route simultaneously before presenting   the most efficient route this type of optimization  holds immense potential for emerging technologies   like self-driving cars where a master system  could theoretically assess all the moving vehicles   traffic patterns stop signs and potential road  hazards all at the same time to present vehicles   with the safest and most efficient route possible  it could also revolutionize ai allowing computers   to analyze and program themselves by exploring all  possible data combinations and outcomes arriving   at the most efficient result besides optimization  quantum computers can also potentially trump   classical computers when it comes to advanced  simulations especially when it comes to problems   involving large unknown unquantifiable data points  this could revolutionize biology chemistry and   even physics itself as these computers utilize the  same principles that make up these disciplines our   current strongest fastest computers can only  simulate relatively small molecule clusters   mostly due to lack of processing space a quantum  computer could have the ability to factor in   all the various data points with these structures  accurately analyze them and stimulate them in real   time this processing power could revolutionize  medicine giving scientists the ability to   accurately simulate the very systems they are  trying to understand before we get back to the   show i want to take a quick moment and talk about  our sponsor surf shark if you've ever used public   wi-fi at the coffee shop or an airport your data  isn't very secure using a vpn service can encrypt   your data and ensure no one can see what you're  doing online and with an exit node in some other   location people won't even have a clue where  you're coming from that's interesting because   where a site thinks you're coming from might  determine the price you pay for things like   airplane tickets so try a few different locations  and make sure you always get the best deals   or maybe you want to access streaming content that  is only available for people in a specific region   you could do all that with surfshark so take  your online security to the next

anywhere   where large uncertain complicated problems  exist quantum computers have the chance to excel   and as the technology advances the applications  could be endless as of right now one of the   biggest inhibiting factors has been building and  managing these super machines because quantum   computers use particles that are smaller than  atoms they are extremely sensitive to all kinds   of interference such as shifts in temperature  or even electromagnetic waves to protect the   delicate superpositions quantum computer chips are  kept isolated in special containment vessels and   chilled down to near absolute zero which is colder  than interstellar space however in recent years   some of the biggest names in tech have achieved  some incredible breakthroughs in quantum computing   right now ibm has a quantum computer which  users can interact with on their website on   october 23rd 2019 google in partnership with the  us national aeronautics and space administration   nasa announced that it had achieved quantum  supremacy the point at which a quantum computer   can actually outperform a classical computer  according to a research paper published by the   tech giant their 54 qubit processor named sycamore  performed a target computation in 200 seconds   determining that it would take the world's fastest  supercomputers approximately 10 000 years to solve   these claims have been disputed by rivals like ibm  who claim their supercomputers could have solved   that problem in a matter of days not thousands  of years still google's achievements represent an   incredible breakthrough in quantum computing and  signal that this technology might be accessible   in the near future quantum computer technology  can truly usher in a new era of human evolution   a reality in which we can use our technology to  analyze information find viable solutions to the   biggest problems facing our planet and even spot  a few problems that we couldn't even see before this is a topic that i find really fascinating and  i think i need to keep reading up with it because   the level of progress is pretty staggering as i  made this video i realized that there's been more   advancement than i thought and this topic is crazy  complicated so if you have questions let us know   or if you're a master or work in this field please  leave us your comments and also in the future   if you want to see a video more in depth about  how the tech actually works let us know i think   historically we found covering topics more  topically generally appeals to more of you   but let us know it's always something we want  to hear from you guys about and just a reminder   we now have a youtube membership program  so if you want to support our effort there   we'll have a link in the description and of  course you can support us on patreon a special   shout out to all of our patrons on patreon for  all your support if you want to be a rock star   supporter
