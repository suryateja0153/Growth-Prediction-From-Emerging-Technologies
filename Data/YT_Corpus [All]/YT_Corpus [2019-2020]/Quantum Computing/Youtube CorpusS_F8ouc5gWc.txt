welcome everybody to this webinar i'm really glad you could take time out of your busy schedules to join us today my talk today is on an introduction to quantum computation um and before i get started let me just thank hong michael kayla and the ilp team for hosting this today great um what i'd like to do is i'd like to get started with a video that's from our mit x pro online professional development course it's it runs about four minutes um and it gives a very brief introduction to quantum computation and then i'll come back in right after that's done we hear about quantum computers nearly every day in the news in the popular press that's what's exciting about quantum computing and that's what we're doing it said that quantum computers will solve certain types of problems ones of tremendous importance to humankind and problems that today are practically prohibitive or maybe even impossible to solve with current computers we hear about pharmaceuticals and drug discovery gaining a better understanding of new materials like high temperature superconductors and how they work new methods for machine learning artificial intelligence optimization problems financial services and technology quantum computers will even challenge and change the way we securely communicate information it certainly sounds like a fantastic and exciting future which leads us to a few fundamental questions what exactly is a quantum computer and what's it good for more importantly when will we have one quantum computers are not just smaller faster versions of classical computers they're fundamentally different we're in the digital computer world of bid which is one basic element of information is a zero or a one nothing else in a quantum computer you can have a quantum bit or q bit that's in a superposition of zero left one we can design it we can actually control it we're actually engineering and manipulating quantum mechanics so when we'll have a quantum code is a very interesting and nuanced question and the answer will therefore be kind of finicky you've been saying computers are 10 years away we've been saying that for decades depending on your definition we already have a lot of computers they're just small within my lifetime this is not decades away or 100 years away that quantum age has now come quantum computers aren't simply faster smaller versions of the conventional computers we have today nor are they another incremental step in the evolution of moore's law rather quantum computers represent a new fundamentally different computing paradigm one that carries tremendous advantage for certain types of problems of importance quantum computing could really transform industries where there are significant optimization problems you've got a lot of discrete or binary decisions to make to figure out you do this first or that first this is where we shine another way to understand the difference between classical and quantum computers if you look at quantum systems of quantum circulation the quantum processor is a suitable tool for modeling other quantum systems biomolecule systems tons of systems that will use material systems work based on those quantum mechanical properties if you kind of need a quantum machine in order to simulate quantum effects when we can manipulate individual molecules and understand what's going on in those molecules how they bond then we'll be able to have a really good handle on generating new things and novel materials that might be very useful still we're just at the very beginning of quantum computing development assembling and testing the first prototype processors it's a bit like being in the 1950s at the dawn of transistor-based computing and just as integrated circuits led to an information processing revolution last century driving economic growth and productivity many people today believe that quantum computing will have similar impact this century climate computing and quantum algorithms present fundamentally new programming and algorithm design paradigms how do we fundamentally unlock new ideas in computing we're still learning a lot about how to improve the individual components as well as connect them together that's part of the fun that's where i'm there to see what can we do to enable the increased complexity and functionality of these cubes we're really here at the very beginning and it's i just find that tremendously exciting so it is a very exciting time for for quantum information science and technology and although today's talk is primarily about quantum computing let me just take a step back for a moment and and say that quantum technologies comprise uh the sensing of quantum information uh its distribution over quantum networks and then of course the processing of that information with quantum computers and if we had to define it succinctly i would say that quantum information science utilizes a quantum mechanical description of nature to sense communicate and compute information in ways that are unobtainable by a classical description of nature itself and so again the talk today will be primary primarily about quantum computation but let me just highlight a few areas in quantum sensing and quantum communication that the center for quantum engineering is also covering and this includes uh precise precision precision positioning navigation and timing uh remote sensing and detecting biomedical applications uh for example magnetic field sensing in the brain um next generation gps centimeter scale accuracy and the distribution of quantum entanglement and secure communication and i just mentioned here that mit is very fortunate to have a quantum communication testbed with fiber that runs from mit lincoln laboratory 42 kilometers down to the mit campus where we can test these different quantum communication protocols and so with that we'll get into quantum computing and before we get started i'd like to start with a poll question which you should see up here in front of you and the question basically is when do you think quantum commute computers um will be commercially um available useful viable and that that can mean different things to different people but what do you think um it will it be in three years um will it be within five years uh 10 years not 20 years or more who knows i'm unsure when do you think quantum computers are going to be commercially useful it's a tricky question right because even as donna rosenberg said in the video that we just saw that we actually have quantum processors today and as we'll see and as we'll talk about in the panel discussion there are small scale quantum processors available to us now but the question is when will they become commercially viable and of course they generate revenue already but but but when will they generate profit okay and so it looks like the poll results are in um and we'll share these with everybody um at the end so i'm asked this question quite often and the way that i typically will address it is by you know i can't see the future any more than anyone else and so what i do is i take a look back at the history of classical electronic computing and here's a timeline that i'm showing here um the vacuum tube was invented in 1906 and it was used for radio transceivers for a number of years but it was a full 40 years before we had our first um vacuum tube based computer called the eniac and that was in 1946 at the university of pennsylvania around this time the transistor was invented in 1947 at bell labs and although within about 10 years mit lincoln laboratory had built the first fully transistor-based computer called tixo based on these transistors it's very different than what we know of today i mean these transistors were soldered together um used a magnetic core memory etc now around that time the first integrated circuits were developed at texas instruments and it was yet another 15-ish 20 years or so before we had the first chips that we would recognize today built by intel for example the the 4004 with 2000 transistors in the early 70s it would take another 25 years to get to the pentium pro with millions of transistors and then another 20 years to get to where we are today with multi-core processors and gpus with with billions and billions of transistors so if we look back at this timeline it's well over 100 years of development to get from the first elemental logic elements to where we are today now we can compare that or contrast it with quantum computing which is still at its very beginning it's it's nascent um in the early 80s richard feynman proposed that if you want to simulate a quantum system you had better use a quantum system to do it because it's a hard problem there are many many degrees of freedom and you know theorists thought about this for again a good 10 or 15 years before we started to see the first quantum algorithms theoretically speaking the first quantum algorithms like shores factorization algorithm grover's algorithm for search quantum annealing and adiabatic quantum computing and from that point forward um it was a good you know 10 or 15 years to get to where we are today where we have the first few qubit processors um you know in the cloud with five uh 16 20 qubits and then just last year the google team demonstrated quantum advantage with a 53 cubic quantum processor so what's the takeaway message well the first thing that i take away from this is that quantum computing is real and it's transitioning from scientific laboratory curiosity to technical reality that's happening right now i also take away that what we all know that you know advancing from a fundamental discovery in a laboratory to a useful machine takes time and it takes engineering and of course you must be in the game to play um it may not be surprising that many of the leading technology companies today uh who are manufacturing hardware uh were in this from the very beginning or they bought companies that were in it from the very beginning and of course we use these quantum computers to run algorithms and i list here many of the algorithms that we know of today or at least the categories i'm not going to read this whole chart but let me just illustrate or articulate the columns we have the classical time that would take a classical computer we have the quantum time which would take on a quantum computer at scale and then the speed up and limitations related to research today now um if you look at these algorithms the one thing that stands out to me is that many of them were either developed or advanced by mit faculty for example uh of course shore's factoring algorithm um which is used for cryptanalysis and in particular the rsa crypt crypto scheme i was developed by peter shore um quantum simulation which many believe is going to be the killer app for quantum computers whether to develop new chemistry or new materials again has a big influence from researchers at mit troy virus and seth lloyd linear systems of equations of course are very important um sampling solutions to very very large matrices aaron harrow and seth lloyd optimization problems and then of course search problems so all of these are very important problems i mean if you think about optimization optimization is ubiquitous and everybody's trying to optimize optimize something whether it's a financial portfolio or a technical challenge like trying to orient the satellites in space with multiple users and multiple vantage points optimization is ubiquitous so there's a lot of promise to quantum computing that's fantastic so well what's the problem why don't we have one today and it comes down to two characteristic times that i'd like to introduce one is the coherence time and the other is the gate time so the coherence time you can think of this as the quantum bit the fundamental logic elements quantum mechanical lifetime how long its quantumness remains viable if we have a cubit we can put it in a quantum state which we represent with this capital psi letter and at time t equals zero we know exactly what it is but this qubit is always interacting with its environment and over time this state decays and eventually blurs and is completely lost now the qubit didn't disappear the qubit is still there but the problem is the state that it's in after some time period is unknown to me as the algorithm designer and this lifetime due to environmental disruption is called the coherence time now the second time scale we care about is the gate time and this is the time required to perform um a logic operation so quantum computers just like classical computers use logic gates to implement quantum logic these are single qubit gates and two cubic gates and with single and two cubic gates a handful of them one can implement any quantum logic just like in a classical computer if you have one bit and two bit gates a few of them you can implement any boolean logic so the time to implement one of these gates on a quantum computer is called the gate time and as you might imagine then there's a figure of merit which is basically how many gates can i perform within the coherence time that i have and and this figure of merit is important because it emphasizes something um that that is a bit nuanced but but is certainly true is that it's not enough for qubit to have a very long coherence time it's it's what's really important is how many gates can i perform within the coherence time that i have and so with this what we can do is we can look at many of the qubit technologies or modalities that are being investigated today and we can plot this in the following way we have this figure of merit on this axis which is the number of gates or operations i can perform within the coherence time before there's an error and on this axis is the gate speed how fast the gates are and um just like with classical computers faster is better now on this axis here is gate fidelity and we see that the gate fidelity is just one to one in the number of operations before an error so if i have 100 operations before an error that's 99 fidelity a thousand operations before an error that's 99.9 percent fidelity etcetera that's how that's defined and that we have a red line here and i just mentioned this that if you've heard of something called quantum error correction which is a way to add redundancy to improve the overall performance of the system uh that's great but when you do that the individual elements need to be at least so good beyond some threshold such that when you add more and more together things actually get better rather than things getting worse and this threshold is roughly at the 99 level for the most lenient error correcting codes that we know and of course best performance then is in the upper right corner so with that setup we can now look at different technologies there are a number of qubits which uh technologies that have demonstrated single qubit gates and i just list them here for example phosphorus doping in silicon or the silicon mos dot and these technologies are just recently demonstrating two cubic gates the remainder here though have demonstrated the universal set of gates needed for quantum logic and these are single and two cubic gates and you can see a number of technologies which i'll highlight uh in the coming slides so one of the two most um advanced technologies today is trapped ions and um here are some researchers uh chuang and rajiv ram at mit campus as well as john chaborini and jeremy sage at mit lincoln lab investigating trapped ions and the other is super conducting qubits which is my own research area along with kevin o'brien terry orlando and jamie kerman at lincoln lab and if if i had to say you know very succinctly what are we researching trapped ions are trying to make their gates faster okay and they're also trying to improve the two-qubit fidelity and superconducting qubits they're already fast enough and they're basically trying to make higher fidelity gains now speed still matters right and and you can think of it this way is that if a quantum algorithm is exponentially faster than a classical algorithm that's fantastic you know it no longer takes me 10 000 years to run a task it takes me much less time but still there's a difference between slow and fast in the following sense which is that if it takes me a day on my superconducting cubic quantum computer which is running at maybe 100 megahertz um a thousand times faster than a trapped iron quantum computer all else being equal that's a very important caveat um that a day on a superconducting quantum computer would be a thousand days on a trapped ion quantum computer and so the gate speed still matters and that's why trapped ions are trying to increase the speed with which they can perform their logic we're also investigating other technologies uh at mit and lincoln laboratories so uh one is neutral atoms and here are vlad vladim bouletich wolfgang ketterley and martin sveirlein uh working on this area also nd centers by dirk england and paula capolaro and um daniel brady at lincoln lab and um my own group is starting silicon quantum dots research as well um so there are many candidate technologies under development to realize the promise of quantum computing and although i've cast these in the context of quantum computing many of these technologies are also used as quantum sensors or as a means to facilitate communication of quantum communication so there's a lot of promise for quantum computing and as a result there's tremendous investment going on worldwide and we'll talk more about this certainly in the panel session but what you can see here is a number of efforts i won't read through them all being funded worldwide in quantum computing by nations by states but what's really changed in the last several years is that um companies have realized the value and potential value of quantum computing uh to their bottom line and in fact many entrepreneurial startup companies are realizing that there are services that they can generate and um and sell and so it's in this context that we formed last year the center for quantum engineering as an initiative between mit lincoln laboratory and the research laboratory of electronics at mit that was that was the instantiation of it but it is institute wide and so let me just talk briefly about the center you can find uh the center website shown here at this url our mission statement is to the academic pursuit and practice of quantum engineering to accelerate the practical applications of quantum technologies and i want to emphasize that quantum means science and engineering of course means engineering and so quantum engineering is both science and engineering the science is not over but we need to start engineering systems of quantum qubits the objectives here are many fold but let me just mention four of them uh the first is to define quantum engineering what is it and what are the textbooks we have to write them what does the curriculum look like we have to develop it um and we use it to educate tomorrow's quantum engineers and create a quantum workforce for this growing field and to do that we want to partner with industry via consortium model which i'll talk about in a moment and our general goals are to advance quantum science and engineering and so we we have a large membership this is a partial list i couldn't fit everybody on one slide but as i mentioned it comprises membership from the mit campus many departments across the institute you'll see physics electrical engineering material science chemistry chemical engineering mathematics etc as well as membership from lincoln laboratory and we have a number of engagements that we've initiated over the past year it's continuing to grow one of the major ones um was where that video came from at the beginning that's the mit x pro professional development series of courses um it was underwritten and sponsored by ibm and there are two classes uh four courses actually the fundamentals of quantum computing as two classes and then the practical realities of quantum computing has another two classes and you can learn more about the professional development courses uh here at this url um ike chuang and myself were the faculty leads and we taught it um teach it with peter shaw and aaron harrow we've had more than 2 000 learners take it in the last 18 months and we're now offering it multiple times per year and it the focus is on people who are already in industry and want to pivot towards quantum technologies uh the second engagement is with the laboratory for physical sciences and this enabled us to form the center for quantum engineering the cqe lps doc bedard fellowship program uh doc bredard was an nsa lps scientist for many many years really spearheaded the use of cryogenic electronics for classical computation and through this program um we have now eight three-year fellowships uh graduate fellowships um a few sponsored research programs that we administer through the cqe and funds to develop uh quantum curricula we also facilitate faculty industry engagement i just give one example here which i think liz one of the panelists will talk about as well and that is um through a very generous donation from keysight technologies we are developing a 64-qubit testbed system uh at mit um and keysight technologies in particular is interested in seeing their electronics being used in state-of-the-art experiments and of course another industrial engagement is in fact the quantum science and engineering consortium industrial group so that group of course is a membership program and as a member the entry fee is 150k per year and startups we want to include them as well in this ecosystem so we charge them only 10k per year because you know money is quite valuable to a startup but time is also valuable to them and so we charge them time they have to show up um they're i won't get into all the details their options if you're an existing big member or mit.nano member there are options of how to join um at a reduced cost but what's important is the value proposition for doing this um one is access to faculty and research at mit another is engagement for the fantastic students and postdocs that we have which then leads downstream to recruitment opportunities we host a number of special events workshops throughout the year as well as the ability to network with other members in the consortium we provide discounts to these professional development programs um and um perhaps most popular i guess we'll see is that the ability to customize membership fee dues so of that 150k that um you might spend as a due um 100k you can customize you can send that to a faculty member a laboratory you get to choose how that 100k is spent within the auspices of quantum science and engineering another 25k we hold and use for faculty startups or infrastructure and then 25k is used for the operations costs of the center and what that means is that 83 of your fees are going directly to supporting research activities at mit and i'll highlight that these funds are in fact a gift which makes them discretionary and at mit that means they don't incur overhead and so these funds go even further than say a sponsored research agreement so that leads me to the second poll question um which i would like your input on um and that's basically with the center for quantum quantum science and engineering consortium the benefits or value proposition that i just spoke about which of them would you or your company find most valuable or attractive and in this one you can select all that apply um and again you know the options are access to faculty and research you know this means that you can call up a faculty member um if you've customized your dues to this person they're very likely to pick up the phone and and have a conversation right um talk about your interest in quantum you also get early access to the research that's going on of course there's also engagements with students and that leads to recruiting downstream mit students as you know are just simply fantastic um special events and workshops the ability to network in addition to companies and startups that will be attending um our these workshops and annual events we we we also will invent uh invite members of the us government who are sponsoring uh research in this area uh discounts on professional development programs as i've mentioned and also there's opportunities if you're in multiple consortia that we can uh provide discounts there and then again the customization of the membership fee that 83 is going to go directly to um to research here at mit so i'd like to hear um from your perspectives which of these are the most valuable uh or the most attractive um okay and that that has come in and and it's looks like access to faculty and research as well as the special events um and students are high good thank you for that okay okay so now moving on so i want to emphasize that mit the institute is not just mit campus i've mentioned lincoln lab a couple times and i want to emphasize here that lincoln lab is mit's national laboratory it's a department of defense national lab it's it's a fantastic place it's where i started my career and lincoln lab has well over 100 people who are working on quantum information science and technology uh from sensors to quantum communication to quantum computing as well and there's many ways in which we uh interact and part of the center's mission is to make this interaction easier and facilitate it and i just bring up one example here um in terms of fabrication um lincoln laboratory has fantastic fab facility it's a dod trusted foundry iso 9001 certified and this is a place where we can do high-yield reproducible fabrication processes at a larger scale building test beds this fabrication line is a 200 millimeter fabrication line and as you know just recently mit invested more than 400 million dollars in what's called mit.nano which is a companion facility at the mit campus and and this is really fantastic for quantum information because this facility is more than two times larger than any other us academic facility and this is where we can do novel rapid prototyping exploratory research on smaller wafers and we we will have in fact 200 millimeter away for tools we're installing some this year and so the interaction between nano and lincoln laboratories mel um is going to be very strong and complementary and this is just one example of where we can impact materials research fabrication engineering and and the like so with that let me conclude and just say what i think quantum engineering is and and really it's an institute-wide effort if we want to build future quantum systems we first need to build test beds and to do that we need to bridge the science and mathematics side of mit the school of science physics math computer science with the classical engineering the school of engineering such as analog and digital circuits control dsp materials and fab and both of these sides need to pivot to quantum and so i view quantum engineering as the bridge which is connecting science math and classical engineering um let me just briefly mention that we've selected a number of panelists today um to to to partake in our discussion and i really appreciate their their attending today both from government and from industry so dr charlie tahan uh dr eric lucero um ms liz rooch and dr christopher savoie and i'll introduce them one by one as they um as they come on but i want to mention that charlie's with the u.s government ostp in the national quantum coordination office eric is with google and represents a maker of quantum computing systems liz is with keysight technologies making the electronics which will go around quantum sensors or quantum computers and um christopher is with zapata which is building uh the algorithm developing the algorithms that we're going to use and is representing the startup community so with that let me summarize you know quantum sensing quantum communication and quantum computing is transitioning to reality that's happening today and as a result we've instantiated the center for quantum engineering it's enabling this transition research education workforce development outreach and more but also engagement with industry and that led us to the industrial consortium the cusec and mitx pro was our first online set of courses for professional development but we're now expanding both to curricula at mit um and we're also sponsoring uh recently the coding school which was had more than 300 on high schoolers for a week-long course in fact taught by two of them graduate students um and for more information um at any time please feel free to contact me at this email right here and so with that i'll stop sharing my screen
