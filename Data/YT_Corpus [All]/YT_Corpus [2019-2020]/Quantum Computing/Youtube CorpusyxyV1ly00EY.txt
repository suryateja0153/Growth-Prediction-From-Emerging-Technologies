 good morning everyone my name is Miguel Somalia and today i bring you a less technical talk alright this is this a disclaimer I'm going to give you a talk that's much wider because I figured I want to do something different and also because we'll have a lot of time to get our hands dirty along the next few days so do not expect any of these in my talk all right let's just skip it this is me a brief presentation I am a master student I'm in the first of two years of a master's degree in Portugal that's Portugal we we are known for Cristiano Ronaldo and other things but we are we also have a growing quantum community so what I'm going to talk to you about today is my experience in learning computing quantum computing I didn't do this through a university degree I did this on my own and I want to share with you the trebles ahead the lessons I learned and some takeaways that you'll see at the end so it all started in 2018 more or less a year ago I was already interested in quantum computing but I didn't know a lot about it and the first the first I would say the sparkle that ignited my interest was a TEDx talk by Professor Cohen Bertels he's from Delft University perhaps you've heard of him and it really got me interested in the topic and so I decided start investing on it I first started professors Vizier on his course on Berkeley Berkeley EDX probably some of you have also done this course and then I just I had a few opportunities at my university like lectures of invited speakers I read some books surveys forums I started getting the gist of it and also of course like many of you I don't doubt I started hanging around kids kids and this was also a mark like milestone because I felt like I could have feedback and I'm from a background in computer science so feedback for us is very important and kiss kids have was essentially a good opportunity to have that and so last summer I was at an event in in my University University of Porto and professor Cohen Bertels actually was there to give a talk and so I eventually had a chance to engage with conversation with him and I asked him if it would make sense for me to make my Erasmus for one semester in Delft and then try and apply for for the thesis on the second semester this is how my course is designed so it would be total of one year and his answer left me well I couldn't answer he just said no but you're there with expectations and someone tells you no and then he said well you see we've tried and it doesn't work if you want to invest in your quantum education you need to take a leap this is a cliff you have to jump and we'll be there to catch you but you have to give everything and this really stuck and so I eventually learned about IBM IBM's contest it was already a bit late for a few of them and so I decided to go for the teachmeet quantum actually it made the most sense given what you've just heard I had a lot of different sources of information but I felt that I needed a place where I could have for instance learned about kids kids and quantum mechanics at the same time and that was liking so this happened ok this was my project for the teach me quantum I'm not going to go very deep into details it's available available online it's actually open source so the idea behind it is to have something that teachers all over the world can go there fork and make their own and then they can adapt it to their to their students and essentially it just goes from the basics and always tries to and I always try to give exercises like using the tools we we've already seen and giving people a chance to do to have this feel like I wanted to have had about what it is to feel what you are learning and this well it went well so taking a leap was it okay and so now I want to leave you with a few remarks to think about the first one is all or nothing and this is the one I've already explained more thoroughly if we are here and as I think all of you are you are here for a reason you want to invest in this field and if it makes sense to you to be here and it makes sense to put all of you into this and this is the first thing that I learned about about this area and of course this is not just for quantum computing but like professor Cohen said you have to take the leap and then another thing this is also extrapolated from where I told you you can turn your problems for instance you are using kiss get at home and you find a bug or you find an imprecision a typo anything the good thing about open source is that you are already turning problems into solutions you go to kiss kit you fork it you make a pull request and you solve the those problems and this i think sometimes is something that we don't do on a larger scale because we have a problem and we solve it for ourselves but what if we can just solve it for everyone at the same time this is the way of progress and lastly this is actually a challenge I want to leave you with we are a growing community I would say that critical mass is at our doorstep so it's our responsibility to let it in we're not I think there yet so we have a community that is growing and it will continue growing I'm sure but one thing that we can take away is take today's today's technical standing we have our main limitation is building quantum computers we already have the algorithms we just need baram's machines how could for instance ibm's labs try to get the community to help them solving their problems their daily problems that would of course have an impact on building quantum computers instead of just doing that in house you know what I mean you have to try to make use of this freelancing quantum community okay and now I just want to leave you again with a with a final remark this is something I brought from Portugal it's not from Cristiano Ronaldo okay and it's from a Portuguese poet and what he said at a certain point was put all that you are into everything that you do and this is the message I bring and the message I want to leave you with his name is actually friend so it's roughly translated okay and so that's it I look forward to meeting you over the next few days and thank you [Applause]
