 first of all i'd like to thank all the people that have tuned in today and i'm happy to uh teach you how to simulate chemistry on a quantum computer this is going to be the the the first part of a two-day lecture so i think tomorrow there's going to be the second part and without further ado let's start to um list the topics that i'm gonna cover in this class well first of all you're gonna learn how to construct qubit hamiltonians for molecules then so this is going to entail learning something about second quantization notation for fermionic system which is what we use really to map molecules to molecule sorry map molecules to qubit objects then i'm gonna introduce you to the some basics of fermion through qubit mappings and then finally i'm going to teach you why operational quantum algorithms work why they work on the current noisy devices that we have and what are some popular variational wave functions for bqe for variational quantum algorithms and finally a bit of open challenges and i hope as at the end of this at the end of this class you should be able to tackle the lithium hydride challenge as as brian was mentioning in the introduction okay the first subject of this class is how to build cubic hamiltonian out of molecules but first of all let's uh let's explain how to get molecular hamiltonian first in feminic second quantization language and uh without even mean actually before diving in into molecular and feminine hamiltonians just a few words on why we're interested in simulating quantum chemistry on quantum computers the thing is quantum chemistry it's a really nice application because it really sits here at the intersection of these three interesting features so it's a problem for which we certainly have a quantum speed up it's a problem that doesn't require many qubits as other ones for example uh condensed matter or high energy physics problems and also has some practical applications so you can think of actually really targeting addressing a state-of-the-art real-world problem with some hundreds of perfect qubits okay so noiseless qubits which is not what we have now but still uh the amount of hardware that you that we need to tackle chemistry problems it's it's way less okay so that's why we are uh focusing so much on uh quantum chemistry and that's why also this this class is about solving quantum chemistry with quantum computers okay now the question is what can really quantum computers do for quantum chemistry problems well they can certainly target ground state properties so we'll see what that means but for the moment you can what i'm going to tell you is that the access to ground state properties for molecular systems gives us access to useful information such as reaction rates and molecular structure okay so we'll see what that means in a few slides okay this is a first one that is molecular hamiltonians so the ones from the ones of you who have a chemistry background will certainly recognize this hamiltonian this is basically a model for the interaction of a set of electrons and a set of nuclei so you know a molecule is nothing else than a collection of atoms in space which is somehow very stable energetically okay so this this is our molecule you see it here so if we draw some a reference frame in a three-dimensional space we see that this molecule it's characterized by the coordinates of its atoms so we have three atoms here and their coordinates for example we can call them our a our b r c and then we're going to have a bunch of electrons floating around uh quantum mechanically in in in orbitals around these uh these objects okay and this this operator here this hamiltonian it really gives you the energy the quantum mechanical energy of this system comprised of a bunch of nuclei and a bunch of electrons so we have a theorem in this energy which describes the kinetic energy for these electrons a nuclear kinetic energy a electron nuclear nuclei coulomb interaction which is actually attractive because electrons are are negatively charged while nuclei are positively charged an electron electron repulsive coulomb interaction and the nuclei nuclei again repulsive columbia interactions so the name of the game here is we want to know what is the minimal eigenvalue of this operator so what we are targeting is a time independent schrodinger equation which is this this equation here so what we really want to know is what states psi satisfy this equation where h here is is the operator defined this h is is the same operator defined out here and specifically we would like to know the the ground state energy so we would like to know for which uh which value of e which is the smallest value of e that satisfies this this equation and so you can see that in this hamiltonian we have the nuclei coordinates this this r a b and uh some electron coordinates this r r aj so you can think of the r i j being the um the electron chord again so this h is an operator acting on quantum states [Music] h can be represented as a matrix and we are interested in knowing the lowest eigenvalue of h so we want to know the value of h0 so we want really to know that the minimal um you know the the smallest eigenvalue of this hamiltonian h for which uh this equation is is satisfied well so why is that interesting that's interesting because knowing the value of e0 for different special configuration of the atoms in this molecule will give us access to something like reaction rates for uh molecular reactions and that could that could be uh you know that that could allow the for example the discovery of new drugs or the design of new materials if you want so the way it works it's it's this one so imagine again i told you that a molecule is completely specified by the coordinates of its atoms so imagine that we plot the energy of this molecule which is really the average value of h over some quantum states as a function of the coordinates so as a function of the coordinates of the atom that compose this molecule and then we can explore so we can search in this landscape here and we can explore this landscape and check what is the value of e0 i guess i should write it i should write as zero what is the value of e0 for each value of the of the special coordinates of the atoms that that compose this molecule and this is useful information because you can think of a reaction rate so the speed at which a certain reaction occurs as depending exponentially on uh energy differences in this landscape okay so if we know if we find e0 at this very high energetic point and uh e0 at this low energetic point this this energy difference delta e0 is going to give us information about the reaction rate that's um that's happening in um in our lab for example okay and so if this will allow you to uh you know make prediction make predictions of reaction rates without actually going to the lab and trying different you know try a bunch of reactants and then see what what sticks together and the good thing about this is that the good thing in using quantum computers to target this is that this problem is exponentially hard problem if you want to if you want to target us if you want to target it with classical methods whereas with quantum computers this has some exponential advantage at least let's say at least in in a memory perspective okay so encoding loading the ground state and trial states for this hamiltonian cost function has a exponentially improved benefit with respect to targeting the same problem with classical computers and we're going to solve this problem we're going to tackle this problem in the born oppenheimer approximation so in the border prime approximation basically you can think of it as the nuclei of of these atoms like being fixed in space and not moving okay so think that uh think of this problem if you want from uh if you want to have a classical intuition about this problem you can think of a bunch of of um really like a bunch of balls by attracting and repulsing each other and you can think of some of these balls being much much heavier than the other ones and so the heavy bowls are the nuclei which are thousands of times heavier than the electrons and so of course a an object which is thousands of times heavier than the other one when they interact together it's not going to move okay so it's not going to feel too much the repulsion of between the two objects as the the lighter one the lighter object okay so this is the spirit of the born opponent approximation so the born opponent approximation tells us that the nuclei are fixed and we're only dealing with a bunch of electrons quantumly you know moving around these nucleis and this is a lot of beautiful words but mathematically what this means is that we can neglect this term in this hamiltonian because remember that this was the kinetic energy of the nuclei but since they're not moving and now this this becomes zero and also this term here which was the coulomb contribution to the molecular energy coming from the repulsion of these nuclei which are now static which are now fixed position in space it becomes just an energy shift so if you want we have simplified the problem so what we're really dealing with is a problem of interacting electrons which is still exponentially hard but somehow better than the full original problem okay now let's start to see like how this the the these nuclei and electrons are even uh you know how we can even hope to map them into a bunch of cubits so in the state of qubits living in our quantum hardware for example in the the ibm quantum processors so i hope that from the previous classes you get some basic concepts of what is a wave function and what is the wave function or the state of a bunch of qubits but now something that i would like to have you reflect on and i'm sure i think nobody in the previous classes told you is that qubits are distinguishable okay what does this mean this is very a precise meaning okay so if you take two qubits for example uh qubit one and qubit two in this um and this a nice picture of ib of ibm superconducting processor then their wave function can be this one so this is qubit one and qubit two okay so qubit one is in the chi-1 state and qubit 2 is in the chi-2 state okay so this is a physical meaning so it means that when i go to my device and i measure this guy and i physically know that it is this cubit sitting on at this specific position of the chip and so on this will have the state kai one well while this other guy will have the state k2 okay so this seems like kind of like a trivial thing but it's not if we start to talk about electrons electrons are actually not distinguishable electrons or if you want in general fermions they are indistinguishable particles or uh sometimes sometimes people call them identical okay so this means that mathematically has a very precise meaning so it means that the total wave function for a system of two electrons cannot be of the form that i've showed you before so it has to be this form okay now look at this at this function here so now we don't know anymore which one of the two electrons in this case is in the state chi 1 or chi 2. so this information is completely undetermined right it's undetermined because you know um this is a in anti-symmetric uh superposition of this this state here so the message that i'm trying to pass you is that so electrons and and fermions have always are always in a wave function state of this form okay so you cannot tell in any in any situation if a certain electron is in a certain state okay so that information is is scrambled between all electrons and note that this is a anti-symmetric a wave function okay so antisymmetric means that if i exchange particle one with two it takes a minus sign okay now you may be wondering but why that is the case well that's not really up to us to explain at least uh maybe not at this level there's something like more kind of like more fundamental that you could say about this but really what um what we are dealing uh what we are dealing with here is that this is how nature works okay so there is really this is really like a fundamental phenomenon and um so if you ask me why this is the case i would say this is our nature words okay so fermions are always in an antisymmetric state okay so if we are uh convinced of this uh well i guess we have to be convinced of this fact by the way this this the nature the anti-symmetric nature of the fermions has a lot of implications in a lot of things um for example thermodynamical properties right so the the thermodynamics of fermions is very different from the one of distinguishable particles but we're not going to cover that here okay so for for now just uh we're just going to assume that a generic familiar wave function is anti-symmetric okay so this was an example for two qubits now what if i have uh this wave function here was a two qubit example what if i have n qubits how do i write down a generic anti-symmetric wave function for um and uh sorry any fermions okay so for any fermions what we have is that the their wave function can be written as a linear superposition of determinants okay so now i have um [Music] now i have sorry now i have up n fermionic states which uh let's start calling them anaphyla orbitals okay so i have k1 k2 up to chi n fermionic orbitals which means of feminic states and these states are anti-symmetrically distributed among n particles okay so n electrons at this so this this notation here it means that uh this this this function is a uh determinant okay so this this these two lines that that you see here it means that we are taking a determinant of this matrix made up of wave functions okay and this determinant here it's called these later this is later determining and you can express always any uh feminine wave function of n electrons sitting in and atomic orbitals as a slater determiner at this but this notation it's kind of it's kind of like very tricky as it's very involved right so this this determinant has a lot of terms and we don't really worry we don't really want to carry around each time like this is very a heavy notation so let's define a more agile notation for this kind of anti-symmetric wave function okay so let me let me define this the wave function of my system in this way so this is a anti-anti-symmetrization operator so it takes the state the state here and it creates a it creates an anti-symmetric superposition of this state and other states which have their orbitals swap between the different electrons such that a permutation of any two electrons in this wave function is going to result in a total minus sign and also this can be defined in a more compact way and the way it can be defined is that i'm gonna i'm gonna use big strings to to define the state of my fermions in my system i'm going to place a one or a zero okay so whether the whether there is an electron or not in the eighth orbital in the i feminic orbital or from young mode if you want so since in this case we have n electrons in in actually n electrons in n modes uh we're going to have old ones here okay so this state is exactly n electrons uh distributed on n modes okay but other number of possibilities are are other possible configurations are allowed right so i can have for example um m electrons distributed on n orbitals okay so uh instead of having states of all ones here i could have something like that okay so this will be a state width and particles and electrons and this will be a state wave of n minus okay of less number of electrons because some of these orbitals are not occupied and so this way of representing slater determinants it's called a fox space so the so the space of n orbitals it's basically the collection of all these subspaces which have a fixed number of electrons and less than big n and it's technically it's the direct sum of all these subspaces okay and practically what i'm trying to say is the the space that we are considering it's it's something like this so it's a big matrix and you have states with zero particles let me say zero electrons and then we have subspaces with one electron are subspaces with two electrons and so on two electrons okay so this is the zero electron subspace one electron two electrons and so on up to the subspace with n electrons this one here and so of course now you realize if i ask you the question you know how many states are in the subspace of n electrons well the answer is just one right because there's only one way of putting n electrons in n orbitals and that's correspond to the uh bit strings filled with all ones okay but that's that's that's the same for the subspace of zero electrons as well right so there's only one state here so the state with with um all these zeros but what happens in this in these subspaces okay so there's more to one state and actually you can show that each if you want a small n particle subspace has a number of states which is uh and big m choose small m and so you know every one of these subspaces has this number of states but all together so all together the number of states is 2 to the n okay and so this this this fact that the number of states is 2 to the n it makes something click in our head right because also this the number of states of n qubits is is 2 to the n right so at this point we are um starting to see how we could even think of of a mapping between this uh the space and the hyperspace of a bunch of cubits is there any question uh brian so far maybe this this could be a good time for for questions yeah of course uh i'm gonna read you one question that's been submitted and then i'm gonna ask everyone in that i see a few people ask questions about this particular slide so as we're answering the first question if you want to write chat any questions about particular slide i'll read them but your first question what is the current accuracy of the molecular interactions simulated by a classical computer and how much can it be improved by using a quantum i think you're pretty much a perfect person to answer this question uh yes so uh i guess if this question is coming from a canvas then i can tell you that quantum computers tackle a full ci precision okay so the in principle the precision that we could get from with a quantum computer is uh equivalent to the the full exact diagonalization of the hamiltonian that you're trying to tackle so this uh i think this this should answer the question uh maybe there is another way of answering this question actually with this um with this matrix here yes maybe i can try to do that what a lot of classical methods do now that we have this matrix up here let me actually change the color of my pen okay so wait um i couldn't figure out a a key word for uh sorry a combination to change color depends worries [Music] so a lot of classical methods so what they do is they take these subspaces and they only diagonalize this problem in so you know they take to one electron or maybe uh sorry it has to be a fixed number so they take the two electron subspace this subspace and they only consider a um only some rows and columns of this subspace okay so they're not targeting the the whole uh subspace okay so what what we have with the quantum computer is could be actually in some limit this whole matrix here okay so this this would be this could be what a quantum computer could do okay while your classical method is is typically limited to some subspace okay i think this this this should answer the question yeah i think so too thank you very much and then a few questions just about this slide in general um we're looking for a few clarifications uh the first question we have about just the clarification is are we already using atomic unit oh uh we can um i uh i guess the question is also there's two different way of interpreting this are they referring to atomic unit distance or atomic orbitals uh well that was another question was actually about the orbitals someone asked is the column axis the number of orbitals so uh okay first question it doesn't matter if we use atomic orbitals or molecular orbitals it doesn't matter we we can feed both of the description for a molecular hamiltonian to a quantum computer so that doesn't really matter and also the uh you know the units that we use to measure the interatomic distances also don't matter actually you can change that change those um and what was the other question bro uh the other question was is the column axis uh about the number of orbitals on your yeah on the table you have set up is the number of orbitals the uh the the y-axis um no it's it's the number of states that uh it's the number no no it's not number orbitals it's the number of states that um in in so it's the number of ways in which you can put uh n electrons in n uh orbitals so small n electrons in small n orbitals so that's that's that's what the columns are okay okay so the size of this matrix is not um n the size of this matrix as i said is 2 to the n okay so it's it's it's the number of states that you can have in your quantum system so it's not just number of orbitals perfect all right i think i'll give it back to you to continue the lecture thank you okay thank you yeah those are uh very good questions and questions and i again i encourage you to ask more okay let me get back to my black pen here all right so now we talked a little bit about the fox space now let's see how we can define operators of this workspace and specifically i want to define creation annihilation operators on the fox base okay so the fox space is is is this this whole space that i uh told you before and i want to define them with this um let me just give the definition and then i'll motivate why that's the case so the a creation operator on the ith orbital would act in this way so would act this way on on and i state with ni fermions on the height orbital and then similarly we have an annihilation operator which is going to have this action this is j minus um sorry i this is i right this is not one so j less than i um this is n plus one okay so let me uh comment a bit on this so what's what's happening here is that first of all let's have a look at this this this these pre-factors here okay this by the way this this ni so the occupation of a certain fermioni orbitals can be either zero one okay so you cannot have two particles so two electrons sitting on the same orbital and the reason uh that's the case is uh you gotta think of our definition of a state in the fox base right so it's later determined so a you know that the determinant is so this determinant will be zero whenever you know we have two uh two orbitals which uh which are the same okay which will mean two electrons in the same orbital so these uh occupation numbers can be only zero one excuse me let's say and so since they can be only zero 1 then the action of a creation operator can be only raising the number of orbitals that are indeed sorry raising the number of particles by one unit the number of particles sitting in the i from the orbitals by one unit if there is no particle if there was no particle before this operator was acting on this state right so if if we had a zero here we would have a a one uh on the other side and if we add a one here so if we add a an electron already in that orbital then this this prefactor here would result in the annihilation of this oscillator determinant okay so this there's this bunch of facts here so a that that cannot be two fermions in two electrons in the same orbital by the way this is called also the pauli exclusion print principle so the power exclusion principle tells us that there cannot be two electrons in the same orbital and the action of a creation and annihilation operator reflect this this this fact so of course you you realize also you realize also the annihilation operator as a similar action if there is no electrons in the orbital it's just gonna annihilate the state and if there is one electron here then it's gonna bring him down so it's gonna remove the electron out of that orbital more interesting are these phase factors here so actually these phase factors are necessary to keep the antenna anti-symmetrization properties for a forced later determinants so if i want to define a state for my fermions for my electrons which is a linear combination of difference later determinants and then i want to act with creation annihilation operators on this linear combination i have i need to take into account of these phases to keep the whole state under asymmetric okay that's why those faces are there and from this definition of these operators sorry i think i have a problem one second with the with the videos here we're able to see you and hear you clearly yeah it's just my monitor okay oh i think maybe it's um so from from this definition we can actually drive if you want this is a little um home assignment i'm not going to do here i'm not going to do it here because it takes a while but we can derive the anti-commutation relations for the fermionic creation and annihilation operators i guess what i'm saying is this that that this the anti-commutation which is this this sum here so it's a product of operators and then that the same product is just exchange you just exchange the positions which we can write in a compact form like this this is delta i j okay so this means is one if i is equal to j and it's zero otherwise and so we will see that this anti-commutation property of the creation and animation operator is very important and it's it's going to be hard to to mimic when we go into a qubit representation of these operators and of course you have other algebraic properties of these operators like the commutator these commutators are zero and so on but uh this this is really the important uh this is really important property that we're gonna have a hard time to retrieve when we go to cupids okay so i gave you the definition of creation annihilation operators adag iai and actually what what i can tell you is that we can use them to build any operator acting on our fox space so any operator on our fox space it's a linear combination of products of creation and annihilation operator it could be high weighted product so it could be a product of a lot of those terms but still we can write any operator in terms of such a linear combination so we can use them um to build any operators any operator on the fox space and guess what also our hamiltonian okay so our hamiltonian can be seen as an operator on the fox space so we can still write our hamiltonian as a linear combination of products of these guys and then this is we this is what we're going to see in the next slides
