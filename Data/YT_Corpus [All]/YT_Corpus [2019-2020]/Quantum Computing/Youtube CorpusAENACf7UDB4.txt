 if you think back to your high school science class you might remember a dusty chart hanging on the wall that listed all the chemical elements in the order of how many electrons they had starting with hydrogen with one electron healing with two lithium with three and so on you might even remember that as each atom gets heavier with more and more electrons the electrons organized in different orbits that are called shells our team has now created artificial atoms in a silicon chip adding one electron at a time this is going to make a great deal of difference to the stability and reliability of the quantum bits that make up a silicon based quantum computer up until now we've created quantum bits for qubits by controlling the spin of a single electron in a silicon device then by placing two of the qubits just twenty nanometers apart we created a quantum gate where qubits interact with each other to perform the calculations that will make quantum computers so powerful but a qubit with just a single electron is extremely fragile and can lead to errors and that's where a new artificial atom qubits come in we've created a way to draw down spare elections from silicon by applying a voltage to a metallic gate forming what we call quantum dot or artificial atom as we slowly increase the voltage we can draw in moral actions allowing us to create artificial equivalents of hydrogen lithium and sodium these atoms are extremely useful to us because each of them have a single electrons on the outer shell we found that we can control the spin of the electron to create a qubit as we do with electrons of a real atom the difference is that the extra electrons in the inner shell provides the ability to the electrons on the outer shell of the quantum dots the result is a much more reliable and controllable quantum system so these basic concepts of chemistry from our high school past have given us a major advantage in our quest to create stable qubits by the millions which a quantum computer will need solve problems of global significance [Music]
