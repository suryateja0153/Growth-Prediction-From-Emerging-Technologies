 quantum computing offers the possibility of exponential speed ups in certain types of calculations or what you could ever be achieved on the classical computer the basic difference between quantum and classical computers is how they manipulate information in a classical computer if you have a series of decisions you can only make one set of decisions one path and in that decision space at a time and in lots of problems the number of decisions you need to make grows exponentially if they depend on each other in a quantum system you don't have to do one at a time you can take both paths and so you can consider the case this is true and false and then you can look at the consequence of that true and false and so on and just like in if the chinko parlor the rather than taking one path down for that ball in the quantum case you can take all paths and in the very end of the calculation you use what's called quantum interference that to collect your result about say the optimal route through through that decision space quantum computing is hard in order to do a calculation we have to come in from the classical world give the quantum system instructions without messing it up and get it to come to some result quantum computing still in its infancy it's a bit like the early days of classical competing when the transistor was first developed we have the basic building blocks but we need to figure out how to put them together and that challenge is something that spans many disciplines from basic science to engineering computation high-performance computing and applications and the lab is a place where we have those capabilities and so it's an ideal place to to pursue this as a and move the field forward another key aspect of the lab that's relevant for this kind of work is that we have a mission and so everything we're doing is geared towards realizing that mission means we have an objective and that actually has a strong impact on how we perform the work and how we move it forward the main component of our quantum testbed is a superconducting aluminum quantum processor what makes our quantum processor unique is its elegant simplicity it is a resource efficient design so that we get the most computational power in the smallest footprint the rest of the system is designed so we can make the processor work we put the processor inside a cryogen free dilution refrigerator and the compressor reduces the temperature inside the refrigeration tank to about three Kelvin the electronics around our quantum test bed serve two purposes the first is a classical to quantum converter so that we can ask our processor a question the second is as a quantum to classical converter so we can see the answer to that question a quantum testbed didn't come configured there isn't an instruction manual for how to put together a quantum computer instead we use the labs mission need to drive our unique design choices and all of the electronics that make up the con computing system you
