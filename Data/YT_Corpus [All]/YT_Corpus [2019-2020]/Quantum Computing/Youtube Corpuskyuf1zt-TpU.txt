 quantum computers are on the horizon and they've been stuck there for quite some time all the theoretical advantages they promise over classical computers like speeding up drug development helping to manufacture room-temperature superconductors and cracking encryption remain just that theoretical however a leaked paper from Google claims that for the first time a quantum computer used its unique quantum properties to absolutely dominate a classical computer in a specific task demonstrating what's known as quantum supremacy the paper was posted in September of 2019 on NASA's website since NASA and Google are collaborating on the project almost as suddenly as it appeared it was taken down again but this is the internet and Google of all companies should know that the Internet is forever the paper was copied and made widely available anyone can still read it I read it a lot of it was utterly gibberish to me but I still read it for you dear viewer now luckily for me and you actual experts in quantum computing reddit too and weighed in on what it means first off they caution that it's not yet published in a scientific journal so it may not be the final version or even peer-reviewed we shouldn't get too ahead of ourselves and declare this the end of data security as we know it like some have been suggested experts also point out that Google's quantum computer bested a classical computer in a task that was tailor-made to exploit the quantum computers strengths the computer was asked to simulate the outputs of a pseudo-random quantum circuit basically a number generator I say pseudo-random because due to quantum interference some of the numbers it generates should have a higher probability of occurring than others if the quantum computer works correctly it should produce a cluster of numbers that line up with what we statistically expect to see well surprise surprise according to this paper the computer that uses quantum phenomena to operate was better at predicting how quantum phenomena would generate numbers than a classical computer but you may be shocked to learn just how much it stomps its supercomputer rivals while the Google machine churned through a million randomly generated numbers in 200 seconds the paper estimates the most powerful supercomputer on earth today I would do the same task if it just had ten thousand years to do it not bad for a chip with just 54 quantum bits or qubits one of which wasn't working so if the leaked paper is to be believed then yes Google has demonstrated quantum supremacy no one said the task the quantum computer demonstrated had to be useful for it to count and no one said that this means it's time to throw our old hardware in the bin either quantum computers still have a long way to go namely the biggest problem with them remains errors caused by qubits decaying and losing information stored on them to make what's known as a logical qubit that's more coherent requires hundreds or thousands of physical qubits whose errors cancel each other out and a quantum computer capable of cracking encryption would require thousands of logical qubits right now the most physical qubits we've ever put together is 72 and that computer was actually too difficult to control for quite some time it appears encrypted data will remain uncrackable but that doesn't mean that google's demonstration of quantum supremacy in this one esoteric task is significant this is quite a milestone that computer scientists have been working towards for decades if their work checks out it will be a major step towards putting quantum computers to work solving problems that so far have been out of reach problems that really matter like developing life-saving drugs faster or inventing new wonder materials so if and when this paper gets published let's all act really surprised and congratulate the researchers okay quantum computers rely on superconductors to function which have to be kept at extremely low temperatures if a quantum computer can develop room-temperature superconductors that could be a vital step to a quantum PC you could have at home if superconductors piqued your interest and you want to know more about the wild possibilities that could unlock check out meirin's video here make sure you subscribe to secret to keep up to date with all your quantum news and as always thanks for watching
