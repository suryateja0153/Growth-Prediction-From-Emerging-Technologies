 so hi I'm Tanisha and I've been interested in corn computing for the past few years and recently the area of quantum machine learning and how these technologies will intersect symma topics can be vastly different but I'll try to in a high level overview what this will look like so as Homo sapiens now as we call humans or ourselves when they started to evolve they realize that if we went through a face of cognitive revolution where we escaped our biology and started in understanding and relating information in groups and having thoughtful implications of these ideas through imagination and describing big thoughtful ideas in various groups of and thinking about how we can evolve from just prehistoric kind of like chimpanzees and for example and into humans that have ideas on religion and philosophy and so that was the idea of cognitive revolution escaping our biology and what I think about quantum computing now is the idea of computation revolution where we have our classical computing that is limited in certain cases with the hardware of what we can actually do even our fastest supercomputers but now we're looking at a technology called quantum computing they'll help us expand and go beyond what computation even means and what it can do and when I think of quantum computing I think of a technology that is able to simulate physics from the ground up or help us understand the complexity of how nature works by leveraging ideas from nature truly and what I mean by this is the idea or the basics of how quantum computing is done is you leverage quantum mechanics which is the the rules of the laws that we use to understand how the very small scaled interactions work in things on the nanoscale so electrons protons are things that we can't see and how do they and how they interact with one another and the main idea is there's two properties that we look at in quantum mechanics that are beneficial to quantum computing which is superposition entanglement superposition is kind of the high-level idea that you can have a particle in any situation any place at the exact same time if it is unobserved and entanglement is the ideas that you can have to particles or two pieces of information that are correlated with one another and if one of them is affected then it directly affects the other one and they can be massive distances apart but it's just correlated with no force in between and these two properties kind of create what is the foundation of quantum mechanics and why it's so powerful and it's powerful because it's giving us the capability now to have an exponential amount of computation power to tackle some of the world's hardest problems and so to kind of understand this a little better I have an analogy that I use so imagine that there is a library that's filled with millions and millions of books with just vast amounts of knowledge and I go into one of the books and I pick out one page or one piece of information that I want to retrieve and I mark it with an X now I tell a quantum urn I tell a classical computer to go and find that X for me and it could take the length of the universe for the classical computer or supercomputers to actually go do this because you'll have to look at every page of every book one at a time but what quantum computers will be able to do is basically go into the same library look at every single page of every single book at the exact same time and find the piece of information or the X in a fraction of the time which is absolutely crazy and why this is so interesting to me is because when I think about information I think about all the data that's being created and as it was mentioned a lot of is unstructured and when where I'm from in Toronto Canada there's a really interesting project with sidewalks labs which is creating this future smart city creating Toronto's a future smart city where it's gonna be connected with millions and millions of IOT devices and what this means is we're gonna be collecting so much data that we just don't understand yet and to understand this I'm thinking well what if we could have some quantum computers that can go in and tackle these types of problems and what these problems would really go into is the idea of complexity we have things like climate change hunger and the food crisis a housing crisis cancer and all these problems that we just don't have the capability as humans and as with classical computers to go and understand because the amount of information and a data and the correlations between them is so complex that it's hard to simulate and even math on to our current hardware or software programs and this is where quantum computers will bring that leverage by going into these ideas and concepts and being able to map complexity because these are what quantum computers will be really good at being able to take physical systems out in the world and map them on to a hardware piece that can understand them in ways that we could never understand before and one really big aspect or one really big idea that is look into is how quantum computing will revolutionize drug discovery so how we can simulate actual drugs and compounds on a computer and have and see the the evolved evolution of how the drugs can be compounded and help them understand by completely decreasing the amount of time it takes for research in this field and it takes I think 12 years and millions and billions of millions of dollars for funding to create just one drug imagine doing that on a computer that could probably take only a couple weeks to do this and that's just one application of how we can look at complex systems and map them onto quantum computers and so the the analogy that I want to use is AI or a quote the idea of quantum machine learning provides is that machine learning will be the design of the car that allows us to frame how we can think of complexity and being able to understand it by using a lot of AI techniques or machine learning takes that we will develop and research into input in providing the context of understanding and being able to make decisions on the data that we have but to even go into and understand this data we'll need the computation power to do this and this is where quantum computing will become I guess the gas the fuel that powers these these engines or these cars to to vast amounts of velocity because now we're thinking about if quantum machine learning becomes a tool of the future and I mean probably way into the future now we have this tool that can go in probably solve some of the world's hardest problems that we can't do with computers we have no way of biologically understanding and creating these intelligence systems where where we can go in and understand nature and reality in ways that was never thought possible think about what of what the internet is today and we like nineteen 1950s we had no idea what the computers that we were developing could lead to and and creating something like the Internet and again this idea that in 50 years we don't know what quantum computers will do especially with the intersection of quantum machine learning and being able to help us revolutionize so many of the problems that we face today thank you [Applause] you
