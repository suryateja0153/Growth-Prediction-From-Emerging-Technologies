 I am professor Buddhist and I'm doing research on quantum computation quantum computation is a novel method of computation which worked with a totally different logic in comparison with the standard computers it is the computation of the future I'm doing theoretical work and my work in the last few years has been to bring ideas from game theory into one computation game here is a subject which is primarily used in economics but I found that it can have an impact into quantum computation and this is the work that they have been doing the last couple of years at the moment there are very few prototypes of quantum computers but in 10-15 years time each of us will have a quantum computer hopefully in their desk with enormous computational power and that can create a revolution in all aspects of mankind
