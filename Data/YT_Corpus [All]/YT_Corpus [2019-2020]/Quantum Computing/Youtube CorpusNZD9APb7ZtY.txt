 so um as you can see we will we will have three different parts that i'm going to go through with you today so the first one is from bits to qubits where we'll give you the very basics of what a qubit is what how we mathematically describe it so we'll tell you about the direct notation then how measurements work and how we can illustrate quantum states on the block sphere then we will have a second part on quantum circuits where i show you what the basic single and two qubit gates are and how we can describe states on multiple qubits and then in the last part we will talk about entanglement so i will show you what both states are we will talk about our very first quantum protocol which is the teleportation protocol and then we will discuss how to illustrate multi illustrate states on multiple qubits on the q sphere between each of these parts or somewhere around in between there we will have two 10-minute breaks hopefully and also i will because i cannot look at the questions all the time obviously so every like around 15 minutes i will have a look at the questions i will check through the most uploaded questions and try to answer one or two of them yeah i hope i i hope you're all okay you can now all understand that i will not be able to answer all questions if sometimes i might not answer the most avoided one just because i think it's something that takes longer to explain or so but then you will be able to ask that later on in the channels that the links that they provided so let's start with the first part from bits to qubits so maybe something else that i should mention is that my lecture notes will be available for all of you like an hour or so after the live stream so you if you're like me and you cannot multitask that well on trying to listen and focus and at the same time writing down everything i'm saying you will don't worry you will get the lecture notes anyway so you can fully concentrate on what i'm trying to tell you now so what we know from classical computing if you know classical computers i then you know that they are programmed to work only with states that are either in zero or one everything is based on bit strings that are bit strings of just zero sense one as the name suggests so for quant for classical computing we have states that are either zero or one however in quantum mechanics it's different i've i guess most of you have heard that word superposition so states can be what we call a superposition which means that they can be simultaneously in zero and one these superpositions allow us that we can then make calculations not only on one stage but actually on multiple states at the same time for example you can think about if you have in classic on classical computers if you have a bit string that contains three bits then with three bits you're able to give one number between zero and seven so one out of eight numbers you can make a computation with that one if you're now on a quantum computer you can be in every every qubit can be in an equal superposition of zero and one for example and that way we can be in a superposition of all eight states at the same time what this means is that if we can calculate on all these states at the same time we can get a big speed up and actually we have we know some quantum algorithms that are exponentially faster than any classical algorithm that we know so far which comes from the fact that we can do calculations on super unsuperposition states however now this sounds very trivial oh nice we just get everything done much faster because we just always go into superposition and then make our calculations at once but it's not that easy so the problem is that once we measure the superposition state it will collapse so what that means it collapses to one of its states to one of the item states of the operator that we're measuring so it means that we can only get one answer so let's say we do a calculation we do it on on the superposition on all different states at the same time but then we do a measurement and during this measurement we will only get one answer so we will only get one answer to one of the states or for the calculations that we did but we will not get all states that are in superposition so this is why it is not that easy to design quantum algorithms but when one actually has to come up with smart methods to in the end be able to get some speed ups so for example one thing that we can use are so called interference effects so i guess most of you have had in their physics high school lectures they might heard you have heard about these interference effects for example when you have this double slit experiment with light so you have two slits that light could go through but then in the end you will see an interference patterns in interference pattern you will have you have some photons that interfere constructively and some that interfere destructively so you have either you have different amplitudes and the amplitudes can be positive and negative for example and then they can cancel each other out so you won't see any light there or they can well add up and then you get an even higher peak so these interference effects are things that we will use for quantum states as well as you will see in like the next few hours because each quantum stage we can have different amplitudes for each of the states and then these states can as well interfere and this is something so we can do calculations on all states at the same time we're only able to get one state output in the end but for example if we have a quantum algorithm where we're looking for or researching a big database for one element that we want to find then we can use these interference effects or we say okay we somehow design a quantum algorithm very smartly in a way that all the elements that we don't want they somehow destructively interfere while the element that we want to get we make sure that we get some uh constructive interference there so then all the other the wrong answers basically cancel each other out and the right answer is the one that remains and then if we get the measurement we're able to get the right answer faster than we would get it on a classical computer so this is the main idea it's still not that easy that's of course why it is one of the big research areas right now and a very hot topic and while a lot of people are trying to find more and more good quantum algorithms so just as this was just for motivation let's start with the direct notation which is our mathematical way to describe quantum states so we use it to describe quantum states so let us choose two numbers now are two strings a and b that are both two-dimensional areas with complex entries and then we can look at what we call a cat you will see that a lot in the lecture today so we put around our vector a we put around this like well the things that you just see and this means we just look at the vector so if we have these two complex numbers a1 and a2 we will just look at a column vector a cat so a cat is simply a column vector it's really not more than that then we can also look at the bra the bra we do the signs the opposite way and what it means is we take the cat and we take the complex conjugate and transpose the vector which means so if we have our vector b1 b2 that would be just a cat now we have the dagger is what we call this t kind of thing and it means we instead of a column vector we will get a row vector and the elements will be complex conjugated which i indicate by a star so we have b1 star and b2 star so maybe just to illustrate it if i have some number b which equals c plus d times i where i is complex the complex i now yeah the imaginary unit then b star so the complex conjugated of that will be c minus d times i or c and d would be now real numbers so yeah this is just so the bra is very similar to the cat just complex conjugated and transposed now we can take both of them the bra and the cat and combine them so i put the bra here and then the cat and this what i'm doing with that is i'm taking the inner product not sure how much linear algebra knowledge all of you have but so what the inner product means is that i take the first element of the first vector in this case well a1 or b1 and then and the first element of the second vector so i'm taking a1 and b1 star multiply them and i add the other one a2 and b2 star and this is by the way the same as if i would take the inner product of a and b and then complex conjugated so taking the inner product what it gives me because i'm just multiplying and adding numbers in the end i will get a complex number so here i have a column vector then a row vector and then a complex number and now as a last thing what we can also do is we can combine the bra and the cat the opposite way so we start with a cat and then put at the bra so we have a and then b and maybe now as a side note people kept asking me why i'm putting an x in between there this is not an x but i on purpose did it now here because it's just one part belongs to the cat the other one belongs to the bra and people if they're lazy or want to save time they just do this instead but yeah it's not an x and so what this means if i have a column vector and i multiply it with a row vector i'm getting in this case a two times two dimensional matrix so the first element is a1 b1 star then i have a1 b2 star a2 b1 star and a2 b2 star yeah and that's it already so these are the most important things you should remember about the direct notation we will use it a lot during the day today and then also i think yeah also and maybe also in the future lectures so but yeah it's really just vectors now when we talk about qubits we usually look at two different states we define some states they're always defined in the same convention so one state is our state 0 which is just the vector 1 0 and the other one is the state one which is the state zero one these two states are orthogonal which we can very easily verify if we take the inner product now we just learned what the inner product is and our product means i'm taking the first element off well in this case zero which is one times the first element of the state one which is zero plus or maybe it should write that down so it's clear so we have this times that so i take the one times the zero plus zero times one which gives me zero and if the inner product of two states is zero then that means that these two states are orthogonal now another important feature of quantum states or our convention actually about quantum states is that we always normalize them which mathematically can be described as the inner product of twice the same quantum state no matter for all quantum states is always one so if i'm for example looking at a superposition state let's say i'm looking at the state psi which is an equal superposition of zero and one then in order to get the normalization constraint satisfied that i get that the inner product is 1 i have to add this factor of 1 over square root of 2. so if i write it as a vector this state would be 1 over square root 2 and 1 over square root 2 here so um maybe now i'll have a look at the first questions um okay the most uploaded question is on labs yeah so there's no questions yet right uh at least are you able to i can hear you yes okay cool so i was looking through them as well it looks like many of them are related to the labs we're going to ask lab questions uh i hope i answered them earlier today but if not when we email around one o'clock today to all the lab students please look for the information there so please don't ask lab questions here because we're gonna send that invite out later today i actually just noticed now that in the chat there are some question questions so someone is for example asking whether we can only discriminate orthogonal quantum states um that's a very good question so but we will look at measurements later and what we will consider is for now only measurements projective measurements which are measurements on orthogonal states but in general they don't have to be orthogonal there's also in general if you look at arbitrary povms which is something that we're not going to talk in the lecture here because that's too well goes too deep into too much content to be covered um then you can also discriminate non-orthogonal quantum states but um so uh another question is huh sorry lisa i was gonna say i was gonna continue to go through the questions that have been officially submitted and i'll um i'll monitor these down to make sure that they're all relevant to your lecture so next time you do a question uh break all the ones in the official question channel should be appropriate okay great i just saw another question that i'm gonna answer now which is something that anyway i wanted to mention so someone asked why are quantum states always normalized which is a very good question um so we do normalize quantum states it's actually just a convention so in theory one could also use non-normalized quantum states but so if we we will see in like 20 minutes you will or actually very soon you will see how we can determine for example the probabilities of measurements of getting different outcomes and for that one it's very um for that it's very useful if we have normalized quantum states it's much easier to determine the probability of getting a specific quantum state and then all the probabilities add up to one of course um also if we describe the evolution of quantum states and we describe it by unitaries well this is also something yeah that helps if we have we always look at normalized states we always but then everything just stays simple and nice and yeah it's a convention it's not necessary but if you wouldn't do it you would need to make sure people know that you're not looking at i mean one would notice immediately but the most it's it's very uh everyone does it everyone does normalize the quantum states but yeah it's not physically it does not really have a meaning if we scale a vector by something else but also later on you will see the how we plot states on the block sphere and there's also important that they're all normalized but yeah good question so now i will continue with measurements so as i just mentioned before what we choose now for this lecture is we're only going to look at orthogonal bases to describe and measure quantum states which also called projective measurements so the generalizations of those are also exist but we will not cover them now most what we do in practice is usually a projective measurement anyway so that's the most important thing to know so if you have a measurement onto the basis zero one so just introduce the spaces the basis where we choose the two states zero and one which are orthogonal states then during such a measurement the state will collapse which is something that i mentioned in the beginning when i told you that it's not that easy to design quantum algorithms because our state will always collapse into either of the states so if i do a measurement onto the basis 0 1 then it will collapse either into state 0 or interstate one the reason why it collapses into one of these two states is that those are the eigenstates of the sigma z operator so sigma z is a poly operator it's the polyz operator sometimes it's also just called just called z and i would go later into i would give you more details about poly matrices and when we look at gates we will discuss all these poly matrices in more detail so don't worry for now but just so you know these are the eigenstates of the polyset operator and so we call this that's why we call this a z measurement however in general there are infinitely many different bases but there is some more common ones some that we use a lot so the other common ones i'm to give you one is the plus minus basis so we have the state plus which is defined as the equal superposition of the state 0 and 1. and then we have the state minus which is also a superposition of zero and one however we have a minus sign between the two states zero and one so i told you earlier that there's different amplitudes and that for interference effects we can have different amplitudes and different what we call relative phases between the different states so we can have zero plus one but we can also have zero minus one for example and so these two states are indeed also orthogonal so if you take the inner product now of these two states you would see that it gives zero again which means that we have two orthogonal states and then another common basis is the plus i and minus i bases unfortunately that one has very has a lot of different names so some people also call it the plus y and minus y bases or the left and right bases before now call it plus i and minus i in this case we again have a superposition of zero and one however the phase is actually a complex one now so we have the i the imaginary unit here f zero plus i times one and then minus i the orthogonal state to that is 0 minus i and again you can check that these two states are orthogonal now these two bases they also correspond to eigenstates and they correspond to the eigenstates of the sigma x so the poly x operator and the poly y operator respectively so we have sigma x and sigma y with eigenstate plus minus and plus i minus i and we have sigma z with eigenstate 0 1. so as you can imagine now i guess if i'm doing a measurement onto the plus minus basis i can then call this as an x measurement or on the plus i minus i basis i would call it a y measurement now in order to determine the probabilities of different outcomes we have the so called bone rule so if i'm giving a state psi in the beginning and let's say i measure it in some basis that i call x so i do a projective measurement and i project onto the state x and x orthogonal so this is just the state that is orthogonal to x and now the probability that my state psi actually collapses to the state x is then given by the probability to measure x is the projection of the state psi onto the state x which is the inner product of these two states and then i take the absolute value and i square it and what one could easily show then thanks to the normalization this is if we would not have normalized states now this would be a bit more complicated we would need to divide below um divide by the normalized uh the normalization of that state base uh to normalize divide by the inner product of the two states but we can forget about that because we said we will only look at normalized states for now so we can just do this and then also the probability of all the different states adds up to one now i will give you some examples so that hopefully becomes clear so let's say we have the state some state psi which is now i need to normalize with a factor 1 over square root of 3. zero plus square root of two times one and i measure it in the basis zero one now i want to determine the probability to measure state zero as i just told you it's the inner product so the projections onto zero here i have the state psi and then i take the absolute value and square it and now it's we can just uh write it as two terms it's all linear so we write first the first term i can get the factor one over square root of three out so that it's easier to look at it and then the factor of square root of 2 over 3 can also get it out and i have the term 0 1 here absolute value squared now what we know is that since we have normalized states this inner product of the state 0 and 0 is just 1 because normalized on the other hand the inner product of the states 0 and 1 is 0 because these two states are orthogonal so i'm only getting the first term and then squared which gives me 1 3. in the same way i can determine the probability to get state 0 which will be two-thirds which we can also see easily see because we know that both probabilities need to add up to one now i'll give you a second example let's consider the state 0-1 and we measure it this time in a different basis we will measure it in the basis plus minus and we are interested in the probability of getting the output plus so the probability to get the plus state is just given by the projections of the state psi to the state plus square root so we right write it out in all the different terms we have here the plus state is zero plus one and then we have the state psi which is one over square root of two zero minus one take the absolute value squared and now we can get the two factors of one over square root of two we can multiply them and get them out of the bracket already out of the absolute value and square them so we have one quarter and then everything else stays inside this absolute values so we have two terms then we have zero zero minus zero one plus one zero minus one one and 1 squared now we can again look at these four terms just as before we know in a product of two times the same state as one thanks to normalization well these terms just are zero because they're orthogonal however now what we see is that due to the different phases before we take the square we will have one minus one in that expression so we will get zero as a probability so the probability to measure state plus is zero which means the probability to measure state minus is one and this is actually very expected it's not surprising because when i looked at the inner product of psi and plus psi is exactly the maybe you have noticed that psi is actually the state minus that i defined earlier when i told you about the basis i told you one basis is the plus minus basis here so um over the plus state and the minor state and we did a measurement and on the we project it onto the plus minus basis and the state that we were measuring was exactly the minus state so if i'm measuring the plus minus the minus state and the plus minus basis since plus and minus are orthogonal it's clear that's that this will get zero and that we will for sure measure the minus state okay so now i think i will have again check on the questions if i can enable the video camera um well i'm not sure whether this helps i mean i can well brian what do you think do you think it makes sense if i i'm a bit worried about because so many people are already complaining about that it stream that the stream breaks down in between so i'm wondering whether so we saw the same question um i commented on it and said uh for that person to reach out to us via discord we're looking into alternatives for what we may be able to do it's a great question for the exact reason you just said alisa i'm not sure if turning the video on right now is gonna be um possible because the stream was already struggling just what we had before but please reach out to us over discord and we'll continue talking with you about what some options are okay yeah good also i mean honestly because i'm writing down on the ipad i'm not even sure whether you would see a lot because you would just see my forehead and i'm looking at the ipad so you might not probably wouldn't even see my lips moving and i think i'm not sure whether that would even help someone is asking where do we get the t-shirt that elisa is wearing so i'm wearing a kisket t-shirt that i actually got at the at the lecture at kiska lecture two years ago i think almost two years ago um i don't know maybe someone else can answer that question i unfortunately cannot yeah okay someone said i i could jump in on that one when we are able to resume in-person events that's a great place to look for some but in the meantime i think helping out or participating in kids kit events that happen on the community level where you're doing something to help organize other members of your own community that is a great way to earn yourself some kids get swag yes and then maybe last question that i quickly will answer now someone's asking which is the best place to work on kisket so if you want to work with kiskit there's actually also maybe i should have noticed that i should have mentioned that in the beginning i'm gonna today's lecture will be very theoretical as you might have noticed already so we'll give you a lot of formulas and stuff and i will only in the very end show you a very bit of cascade code on how to implement some basic gates just to illustrate some quantum states that we will talk about today um tomorrow on the other hand we will also have very theoretical and then a very theoretical analysis of different algorithms but i will always after each algorithm i will immediately show how it works in cascade so we will have both and now to answer the question how to work with well yeah one has two options basically either you install it and run it locally the installation process depending on yeah if you download the stable version it should not be too hard and i think there's youtube videos on how to do it but of course it takes some time if you just quickly want to run something or also make and also make sure that you always have the newest version of kiskit then i would recommend to use the ibm quantum experience which is which you can just online access by quantum minerscomputing.ibm.com you can create an account there and just create notebooks and work with kiskit so i think in the beginning that might be a good start at some point you might prefer to run things locally especially if your internet connection is bad or something like that um yeah but yeah you will you can test it today what you today in the labs you can test whatever works for you best i think actually for the labs today it's recommended to ins download and install kisket and run it everything locally because we have some jupyter notebooks that we prepared so people should okay so download me continue with the block sphere so if we consider any quantum state any normalized quantum state and for now we will restrict ourselves on pure quantum states pure quantum states are states that are in a known state where the entropy is zero so we know which state that is in which can be a superposition state we know that it's in the state zero plus one but we well if it's a it's a very well defined state and we know the answer if we do a specific measurement however there's also mixed states which i will not go into today because we just don't have time to treat them in more detail but that is states that have higher entropy where you don't know whether it's in zero state zero or in the state one even if you no matter what measurement you do you can never be sure which outcome you will get and but we will not treat those states we'll just look at pure states today which are states that you can always write as a cat because if they're not pure anymore you cannot write them this way so we just consider these states and then the most general pure state the most general way to write it at any pure state is as cosine of theta plus 2 times the state zero plus e to the i phi sinus theta over two times one and so in order to make sure that we can have all possible relative faces phi can be anywhere between zero and two pi so this describes what we call the relative phase so this may be important to mention there's the relative phase and the global phase the relative phase is what you have between states 0 and 1 in this case if i have 0 plus 1 or 0 minus 1 or 0 plus i times 1 this e to the i phi is what determines the relative phase and this is very important this is how we get all these interference effects how we can basically how we do quantum computing is because we make use of these relative phases and there's also a global phase which would be maybe you've noticed there's no nothing in front of that part if i would multiply the whole state psi with -1 and would still be normalized and would still be a valid state however physically it does not make any difference from when i don't do that all expectations values will be the same whenever i do a measurement i get the same so these global phases what we call them we don't care about that's why in general i do not need any e to the i phi in front of the first term but just on the second term just to see the relative phase so we have the relative phase and then we have our angle theta theta is between can be between zero and pi and it determines the probability to measure the state 0 or the state 1 in this case if we do a 0 1 measurement so the probability to measure zero in this case would be if we take the projection of the state zero we would see that it's cosine of theta over two squared and the probability to measure one equals sinus square root of theta over two and we know that cosine squared plus sine squared gives one so they add up as expected now all normalized states all normalize pure states can be illustrated on what we call the blossphere so they can all be illustrated on the surface of a sphere with radius one and so i just before that we also have these mixed states this mixed state would actually then be illustrated as some states inside the blasphemy but if we have just pure states for now we will all these states will be on the surface of the sphere and now we can determine of course we're somehow interested and want to know where what the coordinates are of any given state and for that we have the so-called block vector so the block vectors sign given by sinus theta cosine theta sine theta sine phi and cosine of theta so let's look at examples some of the most important states or states that we will look at a lot how we can plot them on the block sphere so uh try to should be a circle so this is our blood sphere we have our three axes so we have here the x the x-axis the y-axis and the z-axis and they all have so this is a sphere with radius one so they all and here now we have our angles theta will actually be this angle so we will see and this angle is gonna be phi so let's look at the different states some examples we start with a state zero for the state zero if we look at the general way that i gave you before here the one in pink this one on how to describe general states if we want to get the state 0 we see that theta would need to be zero if theta is zero we immediately get psi equal to zero because cosine of zero cosine of zero is one and sine of zero is 0 so we will not get any part on the 1 on state 1. actually in this case it also does not matter at all what our angle phi is because the second part this part here will anyway be zero actually yeah [Music] so now if we look at the block vector in this case we get sine theta which is already zero so we get zero here and one here so the coordinates of the state zero are just zero zero one so zero and x directions zero in y direction and one in z direction so here we will have our state zero basically on the north pole of the sphere in a very similar way we can determine where the state 1 lies so we know that we want now the general expression to give us state 1 so we want sine of theta over 2 to be 1. so we need to choose theta equal to pi phi can again be arbitrary and our block vector in this case will be zero zero minus one so it will be down here in state one now let's look at state plus we've seen that state before it's the equal super position of zero and one we have zero phase between them so first of all if we want to get the equal superposition we need to choose in order to have zero and one with equal probability we need to choose theta to be pi over two because then we have one over square root of the one over square root of two factor and then phi since we have zero plus one e to the i phi just needs to be zero so uh sorry needs to be one so phi needs to be zero so that we do not get any phase and then our block vector is given by one zero zero if we insert it 1 0 0 means the state lies on the x axis so we have it here and in the same way we can also determine the minus state theta again needs to be pi over 2 because we can get 1 over square root of 2 as a factor in front both of both 0 and 1. but now we have 0 minus 1 so e to the i phi needs to be minus 1 which means that phi needs to be pi so i hope you're all familiar with complex numbers if not i can very quickly comment on that later um so in this case we get minus one zero zero the state will be here and now i don't want to bore anyone so i'm just quickly going to give you the other two states that i think are important to plot on the blossphere i guess you can already guess where they are so again because we have equal superposition of we have equal probability to measure zero and one so theta needs to be pi over two again but now the angles are actually pi over 2 and 3 times pi over 2 which can you can determine when you look at the general description of the state again just as before and then the states will be zero one zero and zero minus one zero so we have them surprised on the y axis now so we have the state plus i on the right and minus i on the left now one needs to be careful though because if we look at states on the blossphere the angles are twice as large as they would be in actual hilbert space so for example the states 0 and 1 we showed before that 0 and 1 are orthogonal orthogonal in hilbert space means that they have a right angle 90 degrees however here on the block sphere we have one on the north pole and one on the south pole so they actually have an angle of 180 degrees so when i gave you the description for a general state just at the beginning of the boss sphere chapter um i told you that we can write psi as cosine of theta over two times 0 and so on and now this theta over 2 is exactly why we have i wrote it with theta over 2 i could also just have written it as cosine of theta but so theta is the angle that we have on the blocks here which you can see in the in the plot when i plotted it here you see the theta is just the angle that we have basically towards the north pole to the z axis well of course by the description if we mathematically look at it and write it as a vector we can tell that theta over two is the actual angle that we have in the hilbert space oh yeah so don't confuse that it's yeah just make sure you always remember that if states are orthogonal on the block sphere that means that they're not not orthogonal in hilbert space but only if they are on opposite sides on the blossom that means that they are orthogonal so now when something that one could very nicely illustrate on the block sphere i think is the measurements because if we look at a z measurement now a z measurement corresponds to a projection onto the z-axis so if we have a state let's say i put a state here okay i have a state that shows here to this point then then the probability to measure this if i do a z measurement that means i'm projecting onto the z-axis so with a high probability i will actually get the output one and with a smaller probability i'll get the output zero oh sorry the opposite way with the high probability it's going to collapse here to the towards the zero state and with a small probability it's going to collapse to the one state down here similar also to if i measure in the plus i minus i state then with a you can tell from the state here with a high probability it's going to collapse to this side and with a small probability it's going to go to the plus i state so while the z measurement corresponds to a projection onto the z axis so the states 0 and 1 which are the two eigenstates of the holy set operator we also have this same then for x and y so analogously for x and y if we look at an x measurement i told you before that's on the plus minus basis because the the plus and the minus state we define them as the eigen states of the poly x operator and they lay on the x axis as you can tell so if i measure on the to an x measurement i'm going to the state is going to collapse to onto the x axis and if we do it if we do a y measurement we can see the y two eigenstates of the y operator are on the y axis as well so yeah but con i think one can nicely illustrate then on the block sphere how the projective measurement works in this case but as i mentioned in the beginning as well we have infinitely many bases because we can basically project onto any given state plus its orthogonal state we can do a projective measurement onto this x oops it should be a straight line of course onto this axis for example and it should go through the middle let's try again we could do a projective measurement after the state for example that would be a possibility as well of course but yeah usually we do z measurements are what the experiment usually does and then theoretically it's also very common to use plus minus measurements for example good so now i'm think i'm done with the first part
