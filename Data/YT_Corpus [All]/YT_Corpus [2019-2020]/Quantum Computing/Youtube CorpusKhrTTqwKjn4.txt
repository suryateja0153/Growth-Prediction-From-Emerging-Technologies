 Even though we experience the benefits  of classical computing every day,   there are problems above a certain size and  complexity that would take a traditional computer   an impractical amount of time to solve. Enter quantum computing.    All computers rely on a fundamental ability  to store and manipulate information. Current   computers manipulate individual bits, which  store information as binary 0 and 1 states.     For example, when our human eyes see the letter "A", our computer sees a specific string of   zeroes and ones. From social media to spreadsheets (show examples of classical computer: Word, Excel,   social media, video games, etc), everything  is done through these sequences of zeroes and   ones (matrix style string of bits). Where current computers use bits,   quantum computers use qubits.The bits in our current computers   can only be either one or zero, but not both.  But qubits can represent a one and a zero at the   same time. So if computers were coins, current models would be a coin flip with either heads   or tails as the only outcomes. But quantum  computing would be like spinning the coin;   the computer doesn't have to choose one or the other. This allows quantum computers to look   at many different variables simultaneously.   The good news is that quantum computers would   be thousands of times faster than our current  computers, possibly reducing the time to solve   a complex problem from hundreds of thousands of years to mere seconds. The bad news?   Quantum computers are very fragile and need to be  perfectly isolated from heat and vibration. One   quantum computer is kept cool at 0.015 Kelvin, or about 180 times colder than interstellar space.     Although quantum computers promise to power exciting advances   such as better batteries or new disease-curing medicines, conventional computers will still   be the easiest and most economical solution for tackling most problems.
