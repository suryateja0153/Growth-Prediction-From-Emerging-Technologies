 Hi everybody. I hope that you and yours are keeping safe. My name is Rhiannon McGavin. I'm a poet from Hollywood. And today, me and my best friend, and your favorite punk rock superstar, Ariela Barer, we're gonna show you how we stay connected even when we have to keep physically apart under quarantine because social distance does not have to mean social isolation. So, without further ado here is totally real, un-staged footage of one way that me and Ariela stay connected. - So after I made the fritters from the chickpeas, I used left over water and-- - Wait, like water from the chickpeas? - Yeah, yeah. It's called aquafaba. You can use the water to make a little meringue thing and that's what I have in the oven right now. [Rhiannon] That sounds so good. I've just been doing laundry for 10,000 years. [Ariela] Hey, what did you eat today? [Rhiannon] Uh, toast when I got up. But, I have leftovers from last night. I'll get those going. How's your family? [Ariela] Pretty okay. I dropped off books and groceries for my parents yesterday. [Rhiannon] Oh that's great. You know what, I'm going to check on Mrs. J next door and see if she needs anything. I'll call you back later with my reheated gourmet spaghetti? Yeah okay, sounds good. Love you, talk soon. Yeah, okay okay okay. Love you. Talk soon! Ta da! So clearly there's more than one way that we can stay connected during these times. And, you know, like the web of string that I set up in my bedroom for that little video, there's so many things that tie me to the people that I am around. My neighbors, my family, my friends, my classmates, my strangers. When they are hurting, then I can be there for them as best as I can the same way that they hold me when I'm in trouble. That's how we create safety within our communities. That's solidarity. That's mutual aid. And that's how we're gonna get through this. So, grab a tin can and start dialing. Okay, bye. Love you.
