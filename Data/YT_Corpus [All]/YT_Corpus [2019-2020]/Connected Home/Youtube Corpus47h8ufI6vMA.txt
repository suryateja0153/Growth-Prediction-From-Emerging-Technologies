 [Music] so my name's Steven gossipy I'm the head of data science at QB with a provider of a connected home platform and the creators of a smart thermostat and energy display called the tone so some of the the use cases we have for daily bricks is we have a connected home platform that's collecting a lot of data from residential households what we're able to do is we use the data bricks platform to enable us to create data-driven services or on top of that data [Music] so a big challenge we face from the data engineering perspective was just the amount of time that it took to manage the our own infrastructure we could see from just working with our onsite Hadoop cluster that as soon as a new package came along we'd have to be having a data engineer spending up a day or two making sure that that that was installed correctly honor the dependencies were managed well moving two data bricks has allowed us to to take away some of that concentration on infrastructure management and that means our data engineers can focus on why they're really adding even more specific value to the business from a data science perspective at that time before using data bricks we were we were using a number of different tools we came a data scientist came from backgrounds in in MATLAB our Python so what we use data bricks for at that stage was where that the shed notebooks the collaboration allowed us to develop code in a very systematic way and what we were also able to do is very quickly switch between languages so for data science some things work really well in Python you want to be able to use some of the latest developments in tensorflow and caris sometimes you want to be switching more towards scala for a production code so one example of how data practices provide us with a lot of value is we have a use case where where we're trying to detect anomalies in heating systems of homes a dead of bricks Delta a combination with spark streaming allows us to offer alerts to users with a very limited latency so they are able to react to problems within the home before it affects their comfort levels the the real business impact of data bricks a couple of things what one it allows us to to manage our whole data science stack with a very slick team so we can we don't have to spend our time already concentrating on the infrastructure we can put our emphasis into developing the machine learning algorithms that's what we can really truly extract information from the data we're collecting on real cost saving approaches just being able to collect data and analyze it in a in a systematic way really helps for instance one example is data bricks allows us to access spot instances very easily that allows us to change the timing of one where we're using clusters auto scaling if clusters on top of that allows us to process large volumes of data at a in a way that can be very economic for us as a company so the data bricks unified analytics platform has allowed us as a team of the composing of data engineers data scientists but also the the rest of the business to to allow us to to create valuable services from the data we're collecting so in its summary data the data breaks analytics platform has allowed us to transition from a from a hardware based business model towards an abling by for us and our partners to to become more service orientated and ready for the future [Music]
