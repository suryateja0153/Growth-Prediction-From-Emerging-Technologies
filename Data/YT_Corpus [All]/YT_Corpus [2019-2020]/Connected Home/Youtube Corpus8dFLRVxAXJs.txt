 Imagine if you could grow food anywhere. In your home, in your workplace, at universities like here at EPFL. Basically, that is what Caulys offers. We have developed fully automated indoor greenhouses, to enable citizens to grow quality food, all year long, very easily. The idea is to enable them to not only be consumers, but to actually become producers. With this kind of technology you could grow any kind of plants. Aromatics, microgreens, edible flowers, small fruits and vegetables, and so on. Caulys' greenhouses are modular, connected and automated. We measure temperature, humidity, CO2, luminosity, in order to provide to the plants optimal conditions to grow. The water circulates in close-loop to provide to the plants exactly the amount of water they need, and this enables us to use up to 95% less water compared with traditional agriculture. When you receive a greenhouse you have to fill in the water tank, insert Caulys' recharges containing the soil and the seeds to enable the plants to grow, plug in the greenhouse, and the greenhouse takes care of everything, to grow plants perfectly. To give you an idea, you only need up to 20 minutes per week of maintenance to grow up to 200 plants. Caulys's technology implies no GMOs, no pesticides, less plastic packaging, less transport, and much less food waste. You can see food growing in front or your eyes, from the seeds to the final product. Thanks to EPFL sustainability, we have had the chance to insert our first greenhouses directly on campus, to enable any student or anyone to use it and grow directly fruits and vegetables on campus.
