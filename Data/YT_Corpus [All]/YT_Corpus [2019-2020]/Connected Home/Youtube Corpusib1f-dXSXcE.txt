 list this is the most advanced and ladies and gentlemen out there this is going to knock your socks off this product that you're looking at by iRobot has not one or two or three or ten patents not 100 patents not a thousand patents it has thousands of patents thousands no other product in the world and today we have the launch and this is the launch right here right now of the newest Roomba that is five times more powerful five times more suction than the Roomba 600 which was still great but this is so far superior if you have pets because the old room will we love the convenience of a Roomba does all the cleaning for us we don't have to lift a finger we love it but this is actually going to do the job better right so rightly a little and we talk to it yes this one can now work with your Alexa asked Robbie to start vacuuming okay here's a robot home so we've asked okay now you can use it with your phone or with your tablet or with her and it is able to activate that technology for you you can program it to schedule you are going to be able to now if you want to just touch a button you can do that as well but if you want to have this latest and greatest technology you're looking at it with the ability of course to talk to your other electronics wow you can't turn it on manually doing how cool that Alexa tell me what to do exactly now really up what we're gonna do is we're going to put it to the test so what I'm gonna do for you next is we'll take this one along with us because I'll show you how you can use it old-school way to you by just touching the bike okay but first of all let's just show you how powerful it is so over here I'm going to show you that obviously it's gonna pick up what you do see which is going to be you know the the the dust the dander or whatever it might be that's on the floor right now over on this side well this one's picking up what we do see I'm gonna do a serious comparison for you we're in Verdun sand on a sand colored carpet as I put down that sand on a sand colored carpet you don't really see it right so you know we know it's there because it's going on to that carpet what I'm going to do next is I'm gonna use this huge power vac to vacuum up that sand well and then we'll use the rough bot to see what's left behind so to show you this how powerful it is all right so you have your traditional vacuum vacuum cleaner over there by the way if you do have pets you guys this is going to remove 99% of dog hair of pet dander 99% okay now I will show you that there is a completely clean bin there's nothing in here to see you know nothing on the inside okay now I'm going to again you could talk to it you could use it with your tablet or your phone or you could just touch the button we've got it now let's send the robot on the mission and see what was left behind after we ran that big power back so then you can see the powerful qualities that are inside this robot now notice as I'm gonna let it run here for just a second that as long as we did with the big back right it's making 60 decisions a second it knows where it's been where it's going and where it needs to go next and it will vacuum for nine minutes before it goes back home to put itself away notice that it moves in its own pattern because it doesn't have to be methodical like we are when we're vacuuming what it's doing is it's actually detecting where the sand in this case or where the dirt is and it will stay and focus and concentrate in that area until every looking craning quartering crevice of your home is cleaned and you know if you have an old Roomba there's a lot of people that have the old room is and everybody loves the idea of Roomba because guess what you never have to vacuum again it's like having a live-in housekeeper it will do carpets it'll do hardwood floor it'll do linoleum it'll do kitchens it'll do bathrooms it'll do whatever room you want it to do but the key to it you guys is that this is a better mousetrap and that's a new Roomba and look at what it following in just a matter of seconds what it found that was left behind from that big power vac running so not only does it do the job Coleen we use this to illustrate that it actually does the job better that's the key this is a huge upgrade not a little upgrade from the old Roomba this is a massive upgrade to be able to tell you it has five times more suction power with this three tape three-stage right yeah let's talk about that because that's patented yes so what's gonna happen it is going to grab all of the side dirt with that side spinning brush and then from there it moves that dirt into counter rotate counter rotating brushes and that's where that suction power comes in it acts like a trash compactor to move everything to the back of the bin so that you have even more space to grab the dirt you have even more suction power so that now when it's running in this case like under the bed right when's the last time you vacuumed under the bed I mean seriously right good boy no right maybe when you moved in or when you got a new bed now you're able to have all of that suction power work for you underneath the bed in the little crevices if you have pets it's gonna get that hot here and that damn girl it's coming so bad you know what's fun about you guys it's quieter than ever it's true it's more versatile than ever you can literally turn it on from work you don't even have to be home if you want to tell Alexa to turn it on you can do that but the key to this you guys is if you call us right now you spend 70 dollars to try it it's $50 off today it's brand-new first time ever at first airing first time ever to be seen on HSN or $50 offers free shipping and handling you can try it for $70 guys flex pay gets it home for $70 get it home try it you will love it there's nothing like having nice clean carpets the kids are home for the summer and you want the house nice and and span when you come in the door this you can you can set it you can actually set it also to clean and go right back into its little docking station right Li it will take itself home and redock after 90 minutes and notice how it will work itself out of tricky places like we just saw the side table it goes right from the carpet onto the hard velvet great because the old one weight remember the first ones couldn't do that no it's true they keep adapting new technology you go to the different surfaces that what I'm talking about if you have a Roomba from years ago I mean we have the old old old Roomba you have one from years ago this is a whole new deal for those of us that have pets because we have pets and so we you know we love her a little fur babies but guess what fur babies equal fur everywhere true so if you have fur if you have cat hair pet hair and cat dander hate dog dander does this removes 99% they limited do this 99% of pet dander is going to be eliminated because that is the kind of suction power we're talking about so this is a better robot I mean as simple as that it is a huge upgrade it's a better Roomba it's a you it make your investment upfront but then you get to use it for free forever you never buy a bag you never buy a filter you don't have to do anything right you could literally be the office or you can just talk to it if you wanted to as well again with the I adapt the new upgrades that you're alluding to are going to be things like anti-tangle technology it doesn't get tangled in cords or cables or as it interacts with say a beautiful curtain it can back itself out of that environment it even has cliff detect so they gets to the edge they of the top of your stairs right it doesn't fall down now you can do it a couple of different ways you could talk to it you could use your tablet or you could use your phone or you can just tap the button entirely up to you how technical you might want to go so let's just we could use resume on the tablet and we're off and running and look what's happening I'm not even touching it and there it goes so it's entirely up to you how you want to use it if you want to touch the button you can touch the button you want to use the app you can you can be at work and then you could touch the app or have the scheduler go off and you are able to activate it then just simply and easily by using your phone work with perfectly vacuum for exactly nicer it's quiet it's not gonna wake the babies it's not going to disrupt when you're watching TV or whatever you're doing it'll do it you know it it'll sweep your kitchen floor for you if you have again messes to clean up this sweeps your click kitchen floor it does hardwood floors are painted this will get every speck of dirt off those hardwood floors any type of carpet linoleum wherever you need to pick up dirt dust dander birdseed cat litter all the stuff we all deal with only the big dirt but right down to that dust and dander that you were just talking about Colleen because it's not only the big dirt that you want to have captured right you want to have all of the dirt captured it'll illuminate when you're ready to see when you need to clean the bin and again you can either talk to it or you can let the app do the work for you now this is what we call the torture track let's head back here I'm sure he is going to town night school he's going under the bed it's right from the credit card you have you know a beautiful rug ABBA's on rug on your hardwood floor it's gonna do the rug yep and then it's a floor yep exactly right on the tackle right the chair we move the chairs right under the coffee don't look it underneath the bed awesome it's here right guys I don't know about you I want this right I really want this simple and easy to be able to let it do all the work for you right now you got again the ability for it to go right back home it will go around the legs of the chairs there you can see the cliffs detective doesn't go nice bumper it's not gonna bang up your you know any of your baseboard it has a sucker that's beim up your circuit it doesn't have a soft it starts just saying you'll see this it'll start to slow down right before it gets to that soil surface so it's never the original one was bang hey smarter it's right I don't mean to put the old guy down he's great 25 all right we exactly Roomba has evolved a time no yes gentler if you have pets over here on our torture track whether it's hardwood whether it cables that you know don't want it to interact with you don't have to do that free clean we run around your house and you're trying to get with you don't worry about the court exactly I'm and if you have pets then you know that whether it's pet food whether it's kitty litter there's always something little that's gonna be around on those floors right not anymore not when you have the Roomba because it's gonna cover that floor surface whether it's tile linoleum hardwood for ninety minutes right vacuums for ninety minutes because now for ninety minutes it will cover that floor surface so we'll let it continue to do a little work over here also if you have pets or if you just have hair or if you have carpet we're going to have this scenario where dirt gets embedded into that he calls it Rambo oh I'd give our hairdresser calls it Rambo you pick up your pick out your own name but I'll tell you what this guy is smart work play home you know what it's just one of these great little pleasures of life one less thing we have to do I mean this is like the Jetsons folks it is it's like we have our little robot that does the floors all the floors you don't have to worry about him he not only does all the cleanup he goes and puts himself away when he's done and she picks it after himself and recharges himself right he it knows it's so smart it's brilliant and this is no smart it's a brand new Roomba and we are busy taking your calls if you'd like to order it use Express ordering log onto hsn.com make your first $70 flex payment or $58 on your HSN card and let us send it home to you it's fun to launch something new this is technology that was originally invented by the military company yes iRobot was a company that basically did government contracts to protect our military officers so that there could be unmanned robots going in it was okay for land mines exactly and they have said that we can make a vacuum cleaner we can make one better and literally iRobot is the leader in the industry they are the original in the industry there's copies of this exactly if you tried to copy it it's true and if it's not iRobot it's not a Roomba exactly iRobot is the brand 25 years ago that started it all 15 years ago we got into the world of vacuum cleaners and nobody does it better and notice even the carpet lines right it's amazing you guys five times more suction power on the brand-new Roomba and to Lea's poit I mean iRobot they have thousands of pets so as many people to try to copy this who you know the whatever you know cordless do it itself back you cleaner nobody doesn't little bit it does it like this they can't even get close because of all of these patents they don't want people to be able to come to copy their brilliant technology through and nobody can there's lots of imitators there's only one iRobot Roomba that's it if you're thinking about it jump in we only have a couple more minutes a lot of you are ordering it I'm excited for you I want one to love to have this because I mean if you do like our house her we're mainly hardwood floors hardwood floors are so hard to keep playing especially with the dust again the dander the perfect so here's how much we've picked up over here I'm just gonna dump this out and let Roomba do its job again so that you notice that it will pick up of course what you do see but what's great about the Roomba is it also picks up what you don't see so in order to illustrate that I'm going to put down fan over here on this side on a sand colored carpet and we are going to run our big power vac so we can give it a head-to-head competition alright this big power back remember you have to defy gravity you couldn't be at the office and be lighting this one right okay by the way as Lee Augustus it shows you what was going to happen once you put the Roomba to pick up what this big monster is leaving behind on the left side of your screen we're showing you some of the highlights from our to our shopping spree there's the jacket that I'm wearing thank you they have a 700 of you who have ordered so far actually close to a thousand jackets if you're still thinking about the jacket that price is good just for this day I know many of you decided on the minolta camcorder thank you so much over 400 lucky people have that on the way so far right now a lot I hear a lot of you are jumping in for your room but I want one too I think this is so cool I love that it's more powerful I like that it's not just a novelty this is way beyond it that's a serious room vacuum cleaner what I can tell you it's 99% of pet dander the old king didn't have
