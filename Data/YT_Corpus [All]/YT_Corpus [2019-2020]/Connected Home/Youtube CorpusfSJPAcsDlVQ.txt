 welcome to broadland tech park what's the difference between smart home and connected home definitely the difference is smart on off control remote control voice control these functions are very common now it's not smart if every time i still need to use the phone or say something to let the device act is what i want what customers really need is automations without attendance for example turn on lights automatically at sunset turn on air conditioner in cooling mode at 76 when it's getting hot this is the real magic of smart home and this is routines in broadland cap [Music] part one what is routine the function of routines is designed to enable automations of multiple devices and even interact with external data this can be called routines automations triggers or connections depends on which app you are using alexa google home smartthings and ifttt all have routines function like the name usually people set routines for daily or frequently used tasks and these tasks can be performed fully automatically in broadly cap a routine consists of three parts triggers actions and conditions so you can set up a routine like when a is triggered under condition b do action c here the trigger and action are mandatory and condition is optional you can also make it as when a is triggered to action c you can also add multiple triggers actions or conditions like when a1 plus a2 are triggered under condition b1 plus b2 do action c1 and c2 that is very flexible and easy to use part 2 how to set routines to set routines open broadly cap and tap routines at the bottom to switch to the setting page then tap add button to create a new routine first let's tap when event triggers from you'll see five options at specified time triggers the routine at a specific time on specific days also you can customize a time you need [Music] weather changes set the weather temperature or humidity of your local city as the trigger weather keeps in certain state similar to the weather changes but you can set the duration of the state [Music] device operated in this option you can select and set the device state in your device list as the trigger device kept in certain state similar to the device operated but you can set the duration of the state please pay attention when you set the change of state you need to make sure the current state does not reach the threshold so the system can detect the change for example if you set the trigger as when temperature rise to 86 and keep for one minute you need to make sure the current temperature is below 86 otherwise it will not be triggered after you've set up a trigger you can start selecting actions to go with it by hitting the do actions button which also brings up several options they'll control certain device you can choose a device and specify an action it supports any controllable state of the device i'll activate a scene if you want to do more than one action definitely you can add all actions but another better way is to add actions in a scene and choose the scene here they'll push notification on phone you can get a notification on phone when the event is triggered at last you have optional condition can be set for the routine we can see in the first part you can set more than one event as the triggers but these events may not happen at the same time or we say they are connected by ore the relationship between when event triggers from and under conditions is more like hand means if you set the conditions the routine will be only triggered when both are activated one more thing important if you are living in a country with daylight saving time more commonly called winter and summer time you need to enable the dst and routine settings otherwise the time set and triggers will have one hour difference [Music] some customers are wondering where is sunrise and sunset anymore in timer actually we've moved it into routines here we will take sunrise and sunset mode as an example to show how routine works create a routine firstly we enter a routine name then tap when event triggers from to add a trigger here we can see sunrise and sunset mode are set in the option at specified time we need to choose the current city and tap ok to save then we set an action when sunrises open my curtain time to get up [Music] tap save ok done we have created a simple routine some customers are wondering where is sunrise and sunset anymore in timer actually we've moved it into routines here we will take sunrise and sunset mode as an example to show how routine works some customers have not used the notification feature here we also show you a case we set when temperature rise to 86 and keep for one minute turn on the ac and push me a notification [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] if you just want to get alert of device state change another way is to set it in device property enter device control page tap the top right button and choose property then tap notification setting this is same as what you can do in routines [Music] all routine results are saved in your account to check your routine results go to new page and tap notification center [Music] here we also want to
