 hey di wires I'm George from alarm grid today I'm going to be going over the difference between Total Connect comfort TCC and Total Connect 2.0 T C 2.0 so just quick broad overview what each one is Total Connect comfort is an app that allows you to basically control your Honeywell Wi-Fi thermostats through the app now they have to be Wi-Fi thermostats and they have to be Honeywell in order to use the Honeywell app Total Connect comfort if you're having a Honeywell or residual alarm system that is what you use Total Connect 2.0 service with now the alarm system does have to have internet or cellular connection going to it in order to get this Total Connect 2.0 service for it and the total Kinect 2.0 app allows you to arm disarm setup email and text message alerts whenever there's an alarm look at video cameras that are tied into the alarm ecosystem control and create z-wave scenes for the z-wave devices such as lights locks z-wave thermostats not Wi-Fi there's a difference between z-wave thermostats and Wi-Fi thermosets and just to that's kind of like the brief overview between both apps one is just for Wi-Fi thermostats the other one is for your whole alarm ecosystem and what I want to show you guys right now just because it's pretty confusing when you guys are in the App Store is what each app kind of looks like right so if you go ahead and get your tablet your iPhone your computer whatever it is you're gonna be downloading the app on just open up the app store alright once you open up your App Store you're gonna go ahead and search for either/or let's start with Total Connect Comfort so I'm gonna type in Total Connect now as you see as I start typing it in I start getting suggestions I'm just gonna go ahead and hit Total Connect comfort now once I hit Total Connect comfort it's gonna basically bring up every single Honeywell or residual app there is as you see Total Connect 2.0 is also on there but I'm gonna hit the Total Connect comfort right now they kind of looked like the same logo the only difference you're gonna see is Total Connect 2.0 has a red-and-white TC logo Total Connect comfort has like a thermometer 72 number on it it kind of has like a temperature number in red and white right so I'm gonna the total kind of comfort just so you guys have an idea what it looks like so when you guys have your Wi-Fi thermostats you will actually be able to use this application and you can control your thermostats and here are just a couple of pictures that the that they've taken from the actual app to show you guys you can look at the five-day forecast you can set the temperatures higher it lower it put it on auto whatever features you guys have on that thermostat will show up on the Total Connect comfort if you look at what it offers it has a whole list right and again this is just for the Wi-Fi thermostats now if I hit the back icon to go to my search and I go to Total Connect 2.0 I already have the app so it's telling me if I want to update it but here's a couple of screenshots with the app right you have the alarm system arm away arm stay you have the z-wave devices you can control the living room lights the front door lock you see there on the first floor has the temperature as well and that's if your current if you have access to a z-wave thermostat and then you have all the events and everything so the actual Total Connect 2.0 is to interact with the with with the alarm system and any devices hooked into the alarm system so those are the two apps now one important thing you guys may be asking well I have Total Connect comfort thermostats and I have a Honeywell vs. IDEO alarm system with Total Connect 2.0 service there is a way where you can bring in your Total Connect comfort thermostats into Total Connect 2.0 but one important little thing this does not mean that you can create scenes with the thermostats that were brought in from your TCC accounts the only benefit of bringing in the thermostats from the TCC Total Connect comfort account is the fact that you'll be able to roll the thermostats and the alarm system from one app from one convenient location all right you cannot create scenes with a Wi-Fi thermostat the scenes on Total Connect 2.0 can only be created with z-wave thermostats so that's something that you guys want to do and you guys haven't purchased a whole bunch of equipment yet whenever you're designing your house alarm system and z-wave devices make sure that you guys are using z-wave thermostat if you want to be able to control and create scenes everything from one location if you guys have any questions about Total Connect 2.0 or Total Connect comfort feel free to send us an email to support at alarm grid comm if you found the video helpful make sure you hit like underneath subscribe to the YouTube channel and enable notifications so when we upload new content you guys get notified I'm George and I'll see you guys next time
