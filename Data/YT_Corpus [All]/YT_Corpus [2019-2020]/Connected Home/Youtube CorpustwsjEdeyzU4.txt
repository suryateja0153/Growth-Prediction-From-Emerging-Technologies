 HE SAYS NO ARRESTS HAVE BEEN MADE-AND THE INVESTIGATION IS ONGOING. AN INVESTIGATION IS UNDERWAY AFTER THREE BODIES WERE FOUND ON A PROPERTY IN LARUE COUNTY. IT STARTED MONDAY MORNING WITH A CALL FOR A SHOOTING ON RIVER ROAD. POLICE DISCOVERED A BODY IN A CAR AND A MOBILE HOME ON FIRE. ONCE THE FIRE WAS OUT, OFFICERS FOUND ANOTHER BODY INSIDE THE MOBILE HOME. AND LATER THAT EVENING FOUND A THIRD BODY ON THE PROPERTY. THAT LATEST DISCOVERY LAST NIGHT LED OFFICERS TO A HOUSE IN SOUTHWEST LOUISVILLE, BUT OFFICIALS WOULD NOT SAY WHAT THEY WERE LOOKING FOR. POLICE SAY BASED ON WHAT THEY KNOW, THEY ARE NOT LOOKING FOR ANY SUSPECTS.  JUST IN SPEAKING WITH THE INVESTIGATORS, THERE’S NOTHING AT THIS POINT IN TIME THAT WOULD MAKE ME FEAR FOR THE COMMUNITY SAFETY. MONI
