 Hey, that's not due until next week. Yeah, but if I can wrap it up tonight, then it will be done. Hey, Dad! Hey, Bud! How's it going? I was just wondering when you were going to come home. We're supposed to play legos. You know, I'm on my way home right now.  Okay, but you worked late last night. No, I'm cleaning up right now. I'm on my way out the door. You got your legos ready? Yeah, Dad. I've had them ready for like 20 hours ago. Alright, get a juice box out for me, okay Buddy? Smart home integration in every Pahlisch Home. Life. Connected.
