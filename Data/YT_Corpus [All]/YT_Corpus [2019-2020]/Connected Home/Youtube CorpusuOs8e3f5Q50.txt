 [Music] hello I'm Greg Newland marketing director at Reynolds Reynolds and this is connected the podcast with best practices and ideas to help navigate what is happening in the automotive retail industry in the world today as the co mid-nineteen virus continues to change our world and how we live and work daily this podcast discusses ways to continue operating in this unprecedented social environment today we have with a Scott Worthington director of BMS product planning at Reynolds of Reynolds Scott thanks so much for joining hey Greg thanks for having me on today yep absolutely so Scott today I'm hoping to talk a little bit about working from home for for dealerships that are compared able to continue operating right now a lot of a lot of employees are remote so to start I guess what's what's needed for dealership employees to effectively work from home from a technology perspective well for many roles employees will need to get connected to the dealerships network for others you know basic internet connectivity is is just fine especially with a lot of the hosted applications for those need to get connected to the network this can typically be accomplished by working with your network provider to gain access through the firewall and and ultimately to the system but the simplest way really is if you already have a VPN and you can direct connect to the network and then access the applications you need to but one of the easiest things to do really is to contact your network provider and review the options that they have for you and once you do that you should be up and running to be connected also you'll need to look and make sure you've got the licensed applications that you need to do to do your job and I once you got that you should be in good shape good yeah I snuck in with that with Dave Bates a few days ago and he was saying that the Technical Assistance Center was helping with with this a lot as well mmm absolutely yeah they're a great resource to help you out with this good good so once once employees are up and running you know obviously business is much different today than it was just a few weeks ago so there's likely some downtime for folks what are some maintenance things that the people be able to do so things that probably should be done on a regular basis but there's just not time for in a lot of instances well you know the start you almost need to give yourself permission to work on those types of things and it's really kind of a mindset change going from your normal busyness I'm working for home from home is really you know quite a different thing so you know once you decided that you know things are different and that you can work differently you kind of need to evaluate your goals figure out what you need to accomplish either daily weekly or in some cases looks like monthly now and then do those things that you've said you know if I only had time I do X well you know the reality of it is some some of us now have time to to do some of those things so if you're going to do system cleanup for instance we need to look and prioritize what you're trying to accomplish and then figure out you know the specific cash you need to do to do that another thing that's easy to accomplish but there usually isn't time during normal business hours as training and education you know making yourself smarter on the different applications and tools that you have whether it's DMS or CRM or what have you you really got time now to take advantage of reviewing enhancement materials tutorials videos some people participate in online training sessions and you know doing those things that can help you you know get smarter about the the tools you have and then once you've done that it also helps to either practice or go in and set up those capabilities that you've just learned so that you know the hope is you know you learn a lot while you have the opportunity and then you're kind of ahead of the game when things get back to normal yeah that makes a lot of sense it makes a lot of sense and it is hard I know I can speak for myself it's hard to find time to do that kind of system training and get really good at using the tools you have you mentioned there's got kind of system maintenance too are there any you know kind of high level things that middle other people could focus on maybe a couple that you could call out they can have big impacts as far as just updating the system and maintain your your system sure another one that seems to never get done because it you know seems so overwhelming to do is the customer database cleanup that's the idea of consolidating duplicates and purging old records that either don't have contact info or bad contact info you know can seem like tedious work but if you take the time to do it you know it pays big dividends from a customer communication standpoint and you know down the road because you don't have you know multiple greggio and sitting out there and trying to pick the right one to use for contact information so if you can take the time to do that you know that one will pay big time along the same lines a lot of folks can use time like this to clean up vendors and that means you know getting rid of ones that you haven't done business with in years another just system maintenance system cleanup kind of thing a third one that would be a good one to spend some time on is actually looking at the integration from F&I into accounting and a lot of times there's an opportunity to fine-tune that integration and basically look at how a deal is derived or built in F&I and in how it integrates into accounting and a lot of times if you can do a better job with mapping the deals over to accounting it saves a tremendous amount of time in posting the deals and you know quite honestly we're we're busy with the day-to-day and you know we usually don't take time to sit down and look at that and overtime you know a lot of enhancements and changes that have come out that make that a lot easier and typically we haven't taken the time to take advantage of those and now's a good time to look at that mapping and then hopefully save you know minutes which become hours a month on posting time know great great things to look at if and I appreciate Scott Walt while we're over here and we have the audience before we hop off is there anything else that you would want to want to touch on today or then you want to mention sure you know it's just if you're able to work from home really try to make the most of it and it's unprecedented time business is not the way it was and we're you know basically all learning to adjust as best we can and you know hopefully soon we'll get back to normal but in the meantime I really encourage everyone to not only try to complete your basic tasks but take some time to learn the applications learn some of the new and enhancements do some of this system cleanup tasks and all this should help you and your team be more efficient until we can all resume you know somewhat of a normal life good good point Scott definitely appreciate you taking a few minutes out of your day to hop on and share this with everybody you know again I can't thank you enough glad to help out talk to you later all right thanks see ya this has been connected stay safe and we'll see on the next episode you
