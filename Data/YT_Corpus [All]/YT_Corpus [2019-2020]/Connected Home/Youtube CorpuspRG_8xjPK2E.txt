 [Music] the success of any team depends on good communication in the case of a virtual team with members often in different places and different time zones sometimes with different working styles and cultures effective communication is essential this can be a challenge it means everyone on the team must be able to use appropriate tools and strategies to stay connected with each other there are proven methods that help virtual teams communicate effectively the first is to create a social meeting point this means ensuring that there's a forum to talk share information ask questions and get to know the other people on the team this could be a chat based application such as slack or another team communication tool the point is to enlist a platform that gives team members a way to bond with one another share relevant information and communicate informally when you can't see your colleagues face-to-face and have the social interactions that build relationships and rapport it can be difficult to establish trust if it isn't managed correctly this lack of trust can undermine everything that the virtual team is trying to achieve having and regularly using a social meeting platform helps to facilitate open communications and maintain that important level of trust among team members further it's important to strengthen team communication by ensuring digital communication can't be misunderstood it's estimated that in face-to-face interactions body language and facial expression convey up to 55 percent of the information that people receive on the phone and in emails these visual cues are missing so it's easier to misinterpret the meaning virtual teams therefore require taking extra steps to ensure each message they send is clear written and verbal messages must be unambiguous straightforward and only as detailed as necessary to make the meaning clearer reliable communication builds trust minimizes conflict between team members and ensures everyone is on the same page a third way to ensure effective communication is to use the three levels of communication to your best advantage the levels are impersonal communication personal communication and group communication impersonal communication as the name implies is simple and formal and follows the established procedures for the given team or project these are things that involve minimal interaction like delegating tasks providing team status updates and sharing general information email or posting to a shared server generally suffices for this type of communication personal communication or one-on-one dialogue helps build relationships this is just as important on a virtual team as it is in a traditional office on a virtual team it's likely you'll need to communicate personally with colleagues at various levels in a project hierarchy your peers the team leader a manager and so on personal communication cuts down on misunderstandings and conflicts and is best suited for times when there is no need to involve the whole team like one-on-one ketchups with teammates over the phone or internal messaging group communication is helpful when all members of the team need to get on the same page brainstorm or have a live discussion such as strategy meetings these are virtual meetings using tools such as WebEx or Skype for webinars or video conferencing where the entire team can be present they allow for easier distribution of information and open discussion among team members the key is to make sure that you are an active participant in all forms of communication and information sharing and that there is a healthy balance of the three types as a virtual team member you may work remotely but communication with others is still integral to your role teams are more than simply collections of individuals working together through effective communication is how a team becomes more than the sum of its parts
