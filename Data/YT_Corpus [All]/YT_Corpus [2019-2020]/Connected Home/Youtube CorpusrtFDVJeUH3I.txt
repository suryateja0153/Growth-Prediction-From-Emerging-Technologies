 I'm Andrew Edwards and you're watching your lives [Music] smart-home devices are starting to do even more than they appear to at first glance for example take the brand-new eco be smart thermostat with voice control yes it's a thermostat but it also streams music act as a remote control for other smart home devices and you can even make phone calls on it but is this jack of all trades and master of none find out in this episode as I bring you my thoughts on the Eco be smart thermostat 5th generation what is going on Tech Squad andru edwards here editor-in-chief of gearlive.com as i mentioned today we're talking about this right here this is the brand new 5th generation eco be smart thermostat with voice control as you know I love smart home ii when i got my hands on this i was actually really impressed by the things that it could do so let's jump in and talk about eco b's new smart thermostat before we do if you're into tech please do hit that subscribe button down below so you don't miss any future videos and by the way shout out to ecobee for sending over the new smart thermostat and for sponsoring this video if you're interested in the thermostat as we go through the video and you want to check it out for yourself I will leave a link down in the description below as I said this is a smart thermostat that has Amazon Alexa built-in so not only can you control it with Amazon Alexa but since Alexis built-in to the thermostat itself you can also use it to control other things in your smart home the Eco be smart thermostat connects to your home Wi-Fi network allowing you to control the temperature from anywhere that you have an internet connection this isn't new as there are a few other devices out there that do the same thing however there are a few things that set the Eco be smart thermostat apart from its competition starting with apple homekit what that means is that you can tie the Eco b4 into your Apple home system allowing you to control it from anywhere using Siri voice control so no matter where you are you pull up Siri on your iPhone your iPad your iPod Touch Mac home pod or Apple TV to send voice commands to of the smart thermostat / home kit it's also compatible with IFFT if this than that as well as samsung's smart things app and smart home platform but like I said you can also control the Eco be smart thermostat using Amazon's Alexa so we can tie into Alexa and you can use your Alexa devices to control it things like the Amazon echo echo dot echo show but even better the Eco Boost murmurs that acts as its own Amazon Alexa device so what I mean by that is once you have the thermostat installed you can treat it just like an Amazon echo so you can talk to it to ask it to control other smart devices in your home now this version also has a much improved speaker over last gen you can also use it to play music you can ask Alexa to play music through your smart thermostat but the speaker usage doesn't stop there because just like Amazon echo devices you can also use the smart thermostat as an in-house intercom if you have other echo devices or the Eco be switch or other ecobee thermostats around your home and lastly taking the microphone and speaker to the ultimate level for a thermostat you can also make phone calls anywhere in North America for free using Alexa built in two smart thermostats you simply ask it to make a voice call to someone who's in your Alexa contacts then your thermostat will make the call hands-free right on your wall it's it's a sounding like there's there's no other smart thermostat that I've seen that can do these things this is very impressive so if you're looking to start building out your smart home this is one you might want to pay close attention to because it's that good inside the box you'll find the Eco be thermoset itself along with one room sensor with detachable stand aside from Alexa and home kick capability this is another area where the Eco B stands out the sensor is placed in the room that's separate from where the thermostat is placed allowing the system to monitor temperature and motion in more than one area so for example if your thermostat is located on your first floor but you spend a lot of time up on your second floor you take a sensor and put it up on the second floor in the room you hang out in and this will tell your smart thermostat that there's still someone in the house and therefore it'll keep the temperature right where you want it when you're at home alternatively it will also save you money when you aren't home by optimizing the temperature accordingly rather than wasting your resources and cash you get one sensor in the box as I mentioned but you can have up to 32 of these sensors spread throughout your home if you're a baller and even cooler these sensors also act as homekit triggers so you can go into a home kit and say hey if this sensor somebody walk into the room turn the lights on in that room as well so this is really more than just something that can help control your thermostat this can actually trigger a bunch of different things in your smart home you'll also find the power extender kit screws and drywall plugs trim plates a QuickStart guide installation guide wire labels and some ecobee stickers inside the box as well since I installed it myself I turned off the main power switch first so that I wouldn't hurt myself and that's actually something that ecobee recommends doing before you're working with wiring in your home and of course if you're uncomfortable with that whole process you can just hire someone to come by and professionally install the e could be smart thermostat as well he could be sensors to take about 45 minutes to install the smart thermostat I actually did it in 20 minutes and I am no handyman by any stretch of the imagination so if I can do it you can probably do it too the first thing you want to do is remove the thermostat you're currently using and then label your wires if they aren't labeled already mine were already labeled from when I originally installed an older nest thermostat so I was able to save a step there then you choose the trim plate that's applicable to you and screw it in place the ecobee backplate has a built-in level which is nice so you know that you're orienting everything the way that it should be from there you plug the wires for your system into the corresponding holes again keeping the wires labeled makes this a snap I got everything plugged in push the wires back into the wall and then connected the ecobee thermostat which just snapped into place without much force at this point installation is done and it's time to turn the power back on to start the boot up process the touchscreen interface is nice and it walks you through setup in an intuitive way during the process you are invited to download the ecobee app which mirrors the interface of the display making it super easy to control it from afar you also get the option of using your iOS device to quickly get the e kuu beep set up on your Wi-Fi network as well as getting alexa and home kits set up as well so you can control the thermostat with Siri or Alexa voice control both of these just add to the convenience of setup and makes a novice like me feel like I know exactly what I'm doing when installing hardware on my wall once everything is back up and running you can control the echo be smart thermostat in a few different ways when you're not standing directly in front the smart thermostat it has a view only mode on a display to make it easier to see from far away but when you walk up to it it actually automatically changes into interactive mode using that built-in proximity sensor from there you can control it by using the touch screen right on a device changing the temperature is as easy as sliding your finger up and down the right-hand side of the display you can also get a weather forecast right on the eco beeps well and of course you can change the settings too you can also use your smart phone to control the thermostat pulling up the Eco be app on your smart phone gives you the exact same experience that you would have if you walked up to the thermostat itself and what I mean by that is the interface matches exactly so if you know how to use a smart phone app then you know how to control a smart thermostat from its built-in display and if you know how to use a built-in display then you automatically are familiar with and know how to use the smart phone app as well and finally the star of the show with the Eagle be smart thermostat is voice control and again you can control it with Alexa Siri Bixby Cortana and the Google assistant and it's as easy as asking your favorite virtual smart assistant to do whatever you wanted to do with the temperature in your home now this is where a lot of the allure lies from me with the Eco be smart thermostat the fact that it's available to so many different smart home platforms more than pretty much any other currently shipping smart thermostat means that you can add it in different scenes depending on what your platform of choice supports or you don't even have that a platform of choice because you can connect it to multiple platforms at the same time and also not only can it be controlled from anywhere but you can also add it to different scenes and haven't participated play nice with everything else for example one thing I do in the evening before I go to bed I say goodnight to Siri and then what happens when I do that is my front door locks if it's unlocked my garage door will close if I accidentally left it open the blinds will be lowered all the lights are turned off - lights are then turned on and dims and the temperature on the ecobee is automatically lowered to where I prefer to be while I'm sleeping now all that happens with one command and it's super nice to be able to have my thermostat participate in that nightly ritual so if you're in the market for a smart thermostat that allows you to interface with it in multiple ways from connected devices I the Eco beat is the one to get and again you can also use it to ask a lesson to control your other smart home devices just talk to the Eco be smart thermostat and you can have it do things like turn off the lights in the room Alexa what's the weather in New York right now currently in New York at 75 degrees with partly sunny skies today you can expect intermittent clouds with a high of 75 degrees and a low of 51 degrees but now I want to hear from you guys what do you think of the Eco be smart thermostat are you as impressed as I am by all the different functionality that they packed into this by really tapping into everything that Amazon's Alexa service can do sound off in the comments below I'll meet you there for further discussion again 2:49 if you want to pick up the Eco be smart thermostat one thing you should know is if you do buy one you should check with your local utility service and see if they offer any discounts because I know here where I live if you buy one of these the electric company will actually give you a $75 credit on your next bill the new Eco be smart thermostat is one of my favorite smart home devices and it takes the place as my current favorite smart thermostat as well the previous generation was included in a recent video
