 [Music] welcome to lesson eight in our series on engineering research articles in this lesson we'll be looking at supporting your claims using evidence from the current research this is based on chapter 8 of our textbook in communication there's a typical pattern that you begin with shared knowledge and then you connect new ideas to that shared knowledge we can use an analogy of grafting a tree with grafting a tree you take a new shoot and you graft it on to an old tree now if you just cut off a new chute and stick it in the ground most likely it's going to die and if you stick it into a dead tree obviously it's going to die if you stick it into one that's not closely connected it also won't flourish it has to be grafted properly into a tree of a similar type similarly with research as you take your new idea you have to graft it into a living tree of fruitful branch of research and connect it firmly but where does that connection take place remember that we looked at in I M Rd in the introduction we typically have the first four components and those are all related to the past research in the methods division the author talks about what they did it's based on the past but it's what they did it's their present research and similarly of course the results and the discussion are talking about their present research so the break between past and present is very clear and comes at the beginning of the methods division it's very easy to find on the other hand in IPTC in the introduction again we have the past but then the beginning of the process division is the framework and that also is the past before going on to the research details in the the present research in the later part of the process division and then of course the testing is mostly present although comparisons with the past may be made and the conclusion is the present but this means that the break between past and present occurs in the middle of the process division making it a little harder to find so how clear is the break some writers make it very clear they talk about what's been done before and then they say at the beginning of a section in this section we and so it's clear that that's where their research begins other times it's less clear at the beginning of a section they stitch but they don't use that kind of a marker and so it's more difficult to tell or maybe in the middle of the section they've talked about framework and then in the middle of a section there's a new paragraph starting in this paper week that's a little less clear but still fairly clearly marked but sometimes they'll switch in the middle of a section without that kind of a marker or there are multiple switches between past and present those are much harder to find so I encourage you as much as possible in your own writing to stand out for clarity to mark clearly that break point to make it easier for your readers now remember that many claims are implicit particularly the claims 5 6 & 7 you never make a claim that says I collected my data in a valid and reliable way but you write your support you write what you did in a way that says I carefully followed established procedures so that it's clear that your data are valid and reliable and continue with other work so there are at least three different types of support from current research we know of course the data that's what we think of typically is support from current research but that data are worthless without talking about the validity of the data collection and in many branches of engineering we also have numbered examples or equations throughout the text particularly in mathematical treatments those will occur in the the framework and research details divisions the data collection obviously refers to the research details and the testing methods while the data are going to be found in the data patterns comparison Union the data data patterns so let's talk about each of those separately what about equations equations as I said are typically numbered for ease of reference this allows the the writer to refer back to them in a later section if a later author wants to talk about them they can also refer to the article but also to the numbered equation within the article similarly in linguistics education other social sciences there may be numbered examples which allow later writers to refer back to that particular example but these are less common in science and other non mathematical engineering treatments when they do occur they're most commonly found in the framework and the research details but may be found in the testing division sometimes in the introduction as well and then of course the the research and testing details these are found in the process and and/or the the testing division but they support claim to the idea that the data are reliable and valid and the or that you have a workable solution so where are these found exercise eight point one and eight point two ask you to find the break between the current research and the numbered equations and then it's also important to look at what keywords highlight reliability and validity as you're talking about the the details of the research and testing so I'll have my TAS show you how they found these in their own exemplar articles [Music] okay now we're going to look at our chemical engineering article and see where the current research is used to support the claims in that okay so this is my article the introduction division starts from here and we can see that there are lots of citations in the introduction division these are all past researches and here we can see that this is the framework that they use it and also they use lots of citations to support the framework that they believe is feasible and then here comes a research goal right so that's all most of the citations are in the introduction division and then here comes the method division because they based on the framework but they use their own concept so there's no citations now here it's very clear because you have the division between the introduction and the methods so this is the start of their work but they don't mark it particularly they don't say now we talked about our research because in chemical engineering everybody knows that yes because it's a typical way but added their own concept and they have target in the introduction division already so so they won't mention again in the method division so it's a break here that started fresh new here then they started the experiment right right right here good yes so here's all the parameters then they say for sensible comparison okay so they have to calculate yes so and here there's also they had to mention that how much ratio they use so also here is also the ratio here so all these are set based on past research to allow them to make a reasonable comparison with the previous work yes cuz they add their own concept and they and here's the support here so they use the concept of the framework and that they added their own way yes see about the framework which supports the validity of it and also the fact that they use similar methods parameters as other work so that it makes it easy to compare yes because and they also that they also list the equations here kind of equations that if anyone wanted to to do it again then they can use your yes okay now we'll do the same thing for our mechanical engineering article okay in my case the difficulty of in this one is to separate on to figure out the break point between the brain Berg and Lisa detail because in my case we have the second to a soirée that section two we also contained a 2 subsection 2 point 1 & 2 point 2 and as I have mentioned before the 2 point 1 is the percent of a word and to pay 2 is the research detail and the main point is we have no idea how to distinguish all recognize these two when when the frameworks start and when is n or when the Lisa details that because then so there's no marker there that I could recognize that says now we begin so you know which is frame working which is research details because you're in the field yes right but for a new graduate student just starting they would have difficulty telling where the new research began because there you don't have a clear marker there and it starts in the middle of a section ok the middle section they also are after the two point to destroy the section de Madrid is also the Lisa detail but they talk about the another made dot but after that they will combine the two point two and the tree together and then they will produce the day on metals okay and the next part is the section number four is a convergent erases this section is quite a special is my view because this section is try to our guarantee and show you that how this we work in practice because some time okay when you are when we get this kind of the technique order this result and hey how do you grantee that is we work in practice or in the experiment and this will show you that why enjoy some of mathematics so the theorem is proves in this case the validity of the method yes and here you have most of the current research is all of these numbered equations because that's this is a largely mathematical paper and so that's what shows the validity of the the work is the mathematics works yes right now let's look at our electrical engineering article in this one just like bones it's sort of difficult to tell where the the break point occurs between the framework the past research and the current research so how did you decide that this is the point that it begins so at dimension in here is that a d3 crap so if our people in our field they will familiar familiar with with T G and this is past well we mentioned in the framework and now they start dg2 a contract in their work so it will be mostly implements them now they start to contract a DG at follows right because you could say a DG is constructed about somebody else's work as well but if they said now we construct a DG graph or a DG then it's very clear that it's the beginning of their work yeah okay let's look also at the equations because that's a little unusual in here as well so the equation in here is that also in country because they just only mark the number at they are mentioned equation for assemble into house order equation if they don't mention in their paper they didn't matter number hmm that's unusual most papers mark all of them so that if someone else wants to refer to it in a later work there's still a number there they can refer back to yeah yeah but this one again it's unusual in a number of ways and that's just one more okay [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause]
