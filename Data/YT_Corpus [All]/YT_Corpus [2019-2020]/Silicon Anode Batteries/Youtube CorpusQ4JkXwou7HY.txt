 a nanowire battery uses nano wires to increase the surface area of one or both of its electrodes some designs silicon germanium and transition metal oxides variations of the lithium-ion battery have been announced although none are commercially available all of the concepts replace the traditional graphite anode and could improve battery performance topic silicon silicon is a desirable material for lithium battery anodes because it offers extremely desirable material properties silicon has a low discharge potential and a high theoretical charge capacity ten times higher than that of typical graphite anodes currently used in industry nanowires could improve these properties by increasing the amount of available surface area in contact with the electrolyte thereby increasing the anodes power density and allowing for faster charging and higher current delivery however the use of silicon anodes in batteries has been limited by the volume expansion during lithium silicon swells by 400% as it intercalates lithium during charging resulting in degradation of the material this volume expansion occurs in isotropically caused by crack propagation immediately following a moving lithium front these cracks result in pulverization and substantial capacity loss noticeable within the first few cycles the extensive 2007 review article by Kesava jolla at all summarizes early research on silicon based anodes for lithium ions secondary cells in particular Hongli at all showed in 2000 that the electrochemical insertion of lithium ions in silicon nanoparticles and silicon nanowires leads to the formation of an amorphous leacy alloy the same year bo GAO and his doctoral advisor professor otto Joe described the cycling of electrochemical cells with anodes comprising silicon nanowires with a reversible capacity ranging from at least approximately 900 to 1500 milliamp hours per gram research done at Stanford University indicates that silicon nanowires sin owes grown directly on the current collector via VLS growth methods are able to circumvent the negative effects associated with volume expansion this geometry lends itself to several advantages first the Nano wire diameter allows for improved accommodation of volume changes during lithium without fracture second each nano wire is attached to the current collector such that each can contribute to the overall capacity third the nano wires are direct pathways for charge transport in part based electrodes charges are forced to navigate inter-particle contact areas a less efficient process silicon nanowires have a theoretical capacity of roughly 4200 milliamp hours G carrot - 1 which is larger than the capacity of other forms of silicon this value indicates a significant improvement over graphite which has a theoretical capacity of 372 milliamp hours G carrot - one additional research has involved depositing a carbon coating onto the silicon nanowires which helps stabilize the materials such that a stable solid electrolyte interface say forms and say is an inevitable byproduct of the electrochemistry that occurs in the battery its formation contributes to decreased capacity in the battery since it is an electrically insulating phase despite being ionic ly conductive it can also dissolve and reformed over multiple battery cycles hence a stable se is preferable in order to prevent continued capacity loss as the battery is used when carbon is coated onto silicon nanowires capacity retention has been observed at 89% of the initial capacity after 200 cycles this capacity retention is on par with that of graphitic anodes today one design uses a stainless steel anode covered in silicon nanowires silicon stores ten times more lithium than graphite offering increased energy density the large surface area increases the anodes power density allowing for fast charging and high current delivery the anode was invented at Stanford University in 2007 in September 2010 researchers demonstrated 250 charge cycles maintaining above 80% of initial storage capacity however some studies pointed out that see nano wire anodes shows significant fade in energy capacity with more charge cycles caused by the volumetric expansion of c nano wires during litigation process researchers has proposed many solutions to remedy this problem published results in 2012 showed doping impurities - the nanowire anode improves the battery performance and it is shown that phosphorus doped c nano wires achieved better performance come with boron and undoped nano wire electrode researchers also demonstrated the possibility of sustaining an 85% of initial capacity after cycling over 6000 times by replacing nominally undoped silicon anode into a doubled walled silicon nanotube with silicon oxide ion permeating layer as coating the silicon nanowire based battery cell also provides opportunity for dimensional flexible energy source which would also leads to the development of wearable technological device scientist from Rice University showed this possibility by depositing porous copper nanoshells around the silicon nanowire within a polymer matrix this lithium polymer silicon nanowire battery l IOPS IL has a sufficient operational full cell voltage of 3.4 volts and as mechanically flexible and scalable commercialization was originally expected to occur in 2012 but was later deferred to 2014 a related company M Prius shipped a related device with silicon and other materials in 2013 canonical announced on July 22nd 2013 that its ubuntu edge smartphone would contain a silicon anode lithium ion battery topic germanium an anode using germanium nanowire was claimed to have the ability to increase the energy density and cycle durability of lithium-ion batteries like silicon germanium has a high theoretical capacity 1600 milliamp hours g1 expands during charging and disintegrates after a small number of cycles however germanium has 400 times more effective at intercalating lithium than silicon making it an attractive anode material the anodes claim to retain capacities of 900 milliamp hours per gram after 1100 cycles even at discharge rates of 20 to 100 C this performance was attributed to a restructuring of the nano wires that occurs within the first 100 cycles to form a mechanically robust continuously porous Network once formed the restructured anode loses only 0.01% of capacity per cycle thereafter the material forms a stable structure after these initial cycles that is capable of withstanding pulverization in 2014 researchers at Missouri University of Science and Technology developed a simple way to produce nano wires of germanium from an aqueous solution topic transition metal oxides transition metal oxides TMO such as CR 2 O 3 iron 3 oxide manganese 4 oxide and lead 4 oxide have many advantages as anode materials over conventional cell materials for lithium ion battery lib and other battery systems some of them possess high theoretical energy capacity and are naturally abundant non-toxic and also environmental friendly as the concept of the nano structured battery electrode has been introduced experimentalist start to look into the possibility of TMO based nano wires as electrode materials some recent investigations into this concept are discussed in the following subsection topic lead oxide anode lead acid battery as the oldest type of rechargeable battery cell even though the raw material LED for oxide for the cell production as fairly accessible and cheap lead acid battery cells have relatively small specific energy the paste thickening effect volumetric expansion effect during the operation cycle also blocks the effective flow of the electrolyte these problems limited the potential of the cell to accomplish some energy intensive tasks in 2014 experimentalist successfully obtained lead for oxide nanowires through simple template electro deposition the performance of this nanowire as anode for lead acid battery has also been evaluated due to largely increased surface area this cell was able to deliver an almost constant capacity of about 190 milliamp hours G minus 1 even after 1000 cycles this result showed this nano structured lead for oxide as a fairly promising substitute for the normal lead acid anode topic manganese oxide manganese for oxide has always been a good candidate for electrode materials due to its high energy capacity non toxicity and cost-effectiveness however lithium ion insertion into the crystal matrix during charging discharging cycle would cause significant volumetric expansion to counteract this effect during Operation cycle scientists recently proposed the idea of producing a li enriched manganese 4 oxide nano wire with a nominal stoichiometry of Li to manganese 6 oxide as anode materials for lib this new proposed anode materials enable the battery cell to reach an energy capacity of 1279 milliamp hours g -1 at current density of 500 mili amperes even after 500 cycles this performance is much higher than that of pure manganese 4 oxide anode or manganese 4 oxide nanowire anode cells topic heterostructure TM O's heterojunction of different transition metal oxides would sometimes provide the potential of a more well-rounded performance of libs in 2013 researchers successfully synthesized a branched iron 3 oxide nanowire heterostructure using hydrothermal method this heterojunction can be used as an alternative anode for the lib cell operation promotes a more efficient ionic transport while iron 3 oxide enhances the theoretical capacity of the cell by increasing the surface area a high reversible capacity of 980 milliamp hours G minus 1 was reported the possibility of fabrication heterogeneous ZN c o 2o for neo nano wire arrays anode has also been explored in some studies however the efficiency of this material as a notice still to be evaluated topic gold in 2016 researchers at the University of california-irvine announced the invention of a nano wire material capable of over 200,000 charge cycles without any breakage of the nano wires the technology could lead to batteries that never need to be replaced in most applications the gold nano wires are strengthened by a manganese dioxide shell encased in an plexiglass like gel electrolyte the combination is reliable and resistant to failure after cycling a test electrode about 200,000 times no loss of capacity or power nor fracturing of any nano wires occurred topic see also list of battery types list of emerging technologies nano ball batteries
