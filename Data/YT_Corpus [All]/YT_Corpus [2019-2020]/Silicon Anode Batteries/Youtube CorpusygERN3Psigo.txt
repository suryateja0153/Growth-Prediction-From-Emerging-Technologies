 the lithium-air battery Li air is a metal air electrochemical cell or battery chemistry that uses oxidation of lithium at the anode and reduction of oxygen at the cathode to induce a current flow pairing lithium and ambient oxygen can theoretically lead to electrochemical cells with the highest possible specific energy indeed the theoretical specific energy of a non aqueous Li air battery in the charged State with lithium oxide product and excluding the oxygen mass is approximately 40 point 1 mega joules per kilogram this is comparable to the theoretical specific energy of gasoline approximately forty six point eight mega joules per kilogram in practice Li air batteries with a specific energy of approximately six point one two mega joules per kilogram at the cell level have been demonstrated this is about five times greater than that of a commercial lithium-ion battery and is sufficient to run a 2,000 kilograms EV for approximately 500 kilometres 310 miles on one charge using 60 kilograms of batteries however the practical power and life cycle of Li air batteries need significant improvements before they can find a market niche significant electrolyte advances are needed to develop a commercial implementation four approaches are active a protic aqueous solid state and mixed aqueous at protic metal air batteries specifically zinc air have received attention due to potentially high energy densities the theoretical specific energy densities for metal air batteries are higher than fly on based methods lithium air batteries can theoretically achieve 3840 milliamp hours per gram a major market driver for batteries is the automotive sector the energy density of gasoline is approximately 13 kilo watt hours per kilogram which corresponds to 1.7 kilo watt hours per kilogram of energy provided to the wheels after losses theoretically lithium air can achieve 12 kilo watt hours per kilogram 43 to megajoules per kilogram excluding the oxygen mass accounting for the weight of the full battery pack casing air channels lithium substrate while lithium alone is very light the energy density is considerably lower Ally air battery potentially had 5 to 15 times the specific energy of a li-ion battery as of 2016 topic history originally proposed in the 1970s as a possible power source for battery electric vehicles and hybrid electric vehicles li air batteries recaptured scientific interest late in the first decade of the 2000s due to advances in material science although the idea of a lithium air battery was around long before 1996 the risk to benefit ratio was perceived as too high to pursue indeed both the negative lithium metal and the positive air or oxygen electrodes are the reasons why respectively rechargeable lithium metal batteries failed to reach the market in the 1970s the lithium ion battery in a mobile device uses our li c6 graphite compound on the negative electrode not a lithium metal nevertheless due to a perceived lack of other alternatives to high specific energy rechargeable batteries and due to some initially promising results from academic labs both the number of patents and the free domain publications related to lithium oxygen including li air batteries began growing exponentially in 2006 the drop in the apparent patent numbers since 2015 is due to a delay between the priority and publication dates for example the 30 month delay between a provisional application filing and the publication of a patent cooperation treaty application however the technical difficulties facing such batteries especially considering that they must be rechargeable for most applications are daunting topic design and operation in general lithium ions move between the anode and the cathode across the electrolyte under discharge electrons follow the external circuit to do electric work in the lithium ions migrate to the cathode during charge the lithium metal plates onto the anode freeing o2 at the cathode both non-aqueous with lithium oxide or lithium oxide as the discharge products and aqueous lioh as the discharge product leo 2 batteries have been considered the aqueous battery requires a protective layer on the negative electrode to keep the Lea metal from reacting with water topic anode lithium metal is the typical anode choice at the anode electrochemical potential forces the lithium metal to release electrons via oxidation without involving the cathodic oxygen the half reaction is Li Li plus plus e minus lithium has high specific capacity 3840 milliamp hours per gram compared with other metal air battery materials 820 milliamp hours per gram for zinc two thousand nine hundred and sixty-five milliamp hours per gram for aluminium several issues affect such cells the main challenge in anode development is preventing the anode from reacting with the electrolyte alternatives include new electrolyte materials or redesigning the interface between electrolyte and anode lithium anodes risk dendritic lithium deposits decreasing energy capacity or triggering a short-circuit the effects of pore size and pore size distribution remain poorly understood upon charging discharging in a protic cells layers of lithium salts precipitate onto the anode eventually covering it in creating a barrier between the lithium and electrolyte this barrier initially prevents corrosion but eventually inhibits the reaction kinetics between the anode and the electrolyte this chemical change of the solid electrolyte interface se results in varying chemical composition across the surface causing the current to vary accordingly the uneven current distribution furthers branching dendrite growth and typically leads to a short circuit between the anode and cathode in aqueous cells problems at the safe stem from the high reactivity of lithium metal with water several approaches attempt to overcome these problems formation of a li-ion protective layer using dye and try block copolymer electrolytes according to Co Inc such electrolytes eg polystyrene with the highly ion conductivity of a soft polymer segments such as a polyethylene oxide peo and li salt mixture combine the mechanical stability of the hard polymer segments with the high ionic conductivity of the soft polymer lithium salt mixture the hardness inhibits dendrite shorts via mechanical blocking li-ion conducting glass or glass ceramic materials are generally readily reduced by lithium metal and therefore a thin film of a stable lithium conducting material such as lithium phosphide or lithium nitride can be inserted between the ceramic and metal this ceramic based se inhibits the formation of dendrites and protects the lithium metal from atmospheric contamination you topic cathode at the cathode during charged oxygen donates electrons to the lithium via reduction mesoporous carbon has been used as a cathode substrate with metal catalysts that enhance reduction kinetics and increase the cathode specific capacity manganese cobalt ruthenium platinum silver or a mixture of cobalt and manganese of potential metal catalysts under some circumstances manganese catalyzed cathodes performed best with a specific capacity of 3137 milli amp ere's h per gram carbon and cobalt catalyzed cathode performed second best with a specific capacity of 2414 milli amp ere's h per gram carbon based on the first pore scale modelling of lithium air batteries the microstructure of the cathode significantly affects battery capacity in both non-poor blocking and pore blocking regimes mostly air battery limits are at the cathode which is also the source of its potential advantages atmospheric oxygen must be present at the cathode but contaminants such as water vapor can damage it in complete discharge due to blockage of the porous carbon cathode with discharge products such as lithium peroxide in a protic designs is the most serious several modes of precipitates were modeled a parameter dar was defined to measure the variations of temperature species concentration and potentials catalysts have shown promise in creating preferential nucleation of lithium oxide over lithium oxide which is irreversible with respect to lithium Li air performance is limited by the efficiency of the reaction at the cathode because most of the voltage drop occurs there multiple chemistry's have been assessed distinguished by their electrolyte this discussion focuses on a protic and aqueous electrolytes is solid-state electrochemistry is poorly understood in a cell with an aprotic electrolyte lithium oxides are produced through reduction at the cathode li + + e- + o2 + asterisk lithium oxide asterisk li + + e- + lithium oxide asterisk lithium oxide asterisk where asterisk denotes a surface site on lithium oxide where growth proceeds which is essentially a neutral leave akin see in the lithium oxide surface lithium oxides are insoluble in at prata collector lights which leads to cathode clogging a manganese 4 oxide nanowire array cathode augmented by a genetically modified m13 bacteriophage virus offers 2 to 3 times the energy density of 2015 era lithium-ion batteries the virus increased the size of the nanowire array which is about 80 nanometers across the resulting wires had a spiked surface spikes create more surface area to host reaction sites the viral process creates a cross-linked 3d structure rather than isolated wires stabilizing the electrode the viral process is water-based and takes place at room temperature you topic electrolyte efforts in lis air batteries have focused on four electrolytes aqueous acidic aqueous alkaline non aqueous protic and that protic in a cell with an aqueous electrolyte the reduction at the cathode can also produce lithium hydroxide topic aqueous an aqueous ly air battery consists of a lithium metal anode an aqueous electrolyte and a porous carbon cathode the aqueous electrolyte combines lithium salts dissolved in water it avoids the issue of cathode clogging because the reaction products are water-soluble the aqueous design has a higher practical discharge potential than it's a protic counterpart however lithium metal reacts violently with water and thus the aqueous design requires a solid electrolyte interface between the lithium and electrolyte commonly a lithium conducting ceramic or glass is used but conductivity are generally low on the order of 10 - 3 s per centimeter at ambient temperatures topic acidic electrolyte Tooley plus one half O 2 plus 2 h plus 2 li plus + h2o a conjugate base is involved in the reaction the theoretical maximal Li Aircel specific energy and energy density a 1,400 watt hours per kilogram and 1680 what hours L respectively topic alkaline aqueous electrolyte Tooley plus one half o2 plus h2o Tullio water molecules are involved in the redox reactions at the air cathode the theoretical maximal Li air self specific energy and energy density are 1300 watt hours per kilogram and 1520 watt hours L respectively new cathode materials must account for the accommodation of substantial amounts of lithium oxide lithium oxide and/or lioh without causing the cathode pores to block and employ suitable catalysts to make the electrochemical reactions energetically practical dual pore system materials offer the most promising energy capacity the first pore system serves as an oxidation product store the second pore system serves as oxygen transport topic aprotic non-aqueous Lee air batteries were demonstrated first they usually use mixed ethylene carbonate plus propylene carbonate solvents with lipsticks or libras sulfone amides salts like conventional li-ion batteries however with a gelled rather than liquid electrolyte the voltage difference upon constant current charge and discharge is usually between 1.3 and 1.8 volts with a no CP of CA 4.2 volts even at such ridiculously low currents is 0.01 to 0.5 milli amperes per square centimeter and 50 to 500 milli amperes per gram of c on the positive electrode see Figure 2 however the carbonate solvents evaporate and get oxidized due to a high over voltage upon charge other solvents such as n cap climbs DMSO dimethylacetamide and ionic liquids have been considered the carbon cathode gets oxidized above plus 3 point 5 volts viele during charge forming lithium carbonate which leads to an irreversible capacity loss most effort involved at protect materials which consists of a lithium metal anode a liquid organic electrolyte and a porous carbon cathode the electrolyte can be made of any organic liquid able to solve eight lithium salts such as lip 6l IAS f6 lin so2 CF 3 2 and Lissa 3 CF 3 but typically consisted of carbonates ethers and esters the carbon cathode is usually made of a high surface area carbon material with a nano structured metal oxide catalyst commonly manganese 4 oxide or a major advantage is the spontaneous formation of a barrier between anode and electrolyte analogous to the barrier formed between electrolyte and carbon lithium anodes in conventional li-ion batteries that protects the lithium metal from further reaction with the electrolyte although rechargeable the lithium oxide produced at the cathode is generally insoluble in the organic electrolyte leading to build up along the cathode electrolyte interface this makes cathodes in a protic batteries prone to clogging and volume expansion that progressively reduces conductivity and the grades battery performance another issue is that organic electrolytes are flammable and can ignite if the cell is damaged although most studies agree that lithium oxide is the final discharge product of non-aqueous leo 2 batteries considerable evidence that its formation does not proceed as a direct 2 electron electro reduction to peroxide owed to minus 2 which is the common pathway for o2 reduction in water on carbon but rather viral one electron reduction to superoxide o minus 2 followed by its disproportionation superoxide o minus 2 has traditionally been considered as a dangerous intermediate in a protic oxygen batteries due to its high nucleophilicity basicity and redox potential however report suggests that lithium oxide is both an intermediate during the discharge to peroxide lithium oxide and can be used as the final discharge product potentially with an improved cycle life albeit with a lower specific energy a little heavier battery weight indeed it was shown that under certain conditions the superoxide can be stable on the scale of 20 to 70 H at room temperature an irreversible capacity loss upon disproportionation of lithium oxide in the charged battery was not addressed PT C seems to be the best electro catalyst 4:02 evolution and o C for o2 reduction when lithium oxide is the product nevertheless the performance of rechargeable lithium air batteries with non aqueous electrolytes is limited by the reactions on the oxygen electrode especially by O 2 evolution conventional porous carbon air electrodes are unable to provide milliamp-hour per gram and milliamp-hour per square centimetre capacities and discharge rates at the magnitudes required for really high energy density batteries forever applications the capacity in milliamp hour per square centimetre and the SCI life of non-aqueous leo 2 batteries is limited by the deposition of insoluble in poorly electronically conducting leox phases upon discharge lithium oxide is predicted to have a better li + conductivity than the lithium oxide in lithium oxide phases this makes the practical specific energy of Leo two batteries significantly smaller than the reagent level calculation predicts it seems that these parameters have reached their limits and further improvement is expected only from alternative methods topic mixed aqueous aprotic the aqueous at protocol mixtli air battery design attempts to unite advantages of the a protic and aqueous battery designs the common feature of hybrid designs is a two part one part aqueous and one part a protic electrolyte connected by lithium conducting membrane the anode abuts the a protic side while the cathode is in contact with the aqueous side a lithium conducting ceramic is typically employed as the membrane joining the two electrolytes the use of a solid electrolyte see Fig three is one such alternative approaches that allows for a combination of a lithium metal anode with an aqueous cathode ceramic solid electrolytes CSE's of the nasa con family eg Li one minus XA X M 2 minus X po4 3 with a element of L SC Y and M element of T GE has been studied compatible with water at alkaline pH and having a large electrochemical window see phigs 3 for their lowly plus ion conductivity near room temperature 85 ohms cm to makes them unsuitable for automotive and stationary energy storage applications that demand low cost ie operating current densities over 100 milli amperes per square centimetre further both T and GE are reduced by metallic Li and an intermediate layer between the ceramic electrode and the negative electrode is required in contrast solid polymer electrolytes space can provide a higher conductivity at the expense of a faster crossover of water and of other small molecules that are reactive toward metallically among the more exotic membranes considered for Leo 2 batteries is single crystal silicon in 2015 researchers announced a design that used highly porous graphene for the anode an electrolyte of lithium Biss trifluoromethyl sulfanilamide dye methoxy ethane with added water and lithium iodide for uses of mediator the electrolyte produces lithium hydroxide lioh at the cathode instead of lithium peroxide lithium oxide the result offered energy efficiency of 93% voltage gap of point two and cycled more than two thousand times with little impact on output however the design required pure oxygen rather than ambient air topic solid state a solid-state battery design is attractive for its safety eliminating the chance of ignition from rupture current solid-state ly air batteries use a lithium anode a ceramic glass or glass ceramic electrolyte and a porous carbon cathode the anode and cathode are typically separated from the electrolyte by polymer ceramic composites that enhance charge transfer at the anode an electro chemically coupled the cathode to the electrolyte the polymer ceramic composites reduce overall impedance the main drawback of the solid-state battery design is the low conductivity of most glass ceramic electrolytes the ionic conductivity of current lithium fast ion conductors is lower than liquid electrolyte alternatives Topic challenges as of 2013 many challenges confronted designers topic cathode mostly air battery limits are at the cathode which is also the source of its potential advantages incomplete discharge due to blockage of the porous carbon cathode with discharge products such as lithium peroxide in a protic designs is the most serious several modes of precipitates were modeled a parameter dar was defined to measure the variations of temperature species concentration and potentials the effects of pore size and pore size distribution remain poorly understood catalysts have shown promise in creating preferential nucleation of lithium oxide over lithium oxide which is irreversible with respect to lithium atmospheric oxygen must be present at the cathode but contaminants such as water vapor can damage it you topic electrochemistry in 2017 cell designs the charge over potential is much higher than the discharge over potential significant charge over potential indicates the presence of secondary reactions thus electric efficiency is only around 65% catalysts such manganese for oxide co PT and O can potentially reduce the over potentials but the effect is poorly understood several catalysts improve cathode performance notably manganese for oxide and the mechanism of improvement is known as surface oxygen redox providing abundant initial growth sites for lithium peroxide it is also reported that catalysts may alter the structure of oxide deposits significant drops in cell capacity with increasing discharge rates are another issue the decrease in cell capacity is attributed to kinetic charge transfer limits since the anodic reaction occurs very quickly the charge transfer limits are thought to occur at the cathode you topic stability long term battery operation requires chemical stability of all cell components current cell designs show poor resistance to oxidation by reaction products and intermediates many aqueous electrolytes are volatile and can evaporate over time stability is hampered in general by parasitic chemical reactions for instance those involving reactive oxygen topic applications you topic vehicles Lear cells are of interest for electric vehicles because of their high theoretical specific and volumetric energy density comparable to petrol electric motors provide high efficiency ninety-five percent compared to 35 percent for an internal combustion engine li air sells could offer range equivalent to today's vehicles with a battery pack one-third the size of standard fuel tanks assuming the balance of plant required to maintain the battery was of negligible mass or volume topic grid backup in 2014 researchers announced a hybrid solar cell battery up to 20% of the energy produced by conventional solar cells is lost as it travels too and charges a battery the hybrid stores nearly 100 percent of the energy produced one version of the hybrid used a potassium ion battery using potassium air it offered higher energy density than conventional li-ion batteries cost less and avoided toxic byproducts the latest device essentially substituted lithium for potassium the solar cell used a mesh made from microscopic rods of titanium dioxide to allow the needed oxygen to pass through captured sunlight produced electrons that decomposed lithium peroxide into lithium ions thereby charging the battery during discharge oxygen from air replenished the lithium peroxide equals equals see also
