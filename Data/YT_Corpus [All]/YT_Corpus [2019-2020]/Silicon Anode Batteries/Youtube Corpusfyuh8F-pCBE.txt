 silicon air batteries are a new battery technology invented by a team led by Professor irony liar the grand Technion energy program at the Technion israel institute of technology silicon air battery technology is based on electrodes of oxygen and silicon such batteries can be lightweight with a high tolerance for both extremely dry conditions and high humidity like other hand out air batteries in particular metal air batteries silicon air batteries rely on atmospheric oxygen for their cathodes they accordingly do not include any cathodes in their structures and this permits economies in cost and weight experimental cells using a room temperature ionic liquid electrolytes have produced between 1 and 1.2 volts at a current density of 0.3 ml amperes per square centimeter of silicon topic history the only research report available to the public was done by its creator Yaron Eli Eli began research in Technion Israel Institute of Technology with David's to Robert's key graduate student Gil Cohen of Technium Digby MacDonald of Pennsylvania State University and Rica Hagiwara of Kyoto University Eli's reasoning for using silicon as a fuel cell is because of its high specific energy availability as a resource eighth most plentiful in the universe second most plentiful in Earth's crust tolerance of places with high humidity and non-toxic properties in their experiments they tested four different potential energies and voltages using different liquid oxygen solutions the experimental results in theories on the battery were published online in 2009 in the journal electrochemistry communications this got the attention of organizations such as dar PA and the Pentagon where they are currently working on military usage of this battery the battery is still under research by these organizations and not available for commercial use topic design the batteries energy source is made using an ionic liquid known as one-eighth i'll 3-methyl imidazolium oligo flora hydrogenate m e 2.3 h FF classified in the article is a room temperature ionic liquid RT IL and wafers containing high amounts of silicon the wafers act as an anode fuel source and the RT il acts as an electrolyte which turns the wafers into usable energy in its idle state the RT il dissolves the wafers at a slow rate because there is no semiconductor to speed up the reaction when put into use the RT il will then react faster to dissolve the silicon wafers which will produce energy for use in any electronics the battery lacks a builts and cathode that most batteries used to balance the anodes charge instead the membrane of the battery allows oxygen from the atmosphere to flow through it and acts as the cathode topic Spectre the stressed pillar engineered C Mo's technology readied for Evanescence Spectre is under research by D ARPA and SRIA it is based on a silicon air batteries with an added feature in equipment where the enemy is to be denied the ability to profit from captured devices or from information to be gained from such devices a Spectre battery can respond to a kill signal by self-destructing along with the device at powers this is of potential interest mainly in military applications topic storage capacity the storage capacity of the battery is very comparable to that of aluminum air battery the specific energy of the silicon air battery is estimated to be 8470 watt hours per kilogram and the energy density is about 2100 and 9.0 what hours L the battery voltage is 1 to 1.2 v by the use of a dedicated electrolyte flow system discharge times of more than 1000 hours can be achieved for aqueous electrolytes which allows for 100% usage of the silicon anode topic applications one particularly promising field of application for silicon air batteries is powering small-scale medical devices such as diabetic pumps and hearing aids in which tedious charging would be a disadvantage the nature of the silicon air battery also renders it particularly suitable for humid climates such as in tropical regions of Asia or America research is underway to develop silicon air batteries for everyday applications examples include power for consumer electronics such as laptops and phones efforts to develop deployable and scalable systems based on silicon air technology are underway topic see also list of battery types
