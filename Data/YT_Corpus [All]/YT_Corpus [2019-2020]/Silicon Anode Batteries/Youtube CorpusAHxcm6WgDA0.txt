 hi friends so battery and powertrain investor day is coming most people forget is a powertrain day too so I'm just reminding you like how I explained in this video on how fast horses transit to ice engines this day will seal the day of the end of an era for internal combustion engines also known as ice as an investor there are two things that an outside investor should look at I think it's chi or four but Elon Musk said two hour let alone must explain this to you himself if I were an outside investor I would really focus on on two things what is the timeline to full self-driving and what is your plan to scale and and battery production and and get the cost per kilowatt hour lower those those are basically battery cells and for self-driving those are the two strategic things that are of most importance so battery and power train investor day is a day that will blow everybody's mind because it's a mouse tone that was set the standard so high leaving everyone else in the dust by alpha margin I mean that is already a big gap but this gap is going to be as big as max piketty's and David Einhorn ego so in this video I'll cover the obvious stuff that will happen during battery investor day and talk about the stuff that it's not too obvious it's funny when I tell my friends that Tesla 30x their production capacity and they all give me like what a [ __ ] look you know I hope you understand that scaling is one of the hardest and in fact the hardest thing to do in any business being the biggest battery maker in the war and they want to like 30 exit it sounds crazy but let's discuss about this I've been working really hard on this video for the past three days and this video was supposed to be out yesterday sorry for being like one day late you see I really respect your time and I wouldn't release a video for the sake of releasing it and I really hope you like it appreciate the early thumbs up thank you so much first let's have a fast recap on the current technologies and thereafter your cover the obvious that will happen during battery investor day this is Tesla's current battery technology inside battery that's anode cathode and the separator why do we need a separator is because when the anode and cathode comes together kaboom okay so we need a separator so we didn't all batteries of like any battery maker we are talking about any brains out there the angle usually consists of graphite there are research looking into silicon but let's not go into there yet I really don't see that happening anytime soon let's look at cathode so cattle consists of mainly nickel aluminium and cobalt if it's the tesla powerwall this will be changed to manganese but let's not discuss about that yet eighty percent nickel fifteen percent aluminum and three percent copper you realize this doesn't add up to hundred percent is because you know must we thought it's gonna be less than three percent there are long numbers out there and some say nickel maybe eighty eight percent I cannot confirm the number so that it just takes this number s it is currently Tesla's battery technology can go 1,000 cycles so 1,000 cycles will bring 250 thousand Mouse and it has a battery density of about 247 and it costs above a hundred kilowatt hour so let's go into the obvious of what is going to happen during battery investor day I compile everything from everywhere I saw so this is the obvious so Tesla will definitely have the million mile battery this is like no questions asked they will hit the million mile battery so how is this gonna be achieved so looking at this document release if you look down here you can see that these are called chat cycles you see that the battery can go on for thousands cycles without much battery degradation means four thousand cycles and there is like ten over years to fifteen years of operation and still maintains a capacity of above 90% this is like mind blowing so it is done and I believe doing that investor day they will release the information on how they exactly can do to use and it's also going to be super obvious that they're going to be less than hundred kilowatts per hour because Elon Musk mentioned many many times that for electric vehicles would be competitive with a traditional eyes cars 100 kilowatts is the number so far there's some confirmation that Tesla can go below 100 ready but for the AMC pecs they are close to hundred so I believe on battery investor day is going to be less ten $100 so the next obvious thing is that they want to go to one terawatt hour so they want to 30x because currently they are producing like 30 gigawatt hour how do you achieve like 30x production this one they really do it but I will cover later like how are they going to achieve it the next super obvious is the acquisition of Maxwell and high bar what does Maxwell do they do dry electrode so currently our battery production uses wet electrode so what does it mean so let's say for example this is a piece of electrode and you will need to coat it with it's wet and then you go to a big drying oven to dry both sides and it takes a long process so imagine you just straightaway put a dry coating on it so in a trial actual technology instead of an oven what you need to do is just apply time so the next obvious thing is that the battery density has to go up how much above I got a hint that it's gonna be about 200 we'll cover that later that's our follow up it on and let's talk a little bit about this so this is the top view of a battery so when you look at the top view down this is how it looks like it looks like some kind of spring roll right so these are the many layers of anode cathode and separator this is a side view of a battery many layers of anode and cathode so they all roll up looking like a toilet paper room so now let's take a look at this slide if I'm going to flatten the entire battery so I unroll the entire toilet paper and I unroll it it looks something like this so currently when you discharge power the electrons will just escaped through this step out to the car so many electrons will escape through this step you will come from the father's and here and you escape the thing is true many charge cycles let me charge and discharge if you will look something like this so there'll be many of these electrons all over the whole place and you just keep going you will form this like line because this is a shortest route anyway I'd like to thank a limiting factor for coming video on how to explain this patent a lot better so our link his channel in the description below so anyway so the this tablet technology it looks something like this so when your entire tab is like entire row at words so let's say the electrons need to escape you can just go a direct route upwards so how does this help the battery a lot so number one will be less heat because the bed the electron doesn't need to try this way are we creating a lot he just and it is very very fast and because of that less heat and probably cooling gets a lot better so they there is so much advantages to this Tablas technology let's talk about Vito G so with the million-man battery this is going to help a lot what is Vito G basically connecting your vehicle to degree end with all the vehicles combined connected to degree it can power the grid so I'm going to do a super rough calculation my whole point you just let you understand that Vito G can turn your car into an asset a money-making asset so for example the different times of the day where energy cost is different so don't pick our it may cause a different amount doing off p.m. across a different amount so this may be a difference in charges so if you take the difference in this to roughly two hundred kilowatt hour is about seventy dollars so that means let's say you charge your card during off-peak and you take the energy and you feel a great doing peak hour so you roughly get seventy dollars for 200 kilowatts so over the month and just say over the one you do that every day or maybe every alternate day over the month your profits will be about three hundred dollars per month so true the lifespan of the entire car which is gonna be probably more than ten years with this minimal battery you take chura dollars and your times by ten years that is like thirty to forty thousand dollars this is a lot of money so let's say for example with this vehicle to grid technology they say oh kaya you put fifty thousand dollars your car in the next ten years can make you back fifty thousand dollars so your car essentially is free this is freakin mind-blowing and I think this is going to blow everybody's mind I'm just doing a rough calculation but it is going to be so freakin amazing so the last obvious thing I'll talk about is Tesla split poetry the play power train it was a tested you know but ring last year the lap time was crazy and you know must mention during the conference call is like alien technology i when he says alien technology you know it means quite a lot I try to search more online what can I get out of it I can't find anything at all so this is something I'm really looking forward for battery investor day so let's talk about what we do not know how much below 100 kilo what I do not know but I'll show you a chart so this is battery prices and it's been like 1000 plus dollars in per kilowatt hour in 2010 so now he has gotten way in 2020 is a hundred plus I'm Tesla is definitely below the hundred mark we do not know how much so maybe these are every other people and Tesla is like way below 100 what we do not know is how much battery degradation there will be so we do not know exactly how much battery decoration but we know it's going to be around the 4000 mark or above density wise so the proof of concept has been done it's been demonstrated above 300 what our per kilograms so I foresee this could be above 300 how much above I am NOT very sure how is Tesla going achieve 30x production this is the biggest question I have and many people have because when you look at the materials of Tesla battery there is more than enough aluminum cobalt you don't must say that he is going to carry on coma because of many ethical issues so next one we have the question mark laughs is there's not enough liquor production in the world and there's not enough graphite so how are they gonna solve for these two so if you look at how you don't mass has been always thinking he goes by the first principle approach he goes he stripped everything away and asked the most simple fundamental question so to 30x he needs how much Niko and how much graphite let me play you a clip I mean as he just said you know we basically did the quick math and looked at ok we're gonna build you know hundred thousand cars per year and this when you kilowatt hours per car you know therefore therefore you know 35 gigawatt hours of cells per year well that's a huge number and it was actually more than the entire world was producing for all applications cell phones computers cars everything so that is a crazy amount batteries needa and there's not enough materials available i show you some of the research i've done so this is the amount of nickel produce over the whole combined journey generally is quite well spread out and i believe it is easy to scale this up there is a plan on going to mining if you look at tesla apparently together with LG Chem ta ta Damien and watts wagon they are actually gonna form a consortium and going to probably go into mining in Indonesia for Nico so Nico I'm not really worried so what I'm really worried about and this is the one that kept me going down this deep rabbit hole because I show you the numbers now see china produces most of the graphite in the world and I'm like holy [ __ ] because it thing about remember the oil days where countries eat their control one resource they actually can do a lot of [ __ ] to threaten the war just like remember what happened in Middle East they can literally screw the wall so when I saw this like oh [ __ ] so what happened was that I went deeper so I checked all the available like natural reserves that maybe because she start exploration if you look at all this these are the rate don't get the rate diamonds these are things that we don't need this allows you graphite what we are looking for is the green one here so some in Mexico but you look at the whole woman or them a locator in China I'm like holy [ __ ] so further looking into this I'm not worried anymore because there are people making artificial graphite now and if the time comes and is neither people are skilling on artificial graphite so not worry anymore well Tesla goes into mining you see Tesla as far as I know they all want the most vertically integrated companies so they do everything themselves I believe they're going to money because they want full control so we cannot they cannot have a time where let's say the Donald Trump is China off in one day China pissed on a charm off and they not no more trade the voice grew okay if that really happens that's all will not would be the least true because there's a lot more other companies more dependent on China so all these companies are going to die first test I'll be the last one to die because they are the most vertically integrated so just saying so would it go in the mining my answer is probably yes because you don't kind of like hinted that before and then as we as we scale fat reproduction to very high levels we actually have to look further down the supply chain and we might get into the mining business I don't know maybe uh-huh yeah a little bit at least is recycling because recycling because you see in the battery cell all the materials are there so all they need to do is just extract it and do new ones again it's a lot cheaper than going to the mine itself so I believe Jamie Shaw was working on this he left like Tesla one or two years ago so he is Rick I couldn't find any more materials on this but I believe very strongly that you work on doing battery investor day and talk about all the recycling of materials so concluding this video if test out who this off is going to be epic and it's going to be the end of ice and jeans it can be end of an era of shitty air and of like using dinosaur fuel and it will be a really good future I want you to imagine like five to ten years down the road Tesla his batch intensity of like 400 watt hour per kilograms that it is dye disruption zone for battery technology to go into aircraft so we live in a very disruptive era and be invested in Tesla is like one the best ways to take part in this disruption anyways appreciate those who have me the thumbs up thanks for being awesome and hope all my war had given you better insights and all as always invest safe [Music]
