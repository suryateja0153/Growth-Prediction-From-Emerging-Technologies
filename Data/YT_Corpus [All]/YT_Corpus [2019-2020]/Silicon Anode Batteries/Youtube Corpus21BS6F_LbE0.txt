 [Music] welcome to our last lesson on engineering research articles in this lesson we'll be looking at sections of two different chapters in the first part we'll be looking at chapter 9 point 4 looking at the styles used in engineering writing and then in the second part of the lesson we'll be looking at a part of chapter 19 where you'll begin to actually plan and work on your own writing now unfortunately in an online course it's very difficult to cover the actual writing number one because it's very different in every field and even every genre it's also very time intensive and therefore very difficult for grading and in a massive online course so there's much more information on this in the textbook but as far as the actual writing and help with that you'll have to talk with your advisor or a writing instructor about that okay but let's look at writing styles style refers to how much information you give the reader there are two basic styles called condensed and extended condensed assumes that you have a lot of information there's a lot of old information that's known to both the the writer and the reader extended style on the other hand conveys new information and so there are things that make reading easier particularly introductory summaries and topic sentences let me explain what those are the summary paragraph is an introductory summary that says what's coming ahead it's sort of like if you had a GPS unit it warns you in 100 meters turn left and then at the beginning of each paragraph there's often a topic sentence that says what that paragraph is about this is sort of like the GPS telling you when you reach the corner turn left and these both help readers to follow the argument through all the twists and turns of the argument on the other hand condensed style you don't have either of these you don't have summary statements or topic sentences each sentence conveys separate information and this is sort of like when you're in familiar territory the GPS can be annoying you don't need to know that you need to turn you already know that and so that extra information is distracting and often you'll turn the GPS off the same in condensed style the information that's not needed is just turned off so let's consider where we would expect to find these different styles and this matches up very closely with what we looked at in the last lesson about past versus present research the introduction is about the past research things that should be relatively well known and therefore is usually written in a fairly condensed style although there may still be topic sentences at the other end of the article in the results and discussion or testing and conclusion that's all new information and therefore tends to be written in extended style on the other hand the methods division in I am Rd again that's known information and that tends to be written in a very short very condensed style but the process division that's entirely new and therefore tends to be written in extended style [Music] okay now we're going to look at our exemplar articles to see where we can find extended or condensed style in those articles okay so introduction is the content style because there is no topic sentence and there is no summary there's all citations and past research and also here there's no topic sentence and no summary but in the experiment part that the first part that it didn't show the topic sentence and it didn't show the summary so we recall this as Canasta but here although the content is kind of style but it has the topic sentence because it's a concept from the framework so it used a topic sentence here and also at the third paragraph it also has a topic sentence but also in condo style right so sometimes there's not a strong distinction between the extended and condensed style there are intermediate forms particularly topic sentences that you'll find in either one not regularly necessarily not in every paragraph but as you say here at the beginning of a section it will point out and that again calls attention to the fact that they're looking at two and three layer if people don't look at the title they get it from the from the first sentence in the paragraph yes because this is kind of a new thing compared to the traditional way right hmm so here the fourth part is also the content style and the fifth fifth part also and in the resulting discussion although there is no topic sentence or summary but it's also it also used external style because it has explanations and comparisons progressing a comparison gears so all the resulting discussion part is condon extended styles but it still doesn't have the the summary paragraphs or the topic sentences that you might expect so again it's not extremely extended like some of the other ones that will look at that and that's typical of chemical engineering it tends to be more condensed that's part of why the articles tend to be shorter in this field yes yes the structure is not that clearly but most of the component that is necessary in a in a paragraph that will be due but just no topic sentence a summary still and for the last part is a conclusion that is also condensed style right so again condensed out clearly dominates in the in chemical engineering article yes yes now the same for our mechanical engineering article okay ah they look at their introductions actually in some plug gap in introduction we also have like some kind of the topic sentence but actually it's not you got it just like the introduction what they will say but it's not some write what they say yeah so we will consider this one has a condensed I and I hate going to the section two and starting the process divisions we have the two point one as we know is a framework so here we have know the topic sentence and okay move on to the two point two we have the letter a topic plot gap instead of sentence so because this Prague a poor so some rice the whole section whole subsections so that's interesting you said that framework two point one is framework and you don't have extended style you don't have a summary because that's old information but you get into two point two that's the new information and it does have a summary and that's what we would expect yes okay and yeah as well for the section treaty or so is a new new information so we have the some rights a prog-rock here and to some right for the whole section mmm yeah it's uncommon for the section fall because this one is also new information but no no the some rice said heads on down here it just jumps right into it and I think that's because it's sort of a continuation of section 3 it's a it's a different topic but it's continuation of the mathematical analysis and so they don't have a separate introduction to that oh it is possibility for the scholar in this field we know this kind of the B sections they start by the conference analysis yeah okay and okay going to the testing divisions even here we have some Kyle ID as we have seen the interaction division we also have Leiter is look like the summer summarized sentence but for this one they just show that or we have the submissions and experiment and you show that okay we have the similar similar management so and then they will compare so did it describe it or some write what they have done here so because this one has a condensed because as you see the lunch of they are written here is really Shawn hmm yeah but so again I mean this is sort of shows that there's not a clear distinction always that they have a summary paragraph before they go into five point one which is simulation and five point two which is the experiment but because that whole section is so short they don't go into great detail as they might in a fully extended format okay and okay the final one is conclusions so in this part we have no the summarize sentient here so it's also condense time right so again yours is largely condensed style with just a few elements of the the extended style topic sentences and maybe one short summary or two short summaries but other than that it's largely condensed okay now in our electrical engineering article we're going to see a lot more of the extended style so this article in electrical engineering day on Muslim use the extended style and that you can see in the first session so they they we start with the samurai paragraph to talk but they are we talk in the more detail in a later right so this is typical of the extended style that you you often have a summary paragraph before the the sections and and that summarizes what's going to come in the in the different sections yeah similar light us we also have on this is the heart to play rock rap is also summer I know this the recession right so in this case you have the first one talks about the overall goal to reminder of the research goal and then the second in this section it talks about how this part addresses part of that goal yeah and another thing so I start at this obsession don't stop keep their samurai but I'll wrap and then they spread a damn mantis you know right before the sub subsections yeah right you can see yeah it's similar like I saw this obsession is all the way how to summarize paragraph yeah and later on they they also have the connection between the alas rivers and now they go on their session you know okay so this is a different kind of summary because this is pointing out a summary of the previous section before they before they go on yeah so it's a connector right there's another function in that's common in extended style okay and in Georgia yeah just before the success and always they summarize what they are doing on there is just did help by somebody's father signature artist and then they move into the experimental whistles right and the experimental results just jumps right into it which is again common in in this field it talks about the testing methods and then directly into the results without any sort of a summary because that title experimental results by itself indicates to readers what to expect yeah yeah okay just with another session and also this thing is then distilled right because yours has that sort of unusual structure mixing process and testing this is the next process section and the game goes back to the extended style yeah okay very good okay so now you should be ready to begin your own writing there's more information about reasoning and sequencing strategies in the rest of chapter 9 and again there's a lot more on writing strategies in the rest of the textbook we'll talk about a few of those things in the second part of this lesson to get you started but then you'll be on your own for actually doing your own writing [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause]
