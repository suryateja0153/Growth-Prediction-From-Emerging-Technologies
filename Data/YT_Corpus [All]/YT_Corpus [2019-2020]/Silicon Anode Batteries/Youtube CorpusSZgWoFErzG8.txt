 [Music] okay in the second part of this lesson we'll be looking at the types and locations of graphics in different research articles now current data are usually presented in graphics because graphics make it much easier to see patterns in the data and as we've said patterns are very important in in data data also need to be discussed in the text however at a minimum the writer needs to mention each of the graphics pointing to it but in IMR D in particular it's common to talk about what you should look at in those graphics in IPTC there may be many specific types of graphics that are common in the field and it's assumed that readers will be able to interpret just by looking at that at that graphic now again it's important to remember that graphics is not the same as graph graphics includes both tables and figures tables includes numerical tables those are the most common in science and engineering but you may also have non numerical tables things like parameters conditions that talk about the settings that went into some research where you're not comparing sets of numbers but you're just looking at where those parameters were set and then in in figures you have both graphs and illustrations a lot of writing texts talk about figures just as graphs and that could include line graphs bar graphs and many other kinds but in engineering illustrations are also very important you have photographs and particularly many different kinds of diagrams many different kinds of schematics which are very important in in engineering okay now we'll look at the graphics in our chemical engineering article okay so now we can first look at here it's a special part called graphical abstract now of the journal they require that we have to put this one because I but I think it's a good thing that we can go through the whole topic by this and here we see the introduction no graphics and no figures also the method division also don't have because they are calculations right so almost of the figure are in the result and discussion division because we can see that they started from figure 1 ok so even though these occur before you get to that designation you look for the thing that says figure 1 in terms of determining what division 2 to call those yes because some of the journal that they would like to put the figure in the last part of the page right they doesn't like to put at the beginning so sometimes they will put before the article that dimension right so we can see that here we can find mmm yes so the graphics here this illustration is not used and now this is the graphs now we can also see it really clear and here also the graphs and now here that is figure in figure 6 rotors have graphs and have illustration right so in illustration that's a pro support these graphs right so this is one of the difficulties in counting because if you're counting just the number of numbered figures it may not include the fact that there this one figure has two graphs and two illustrations but on the other hand in terms of the number of places it's mentioned in the text it's important to know how many how many numbered figures there are as well so in the table we're going to show both the number of actual graphs and illustrations as well as the the count of figures because both are important for different purposes yes because using the illustration to the product to support the graph it kind of been more common in chemical engineering goes through so we have to count it like half and half right yes and now we can see the conclusion that they will no there will be no graphs or tables that is also very common here right it's common across all fields of engineering yes now we'll look with the graphics in our mechanical engineer an article okay so if we look at the introductions as you can see this one actually we have no the any copy in this one but it show in the section 2 because in section we Daniel just cry about the figure 1 here okay a second bigger one is to try about the schematics not a glob even they show the XY right it's next Y so you might think that this is a graph but it's it's really showing a physical situation yo it's not graph in in the traditional sense of a graph so some things may be hard to interpret whether it's a graph or an illustration especially if it's specific to a particular field I think nothing can help the later is the bigger title because this one is really obvious is end of um our configuration so yeah it's true that's not the graph right and the second one is as well it's like a c1 c2 as an XY graph right but if you look at a bigger title it's not right is that an example of the des belles partitioning yeah and this one is a 2 is to figure in the research detail ok ok let we look at the testing divisions or we have a lot of the graphics make a Indies is a bigger tree but if you look at here in bigotry we have one we have stick graph here yeah and then in figure 4 we have full graph and this one is quite special the table one because this one is show the parameter used in the simulations it's not the result at all right yeah so and and it it's interesting because it has the like the parameter and then the the setting but it actually has two columns yeah and but it's basically a list that's broken into two columns just to save space yes right so it not really a table in the traditional sense but it's that's the only thing they can call it because they don't have parameter list as uh as a designation yeah actually this one is a plummet er risk but it's just save the space at you just general right yeah so this one is not cow as a non America on the recode table at you have mentioned in their own before yeah but if you had to call it something you would probably call it non numerical because you're not comparing any numbers in it is just a list yeah it like they're the conditions right yeah exactly okay and that one is also this one is registration to show how the how to set up their experiments this win is a experiment resolve this one as well but they are record and just pick up the some snap of the video like COD here so again you have graphs and illustrations in the same figure right now we'll look at the graphics in our electrical engineering article so in this article the breakfast at the beginning in the introduction session and this will be the first figure in really mercury and this will be focused on the how to the model step in equivalent to gender stander and then later on they will have the crop in there and they decide there is just - mm-hmm so this is very common in electrical engineering that they have something some sort of a diagram in the introduction that talks about the whole system yeah usually indoor electrical engineering they will have the big picture at the beginning to say what they are doing forget what mm-hmm yeah and so this does the same it gives sort of the general picture before talking about the specifics of their research okay and then what else is come here so some paper in energico field they also Kondos it a few yeah but if this article they didn't mention that nature count is evident right so sometimes it refers to as you can see in algorithm one and other times the algorithm will have a separate figure designation because it's not a table so it must be a figure those are the only two options algorithm is sort of a separate category so sometimes it gets a separate designation and sometimes not yeah like here okay what else if we look at the table so here is there a condition generate the condition because not not in no more table to compare vision right so this is like booms table of parameters the settings that we're going to use hmm okay and in here we also have to the table with a comparison to two different methods right so this is the typical table that you would have in the testing division that shows the the results of the paracin yeah so now let's look at the tables we have known that there's a gravity go abstract so we can get one graph and one illustration at the abstract division and there's no tables or figures in the introduction method and discussion division so all of the figures are in the result division and because of the figure six that we got one graph and one illustration so we got 0.5 and 0.5 each in the results and discussion division of my mechanical engineering article in this table here and note that number in the parenthesis it represents the number of figures and number out size is represent graph and illustrations and for examples is in this column sorry in this law the the out fold figure in a testing divisions but in these four figures they have 13 graph and two illustrations and right now we want to look at the relationship between the table and figure and IPTC division in this case as you can see the most of the figure and the tables they belong to the testing divisions but only fill they belong to the prostate division and notable and figure in the introduction and conclusion divisions and what are why this happened the main reason is the literature in this field they're people to describe the results in graph format so there's reasons why we have a lot of bigger and tables in a testing emissions and sometime the researchers try to describe the some listed detail in the sacramental order at gamma so we have a few illustration in the process divisions and introduction introduction and conclusion divisions the rich literature can describe off the inverse so we have no the any figure or table in the iteration and conversions this is a table samurai drafted by division in electrical engineering article and as you can see in the prostate division we have total a figure and one table top about a condition and in the 13 division they are have two table and don't have any field okay so let's try to summarize and compare the different articles that we've looked at chemical engineering was the only one that had a graphical abstract and therefore had graphics in the abstract itself and that's relatively common in chemical engineering but very rare in most other fields apart from that all of the graphics were in the results and discussion division similarly in the mechanical engineering article we found that most of the illustrations most of the graphs were in the testing division although there were a couple in the in the process and then in comparison the electrical engineering article had a lot of illustrations in both the introduction and particularly the process division showing how this was set up and again that's very common in engineering because it's hard to describe in words these new designs and so this is a common pattern but it's not true for all articles or all fields and so again you need to compare your own field and find out the the pattern in your own field okay so we've looked at the numbers of graphics and in the different papers but there's also a difference in the text and where they're described in yours there's usually more description of Ian's table such-and-such look at something why do you think that is yes because if there's a table or there's any graphs because they include many many data points it it shows a trend of property of the material so we have to explain that that the trend that the comparison of each other like different put different parameters and so there will be a lot of explained or this sorted or described so if there are no dip described then maybe the videos won't know that why they put the table or why they put a graph you write those tables and graphs are used for lots of different things and so if you don't say what to look at okay it's a line but what should I notice about the line yes whereas in in some of the other your illustrations your schematics someone knows what to look for right you look at a schematic yeah so someone we're familiar with this Malthus coding you know what I mean me right yeah so in each field there are special things that you I mean you have SEMS you know how to look at an SEM but they probably don't because they haven't seen them so a lot of these graphics require field specific knowledge and able to in a vegetative and interpret and understand them yeah and so you don't know how much detail you need to describe until you know your audience you know if your audience is familiar with it you don't need to describe as much so you always need to consider your audience and your writing okay good but I think that's probably enough for graphics and next week we'll finish up if your research uses statistics it's important to pay attention to that to read section 8.6 in the text and other places that you can find listed under statistics or statistical in the index these are some terms statistical standard deviation confidence interval others that will indicate statistics they're not very common in engineering so I'm not going to talk about them here but again if it does apply to your article please pay careful attention to those now your assignment again you need to determine where various types of support from current research are found in your own article where the breaks occur between past and present what types of equations details data are used and where they occur and then make a table to summarize where the different types of graphics are found you'll find this helpful when you do your own writing so you have an idea of how many graphics you're going to need and where they should be placed in the article [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause]
