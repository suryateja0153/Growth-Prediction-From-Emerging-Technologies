 hello guys this is just a follow-up  video of my previous upload  about thyristor SCR  Triac Diac and how to test They are asking if there's a way to test an SCR using an analog Multimeter only Yes It can be tested by a multimeter only But it depends on the Gate triggering voltage So if the gate triggering voltage is higher than 3 volts There's no way you can test it with this multimeter because it has only 3 volts battery inside some are requesting assuming the trigerring voltage is below 3 volts They are asking for a demo on how to test using multimeter tester only And It just happened that our sample here is below 3 volts I have the specification here So it's written here The maximum required DC gate voltage to trigger At 25 degree centigrade It will be 2.5 volts so we still can use our 3 volts multi-tester Ill just show you the faster way on how to test using our multi-tester only here's our SCR and our tester we will going to connect our black probe to anode because the output positive flow is the black probe and the negative flow is the red probe for this specific analog meter so the red probe will be connected to cathode just follow this connection then we will trigger the gate by shorting it to the anode lets try it set the multi-tester to X1 range then try to short the probe to confirm if the tester is working red probe to cathode black probe to anode then we will try to short the anode and gate observe the needle of the multi-tester short it for a while it triggered try it again short the anode to gate it was latched even our tester has a 3 volts battery only just open it to remove the latching again that's the way on how to test an SCR with below 3 volts triggering voltage but you cannot use this way to trigger an higher triggering voltage SCR if it has more than 3 volts triggering voltage you can see my previous video in that video I showed an accurate way on how to test an SCR ever the triggering voltage is higher than 3 volts you can comment if you have any question and please click like and subscribe
