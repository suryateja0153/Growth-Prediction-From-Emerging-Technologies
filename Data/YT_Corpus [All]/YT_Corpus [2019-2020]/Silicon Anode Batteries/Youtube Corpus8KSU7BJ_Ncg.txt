 tesla declared some impressive ambitions at its battery day this past september and the berlin brandenburg plant will play a role in realizing those ambitious aims joining us now very early in the morning his time is tesla's visionary ceo elon musk elon musk absolutely great to have you with us and thank you so much either for staying up late or getting up at the crack of dawn uh great to see you so you you have been putting a lot of emphasis on battery innovation recently i'd like to ask you about why that is and what you see as the most critical areas where improvement is needed and also how realistic the chances are that we will see that kind of improvement mr musk i think maybe your microphone might be on mute is that possible yes there we go thank you so much i can hear you very well thanks i did yeah um okay well thanks crystal thanks for having me um and uh it's an honor to talk to everyone so the as far as range is concerned we um i think have shown that the range can be uh very long in fact we we could make it even longer than it is today um but our longer strange vehicles have a range uh over 600 kilometers um and uh and and there's there's more we could we could actually do more than that and you'll see actually some uh improved versions of our vehicles come out with uh over 600 kilometers range starting to approach 700 kilometers and we even have uh some other development long term that can do a thousand kilometers so the uh what we see is really the fundamental uh impediment to progress with batteries is the cost so um if you've got if you've got range if you've got rapid recharge um and um and then all those can be achieved and a high calendar and high cycle life um so your batteries can last like 15 years which i would believe ours currently can then the what it comes down to most of all is uh improving the cost so that the affordability of batteries is of battery-powered cars electric vehicles is improved and so that everyone can afford to buy an electric car that's that's really what we see as the the fundamental thing that needs to be improved um now along the way there will also be uh improvements in energy density which really translates to improvements in range um so in pursuit of lower cost batteries you actually end up try um a lot of cases with improved energy density which also gets more range so um the long term goal would be to try to get to um a cost per kilowatt hour of perhaps around um uh 58 cents or 35 cents at the cell level for a long range battery cell um and in order to get there there are a lot of innovations that are necessary both in the cell design and in the design of the the factory that produces them so in fact there's quite a bit more work in the in building the machine that builds the machine uh than in the the cell itself so it one needs to design the cell in the right way um and then uh very with the very difficult part and i can't emphasize this enough a very difficult part is then scaling up that production and achieving extremely high reliability and safety with the cells so we would it tells us we've put a lot of effort into this over many years um mostly internally but they've also been some key acquisitions that have been instrumental in achieving a low cost per kilowatt hour and that's uh that's what we intend to build at the prospective gigafactory in berlin vandenberg area just ask you uh in terms of scaling up what you see as the biggest hurdles to mass production i think um there is the very element of scale itself um in that do we it's important to achieve economies of scale um to make the batteries affordable so things have to be done at extremely high volume so that means a very big factory um and not just one that is big but also one where the um the cycle time through the factories is very low so you have fast cycle time with a big factory is what yields a high output in order to achieve a fast cycle time um and a high precision you need to develop advanced machinery for every aspect of the production system so this is really everything from how these the cell can is made to the how the uh the electrode precursors the cathode and the anode precursors are made so then making the anode cathode materials to applying them uh to uh the the the conductive conductor um and for this we have for example the a very special process called the dry electrode deposition um which is much better for the environment it's basically allowing going to put on that to apply the electrode to the conductive ribbon in a way that it does not require solvent and or or require bait to to to them the normal way these things start you you you create a slurry of the electric materials and then uh you put the this wet slurry on and with a lot of solvent and that solvent is uh baked away by the ovens uh and and this this is this is obviously self-optimal from an environmental standpoint because you've um so you have the gases coming from us from the solvent that you have to then get rid of um but with dry electrode processing you do not need the uh the solvent you don't need the the drying ovens um and you can apply it directly this this maybe sounds simple but it's really very difficult um and uh but in fact a lot of the specialized equipment we use for this comes from germany and elsewhere in europe so but it does it doesn't exist it's being made it's it's really under design and and and you know we're we've made them made it now at kind of a bench top level and we're aiming soon to have it done at a pilot client level um and then the intent for berlin brandenburg would be to have it done at scale um a scale at scale in and of itself comes with a lot of design challenges um that have it's a lot of r d that's going to be done just to solve this talk to us a bit if you would uh in general about your plans for the battery cell plant within the gigafactory berlin brandenburg as you know people here very excited about this so what more can you tell us sure so the we want to go from where we have a small pilot plant which is basically proof of concept uh in uh california to um uh so something that that will actually be i think possibly the largest uh battery cell plant in the world but i i think it will be the largest um it would be capable of over a hundred gigawatt hours per year of production and then possibly over time going to to 200 or 250 gigawatt hours a year pretty confident at that point it would be the largest battery cell plant in the world um and uh as i said a lot of processes where we have to uh quite radically improve the cycle time um and where we have to redesign machinery for continuous flow operation uh i i've said this publicly on many many occasions that the designing the uh the prototype of really of any advanced technology um is i think relatively easy uh and then scaling up to high volume production is is very hard um and in fact there's an old saying it's like it's one percent inspiration and 99 perspiration it might be 99.9 in the case of of battery cells you will see a lot of announcements of this cell breakthrough that cell breakthrough this technology breakthrough and say okay well why can't they just make a lot of them it's because the the scaling up of the production process is much harder than moving something out on a lab bench so great um in fact it might be helpful to provide everyone with just just a walkthrough of the tesla um pilot plant and if you see how intense it is even at the very small pilot plant level you can imagine how much more it would be at something that is perhaps 100 times more throughput thank you it's intense yeah thank you so much for the inspiration perspiration uh ratio there i'll be taking that into some of our future uh discussions here at the conference when we talk about uh technology and breakthroughs let me ask you this because we've been hearing all morning from the speakers on policy issues that they see sustainability as absolutely key to the european comparative advantage in this area so you mentioned some sustainability considerations around solvents and slurry and so on could you say a little bit more about your view on the environmental impact of battery production and what you're doing at tesla to take it uh toward a more sustainable direction yeah absolutely um as you had i think the the dry electrode uh production process is uh in and of itself quite a game changer it's a fundamental improvement compared to using solvent and then having to dry up the solvent and deal with the the off-gassing from the solvent that's for sure is a big one um there are um some um proprietary methods by which the the cathode is produced in the first place where we avoid um a lot of the steps that are environment that are difficult to deal with environmentally um and one of the things we're doing is we are reducing the for example the cobalt content um so that avoids like a cobalt mining issue so it would be um a pure nickel or almost pure nickel anode and then eliminating likes a bunch of the steps of processing of the nickel electrode which um then obviously is good for the environment um we're moving to a high silicon um anode but it's a it's a silicon anode that where the silicon does not require um a lot of it's not energy intense to create the silicon it's using silicon that is comparable to solar uh sort of solar panels sort of voltaics photovoltaics um we also come up with a means of creating lithium hydroxide without use of sulfuric acid so it actually uses sodium chloride essentially table salt to extract the lithium from lithium clay deposits and that and then that table salt is able to be reused so there's this there's really a whole series of steps that are employed to ensure that the environmental impact of the cell production is um is very clean and that you could be living right next to the battery cell plant and you wouldn't even have detectable amounts of any toxins uh in in the air so if you had like an air tester you wouldn't you would not uh notice anything literally um and it's it's notable that uh our pilot plant was the um you know sort of basic group of concept is located in the san francisco bay area which is renowned for extreme environmental requirements so if there was anything that was bad it's really not possible to do it in the san francisco bay area that will be very good news uh to those who enjoy the beautiful forest around the gigafactory facility so uh just a couple more short questions if i may uh one of them uh regards uh a long discussion about whether we will ever see electric uh trucks as being truly viable and you started out in your remarks talking about range uh so what's your response to the pessimists who say not gonna happen well i think this is really just a fundamental um calculation of you say like what's the energy density of the uh of the battery of the cell and then of the battery pack and then if the integrated battery pack and truck uh chassis um so it's a sort of total mass of the uh of the semi truck before you know before including the trailer or anything and can you get that mass down to something which is comparable to existing uh diesel trucks uh i think the answer is absolutely yes and we demonstrated that with uh prototype trucks um and so getting a range of let's say uh 500 kilometers is i think quite easy i like trivial to be frank um for a semi truck um and this is assuming a truck that's pulling a load of something on the order of 40 tons 40 metric tons um so um just a heavy truck uh and then you can take the range if you if you want for long range trucking uh up to with we think uh easily 800 kilometers and we see a path over time to get to a thousand kilometer range uh with a heavy-duty truck this is like a truck on the order of 40 metric ton uh total mass uh and uh we think this is gonna be extremely competitive and compelling to uh the trucking companies um and we actually have a few prototype semi trucks that are in operation have been in operation for over a year um so you know some keys to that are having like said a high um an energy density cell and then integrating that cell into the pack uh with a minimum of extra of extra mass and then uh using us having a structural battery pack where the cells and the battery pack actually form part of the core structure and this is also something that we talked about at battery day and that we will be of course implementing with the semi truck and the net result is uh you're able to carry uh the basically the same cargo as a regular diesel truck like this we think maybe there's a um a one ton penalty maybe but at this point we think possibly you can even have less than a one ton uh payload reduction but and it could long term i think be zero colored reduction for four electric trucks so sort of a you know in terms of like put your numbers on this that are specific uh you know something like um uh around uh 300 um uh 300 watt hours per kilogram something like that uh at the cell level uh is enough to to get to these with the high ranges that i talked about sort of the 800 kilometer range very interesting thank you so one last question pertaining uh to something uh that you have uh said uh publicly that both gigafactory berlin and gigafactory shanghai will be making original vehicles can you just say a few words uh about that give us a little more detail sure um yes absolutely so um you know i think there's there's just a lot of talent um talented designers uh engineers in europe of course and uh it would i think for a lot of the best people they really want to work somewhere where they're doing original design work um they don't want to just be you know doing say the european version of something that was designed in california so i think it's important for in order to attract the best talent um to to do original design um and i think uh you know possibly uh in europe it would make sense to do um i guess a compact car so perhaps a hatchback or something like that and um so it's something that like well what do most people want um and in a given region um or where's a very popular approach to take um you know in the u.s the classes tend to be bigger for personal taste reasons and in europe the chance to be smaller um and i mean if you're trying if you're trying to park in a dense urban environment having a car that is um that actually fits puts in a parking space easily is important um i was driving a model x around berlin and we had quite a bit of trouble finding a parking space that we could fix so um i think but you know that would probably be a good candidate for original design um but i'm sure there'll be others as well but that that might be the wise place to start um and it helps us also say okay we need a car that people can afford uh that fits their lifestyle and everything and so probably something like that would make sense um yeah i'm excited about doing some original design in europe and many people here excited as well so we will be following with great curiosity and interest the further developments elon musk thank you so much for joining us when i when i calculated the time in california and uh you know figured out what hour you must have gotten up at i thought uh you know has he actually succeeded in bending time or uh is it really two in the morning so we really appreciate uh your sharing your insights with us and now i wish you a very good night and much success in future uh thank you guys good to talk to everyone thank you thanks bye-bye
