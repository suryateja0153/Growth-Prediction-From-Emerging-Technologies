 zinc is a chemical element with symbol Zn and atomic number 30 it is the first element in group 12 of the periodic table in some respects zinc is chemically similar to magnesium both elements exhibit only one normal oxidation state plus 2 and the Zn 2 plus and mg 2 plus ions are of similar size zinc is the 24th most abundant element in Earth's crust and has 5 stable isotopes the most common zinc Oris sphalerite zinc blende a zinc sulfide mineral the largest workable loads are in Australia Asia and the United States zinc is refined by froth flotation of the or roasting and final extraction using electricity electrowinning brass an alloy of copper and zinc in various proportions was used as early as the 3rd millennium BC in the Aegean Iraq the United Arab Emirates comitia Turkmenistan and Georgia and the 2nd millennium BC in West India whose Becca Stan Iran Syria Iraq and Israel judea zinc metal was not produced on a large scale until the 12th century in India though it was known to the ancient Romans and Greeks the mines of Rajasthan have given definite evidence of zinc production going back to the 6th century BC to date the oldest evidence of pure zinc comes from Zawar in Rajasthan as early as the 9th century AD when a distillation process was employed to make pure zinc alchemists burned zinc and air to form what they called Philosopher's wool or white snow the element was probably named by The Alchemist Paracelsus after the German word Zinke prong toothed German chemist andreas Sigismund Margraff is credited with discovering pure metallic zinc in 1746 work by Luigi Galvani and Alessandro Volta uncovered the electrochemical properties of zinc by 1800 corrosion-resistant zinc plating of iron hot dip galvanizing is the major application for zinc other applications

prenatal and postnatal development zinc deficiency affects about two billion people in the developing world and as associated with many diseases in children deficiency causes growth retardation delayed sexual maturation infection susceptibility and diarrhea enzymes with a zinc atom in the reactive Center are widespread in biochemistry such as alcohol dehydrogenase in humans consumption of excess zinc can cause a taxi a' lethargy and copper deficiency topic characteristics topic physical properties Zink is a bluish-white lustrous diamagnetic metal though most common commercial grades of the metal have a dull finish it is somewhat less dense than iron and has a hexagonal crystal structure with a distorted form of hexagonal close packing in which each atom has six nearest neighbors at 265 point nine pm in its own plane and six others at a greater distance of 290 point six pm the metal as hard and brittle at most temperatures but becomes malleable between 100 and 150 degrees Celsius above 210 degrees Celsius the metal becomes brittle again and can be pulverized by beating zinc is a fair conductor of electricity for a metal zinc has relatively low melting 419 point 5 degrees Celsius and boiling points 907 degrees Celsius the melting point is the lowest of all the d-block metals aside from mercury and cadmium for this among other reasons zinc cadmium and Mercury are often not considered to be transition metals like the rest of the d-block metals are many alloys contain zinc including brass other metals long known to form binary alloys with zinc are aluminium antimony bismuth gold iron lead mercury silver tin magnesium cobalt nickel tellurium and sodium although neither zinc nor zirconium are ferromagnetic their alloys zrz n 2 exhibits ferromagnetism below 35 K a

contains zinc in five to seven hundred seventy ppm with an average 64 ppm seawater has only 30 ppb and the atmosphere 0.1 to 4 micrograms per cubic meter the element as normally found in association with other base metals such as copper and lead in ores zinc is a Chalco file meaning the element as more likely to be found in minerals together with sulfur and other heavy calso Gian's rather than with the light shell Sojin excision or with non chalcogenide Avella meant such as the halogens sulfides formed as the crust solidified under the reducing conditions of the early Earth's atmosphere sphalerite which is a form of zinc sulfide is the most heavily mined zinc containing or because it's concentrate contains 60 to 62 percent zinc other source minerals for zinc include Smith's a night zinc carbonate Hema more fight zinc silicate wurtzite another zinc sulfide and sometimes hydrazine Kight basic zinc carbonate with the exception of word cite all these other minerals were formed by weathering of the primordial zinc sulfide identified world zinc resources total about 1.9 to 2.8 billion tonnes large deposits are in Australia Canada and the United States with the largest reserves in Iran the most recent estimate of reserve base for zinc meets specified minimum physical criteria related to current mining and production practices was made in 2009 and calculated to be roughly 480 mount zinc reserves on the other hand are geologically identified or bodies whose suitability for recovery as economically based location quality and quantity at the time of determination since exploration and mine development as an ongoing process the amount of zinc reserves as not a fixed number and sustainability of zinc ore supplies cannot be judged by simply extrapolating the combined mine life of today's zinc mines this concept as well supported by data from the United States Geological Survey USGS which illustrates that although refined zinc production increased eighty percent between 1990 and 2010 the reserve lifetime for zinc has remained unchanged about 346 million tonnes have been extracted throughout history to 2002 and scholars have estimated that about 109 to 305 million tons are in use topic isotopes five isotopes of zinc occur in nature sixty-four Zn as the most abundant isotope 48.63 percent natural abundance that isotope has such a long half-life at four

104 s2 and as a member of the group 12 of the periodic table it is a moderately reactive metal and strong reducing agent the surface of the pure metal tarnishes quickly eventually forming a protective passivating layer of the basic zinc carbonate zinc hydroxide Co 3 2 by reaction with atmospheric carbon dioxide this layer helps prevent further reaction with air and water Zink burns in air with a bright bluish green flame giving off fumes of zinc oxide zinc reacts readily with acids alkalis and other nonmetals extremely pure zinc reacts only slowly at room temperature with acids strong acids such as hydrochloric or sulfuric acid can remove the passivating layer and subsequent reaction with water releases hydrogen gas the chemistry of zinc is dominated by the +2 oxidation state when compounds in this oxidation state are formed the outer shell s electrons are lost yielding a bare zinc ion with the electronic configuration are 3d10 in aqueous solution and octahedral complex ZN h 2 o 6 2 + as the predominant species the volatilization of zinc in combination with zinc chloride at temperatures above 285 degrees celsius indicates the formation of zinc chloride a zinc compound with a plus 1 oxidation state no compounds of zinc and oxidation states other than plus 1 or plus 2 are known calculations indicate that a zinc compound with the oxidation state of plus 4 as unlikely to exist zinc chemistry is similar to the chemistry of the late 1st row transition metals nickel and copper though it has a filled D shell and compounds are diamagnetic and mostly colorless the ionic radii of zinc and magnesium happen to be nearly identical because of this some of the equivalent salts have the same crystal structure and in other circumstances where ionic radius as a determining factor the chemistry of zinc has much in common with that of magnesium in other respects there is little similarity with the late first row transition metals zinc tends to form bonds with a greater degree of covalency and much more stable complexes with NNs donor's complexes of zinc are mostly four or six coordinate although five coordinate complexes are known topic zinc I compounds Zink I compounds are rare and need bulky ligands to stabilize the low oxidation state most zinc compounds contain formerly the Zn 2 2 plus core which is analogous to the hg 2 2 plus dimeric cation present in mercury I compounds the diamagnetic nature of the ion confirms its dimeric structure the first zinc I compound containing the ZN ZN bond 8 of 5 c5 me v 2z + 2 is also the first dye metallocene the Zn

onto the dry paper and heated a green disc indicates the presence of zinc topic history topic ancient use various isolated examples of the use of impure zinc in ancient times have been discovered zinc ores were used to make the zinc copper alloy brass thousands of years prior to the discovery of zinc as a separate element Judean brass from the 14th to 10th centuries BC contains 23 percent zinc knowledge of how to produce brass spread to ancient Greece by the seventh century BC but few varieties were made ornaments made of alloys containing 80 to 90 percent zinc with lead iron antimony and other metals making up the remainder have been found that our 2500 years old a possibly prehistoric statuette containing 80 7.5 percent zinc was found in a Dacian archaeological site the oldest known pills were made of the zinc carbonates hydro zinc it--and Smith's a knight the pills were used for sore eyes and were found aboard the Roman ship real ito del pizanno wrecked in 140 BC the manufacture of brass was known to the Romans by about 30 BC they made brass by heating powdered calamine zinc silicate or carbonate charcoal and copper together in a crucible the resulting calamine brass was then either cast or hammered into shape for use in weaponry some coins struck by Romans in the Christian era are made of what is probably calamine brass Strabo writing in the first century BC but quoting a now lost work of the 4th century BC historian Theo Pampas mentions drops of false silver which when mixed with copper make brass this may refer to small quantities of zinc that as a by-product of smelting sulfide ores zinc in such remnants in smelting ovens was usually discarded as it was thought to be worthless the burn zinc tablet as a votive plaque dating to roman gaul made of an alloy that is mostly zinc the Scirocco Sumida thought to have written between 300 and 500 AD mentions a metal which when oxidized produces push benjin thought to be zinc oxide zinc mines at Zawar Nehru died poor in India have been active since the Mauryan period see 322 and 187 BCE the smelting of metallic zinc here however appears to have begun around the 12th century AD one estimate is that this location produced an estimated million tons of metallic zinc and zinc oxide from the 12th to 16th centuries another estimate gives a total production of 60,000 tons of metallic zinc over this period the rasa Ratna Sam aquella written in approximately the 13th century AD mentions two types of zinc containing ores one used for metal extraction and another used for medicinal purposes topic early studies and naming Zink was distinctly recognized as a metal under the designation of yo sada RG sada in the medical lexicon ascribed to the hindu king medina paula of taka dynasty and written about the year 1374 smelting and extraction of impure zinc by reducing calamine with wool and other organic substances was accomplished in the 13th century in India the Chinese did not learn of the technique until the 17th century alchemists burned zinc metal in air and collected the resulting zinc oxide on a condenser some alchemists called this zinc oxide lana philosophica latin for philosophers wool because it collected in wooly Tufts whereas others thought it looked like white snow and named it nix album the name of the metal was probably first documented by Paracelsus a Swiss born German alchemist who referred to the metal as zinc 'm or zinc in' in his book library mineral 'i'm - in the 16th century the word is probably derived from the germans Enki and supposedly meant tooth like pointed or jagged metallic zinc crystals have a needle-like appearance zinc could also imply tin like because of its relation to Germans in meaning tin yet another possibility is that the word is derived from the Persian word Assange saying meaning stone the metal was also called Indian tin - Danai go calamine and spin tur german metallurgist andreas lab atheist received a quantity of what he called Callay of malabar from a cargo ship captured from the portuguese in 1596 Libanius described the properties of the sample which may have been zinc zinc was regularly imported to Europe from the Orient in the 17th and early 18th centuries but was at times very expensive topic isolation metallic zinc was isolated in India by 1300 ad much earlier than in the West before it was isolated in Europe it was imported from India in about 1600 CE pasal weights Universal dictionary a contemporary source giving technological information in Europe did not mention zinc before 1751 but the element was studied before then Flemish metallurgist and alchemist PMDD arrests were reported that he had extracted metallic zinc from zinc oxide in 1668 by the start of the 18th century Etienne Francois gia Freud described how zinc oxide condenses as yellow crystals on bars of iron placed above zinc ore that is being smelted in Britain John Lane is said to have carried out experiments to smelt zinc probably at land or prior to his bankruptcy in 1726 in 1738 in Great Britain William champion patented a process to extract zinc from calamine in a vertical retort style smelter his technique resembled that used at Zama zinc mines in Rajasthan but no evidence suggests he visited the Orient champions process was used through 1851 German chemist andreas Margraff normally gets credit for discovering pure metallic zinc even though Swedish chemist anton von swab had distilled zinc from calamine four years previously in his 1746 experiment Margraff heated a mixture of calamine and charcoal in a closed vessel without copper to obtain a metal this procedure became commercially practical by 1750 to topic later work William champions brother John patented a process in 1758 for calcining zinc sulfide into an oxide usable in the retort process prior to this only calamine could be used to produce zinc in 1798 johann christian ruber improved on the smelting process by building the first horizontal retorts smelter jean-jacques Daniel Dhoni built a different kind of horizontal zinc smelter in Belgium that processed even more zinc Italian doctor Luigi Galvani discovered in 1780 that connecting the spinal cord of a freshly dissected frog to an iron rail attached by a brass hook caused the frog's leg to twitch he incorrectly thought he had discovered an ability of nerves and muscles to create electricity and called the effect animal electricity the galvanic cell and the process of galvanization were both named for Luigi Galvani and his discoveries paved the way for Electrical batteries galvanization and cathodic protection Galvani's friend Alessandro Volta continued researching the effect and invented the voltaic pile in 1800 the basic unit of Volta Spile was a simplified galvanic cell made of plates of copper and zinc separated by an electrolyte and connected by a conductor externally the units were stacked in series to make the voltaic cell which produced electricity by directing electrons from the zinc to the copper and allowing the zinc to corrode the non-magnetic character of zinc and its lack of color in solution delayed discovery of its importance to biochemistry and nutrition this changed in 1940 when carbonic anhydrase an enzyme that scrubs carbon dioxide from blood was shown to have zinc in its active site the digestive enzyme carboxypeptidase became the second known zinc containing enzyme in 1955 topic production topic mining and processing Zink is the fourth most common metal in use trailing only iron aluminium and copper with an annual production of about 13 million tons the world's largest zinc producer as near star a merger of the Australian Oz minerals and the Belgian Yuma core about 70% of the world's zinc originates from mining while the remaining 30 percent comes from recycling secondary zinc commercially pure zinc is known as special high-grade often abbreviated shg and as 99.995% pure worldwide 95% of new zinc is mined from sulphide Accord apposite in which sphalerite ZN s is nearly always mixed with the sulfides of copper lead and iron zinc mines are scattered throughout the world with the main areas being China Australia and Peru China produced 38 percent of the global zinc output in 2014 zinc metal as produced using extractive metallurgy the Ora's finely ground then put through froth flotation to separate minerals from gang on the property of hydrophobicity to get a zinc sulphide ore concentrate consisting of about 50 percent zinc 32 percent sulfur 13 percent iron and 5 percent silicon oxide roasting converts the zinc sulphide concentrate to zinc oxide to Zn S Plus 302 to Zn o plus to so2 the sulfur dioxide is used for the production of sulfuric acid which is necessary for the leaching process if deposits of zinc carbonate zinc silicate or zinc spinel like the scorpion deposit in Namibia are used for zinc production the roasting can be omitted for further processing two basic methods are used pyro metallurgy or electrowinning pyro metallurgy reduces zinc oxide with carbon or carbon monoxide at 950 to Celsius 1740 degrees Fahrenheit into the metal which is distilled as zinc vapor to separate it from other metals which are not volatile at those temperatures the zinc vapor is collected in a condenser the equations below describe this process - Zn o + c 2z + + co2 Zn o + coz n + co2 in electrowinning zinc is leached from the ore concentrate by sulfuric acid Zn o + h2 so4 zinc sulfate + h2o finally the zinc is reduced by electrolysis to zinc sulfate + 2 h2o 2 z + + 2 h2 so4 + o2 the sulfuric acid as regenerated and recycled to the leaching step when galvanized feedstock is fed to an electric arc furnace the zinc is recovered from the dust by a number of processes predominantly the wells process 90% as of 2014 topic environmental impact refinement of sulfide extinct ores produces large volumes of sulfur dioxide and cadmium vapor smelters slag and other residues contain significant quantities of metals about 1.1 million tonnes of metallic zinc and 130,000 tons of lead were mined and smelted in the belgian towns of leh calamine and plum beers between 1806 and 1882 the dumps of the passed mining operations leach zinc and cadmium and the sediments of the ji EUL River contain non trivial amounts of metals about 2000 years ago emissions of zinc from mining and smelting totalled 10,000 tons a year after increasing tenfold from 1850 zinc emissions peaked at 3.4 million tons per year in the 1980s and declined to 2.7 million tons in the 1990s although a 2005 study of the Arctic troposphere found that the concentrations there did not reflect the decline anthropogenic and natural emissions occur at a ratio of 20 to 1 zinc in rivers flowing through industrial and mining areas can be as high as 20 ppm effective sewage treatment greatly reduces this treatment along the Rhine for example has decreased zinc levels to 50 ppb concentrations of zinc as low as 2 ppm adversely effects the amount of oxygen that fish can carry in their blood soils contaminated with zinc from mining refining or fertilizing with zinc bearing sludge can contain several grams of zinc per kilogram of dry soil levels of zinc in excess of 500 ppm in soil interfere with the ability of plants to absorb other essential metals such as iron and manganese zinc levels of 2,000 ppm to 180,000 ppm 18% have been recorded in some soil samples topic applications major applications of zinc include numbers are given for the u.s. galvanizing 55 percent brass and bronze 16 percent other alloys 21 percent miscellaneous 8 percent topic anti-corrosion and batteries Zink is most commonly used as an anti-corrosion agent and galvanization coating of iron or steel is the most familiar form in 2009 in the United States fifty-five percent or eight hundred ninety three thousand tons of the zinc metal was used for galvanization zinc is more reactive than iron or steel and thus will attract almost all local oxidation until it completely corrodes away a protective surface layer of oxide and carbonate zinc hydroxide co3 to forms as the zinc corrodes this protection lasts even after the zinc layer is scratched but degrades through time as the zinc corrodes away the zinc is applied electrochemically or as molten zinc by hot dip galvanizing or spraying galvanization is used on chain-link fencing guard rails suspension bridges light posts metal roofs heat exchangers and car bodies the relative reactivity of zinc and its ability to attract oxidation to itself makes it an efficient sacrificial anode in cathodic protection CP for example cathodic protection of a buried pipeline can be achieved by connecting anodes made from zinc to the pipe zinc acts as the anode negative terminus by slowly corroding away as it passes electric current to the steel pipeline zinc is also used to cathodically protect metals that are exposed to seawater a zinc disc attached to a ship's iron rudder will slowly corrode while the rudder stays intact similarly a zinc plug attached to a propeller or the metal protective guard for the keel of the ship provides temporary protection with a standard electrode potential sep of minus 0.76 volts zinc is used as an anode material for batteries more reactive lithium sep minus 3.0 4 volts is used for anodes in lithium battery powdered zinc is used in this way in alkaline batteries and the case which also serves as the anode of zinc carbon batteries as formed from sheet zinc zinc is used as the anode or fuel of the zinc air battery fuel cell the zinc cerium redox flow battery also relies on a zinc based negative half cell topic alloys a widely used zinc alloy as brass in which copper is alloyed with anywhere from three percent to 45 percent zinc depending upon the type of brass brass is generally more ductile and stronger than copper and has superior corrosion resistance these properties make it useful in communication equipment hardware musical instruments and water valves other widely used zinc alloys include nickel silver typewriter metal soft and aluminium solder and commercial bronze zinc is also used in contemporary pipe organs as a substitute for the traditional lead tin alloy in pipes alloys of 85 to 88 percent zinc four to ten percent copper and two to eight percent aluminium find limited use in

1994 thirty-three thousand two hundred tons thirty six thousand six hundred short tons of zinc were used to produce thirteen point six billion pennies in the United States alloys of zinc with small amounts of copper aluminium and magnesium are useful in die casting as well as spin casting especially in the automotive electrical and hardware industries these alloys are marketed under the name zamak an example of this as zinc aluminium the low melting point together with the low viscosity of the alloy makes possible the production of small and intricate shapes the low working temperature leads to rapid cooling of the cast products and fast production for assembly another alloy marketed under the brand name Prestel contains 78 percent zinc and 22 percent aluminium and is reported to be nearly as strong as steel but as malleable as plastic this super plasticity of the alloy allows it to be molded using die casts made of ceramics and cement similar alloys with the addition of a small amount of lead can be cold rolled into sheets an alloy of 96 percent zinc and 4% aluminium as used to make stamping dies for low production run applications for which ferrous metal dyes would be too expensive for building facades roofing and other applications for sheet metal formed by deep drawing roll forming or bending zinc alloys with titanium and copper are used unalloyed zinc is too brittle for these manufacturing processes as a dense inexpensive easily worked material zinc is used as a lead replacement in the wake of lead concerns zinc appears in waits for various applications ranging from fishing to tire balances and flywheels cadmium zinc telluride cz T is a semi conductive alloy that can be divided into an array of small sensing devices these devices are similar to an integrated

sulfur powder as ignited there is a violent chemical reaction this produces zinc sulfide together with large amounts of hot gas heat and light zinc sheet metal is used to make zinc bars 0.64 Zn the most abundant isotope of zinc is very susceptible to neutron activation being transmuted into the highly radioactive 65 Zn which has a half-life of 244 days and produces intense gamma radiation because of this zinc oxide used in nuclear reactors as an anti-corrosion agent as depleted of 64 ZN before use this is called depleted zinc oxide for the same reason zinc has been proposed as a salting material for nuclear weapons cobalt as another better known salting material a jacket of isotopically enriched 64 ZN would be irradiated by the intense high-energy neutron flux from an exploding thermonuclear weapon forming a large amount of 65 ZN significantly increasing the radioactivity of the weapons fallout such a weapon as not known to have ever been built tested or used point

deficiency has been associated with major depressive disorder MDD and zinc supplements may be an effective treatment zinc serves as a simple inexpensive and critical tool for treating diarrhea episodes among children in the developing world zinc becomes depleted in the body during diarrhea but recent studies suggest that replenishing zinc with a 10 to 14 day course of treatment can reduce

orally consuming a zinc dietary supplement could have the same effect zinc is a negative allosteric modulator of the GA baa receptor topic common cold zinc supplements frequently zinc acetate or zinc gluconate lozenges are a group of dietary supplements that are commonly used for the treatment of the common cold the use of zinc supplements at doses in excess of 75 milligrams per day within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms has been shown to reduce the duration of cold symptoms by about 1 day due to a lack of data there is insufficient evidence to determine whether the preventative use of zinc supplements reduces the likelihood of contracting a cold adverse effects with zinc supplements by mouth include bad taste and nausea the intranasal use of zinc containing nasal sprays has been associated with the loss of the sense of smell consequently in June 2009 the United States Food and Drug Administration US FDA warned consumers to stop using intranasal zinc products the human Rhino

an alpha ketoglutarate dehydrogenase the dysregulation of calcium homeostasis glutamatergic neuronal excitatory an interference with intra normal signal transduction lnd histidine facilitate brain zinc uptake SLC 3o a 3 as the primary zinc transporter involved in cerebral zinc homeostasis topic enzymes Zink is an efficient lewis acid making it a useful catalytic agent in hydroxylation and other enzymatic reactions the metal also has a flexible coordination geometry which allows proteins using it to rapidly shift confirmations to perform biological reactions two examples of zinc containing enzymes are carbonic anhydrase and carboxypeptidase which are vital to the processes of carbon dioxide co2 regulation and digestion of proteins respectively in vertebrate blood carbonic anhydrase converts co2 into bicarbonate and the same enzyme transforms the bicarbonate back into co2 for exhalation through the lungs without this enzyme this conversion would occur about 1 million times slower at the normal blood pH of 7 or would require a pH of 10 or more the non-related beta carbonic anhydrase has required in plants for leaf formation the synthesis of indole acetic acid oxen and alcoholic fermentation carboxypeptidase cleaves peptide linkages during digestion of proteins a coordinate covalent bond has formed between the terminal peptide and a c equals o group attached to zinc which gives the carbon a positive charge this helps to create a hydrophobic pocket on the enzyme near the zinc which attracts the nonpolar part of the protein being digested topic signaling Zink has been recognized as a messenger able to activate signaling pathways many of these pathways provide the driving force in aberrant cancer growth they can be targeted through zip transporters topic other proteins Zink serves a purely structural role in zinc fingers twists and clusters zinc fingers form parts of some transcription factors which are proteins that recognize DNA base sequences during the replication and transcription of DNA each of the nine or ten Z and two plus ions in a zinc finger helps maintain the fingers structure by coordinate ly binding to four amino acids in the transcription factor the transcription factor wraps around the DNA helix and uses its fingers to accurately bind to the DNA sequence in blood plasma zinc is bound to and transported by albumin 60% low affinity and transferrin 10% because transfer and also transports iron excessive iron reduces zinc absorption and vice versa a similar antagonism exists with copper the concentration of zinc in blood plasma stays relatively constant regardless of zinc intake cells in the salivary gland prostate immune system and intestine use zinc signaling to communicate with other cells zinc may be held in metallothionein reserves within microorganisms or in the intestines or liver of animals metallothionein in intestinal cells as capable of adjusting absorption of zinc by 15 to 40 percent however inadequate or excessive zinc intake can be harmful excess zinc particularly impairs copper absorption because metallothionein absorbs both metals the human dopamine transporter contains a high affinity extracellular zinc binding site which upon zinc binding inhibits dopamine reuptake and amplifies amphetamine induced dopamine efflux in vitro the human serotonin transporter and norepinephrine transporter do not contain zinc binding sites topic dietary recommendations the u.s. Institute of Medicine IOM updated estimated average requirements years and recommended dietary allowances rdas for zinc in 2001 the current ears for zinc for women and men ages 14 and up as six point eight and nine point four milligrams per day respectively the RDAs are eight and eleven milligrams per day our das are higher than years so as to identify amounts that will cover people with higher than average requirements RDA for pregnancy as 11 milligrams per day RDA for lactation as 12 milligrams per day for infants up to 12 months the RDA as 3 milligrams per day for children ages 1 to 13 years the RDA increases with age from 3 to 8 milligrams per day as for safety the IOM sets tolerable upper intake levels you ELLs for vitamins and minerals when evidence as sufficient in the case of zinc the adult has 40 milligrams per day lower for children collectively the years are das a eyes and you ELLs are referred to as Dietary Reference Intakes dris the European Food Safety Authority EFSA refers to the collective set of information as Dietary Reference values with population Reference intake pri instead of RDA an average requirement instead of year AI and all are defined the same as in United States for people ages 18 and older the PRI calculations are complex as the EFSA has set higher and higher values as the phytate content of the diet increases for women pre increase from seven point five to twelve point seven milligrams per day as phytate intake increases from 300 to 1200 milligrams per day for men the range as nine four to sixteen point three milligrams per day these pre are higher than the u.s. RDAs the EFSA reviewed the same safety question and said it's all at twenty five milligrams per day which is much lower than the US value for us food and dietary supplement labeling purposes the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of daily value percent DV for zinc labeling purposes 100 percent of the daily value was 15 milligrams but as of May 27 2016 it has been revised to 11 milligrams a table of the old and new adult daily values as provided at reference daily intake food and supplement companies have until January 1st 2020 to comply with the change topic dietary intake animal products such as meat fish shellfish fowl eggs and dairy contains zinc the concentration of zinc in plants varies with the level in the soil with adequate zinc in the soil the food plants that contain the most zinc our wheat German bran and various seeds including sesame poppy alfalfa celery and mustard zinc is also found in beans nuts almonds whole grains pumpkin seeds sunflower seeds and blackcurrant plant phytates are particularly found in pulses and cereals and interfere with zinc absorption other sources include fortified food and dietary supplements in various forms a 1998 review concluded that zinc oxide one of the most common supplements in the United States and zinc carbonate are nearly insoluble and poorly absorbed in the body this review cited studies that found lower plasma zinc concentrations in the subjects who consumed zinc oxide and zinc carbonate than in those who took zinc acetate and sulfate salts for fortification however a 2003 review recommended cereals containing zinc oxide as a cheap stable source that is as easily absorbed as the more expensive forms a 2005 study found that various compounds of zinc including oxide and sulfate did not show statistically significant differences in absorption when added as for tiff against two maize tortillas topic deficiency zinc deficiency as usually due to insufficient dietary intake but can be associated with malabsorption accra dermatitis enteropathy qey chronic liver disease chronic renal disease sickle cell disease diabetes malignancy and other chronic illnesses groups at risk of zinc deficiency include the elderly children in developing countries and those with renal dysfunction in the United States a federal survey of food consumption determined that for women and men over the age of 19 average consumption was nine point seven and fourteen point two milligrams per day respectively for women seventeen percent consumed less than the year for men 11 percent the percentages below ear increased with age the most recent published update of the survey in Haynes 2013-2014 reported lower averages nine point three and thirteen point two milligrams per day again with intake decreasing with age symptoms of mild zinc deficiency are diverse clinical outcomes include depressed growth diarrhea impotence and delayed sexual maturation alopecia eye and skin lesions impaired appetite altered cognition impaired host defense properties defects in carbohydrate utilization and reproductive Terada genesis mild zinc deficiency depresses immunity although excessive zinc does also animals with a zinc deficiency require twice as much food to attain the same weight gain as animals with sufficiency despite some concerns Western vegetarians and vegans do not suffer any more from overt zinc deficiency than meat-eaters major plant sources of zinc include cooked dried beans sea vegetables fortified cereals soy foods nuts peas and sieves however phytates in many whole grains and fibers may interfere with zinc absorption and marginal zinc intake has poorly understood effects the zinc chelator phytate found in seeds and cereal bran can contribute to zinc malabsorption some evidence suggests that more than the u.s. RDA 15 milligrams of zinc daily may be needed in those whose diet as high in phytates such as some vegetarians these considerations must be balanced against the paucity of adequate zinc biomarkers and the most widely used indicator plasma zinc has poor sensitivity and specificity diagnosing zinc deficiency as a persistent challenge nearly 2 billion people in the developing world are deficient in zinc in children it causes an increase in infection and diarrhea and contributes to the death of about 800,000 children worldwide per year the World Health Organization advocates zinc supplementation for severe malnutrition and diarrhea zinc supplements help prevent disease and reduce mortality especially among children with low birth weight or stunted growth however zinc supplements should not be administered alone because many in the developing world have several deficiencies and zinc interacts with other micronutrients topic soil remediation species of calluna Erica and vaccinium can grow in zinc metal if forest soils because translocation of toxic ions as prevented by the action of Eric oeid mycorrhizal fungi topic agriculture zinc deficiency appears to be the most common micronutrient deficiency in crop plants it is particularly common in high pH soils zinc deficient sow has cultivated in the cropland of about half of Turkey and India a third of China and most of Western Australia substantial responses to zinc fertilization have been reported in these areas plants that grow in soils that are zinc deficient are more susceptible to disease zinc is added to the soil primarily through the weathering of rocks but humans have added zinc through fossil fuel combustion mine wastes phosphate fertilizers pesticide zinc phosphide limestone manure sewage sludge and particles from galvanized surfaces excess zinc is toxic to plants although zinc toxicity as far less widespread topic precautions topic toxicity although zinc is an essential requirement for good health excess zinc can be harmful excessive absorption of zinc suppresses copper and iron absorption the free zinc ion in solution is highly toxic to plants invertebrates and even vertebrate fish the free ion activity model has well established in the literature and shows that just micro molar amounts of the free ion kills some organisms a recent example showed 6 micro molar killing 93% of all Daphnia in water the free zinc ion as a powerful Lewis acid up to the point of being corrosive stomach acid contains hydrochloric acid in which metallic zinc dissolves readily to give corrosive zinc chloride swallowing a post one nine eight two American one cent piece 97.5 percent zinc can cause damage to the stomach lining through the high solubility of the zinc ion in the acidic stomach evidence shows that people taking 100 to 300 milligrams of zinc daily may suffer induced copper deficiency a 2007 trial observed that elderly men taking 80 milligrams daily were hospitalized for urinary complications more often than those taking a placebo levels of 100 to 300 milligrams may interfere with the utilization of copper and iron ore adversely affect cholesterol zinc in excess of 500 ppm in soil interferes with the plant absorption of other essential metals such as iron and manganese a condition called the zinc shakes or zinc chills can be induced by inhalation of zinc fumes while brazing or welding galvanized materials zinc is a common ingredient of denture cream which may contain between 17 and 38 milligrams of zinc per gram disability and even deaths from excessive use of these product have been claimed the US Food and Drug Administration FDA states that zinc damages nerve receptors in the nose causing anosmia reports of anosmia were also observed in the 1930s when zinc preparations were used in a failed attempt to prevent polio infections On June 16 2009 the FDA ordered removal of zinc based intranasal cold products from store shelves the FDA said the loss of smell can be life-threatening because people with impaired smell cannot detect leaking gas or smoke and cannot tell if food has spoiled before they eat it recent research suggests that the topical antimicrobial zinc pyrithione as a potent heat shock response inducer that may impair genomic integrity with induction of PARP dependent energy crisis in cultured human keratinocytes and melanocytes topic poisoning in 1982 the US Mint began minting pennies coated in copper but containing primarily zinc zinc pennies pose a risk of zinc toxicosis which can be fatal one reported case of chronic ingestion of 425 pennies over one kilogram of zinc resulted in death due to gastrointestinal bacterial and fungal sepsis another patient who ingested 12 grams of zinc showed only lethargy and ataxia gross lack of coordination of muscle movements several other cases have been reported of humans suffering zinc intoxication by the ingestion of zinc coins pennies and other small coins are sometimes ingested by dogs requiring veterinary removal of the foreign objects the zinc content of some coins can cause zinc toxicity commonly fatal in dogs through severe hemolytic anemia and liver or kidney damage vomiting and diarrhea are possible symptoms zinc is highly toxic in parrots and poisoning can often be fatal the consumption of fruit juices stored in galvanized cans has resulted in mass parrot poisonings with zinc topic
