 Good afternoon and welcome to the latest webinar presented by Advanced Thermal Solutions Inc. This month's webinar is on the thermal management of automotive battery packs and it is presented by Dr. Kaveh Azar, the CEO and founder of ATS and a world-renowned expert in the thermal management of electronics. Before I turn things over to Dr. Azar, I'd like to remind everybody that there will be time for questions at the end of the webinar so if you have any questions please type them into the section provided and we will get to as many as we can at the end. Also we will be continuing our monthly webinar series in November with a discussion of heat pipes and vapor chambers and their role in heat transfer. You can register at the same link that you used to sign up for this webinar which is qats.com/training/webinar With that I will now turn things over to Dr. Azar Kaveh Azar: Thank You Josh and greetings from ATS to all attendees thank you for your participation in this webinar. Let me talk about the electric vehicle battery thermal management review of options and technologies around the market. So the presentation is going to be at the understanding the lithium-ion battery working principles and how it compares to the acid lead batteries and the type of batteries that are deployed in the automotive industry and then we focus on the battery thermal management from air and liquid refrigeration PCM and vapor chamber and I will try to bring it together at the very end with all the stuff that we see. As you're going to see this presentation is benefited from the excellent work that's been done by many many many researchers across the globe from Asia to North America and I have benefited from the work that they have done I've tried to put it together here for you to see what is happening and what's state of the art as far as the battery thermal management is concerned. So starting with understanding the working principles of the of the battery. When we work with a lead acid battery it's a device consisting of 2 or more electrochemical cells that converts the stored chemical energy into electrical energy. That's an essential function of a battery whether it's a lithium-ion or lead acid battery. In the lead acid battery, current flows between the positive terminal the cathode and the negative terminal anode, isolated by a separator obviously the cathode is at a higher energy potential than the anode. When the battery is connected to external circuit electrolytes allows iron that's generated by the chemical reaction to move between the cathode and anode and as a result it would create the energy that's required. With the lithium ion battery working principle the lithium-ion cell stores energy by inter- collection of the charged lithium ion in a graphite node and then the cells are released energy transferring these ions through an organic process and creating the current that we require to do it. When you look at the performance of the two battery types you'll notice that the lithium-ion batteries are much more efficient in charge and discharge than the lead acid batteries and as a result of it has got a significantly larger acceptance in the deployment of the electric vehicles not only electric vehicles but a lot of the other battery requiring operations across the industry in order to function effectively. So it's a very attractive corner piece of the market as far as use and functionality is concerned with a very broad spectrum, obviously when we get to electric vehicles that demand on the power is significantly higher and the issues associated with managing this thermal as we're gonna see, becomes more prevalent and significant. So what are the battery types? Two broad spectrum or possibly three is cylindrical it's a jellyroll or a hard can or is wound or stacked layers or soft pouches as you can see examples of these that are shown in these applications you see an example of a soft pouch or the can that we see that's very commonly seen in the in the industry. When we look at the inner structure of it, irrespective of the packaging that we have whether it's cylinder prismatic or pouch the inner construction of these batteries are identical in order for them to function effectively as I showed you on the first slide we have a negative electrode we have the negative terminal lead we have the positive electrode and we have a separation or separator plate in order to make it function and as you can see these principles or these structure is coming across these battery types in packaging. So obviously these are packaged for different purposes so they have a application for as I mentioned a very broad spectrum from automotive all the way to laptops and so forth that we see they use a similar type of a battery or technology. When we look at the way the system is packaged in hybrid electronics and hybrid electric vehicles and so forth we see overall packaging that looks like like this and from the outside has got some connections and they're both for power and cooling depending upon the type of cooling that's used. If we sort of break it open you can see that there is a multi- layers that are composing the overall battery that's used across the industry. But I think something is very important to notice in this schematic that's shown on the right hand side is the thermal management is encompassing of the entire system and there is controller as you can see from one of the researchers what an important role the controller plays but you can see that the sort of hierarchy of packaging as we go into the system and there is a heat transfer and heat transport between different layers that has to be considered so in a given application like this not only we have to worry about the battery modules we also have to worry about the ancillary electronics that's going to be functioning properly in order for the batteries to operate so there is really two prong or two points of concentration as we go forward in the thermal management of our our system so we can't just focus on the battery there is ancillary electronics that's kind of supporting the battery and battery operation that we need to know. So when we look at the type and the way it's composed and put together, we have in this case is a can and the second case is a pouch or a plate it's put into a module from the module into a pack and eventually into the vehicle and we can see the example for the Tesla for instance the roadster that the way the battery is packed inside the rear compartment of the vehicle in order to provide the power that's required to go forward and likewise in the bottom when you see on the Nissan Leaf for instance they have used the cells and then they made a module the module goes into a larger module that makes it pack and eventually goes into a vehicle but again it's packaged differently. So you can see that the hierarchy of packaging is becoming more and more clear and those of us who've been involved in electronics cooling, traditional electronics cooling, where we concentrate on the component and in the component we focus on the junction, here our component is the battery and the junction is the core temperature inside the battery that we have to be minimizing and making sure that's a function here at the level that it's supposed to in order to have a fail-safe operation with our electric vehicle. And the technology is all over the place as very similar to what we see with the traditional electronics packaging it is very very much system related and the system in this case is a vehicle that we use as consumers and the designers in these companies they're putting the packages differently depending upon how the ultimate system is put together you can see examples of the Chevy Volt, Nissan Leaf, Fiat, Tesla, Focus and Nissan Mitsubishi, I'm sorry under i-MiEV. And you can see the packaging is totally different and how they utilize the system in order to put it together in order to provide the energy that's required for the vehicle to be functional. And the reality is the mobility industry, not necessarily automotive by itself, requires a full range of lithium-ion batteries it's not specific to one particular type it depends upon the application and the system it's being deployed. But I think it's awarded to pay attention to this to this chart as well that heat accumulation this cell is equal to the net heat entering or leaving the cell plus the heat generation and as you can see heat accumulation in the cell creates additional chemical reaction which is which is a problem. Heat from the chemical reaction accumulates in the cell and any kind of a heat accumulation or excess heat that cannot be removed effectively it could be a causative agent of failures, shortened life and catastrophic failure that we've seen some fires and so forth that's happening. So the thermal management it is it is very much system later and it's very very broad across the industry. So what about the challenges with a lithium-ion battery when we look at the issues with electric vehicle the lithium-ion batteries have the best performance as far as the battery class is concerned. But they are very temperamental and we have to be addressing that very accurately when we start to work with it. Key problems is dealing with heat generated by cell during charge, discharge and ambient conditions this is the area of the menace we have that we have to attend to as we go through the design in order to make sure that it is done properly in order to avoid catastrophic failure. If our cells get too hot, three high level problems occur - decreased battery life, decreased performance and risk of fire or explosion. We have seen examples of a fire happening with lithium-ion batteries a variety of applications we've seen it in the laptops we've seen it on the automotive we've seen it in the airplanes depending upon where they were used and whether the thermal management system worked effectively for them or not. So when we look at the thermal runaway situation in lithium-ion battery, a large did a very nice graphic here to to show what exactly happens when we look at the ion battery we have the anode layer we have the protective layer here we have the electrolytes and the separator and then the cathode layer. And the first thing when the heating starts this is area number one then the protective layer breaks down and electrolyte breaks down into a flammable gas or gases and then the separator starts melting possibly causing a short circuit and then cathode breaks down and generating oxygen so we have all the components for a catastrophic failure if we have this thermal runaway that it's not managed effectively in our system and the net result of it is here what this picture shows I believe this is from 3M, if my memories yes it is 3M, where they've shown a difference between an immersed battery pack into a liquid versus un-immersed and you can see where the fire occurs and in the 3M Novec fluid you can see that's a better containment of the thermal runaway and the issues could potentially happen with it. By the way, this is practical or not, it is a question that we're going to try to address as we go forward but nevertheless it shows that if we manage the thermal runaway during the charge discharge or possibly extreme ambient conditions we could have catastrophic failure and there are solutions to address that. So what are the, let's start at the thermal management. We know that lithium-ion batteries could potentially cause fire and sometimes explosions, but you know we have oxygen and oxygen is an explosive gas so how do we go about managing this from a thermal step and what are our options what are the people have done what what are the things that people have done in the industry in order to be able to address this? I think it would be helpful to just take a look at and see what are the different options and compare it against the internal combustion engine vehicles and see what the changes are as we go from internal combustion engine to electric vehicle to hybrid systems. You can see the cooling system I apologize if these pictures are not very large I try to put three of them into one sheet so we can have an ABC comparison and you can see that the overall structure with respect to the evaporator and the condenser and some sort of a heat exchanger here continues to be the same across different industries. Different, I'm sorry, vehicle design. And obviously as we go to the hybrid vehicle we can seen in addition to the battery, we have the engine in here to that we have to also worry about from the thermal standpoint, not only that but also from the thermal coupling that could potentially take place between the internal combustion engine and the battery compartment. So the problem with the hybrid could potentially be twofold depending upon the packaging that we have. Obviously when we go to the pure electric vehicle some people call it a plug electric vehicle you see this PEV or PHEV being used interchangeably they both reference so however we come to the conclusion. In this particular case there is no engine internal combustion engine and the vehicle is purely driven by the electric power that is has to be charged obviously from the electric source. When we look at this overall thermal management there are some conditions that we have to address it's a load profile, current rate, short-circuit and overvoltage. On the environmental side remember what we saw from the in the typical electronics packaging we always go from the environment to the junction temperature we never go from junction to the environment. We have to address the environment and in electric vehicles it's no different when it comes to the battery management we have a system that we have to address and we have to come all the way down to the core temperature of the battery. So the environment plays an important role, ambient condition, ambient and coolant temperature, contamination, altitude, climate. Remember these are also the issues that we deal with when we deal with traditional electronics cooling. And equally as important because of the fact there are  standards in any industry, automotive obviously is very known for it and it's no different so existing ecological laws and safety issues are huge you don't want to have a passenger car catching on fire and harming people, So when we go to that the levels that we saw how the system is packaged it is a cell pack in the system we see the issues that are associated with that is the chemistry geometry reactions and properties on the pack is a thermal interface which is huge and you're going to see examples of how the interface makes a difference when especially when we come to phase change material. Coolant medium, coolant flow, where there is liquid force natural convection what have we, this all happens at the pack level and then the system. System interfaces between the packs, optimization amongst packs and then realization of the intelligent algorithm. And you're gonna see in examples of this that because of the fact we're dealing with a chemically active system we cannot really walk away from the intelligent algorithm to make sure that the system is being monitored and controlled and the electronics associated with that and their thermal management is a huge point of concern that we have to address. So when we look at the lithium-ion battery this graph on the top clearly shows the superiority of the lithium-ion battery in comparison to the lead-acid and other types of batteries that are in there and depending upon the energy density that we have and the type of vehicle you can see that the power density changes quite a bit, that depends upon the usage. There are two other components that we have to pay attention to in addition to the power density requirements and so forth that is the safe operation of the battery. There is a point of as a function of temperature notice that these are all function of temperature as we are talking about it the battery power and temperature when the temperature ranges between about 20 to 40 degrees C we have a peak performance so if we can keep our batteries at the at that temperature range we have the best performance the best return on our investment as far as charging and discharging is concerned and equally as important is the expected life and there is a very very much of a temperature range where these devices function that I had a most optimum so we can get the longest life remember there are requirements that we have to meet in order to be able to have a product on the market that's kind of function effectively otherwise people have to go with the vehicle to the dealership and change the battery every every every two months so what is the overall map of the Year thermal management concerns that we have to address so when we look at this the temperature effects are the operating limits life cycle and this is the you're going to see this number modified by massage by different different researchers and the thermal runaway which is a huge huge problem and we would like to avoid as a result of the temperature thermal management and the sources of heat and sinks are electric heating they have the joules effect that that happens and we have to manage effectively thermal chemical heating and cooling that takes place and external thermal effects that always impacts the system as far as the environment is concerned whether you're driving in inside Arizona in July and not July 22nd or you're in Alaska in Juneau and driving in in in wintertime so the electric vehicle or hybrid large sized batteries high thermal capacity high heat dissipation requirements low temperature rise and again the low temperature rise is important for the functionality of the vehicle as well as the safety and the longevity of the battery under here hybrid vehicles is a small smaller size of the of the battery low temperature capacity low heat dissipation requirements and high temperature rise as a result of it again high temperature rise is so the temperature-controlled prevent from overheating heat dissipation at higher rates uniform heat distribution this is very important at you again those of you who've been involved in electronics cooling when you put the stack of PCBs right next to each other you see a temperature gradient across that and the batteries are no different the batteries are effectively for the for the sake of analogy or individual PCBs that we put right next to each other and we need to make sure that there's a very very strong temperature distribution uniformity across these otherwise we're gonna have neighbour heating taking place and as a result of with all kinds of thermal issues so self heating elements external heating a thermal insulation and so forth is required and also the heat recovery and some people are using the heat also as an energy source to possibly recreate if they can but that adds additional payload to the to the to the overall vehicle so as a result a thermal management is not a singular point that I can say okay I just I just managed a temperature of the of the EMI and battery I don't have to worry about anything else but no it's an integrated system we have to address all aspects that would not be aware of it as we go through the design and make sure that the system is designed properly as I mentioned there is industry standard that are that are communicated because of the fact they have a human interface we have a device that interfaces with human and/or occupies or people occupied this space one of these standards is a freedom car that is a target about you about 2020 and there are all kinds of expectations about it but some of the sort of highlights are fifty five kilowatt for 18 seconds which is a tremendous power surge that we have to manage and have continuous power of 30 kilowatt and imagine in an in a confined space this is a tremendous amount of power that we have to maintain manage or generate and equally as important the daunting task of 15 years of operation of a lifetime it is 150,000 miles this is not a trivial task those of us who are a little bit Alzheimer's we know or when we design for a long life it's a very very challenging process and you got to make sure that all the components that are used in that in that system are meeting the requirements that are associated with that not going to go through all these details but just to highlight what the freedom car thermal goal is dissipate 200 watts per square centimeter and just to get a sense of what that's what this means if you look at your sort of pinky finger and look at your name on your pinky finger that's effectively if you put 200 watt light bulbs the one on you on that on that area that's almost one square centimeter so you can imagine that the the thermal concentration or the heat density as I hate to call it is very very severe when it gets to that level and we need to be able to manage it effectively and coolant temperature of 105 degrees C for the maximum Junction temperature or device or battery temperature of 1 to 25 degrees C these are these are very very critical numbers that we have to meet with with a challenge that we have to make sure that it is it is delivered so what are my cooling options I'm dealing with a potentially significant problem is the challenging from the thermal coupling standpoint and the packaging is standpoint and when we look at the options of available in industry that has been either deployed or accepted or effectively in a broad sense or air liquid and refrigeration so when we look at the air cooling both cooling and heating is feasible good performance normally large space needed it's the cheapest certainly like any other electronics cooling lowered development efforts it is needed certainly for these applications liquid is the lowest temperature gradients and please take your pay attention to this column right here I will respected liquid on the refrigerator refrigerator when you look at the air you see a significantly larger temperature gradient but when we look at the liquid it's one to three degrees C now remember what I said a little bit earlier is the uniformity of temperature from pack to pack or from battery to battery is really really important so B we don't get the neighbor effect as severely as we've seen in other applications and refrigeration is a aggressive cooling due to very low cooler temperatures intelligent thermal management and a specific design needed to avoid a too aggressive cooling and condensation of humidity and irrespective of the type of system at the employed refrigeration the condensation is a huge point of concern and its management could potentially be very very costly so you can see that these these products or systems have been deployed or are being contemplated to be deployed in different electric vehicles and as a result of it we have options that are better utilized so before we run into the options and review those with you briefly I'd like to just go over some of the thermal stuff and see some of the data that you're gonna see where they have come from I know we dealing with a chemical process in lithium ion batteries for a lot of us from mechanical engineers that this could be a sort of a point of ambiguity that what is it that we're dealing with up basically we're coming out of that out of the battery we try to maintain the core temperature we're dealing with the surface temperature and when you put look at the heat transfer equations that are that are associated with that is very very straight forward the stuff that we've done over and over and over again you can see that there is a different temperature here in this case I used the example of LGBT but it could as well be a battery doesn't really matter it is it is a point of describing what transpires and what are these inter layers that we have to worry about whether I put a battery in there or IGBT that there are layers that interface interface resistances interfaces that we have to manage effectively so you can see that the for instance the convection losses that we have Trudy here through the Fenton is H 8 TB minus T C obviously m dot CP is also a function of the at least to the ant ant ant in order to be able to take the heat away and the the t heart the silicon or battery temperature divided by the film temperature which is that highest delta T that we have is a function of all these resistors that we have to manage and these are irrespective of what we are putting it as a cooling system we have these interfaces that we have to account for and if we don't take it take it if you don't pay attention to them they could come back and adversely impact or design or positively impact your design depending upon what you miss so the subjectively shows by by us trying to manipulate these for instance if I if I change the value of H I can significantly impact it if I change the mass flow rate I can I can impact a totally damp time transported through this system if I change the fluid this C sub P I can also again impact the impact the year the total transfer capability do you remember that m dot is equal to Rho V a where a is the cross section area that the food is the fluid is being taken away so if I change the cross sectional area optimize my heat sink if I change the velocity if I change the fluid tile all of these is going to impact the total heat that I'm transporting by looking at these inter facial resistances or material resistor between the source and the sank I can again further optimize my my thermal transfer capability a smaller that resistance larger the they kill a tool that I can take the heat transfer into the to the heat sink and take advantage of it I see Abraham did a very nice job in it showing the capability of these packaging as it applies to electric vehicles or in general the cooling of the IGBTs and this is really done for the demonstrating the purpose is to show for instance if I if I have a heat source and heat sink well what is what are the capabilities that I have what if I put jet impingement meaning the jet the fluid has been impinged in the bottom or and on the top what do I get what if I put microchannel heat sinks that have a very very hi thermal transfer capability but at the same time has a have a very high pressure drop so I have to balance those together the points in November our target is two hundred two hundred watts per square centimeter our temperature is about 105 and the hot the coolant temperature hundred and five then the hottest temperature T sub H that's associated with this assembly is that one twenty five anything that falls in this area is a possible solution for me and the important thing to to look at it and bring it down to this axis is the effective heat transfer coefficient you can see that this is from effectively about thirty to about eighty kilowatts per meter square degree K this is 40,000 watts per meter square degree K all of us who've done some heat transfer work we realize that this number is a daunting task to to achieve is it achievable absolutely so there is a solution out there as we go through the design and limitations we have to understand what it takes for us to be able to get to these temperatures and be able to deliver this level of cooling system that's associated with that but you can see certainly it is it is a plausible and possible the different applications that you have and as you change the fluid you can decrease your heat transfer coefficient value as you change develop AA city etcetera subtle as we talked about it before so air cooling is a very nice work that was done by Tao and that he showed the effectivity the governing equations that we have in order to be able to simulate and understand what happens in a battery cooling if I want to do it but by air and then he uses the nusselt number and the Reynolds number as shown here for a specific battery pack that we have to use so you can see the SOC is the state of charge and SOC naught is the initial battery state of charge whatever whatever capacitance says but I like to point your attend attention to the equations and the kind of information that we can get out of it as you've heard me say in the previous webinars I call this integral modelling that we can very quickly get a get a good estimate as to what is happening in our battery system and where is a where the points of concentration that I have to worry about and they do the parametric analysis this can easily be done in any of the available tools from the excel to some like mathcad MATLAB Nemeth it's available on the market that we can get and math math deco and so forth and solve the problem so having these governing equations he did a very nice job in looking at the performance of the what happens in the system he did something like 3738 different simulations and changing the variety of parameters i am only showing you three of those that just to show the capability and the kind of things happened as a result of the modeling and then the points that we have to pay attention to and manage this is the system that you have the bunch of batteries and the air is coming from the outside and leaving leaving the system so that the adhesive see the battery core temperature is obviously the most important point this is one that's shown in the in the red as to what happens to it this first one shows the back stepping controller that he had he had deployed as as a parameter shown in these equations that are being controlled with as as a functional as a function of time and what you can see is the core temperature is very very stable throughout the process let's put in the controller you remember I pointed out to a circuit board in the earlier slide and said we cannot ignore the the electronics that we have to deploy in order to be able to solve the problem without this controller this wouldn't happen but you can see the surface temperature fluctuations and we can also see that the coolant temperature air temperature fluctuating quite quite a bit in this case now when we come to a fixed coding temperature that means there was no controller involved you can see that the sort of the onset of the temperature rising very rapidly and going over the 40-degree limit that we had yet the surface temperature and coolant remain very stable when we go today a linear optimal controller we can see a little bit of a fluctuation in temperature but the delta T that we see in this is very small in the order of a 1 1 or 2 degrees but we see a higher level of fluctuations in the air cooling air temperature and the surface temperature this may not be attractive in your application but nevertheless very simple set of equations is enabling us to understand and the dynamics that's required in order to manage the system by air cooling and what are the salient points that we have to worry about and pay attention to you are given an application for instance this could be perfectly functional as long as you know that this is gonna stabilize and not go any further going over 40 degrees C as you saw it is not a very active situation for us to operate as gonna start impacting the battery performance and life as a result of higher temperature so the next cooling method is the is a liquid cooling and again I try to show here what are the our options that we have as far as the liquid cooling is concerned with different systems that are deployed in the in the market yes you can see a passive liquid cooling system where we have the air coming in today here liquid to a heat exchanger here and there's a fan that's exhausting you to bang into the ambient but nevertheless this is this is the cycle that you have in order to be able to manage the cooling so this could be an application for a not necessarily electric vehicle or maybe a light electric vehicle one of these smart cars that are very compact a small effectively glorified motorcycle so active moderated liquid and heating that that may be required and again you can see that the presence of a liquid to liquid heat exchanger and and this goes into the vehicle coolant that comes in and take advantage of the vehicle coolant so active cooling and heating we have the air from the evaporator or refrigeration from the from the condenser comes in we have a heat exchanger place here and the liquid to our heat exchanger so the problem gets more complex and more components have to go into the system that we have to address a little bit reliability we have to address the weight issue we have to address the the cost issue and also that it's effective management of the of the battery pack depending upon what we have to use ultimate objective is to make sure this battery pack is working properly and it's giving us the performance that we want so and you look at the level of packaging that takes place this is an example from Audi that they've done it's you can see how complex the the process is you have the you have the cells that are that are shown here and this whole assembly is put into this structure that has the lower protection cover has the cooling system as you can see in the middle with the fluid coming in and going out you have the battery frame that the battery has to be held intact and housing trade in order to be able to accommodate the batteries and so forth and the aluminum crash structure in order to make sure that they're protected in in the case of possible crash and then you can see how these are going from here and packed into into this and then eventually into into this system that the plumbing the all the packaging that's required in order to make sure that this one complete unit for transport ability you can see that as as we talked about it before the serviceability of these batteries are very very important and you don't want to have a one battery that you can pull out and put a new battery in or or be able to uncover this and take it change the individual similar to that we have stopped functioning properly and eventually this whole thing goes into a onto a chassis that powers the vehicle to go forward and and some of the vehicles that we see in the market right now they have quite a bit of power quite a bit of a range to three to four hundred depending upon where they're obviously the weight of the occupants and what's inside the vehicle but they can go out at their high speed in long distances so the battery technology is really transform quite a bit the coulee technology in this case liquid has also transferred quite a bit in order to be transformed quite a bit in order to be able to support that level of function that so when we look at the liquid in this example you can see the schematic we have the battery cells here and then we have the cooling plates that are in gray if you can see it on your screen and this is one one embodiment of if you will one design and eventually these are coming to the to the connections to be able to circulate the liquid and take it out this is a design the one in the bottom that was done by Tesla well you can see that there is a tube that is being drawn right through the battery pack but there is a connection between the the the battery pack here and the the plate and again this is a patented technology by by Tesla so you can see the different embodiment different improvement implications that are done in order to be able to cool the battery the objective is to make sure the batteries are maintained properly and I'd like to draw your attention to the number of batteries that are being used in this particular application for for Tesla eighteen thousand batteries are used in this application for the Model S battery and again more deployment of the liquid cooling and I locked you again to draw your complexity draw your attention to the complexity and how designers have gone about to to design this very effectively what you see here is an example of a volt by boy I believe by Chevy where you have the battery you have the thin plate and you have the cooling plate and then and this this area is attached to the Year coolant that's been circulated within the battery pack all of these are put into these plastic frames and and packed together into a structure and eventually is packed into this but when you can see as you can see here there is there is Inlet and outlet for the for the glycol material to fluid to circulate inside the inside the system to to provide the cooling that's required it's a very very effective system as was designed by Chevy or GM but you can see the complexity that they have to go through in order to be make sure that that the connection is made notice that every single one of these effectively is a fluid connection joint that has to be effectively sealed and make sure that's functioning properly with the expected life that we talked about we are talking about the seal that's most last 15 years in elevated temperatures with shock and vibration and extreme temperatures and be able to function effectively and not provide a leak the next concept for a coolie that's been explored by some manufacturers is the old concept is called the immersion cooling in the old traditional immersion cooling you just dropped your electronics into the into the bath and there was a heat exchanger on the top where as the fluid vaporizes it condenses and comes back so there is a full cycle taking place in them this concept found its way I think initially was designed in the vacuum tube era and then in the 60s and 70s mainframe computers like IBM and others started exploring this possibility and was never really successfully deployed they kept on coming back to a less cost-effective less costly I should say systems for cooling and and deployed it accordingly and now you can see it's been be possibly contemplating the battery cooling where you can put yourselves inside a container and you have the liquid cooled heat exchanger on the top where the fluid turns you to from vapor to liquid and the cycle is repeated over and over again the biggest challenge obviously we see is in the packaging and serviceability repair of these parts as you go forward here is a concept that stone by I think zinc modular battery systems in out of China that they're they're putting the whole system into a into a immersion bath and this is what the system looked like and you always have to have a liquid to air heat exchanger in order to be able to take the heat out if you don't have that heat exchanger on the top but irrespective you have to have that another heat exchanger further back to take that heat that you generate by the battery in order to make sure they're working properly 3m Novak that as Novak that we talked about before they obviously claim that this is a very effective cooling system and that they have highlighted the benefits of these as a direct cell contact helps improve heat transfer performance help to improve his pack temperature uniformity I mentioned that this is very important and certainly cooling or immersion cooling can help health help helps protect against cell to cell a thermal runaway which is the neighbor effect that we talked about potentially enables a higher charge and discharge rate depending it because of the fact the whole system is at a lower temperature if you remember the chart that I showed you that said for the liquid cooling the temperature gradients between one to three degrees C so the success of this now requires an liquid to our heat exchanger or on active cooling system in order to make sure that we can to move the heat and create this recirculation that's required and we have a change of the phase change take simple takes place from vapor to liquid so we never have a dry out if your liquid to our heat exchanger fails you're gonna have a dry out all the liquid II so the emergent system is going to vaporize and as a result of it may have all kinds of catastrophic failures certainly heat pipes have been used in a variety of applications and automotive air battery cooling is no different we all know that the heat pipe is a transport mechanism that takes the heat from point A to point B and they come in a round and flat shape and they've been certainly deployed or considered in the battery coating note no different than any other applications where you have the heat source and you bring it out to an area that you have a better airflow and and you put the fins on it excuse me in order to be able to cool the batteries and take the either way so in order for this to function effectively with or without the heat pipe is you have to have an effective heat sink at this end of it otherwise your system is not going to function effectively this time your ploys excuse me for one second the same applies for the cells of the cancers and so for if you put it in it's inside the container and if the container is filled with some sort of a transfer fluid or medium you can take that take the heat away and use the flat heat pipe to dissipated elsewhere the heat pipes do two things number one they they transport the heat very effectively from point A to point B number two is it allows you to spread the heat more uniformly over over your entire surface in the back of your heat sink if you have heat pipes you can get a better distribution and so I can use your heat sink more effectively so you won't have hot spots on your heat sinks as a result of it less effective coating that takes place in there so phase change is another thing that has been socializers are contemplated for a variety of applications what a face you change material is it's like a paraffin or some sort of a wax that changes phase from one state to another from from solid to liquid from from liquid to vapor and as long as the cycle is repeated we are we are all set you can see here that there is a storage temperature as well as the capacity to retain heat and the increase of the internal resistance which is another something very attractive that we want to see and we can see the temperature dependency temperature dependency affects both parameters that are very very important in the face George Wein had done a very nice study to show what happens to these to these the devices as we go forward so he uses a PCM that was pure paraffin then he changed it to the expanded graphite and paraffin some mixture of 20 80 percent and then he chose the the third one that was expanding graphite/epoxy and paraffin and as you're gonna see epoxy has has other advantages that that provides some some consideration so this is the setup that Bank looked at and you got to look at the also functionality of the year of the of the piece TMS or materials that you need to have active could in order to be able to return today to to original state so the first one that the blue dots show the pure paraffin the red dots or red markers show the 80/20 combination and the black ones show the third combination but is the epoxy paraffin and expanded graphics and I think as you can see obviously the lower the temperature better off we are but equally as important pay please pay attention to the cycle at the time that is changing as a result of it when we when we changed the mixture and the combination so it's a highly transient problem the combination of the mixtures that we have depending upon the discharge at three different levels that's discharge one discharge three and discharge far right and this shows that the discharge rate as and also the temperature difference and the green one shows no no cooling if I if I had just a standard cooling process and you can see that the composition and the mixture that we have plays a significant role in the effect about PCM so let me not go through these details you saw that the numbers that you see so with respect to what the temperature fluctuations are and what they gain a benefit sort of to upwards of twenty thirty percent when we change the mixture but important things let me just do these observations battery thermal management using PCM shows excellent performance in limiting peak temperature at short period so when I read when I say that conclusion that the thing that comes to my mind is PCMs are certainly good as a sort of a safety valve I have a cooling system in place I'm gonna put a dilution of PCM in there in order to make sure that if I have a thermal runaway at least I have a secondary system to suppress the peaks and manage it effectively the battery using PC and without convective cooling methods may not be practical at all we have to have a cooling system in order to be able to bring it back to normal temperature the use of the PCM in those applications enables us to use a smaller air cooling application I bring it to reality and lesser the weight more effective our devices and vehicle designs will need to wait the potential increase in mass and and cost associated PCM against the anticipated benefits we had eight years I've done the use of the vapor chambers to be able to effectively cool these batteries what we've developed is a an array of aluminum and titanium vapor chambers vapor chamber for those of you who may not be familiar with it is effectively a flattened heat pipe effectively and what we've done very successfully it's been able to oops sorry been able to I'd lost my pointer here somehow to make it out of aluminium and titanium but in very large sizes unable to put a copper plate and or heat sink on top of it whether this is an individual system or connected to the bigger system doesn't make any difference the point is its ability to have a very large platform they can rest against the batteries you still have the thermal interface materials but what the vapor chamber does a uniform eise's temperature gradients across multiple batteries and then you have the dedicated cooling system to be able to take it away you take the heat away and or put it into a bigger system so if you can see there is a broad deployment of batteries in variety of applications across the industry so whether we have done automotive or whatever that that is that's a point of concern you see that the batteries are being deployed and the point that we have to pay attention to as we go through it like other electronics that we've dealt with over the years the phone I mean this is very much system-specific we cannot take the system that's done for company a and just plant it into a company B because of the fact that it is very much designed for the final application that we have to go through so in summary temperature needs an effective management play key role in deployment of battery system in any application including electric vehicles two major problems caused by temperature can be found on when it comes to battery cooling one is the year the temperature exceeds permissible level during the charge and discharge and uneven temperature distribution attributes to localized deterioration of the of the battery and potentially catastrophic failure temperature effects heats heat source and heatsink electric hybrid vehicles and batteries in smoke or the temperature control should be considered before designing the battery thermal management system it is it is very important that we have the that information in front of us before we go on design something that's not going to fit effectively either law for - less than 15 degrees C or higher temperature greater than 50 degree C will adversely reduce the battery cycle life and that's very effective remember the batteries that beers that it's expected to be designed by the freedom car supposed to operate for 15 years or hundred fifty thousand miles research suggests that lithium ion batteries the desired operating temperature to achieve required safety and performance is between fifteen to thirty five degrees C with five degree C temperature variation from module to module a daunting task it's not an easy easy thing to attain if we especially don't have the proper resources in order to make sure that we can design the cooling system that's going to fit the application the address and his team provides the following temperature bands at different operations level battery capacity and pulse performance from zero to ten degrees c optimal range twenty thirty degrees c faster self discharge we had 30 to 40 degrees c irreversible reaction.add short circuit they filled forty to sixty degree c and there are three primary cooling approaches that are considered for the battery thermal management at this junction air liquid and refrigeration and every single one of them have branches that are associated with that air cooling could have a TCM heat pipe liquid cooling could have a PCM and some sort of a system level cooling refrigeration etc so design of the cooling system is a strong function of the final product that that will be resilient of the ownership is very very important a lot of us have will have it we don't pay attention to it as we going through the design it is not just the cost of the battery it's the service life access to parts operating expense and all the way to the disposal and every other thing that's in between among other parameter is our important consideration once considering it design of the couny system so it's not a if you don't want to design your vacuum we want to understand what's going to happen at the end and the users we're going to use it in order to make sure that we have it we have designed an effective system for it similar to any other electronics coding problems there must be a technical or marketing reason to go to a higher capacity cooling always to start with air cooling and travel up the cooling ladder to make sure that you have exhausted our options that are associated with the cheaper less less complicated systems like air cooling before we go to liquid and as we go from from liquid to refrigeration it gets that much more complicated one thing that's really important to know is that the market is rich to saturate that with design including options for battery thermal management we need this we need to see that use and don'ts because there are a lot of stuff that's been done this trim there's so many article of so many presentations and so many conference and so forth dedicated to this concept people are doing all kinds of work across the globe before you jump into a design please take the time to understand and what has been happening and what's the best thing that you can do what we can learn from what's been done but the do's our review and understand the problems and the boundary conditions that are that the solutions or the solution was developed for understand the approach that the engineer took to solve the problem at hand not not just the final system the don'ts are do not assume that the solution is an end-all meaning since it work for their product it will work for your design do not copy what they did solutions published a very problem is specific and they speak to the possibilities not the exact solution we can learn a lot from more colleagues who've done and when you come up with a nice design if your company allows you to to publish it please share it with the community I think it's always very valuable my people published and as long as no proprietary and and get the get the technology communicated but what's something that ever advocated all the time to solution approaches whether a numerical analytical experimental are fundamental to the Soviet vtm issues there are no different than any other thermal problems or engineer problem that you solve you have to have two solutions and accurate estimation of the battery core temperature like the a6 Junction temperature is the court focused for developing an effective cooling temperature the cooling solution there is no difference between the John temperature and the core temperature that we've done with the batteries these are these are all the same we have a temperature that we have to maintain and you saw the important the important the important role the junction temperature or the core temperature of the battery plays in its expected life and their performance so with that I thank you 80s has been around for almost 30 years we provide mechanical and thermal design services cooling solutions air liquide an active and passive is Temptation Airmen tunnels manufacturing services training programs and QP dia so with that I thank you for your attention and I'd be more than happy to answer any questions that is that is coming the question is what are the major advantages and challenges associated with two phase immersion cool the biggest challenge with the two phase immersion cooling is the same thing that we've seen in the in the our computing industry or the vacuum tubes which is very way back before that the issue is the issue of packaging issue of the thermal runaway making sure that the cooling system that is that exterior that are short on the top let me see well I can go back to what I had so I can I can point to it effectively right here if its core is not working effectively it's this this combination all the liquid is gonna turn into vapor and you're gonna have a dry out so you're gonna have you're gonna be dissipating all that power and you have no effective coding that takes place inside the system so the challenge is the packaging it's a control it is it is serviceability what what do you have to do if you want to change the batteries in here how you gonna fill that system how you gonna change this change the fluid which is the fluid now as a result of the functionality you are mentally safe disposal of the fluid so all of those things every system has its own challenges but from the thermal standpoint making sure that your your heat exchanger is working effectively and the condensation is taking place that's that's the biggest thing so whatever is residing at the end of end of this system to take this heat away this has to function perfectly at all time you have to have a shutoff system meaning if this failed the controls that we talked about this system is shut down so it doesn't work anymore so those are from the thermal standpoint that other part of it is deployment when you deploy it I'd love to see how this is going to be changed or done in the service area if you go after you have to go back and fill this cavity or this path stop with fluid again and how you're gonna be doing it very effective very very difficult very expensive thank you for everyone who's joined us this afternoon if you do have any other questions you can feel free to try to come in just a reminder that the our monthly webinar series will continue next month in November I believe it's November 29th it is the exact date and that will be on key pipes and in the vapor chambers and their role in heat transfer and you can sign up and register for that webinar add the same link that you had registered for this webinar as well I'm not seeing any other question so I just want to say thank you to everyone who joined us and thank you dr. azar for the presentation hopefully you'll join us again next month thank you
