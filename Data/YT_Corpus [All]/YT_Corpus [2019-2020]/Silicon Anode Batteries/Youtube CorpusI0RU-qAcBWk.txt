 [Music] okay in the second part of this lesson we'll look at ways that past work can be referred to without specific citations and why you would do that there are many reasons that past research could be used in this way one is for general background knowledge things that are generally true or accepted by the field now these you'll notice because they're usually written in the present tense because they're considered to be always true not from a certain point in time where they were discovered they're not about the the new research in that article but they're things that are known and accepted by experienced researchers in the field this is commonly found in things like importance in engineering in science even these things that are generally accepted as true science prefers to use a citation if it's available and then the second is definitions or notation these are very common in mathematics there may be a whole section devoted to definitions or notation presented as a list in which case they're very easy to find this is considered to be part of the framework because it's what the rest of the paper is based on unless they're new definitions new notation proposed in the current work in which case it would be considered part of the research details and then the third is the theoretical model things that are needed to understand the current work the approaches the theoretical model the specific background information but things that are again well known in the field this also is considered to be part of the framework but I separated definitions because they're sort of a separate category and easy to recognize so how do you find these because they're not marked again let my students show you how they found them in their own work okay now we're going to look at the unmarked areas where it's referring to past research but without citation and try to figure out how you can find those areas okay so let's look at the article again so we can see that there are citations here so now we can see the second paragraph they say traditionally so they are talking about how they do it in a traditional way so they didn't cite it because many people do this oh yes so then here's a framework and this is a research goal mm-hmm and that's that's related to the framework yes not really the same framework and here is based on a framework so that it'll also have the citations here because the citation is that is in a frame working so there's also the methods and for here the material carotids characterisations so here is all the people do this but you don't need to talk about the methods for doing scanning electron microscopy because everybody in the field does it so you don't need to list the specific methods or site and it yes yes you can just list how many instruments that you use yes and also here that you can also just list it yeah you did until you don't need to mention that why you chose it yes because everybody does it yes so here is the result and discussion that they explained the results here and they are only just describing so there's no particular things that they need to mention right because that's their work which we'll talk about next week rather than past work that so it doesn't need any citations yes so in a in a resultant discussion part if they have to like compare with past research they will have citations if they don't have then there's no right yes so here's also no no markable citations here and in the in a conclusion they're absolutely absolutely not no armed archaic citations right again because that's talking about their own work we will talk about next week rather than past research yes okay good okay now we'll look in the mechanical engineering article for those references to past work that are not specifically stated okay for this article I found not may need a unmarked citation the person one I found in the research detail as the this one okay they try to commit some problem some particular problem by using the traditional controller so this one they use dirt the select mode control because actually this one have I mentioned before but normally if you if the order try to use the this kind of word and this method on that as they did you sign the some number here okay and the second one is this one they define the steps paid positionings this work just showed at the first time but the key points they use there instead of a so this one is really obvious that they try to leave produce some really popular method of thumb I'll bill known met hot okay so if the audience doesn't know about something the first time you mention it you should use a but this is the first time they mentioned state space partitioning so the fact that they use the implies that the audience already ought to know about the idea of state space partitioning and therefore it's from past work yeah so the beginning to sorry the beginner should not know about this one yeah except right me because I've really familiar to this field so when I say this one oh okay III catalyze what is this one so again this is things that are any experience researcher in the field would know but someone who's new might not be able to tell that this is past work and instead of the present work okay and the other one in the simulation results are in the testing method they are trying to compare with a traditional slightly more control this one is really clear because they use a traditional to represent that they use the deposit research right and again sliding mode controller then you can that was what we talked about before it didn't specifically say it there but you can say Oh sliding mode controller that's traditional people ought to know it that must be referring to well-known past work and now to look for the unmarked references to past work in our electrical engineering article yeah so in this article they also mention about a dependency graph but this is the well no in this view so they didn't mention any citation in in this session in this obsession ok so again this is something that's well known to researchers in this field I wouldn't know it I wouldn't know that this is past work but you know it because a lot of things in the field are based on dependency graphs so this is something that's field specific and again a new student coming into the field may not know that but we have to learn that ok now we're going to talk about when you need references and how you decide whether you need a specific citation or or whether it's ok to just refer to past work so what do you think I mean you've written a little bit you've read several articles how does an author decide whether they need a numbered citation or whether it's ok to just refer to the past ok let me talk first ah oh my kids we have two two categories the first one you need most of this one is happening the introduction product when you try to say some cram and then you have SubPop right to support this cream is not get it more strong or stronger on more soaking so when you say some sentence and you you think that destiny is not get the convince the leader on the living world so you should put a citation there to make the liberal or leader make sure that this is happen can can be happen all right I do have done research Oh lady okay so in the introduction you frequently have citation numbers because you're using that as support yeah for your claim of need yes in particular mm-hmm yeah sometimes but important because ya know you may not know that it is up this is really important not not yeah so it is better to put some citation than to make okay we have a live rendered it is really important and the other category is when you when I try to write there some what term is really patty gray or only my few only have these four terms because in my view is control and we have a lot of the bottom by their list these are should name like it love north or something it's really weird so that one should be to put the citation dad okay but sometimes some of the things that you look at didn't have a citation so how do they decide when they need it and when it's okay not to put something like that I think for that case we have to consider about the leader or Louisville ah ah ah da the specialist of this figure or not you've dated we should we just use the death instead of a to add the article of the that network that is enough yeah so again that's depends on the journal then because if a journal talks all about control then the readers of that journal are going to be familiar with control systems yes but if you published in some other mechanical engineering journal you might need a reference for that because the readers of that journal wouldn't be familiar with it yeah mm-hmm okay yeah so in my case so when I'm writing the first version of my article will be like follow my mind then which side ages have I wanted to put it your and maybe the next version that we have to like find what journal that we are tackle for and then we and make some research that read some of the articles author of the journals then we can know that whether if we need to add some more citations or or dated some some citations right so if other readers in the field commonly refer to something without a citation you can - but if they commonly use a citation to refer to a particular topic or idea then you also should yes because different journals have different topics that they need to talk about and sometimes they overlap but sometimes there's slightly different work so the citation may be like a little bit different if we tackle different journals mm-hmm in my field also citation in introduction but if we come there with another work so indebted method is efficient in there mm-hmm okay but again how do you decide which testing methods need if we use the data have purpose already publish in another world we should decide but if the data is really by yourself so we should we don't need to citation here yet so anytime that you refer to specific data specific methods that were used in one particular article then you need a citation yeah but this this is again is something that you learn over time right you learn from other people in the field you mentioned before we started recording that you learn from your advisor yes yes because my coz after I finish my article then I will discuss with my teacher and he is also in editor mm-hmm other journals he'll give me many advise on the of the structure or citations right and the reviewers - I mean if you send it out for to the editor the editor sends it to the reviewers and if the reviewers don't recognize something they'll say hey I want a citation just show me where this is from so again by doing this several times you learn what's important and what you don't need a reference for yes yeah okay so it's it's a learning process you know the past research you become familiar with it and then sometimes you don't cite things because you're familiar with it you forget that other people may not be but then the reviewers will remind you okay good okay again now it's your turn to look for citations in your article the specific marked citations and try to figure out which components they refer to which they're used to support make a table just like the ones that we showed you in this lesson but then also look for other places that known past information is used without citation and again often this will be in the framework portion of the article [Music] [Applause] [Music]
