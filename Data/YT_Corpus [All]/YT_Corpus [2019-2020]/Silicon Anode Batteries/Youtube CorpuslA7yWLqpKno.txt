 [Music] hello students greetings to you we'll continue our discussion on the batteries as well as a little bit about the fuel cells today yesterday I had talked to you about nickel cadmium cell that is essentially similar to nickel iron cell and I had shown you this slide and now I want to compare some of the alkaline rechargeable battery systems and their typical applications actually whenever we want to tell something about the batteries etcetera if we don't talk about the applications and their salient features it will be some sort of a anticlimax because quite often we have to choose between various kinds of batteries so look at nickel cadmium battery it's a prismatic cells with pocket electrodes etc and battery applications include remote power load leveling stationary and then the salient feature among the salient features you will see that the toxicity is one part in which I want you to concentrate and the other one is the limitations so in nickel cadmium batteries you can see that the energy relatively low efficiency per volume and weight that is not very highly desirable so open circuit voltage cell capacity should be about 1.3 volts but toxicity due to cadmium is always there that means once the useful life is over we have faced with the burden of cadmium dito with other types of cells here in prismatic cells pocket electrode sintered electrodes and powder these are all different kinds of electrodes of different sizes etcetera for example this prismatic cells having sintered electrodes are used more mainly in aircraft waitress and again toxicity of cadmium should be common then button cells are there nickel cadmium low power applications but toxicity we really do not know how to recover very low quantities of cadmium even though we know that they are dangerous in the environment similarly seedless cylindrical cells are there with jellyroll electrodes these are useful for very high power but portable energy so relatively low electrode efficiency is one of the common result that happens whenever we draw high-power current so look at nickel hydrogen battery again a similar problem pressure vessels thin electrode stacks are required and high profile applications in space missions now usually they don't do a use anything else apart from nickel hydrogen in space applications so as power systems for military satellite applications etc only nickel hydrogen are useful again the energy other things are essentially same 1.3 volts 16 whatever synergy density etcetera then there is this nickel metal hydride is something special only that has come to the fore only since last 20 years and these metal hydrides are portable high power high energy applications so apart from that there is not much to tell I want you to study all these applications with respect to their utility then comes silver zinc prismatic cells with the flat plate electrodes used in military applications and marine communications they are expensive because of the use of silver you see silver is an electrode that is not only toxic but it is costly also so but the current capacity wise and all later is very good 1 point 6 volts 190 volt white hours and then specific energy is approximately 90 watt hours per kg etcetera and you may know to zinc electrode shield cylindrical cells applications portable low moderate power applications suppose you want to monitor you know s PMS or two etcetera in the environment we're in the field then you should go for such electrodes batteries they are relatively cheap and absence of lead and cadmium etc makes it environment friendly and they are alternates for primary alkaline batteries energy density is also quite attractive I will not go into details of this but these slides we have prepared for you to study and compare okay rechargeable battery systems under development I want to give you a couple of remarks lithium manganese oxide is three volts look at the research emphasis in getting higher voltage for the same electrodes and then remarks of course I put starting from the applications so room temperature operation means very comfortable positive electrode material is air sensitive so problems due to plating of lithium because the high if you want high voltage lithium minimum so plating of lithium is required then lithium this is another very trademark battery available in the market commercially 2.5 volts lithium titanium s2 is 2.3 volts we are having nothing better than that comparable would be sodium nickel chloride this would be approximately two point five to two point three volts but very good but the they had they need high temperature molten salt as cata light and solid BLT three separator Vita Vita aluminum that is al2o3 here the problem is they would be useful only for specific applications rather than as a routine patreon sling similarly sodium sulfur two point one volts beta alumina separate our high temperature liquid electrodes difficult to handle but useful anyway so the chemistry involved in all the above three types of nickel cadmium batteries is essentially same we have already written the equations basically it is conversion of cadmium to cadmium hydroxide with the release of two electrons and a normal reaction would be beta nickel oxide hydroxy peroxyacid water plus electron that goes to beta nickel hydroxide and OAH - so however this reaction is basically complicated you can imagine you see this is a peroxy compound and here it is the only hydroxide and all the reaction that is happening is only due to this electron that is fantastic so this reaction is definitely complicated because of the existence of two additional phases that undergo electrochemical transformation and their various conditions and this is the type of real solid state reaction we write that is why moles of NaOH and 1 minus X of h2o plus e - goes to alpha nickel hydroxide with X and that is X means variable water we react on variable quantity of water plus o H - so the gamma nickel per oxyhydroxide phase appears in the system because of the possible overcharging of T beta and ioo at electrode now let us talk a little bit about nickel hydrogen batteries that makes it it's very simple H 2 plus 2 o H - goes to h2o and pressure vessels made of inconel or stainless steel they can withstand up to 200 bars what does it mean this 200 bars essentially are used such conditions prevail in submarines so that is why we need a an alloy like inconel and other batteries are there manganese dioxide zinc weight resale or zinc alkaline battery there are various of batteries are available and they would be having specific applications we will not go into details of this except to say that there are lot of reserve batteries there has been a requirement of cells with special characteristics for the use in proximity fuses artillery mines balloons guided missiles radar bazookas nightwing equipment and left several times walkie-talkies and several types of materials require these kind of batteries and they must have capability of high voltage as well as long in active shelf life this is very important we want their batteries to have long shelf life even if they are not used so the moment to use it should come into life so rapid activation is one of the requirement for a good battery so here I can say a little bit about perchloric acid and fluo boric acid cells that is essentially LED perchloric acid flow boric acid and lead oxide reactions are similar let goes to let iron play releasing two electrons and perchloric acid reaction produces lead perchlorate and this is another reaction PB o 2 plus PB so similarly we can talk about there that is the silver chloride cell that is also very good and gordon magnesium battery this is one of the important batteries containing magnesium as the negative electrodes and oxygen D polarizer has the positive electrode here the most beautiful thing is tap water is used as the electrolyte so we can simply write a cell reaction like magnesium is one electrode whatever is the electrolyte or KBR we can add KBR means potassium bromide in aqueous solution so water also is one of the electrolyte plus oxygen gas from the air then carbon as the another electrode so silver peroxide Zink alkaline cell was designed during the Second World War to meet the requirement of high rate primary cell however during investigations we find that the cell was best suited for one-shot purpose because of the shorter shelf life arising out of the high solubility of silver oxide in the NaOH or Koh that is why these cells are almost obsolete now nobody uses this kind of cells in silver silver oxide KO it because they are all one-time cells so you ready to forego the reuse then you can use this type of cells then the reactions at the silver oxide electrode occurs in to reduction steps first stage silver oxide goes to AG - oh this is AG room and then AG - oh goes to AG that is silver so at the zinc electrode again we have the final product would be k2 Zaida no 2 + 2 h2o so the overall reaction at the zinc electrode you can write that is zinc plus 2 K + + 4 o H - goes to K 2 Zn o 2 plus 2 h 2 o plus 2 e - so that completes our discussion on various kinds of cells that is battery cells we have discussed about nickel cadmium air water silver oxide then the lithium batteries and their nickel nickel err all those things now I will introduce you quickly to another part of the electrochemical technology that is known as fuel cell we will not go into details but we will just have a glimpse of what is a fuel cell this is for the sake of brevity that we should not leave out anything related to electrochemical technology that is used in the pollution monitoring so what is the fuel cell a fuel cell is an electrochemical cell that can convert chemical energy contained in a readily available fuel oxidant system into electrical energy so they work at high efficiency resulting in emission levels that are for the far more than the permissible limits so they are modular in nature they can be built in a wide range of power requirements from a few hundred Watts up to multi kilo wet and even mega watt sizes see here the beauty of fuel cell comes into play you know the fuel cells are required not in not only on the earth but even in space applications where a rocket or a satellite has to keep on working for years together based on its own chemical system basically what is the fuel cell it converts electrochemical chemical energy into a reusable electrical system so the chemical must be released slowly slowly slowly so that electrical energy keeps on being supplied to this system so it works for longer time so what are the basic theoretical principles very simple we have a chemical energy that goes to heat then it is mechanical energy converted and then into electrical energy so we need a fuel we need an electrode and we need another electrode and we need an oxidant so both oxide and Phil can combine to give you electrical energy so there are several types of fuel cells with hydrogen oxygen fuel cell having porous electrodes and potassium hydroxide as the electrolyte simple reactions Oh 2 + 2 h2o + 4 he goes to 4 Oh H - and the cathode reaction above is the sum of the intermediate reactions occurring at the cathode that is 2h 2 + 4 o H - plus 4 h2o + goes to 4 water and 2 electrons these two electrons are again used up here and the overall reaction would be 2 H 2 plus o 2 goes to 2 H 2 so the products of the fuel cells are always water and maybe a little bit of carbon dioxide depends so the fuel cell electrode design normally provides for high rate of electrode processes by creating stable interface between the three phases that is solid liquid and gases so all these three must be used up and thrown out used up and thrown out used up and thrown out some of the electrodes used are platinum porous PVC and Teflon coated with silver nickel boride Raney nickel and many of the simple metallic systems which we are quite familiar in our day-to-day industrial life so what are the oxidants the oxidants include oxygen air hydrogen peroxide nitric acid any of the oxidant will do the job and oxygen is used as the oxidant in many fuel cells because it can be attached to beam a cylinder and then the cylinder can be supply opened at a with a needle wall to supply very small quantity of silver so the oxygen continuously to the system so that the fuel cell keeps on so the reactions proceed at a faster rate at increased temperature and also in pressure increased pressure also with suitable catalyst so here is a fuel cell system stack here is the fuel cell stack all other things are normally systems required this is a system not nothing to do with the fuel cell this is some other system I am NOT going into details of what is this it is a catalytic converter reactor ok petrol in a petrochemical complex but the power supply is from fuel cell stack here so this kind of applications one can use especially in refineries and satellites and other places so from the practical point of view fuel systems are like this alkaline fuel cells are there and then molten carbonate fuel cells phosphoric acid fuel cells solid oxide and proton exchange membrane fuel cells so alkaline fuel cells the equipped with a dual loop water removal system here you can see that the electrolyte is Koh again and then the pressure hydrogen comes here hydrogen fuel cell so there is a reaction with the Koh producing water here also it is similarly kind of reaction this is a sort of mirror image left and right but both of them are working in tandem so this is the alkaline fuel cell called as do a loop water system also and then molten carbonate cells we can simply write the reaction with very simple components that is hydrogen and carbonate goes to h2o plus co2 that is very simple known reaction like soda okay so what will be the out some of soda that is what you drink at home bicarbonate so carbon dioxide and water so products are always harmless especially in fuel cells that - in molten carbonate fuel cells so cathode reaction we write 1 by 2 o2 + co2 goes to 0 3 2 - and co h2o goes to h2 + co2 so cold filled MCFC power plants have been developed by international fuel cells for electrical utility and dispersed power generation then there are reactions occurring in a phosphoric acid plant with a fuel cell with matrix electrolyte here I have phosphoric acid matrix h2 co2 comes here and this is a sort of a electrode plate electrode this is another cathode and reactions are very simple like what we have studied so far anywhere all the time only simple reactions like h2 goes to 2h plus n oxygen goes to water so phosphoric acid fuel cells are considered to be most advanced the fuel cells after the alkaline fuel cells they are used in spacecraft so they have been operated with a wide range of power output one kilobyte to five megabytes so we have not talking of small power requirement but also in megawatts so the reaction occurring here with a matrix electrolyte are represented there I have already shown you the figure and the electrolyte is contained in a silicon carbide matrix you can't have the helix in the electrolyte liquid hanging around in space applications they have to be incorporated into a solid substance so that liquid is available all the time at the same time it should not spill out and cause the corrosion and other related problems so the silicon carbide matrix normally placed in between the electrodes the bipolar plates are normally hot pressed carbon or graphite plastic mixture so such fields are developed for rias army they have reached India but we do not produce them in India and we have also tried using them in electric vehicles and then power plants etc but it is a slightly difficult right now to adopt them on a larger scale because the technology has not been available and as far as fuel cell technology is concerned India is or something like underdeveloped country so let us discuss a little bit about ion exchange membrane fuel cells these are also very simple systems essentially same reactions water hair discussed earlier this is developed by GE C General Electric Company and the solid polymer electrode has been used see these solid polymer electrodes these are all patented products which are not available in the free domain that is why all these applications make the space travel space applications very costly we have to import them and pay in dollars well in our way during shady periods they've actually fuel cell provides energy for their space station that means well more power required would be huge and during sunny periods of course one can go for solar cells then there are solid oxide fuel cells a very simple reaction as usual X moles of h2 plus Co plus X plus y o2 minus goes to water co2 and E minus simple reaction cathodic oxygen plus electron goes to o2 to minus that will combine with water to give you water and co2 I have put X&Y to indicate that the quantities can be varying there then the stoichiometric requirement so a fuel cell requirement is again and with one electrode here one electrode here this is cathode this is anode and the transfer electron of the electrons takes place in the in between the electrodes we have a news doxygen you we supply oxygen on one side and hydrogen on the other side and so biochemical fuel cells are also there which will normally having specialized applications for example urea and glucose very simple reactions but they act as a field which is oxidized with the help of living organisms biochemical cells so what are the living organisms that can oxidize substances everyone including us we oxidize glucose to survive bacterias also do the same thing enzymes derived from bacteria basically the ketchups of glucose and then they release the oxidation products so it's possible to accomplish direct reduction of oxygen or some other oxidant at the cathode that is bio Cather so they can be used to generate reactants that are consumed at the electrodes itself then there are regenerative fuel cells here the photo galvanic cell is something like a chemical nitrosyl chloride is a photo chemically dissociated into nitric oxide and chlorine which are used as fuel in fuel cells the fuels are regenerated photochemically that's very interesting and now last one solar cells direct or diffuse solar energy can be converted with the help of solar cells directly into the electric current and photovoltaic current without intermediate conversion of thermal energy this principle everybody knows isn't it nowadays we have all over the world solar energy available and solar panels etcetera very highly developed but the problem is with higher energy conversion is still a dream as far as solar energy is concerned normally we expect solar energy to be very efficient unfortunately it is not maximum solar energy conversion what we have obtained so far in our research laboratory is approximately about 19 percent not more than that but 90 percent of the solar energy conversion units give you only about 13 to 14 percent if they cross 14 it is considered to be simply a super-rare panel so with this we come to the discussion on the electrochemical cells and in the next class that is our last class we will talk about process waste handling and zero electrical zero liquid discharge systems so thank you very much we will meet again
