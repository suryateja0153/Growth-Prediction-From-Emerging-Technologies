 David: Hi Peter Zverina, we're in Blansko in the Czech Republic at Pyrotek's facility 2 and we just took a tour which is great appreciate you taking some time to walk us through that. The sign behind you says Pyrotek reached the milestone of making more than 5 million filters inside and during the tour it's easy to see the care your team's put into making each filter. How does Pyrotek maintain such large production volumes while still making the quality the primary emphasis of everything? Peter: I can split it into the 3 things which are the people. We train them which is never ending training and to make the core team stable this much as possible without fluctuation and so on. The 2nd thing is the processes. Stability of processes, effectiveness and also the standardization. Because we have four shifts. That is necessary to have all shifts making the same thing and solve the troubles of production in the same way from all four shifts so that's necessary for the success of production. And the 3rd thing is technologies because we need to learn from our mistakes and the setup the technologies as fine as possible. David: Well thanks so much your time! Nice talking with you! Peter: Thank you
