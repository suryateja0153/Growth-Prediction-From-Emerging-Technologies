 [Music] welcome to the sixth lesson in reading and writing engineering research articles in this lesson we'll be looking at the last two divisions of your research article finding the components in those this is based on chapter 6 of the textbook now remember that one of the things you may find is the testing methods in IEEE MRD usually those are found in the last subsection of the methods and often will be indicated by the title of the subsection but in IPTC frequently the testing methods are found in the testing division along with the the results and frequently in the same paragraph as the data and other components that we'll be looking at now the data patterns form a large part of this division and I specifically call it patterns because the data themselves are often worthless unless you can discover a pattern and because we recognize patterns visually those are often presented visually in either graphs or tables and data is required in almost all studies but again if it's a purely mathematical study depending on mathematical proof then it may not be necessary in IM rd frequently the main points of the table are highlighted in the text whereas in IPTC often the writer simply points to the graphic and expects that the readers will be able to interpret it themselves now data patterns come in many types for instance in this graph you could say that this is linear or that it's rising or that there's a strong correlation between the two values or that the new is better than the old at all of the points measured so there are many different types of patterns and sometimes you can have many types of patterns in the same graph now comparisons is is the eighth component and again this is usually present and in engineering frequently combined with the data patterns and frequently that's presented in the graphs or tables visually and it may be again explicit or it may just be implicit in the fact that they show to lines on on the graph so what do you compare with well sometimes there's a comparison with the expectations or the predicted results or some theoretical ideal on the other hand you may compare two different designs that have been mentioned in the same article or you may compare with previous work in which case it would require citations of that previous work and then we go on to nine interpretations this is the main claim of a science article because this is where the explanation is found on the other hand in engineering it may not be necessary because your design is based on some theory and therefore you may not need to interpret your results and then again either components eight or nine are usually they are one or the other because it's necessary to explain the meaning of the data patterns the data never speak for themselves you have to show that your explanation of the data is correct or that the solution is best in in some way and then finally the conclusion the conclusion may include the summary of the design it may include the achievement or it may include future work or perhaps two or three of those different subcomponents and in many cases in engineering this is a separate section but it may also be the last paragraph in the discussion particularly in the traditional I am Rd format so again to summarize we're looking at the claims that are in the last division in science that you have a good explanation for the data or in engineering that your solution is better than other existing solutions to do that in IMR D you need to look at the the data patterns the results and the comparisons or interpretations in the discussion and then again frequently in the modified IMR D format there will also be a separate conclusion whereas in IPTC you have the same sorts of things but you also have the testing method and often these various things that the testing method the pattern and the comparisons are all found in the same paragraph again followed by a separate conclusion so this is the the difference one of the main differences between IMR D and IPTC in this division so now we're going to let the TAS show you in their articles how they found the components and whether they fit the expected pattern okay now we're going to look at our chemical engineering article at the last two divisions okay so this is a third division resulting discussion and for the second division they have two kinds of methods one is material characterization and the other one is a natural chemical characterization so first is the material space so the first the previous part of the resultant discussion they will show the comparison so the figure they showed is in here so as we can see that this is the image so we can see that they always in starting that they say that the figure one the figure two and they say that what's in the figure one so this is a describe and the purpose is to comparison so this is a comparison component so it has both the data and the comparison in the same paragraph yes so if they are comparison the material the data could be the image my so this could be the the data right so the pattern here is not like a graphical pattern but just the pattern of the two images if you go back up there like this one looks very plain very flat and this one looks very pattern as we can see in an ass next paragraph they say due to the superior structural integrity show above this means that they want to connect the first two paragraph to the following paragraphs because the forum following paragraph is talking about the next testing methods which is the electrochemical characterizations so the order of the paragraphs in the methods division matches the order in the results yes they should be like this so so what they listed in the method divisions they should show it in order in the result and discussion division right that makes it easier for the reader to follow aibee aibee yes and also the image also follows the olders yes so we can say that they have the same patterns that figure three compares and which we can see that these all we can see the numbers the numbers is like they're describing the graphical here you're describing so and again that's more common in IM rd including chemical engineering whereas in electrical engineering sometimes they just say look at the figure yes they don't tell you what to look at we'll see that in the later papers yes because why they are talking about this one is because that there are only dots not only dots in the whole lines they didn't point out the specific number yeah so they point out the specific number so the readers could know that if the data has is better or poor then then the articles okay yes so we can see that there are some keywords inside this division is that compared or do to do to means that the interpretations components and compares is the comparison components and here we can see that there's also another keywords should be attributed this is really really really common in chemical engineering articles this is really common and the next one is this is the data patterns this is almost the only one data patterns that have shown in this articles this is the plateau plateau is where it levels out yes yes sorry yes so we can see that all the figures they have to explain they cannot put the figures out and they didn't have any explanations so we can see that they they have all all the figures and explanations and why does the result will be like this and we can see all here okay so each one compares indicates compares indicates so you have the comparison followed by the explanation yes because we have to do that because if the Commerce the comparison results doesn't have any explanations then if anyone wants to like replicate or do it again if they have failed they could not know why yes so so now there is also the same things that indicates comparisons it's very much better performance is all similar so now we can go through the conclusion part the conclusion part that we have three components in here we can see that in this paper we tack code so that means that they describe the highlight in the in the first sentence and then they give a summary that we really did it well so the next one is that our approach is facile low cost because because that they through the calculations and they achieve the research goal and now they said it is believed that the performance of the electron can be improved further okay now we'll look at the same things in our mechanical engineering article okay ah let me talk first this is a testing missions and if you look at this section number why they name is a summation and experimental results or the simulations are like on a computer and then the experiment is physical real yes right okay okay let's see the first one submission result for this one the the title they use as a communist marker for the testing may start and then they we have the explanations how they are carry out the summation read so they compare which the traditionals writing not control which they propose controller and next they say they compare with the these four figures so is a chi of a comparisons and at the same time they also show the data pattern here next you go to the discontent marker we have two things in here the first one is a comparisons if you can see in these are key one is called 1 by Phi less than so this one is the descender comparisons ok between bigotry F and bigger for D okay and because of this one they indicate that so these the sentence have other the that they showed some interpretation because I here you have both comparison and interpretation in the same sentence not just the same paragraph yes run okay okay right now I'll be move to the explain result the first and then they will show you the pic of Phi a is a picture here that is a experimental setup to show you that how to carry out a simple experiment and as well below here also experience and discredit how they carry out the extra man what is the current conditions sit comes then yeah like the the parameters as it says yeah that's the input to the experiment yeah so this table is not results but that's the parameters the inputs yes and the other one is ah as you can see here it's a have a figure six illustrate as you have say many time about the testing nest on that data patterns you have the keyword something like that Illustrated demonstrate show so this one is really clear this is that theta did a pattern and the other one is this one is according to the Esmond reese result for the circle trajectory tracking this one like he tried to leave her to the dispersal and then they were explains the interpretation so this one compared to the one we looked at in chemical engineering these results are really really short yeah which again that that's what we expect in the IPTC format the the results are usually much shorter than they are in the IM rd even though they're both different fields of engineering yeah sometimes compressing only one sentence but contain two or three components right okay let us move to the conclusion divisions it is we have a treat i up conclusion as you have mentioned we have treaty try the first one is a summary as you see at a dispersed content markers they say an innovation Lobos controller has been investigated so it does mean model what is people have done okay and uh and dissident here they will explain one the detail and then the second ones is a contributions they had to point out what is the contribution in this paper and this is a action meant and the final one here is a third type in the future works and the key word is really cure here in future work and then bra bra bra as an expression so again just like in Wendy's it has all three sub components of the conclusion in this okay now we're going to look at the electrical engineering article but remember here we're looking at the the middle of a section because in in this article it's a little unusual that it has the the testing division sort of at the end of two of the sections so and we talked before in the subsystem process is they will include a substation kinda experiment resource notices contacting division in this paper and we started at this a 5c is experimental result they will talk at the first they will talk about that in matters they perform into this machine and then they come back with the TG matters so that in component and this is the they will also say a powder along with five hey and they they will actually in dutchy okay so it's also the type in metals components okay so that's what they're going to compare against they're going to compare against five cases plus three industrial cases compared with their method yes and in here's the net pal they will say the start is up Toki and the runtime for both metals and so in the table - so this table is will be included that path pattern and also the comparison right and in here we we can easy to find a comparison component because it we mentioned for the for the taste for some case so they we saw some comparison of their work ok so every field has slightly different component markers that are common in that particular field and in here they will explain the detail that their data and also the comparison and weakened as a interpret interpretation right and another experiment ratios in this paper is also in this obsession of sick success and I saw its own success and sick day is also sake if Pearman tourists rose and they also said mention about a patent matters component and they propose a synthesis flow element in ABC and in here they will talk about a collaboration and also the github pattern and so in the table tree and in here they will very clear they talk about compare ring to unknowns and is it for most of the case with a wee bit of comparison component ok so again here you have mostly comparison you don't have much interpretation because it's built on established theory and you know what to expect you don't need to explain why you're getting the results yes and in this we will go to the collusion of this paper and at the first day we'll summarize what they they are doing in this paper and also they will show the it's fiction of everybody's life at their contribution in their work but they didn't sort of future will in their work all right so it says like they're effective and efficient so again those are help you to recognize their contribution their achievement but this one doesn't show the third of the three sub components [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause]
