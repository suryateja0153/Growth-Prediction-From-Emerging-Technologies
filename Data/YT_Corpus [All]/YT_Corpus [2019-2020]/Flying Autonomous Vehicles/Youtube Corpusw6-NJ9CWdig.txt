 we've probably all daydreamed at some point about what life will be like in the future whether you're optimistic shimmering city's hoverboards and robot assistants or pessimistic pollution it's really advertising a robot overlords well the future won't be quite like any of those it will be dominated by challenges such as climate change their ever increasing population and artificial intelligence the history of autonomous week actually goes back quite far the oldest example where we had auto pilots that's actually airplanes and the first autopilot was already in 1912 where people were using an autopilot in an airplane to stabilize the flight and make it much easier for the pilot to fly the airplane maybe the most exciting right now that's actually self-driving cars in self-driving cars we are not yet really at the full potential of self-driving cars we're not driving completely without drivers there are different levels of autonomy we are actually making big progress with artificial intelligence in these vehicles that will hopefully get us soon to higher levels of autonomy what we need to do is we need to collect tons of datasets images of people in different situations images of pedestrians on the road images maybe of hidden pedestrians behind cars and we need really thousands millions of these images are in train tone examples to train a network to recognize objects on the road of images where something is labeled as a truck or is labeled as a car and if you have only been training on cars and trucks then you will never be able to recognize a bicycle so you will have to provide examples of recognizing a bicycle the whole point is to teach the computers to mimic the computation that happens in the human brain when we do object recognition right because it's very easy to for us to tell if this is a dog or or a cat but it's very difficult to write down the code that actually captures what is a dog and what is a cat traditionally Trust has been among people it's a social phenomenon that relates to how people interact with each other but now that we are looking at the trust between humans and machines then the trust gets a slightly twist in its meaning so for example it has been shown that if people ride that Newton was trained they are more likely to trust the authen was trained and when they ride an autonomous car and interesting it has been shown that if there is a human-like body hand on the steering wheel that could also positively influence the issue of trust although that human body is not going to steer the autonomous vehicle we want to show that if people understand how how they are works in the autonomous vehicle and then they can explain how it works then they are more likely to accept it from a trust point of view usually these cars they have sensors that look all around the car they might have information from other cars that they are sharing so they are much better in detecting some situations where there might be pedestrians on the road or hidden or other cars driving in in a strange way or there is an accident behind the corner it's a little problem with the data on how much they will reduce accidents is that there was one statistics I think which is quite credible which says that it's 40% but then there are ones would say well basically 96 percent of the accidents are based on human errors so self-driving cars can rule out 96 percent of the accident now the advantage is that there are still some people who don't have access to either their own car or maybe they cannot drive themselves for for various reasons maybe because of age or disability and all these people they would have a wider access to individual autonomy by self-driving cars a lot of people perceive AI as something which has its old ideas and emotions and feelings and I can perhaps show initiative in situations that it has never encountered before have initiatives on their own how to act and this is quite inaccurate at least at the level of AI that that we have today I think the current perception of AI is really much influenced by the media by science fiction movies they think AI has its own intention it does what it wants to do basically and also at a certain moment it may basically go beyond the human capabilities and then rule over human beings it's nothing but an algorithm that looks at the past examples and based on that makes a decision AI does nothing but what you have programmed and in that sense it's not magic when it comes to autonomous vehicles making sure that they are safe and also we can explain why they are safe to the public that also can contribute enormously to the issue of trust
