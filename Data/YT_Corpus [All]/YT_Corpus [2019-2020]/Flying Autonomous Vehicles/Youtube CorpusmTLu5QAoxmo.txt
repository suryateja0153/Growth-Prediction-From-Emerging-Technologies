 staying in high-tech gadgets what will cars be like in the future there has been speculation for years now that flying cars could be one possibility in fact what was once considered science fiction is close to becoming science fact the market is expects to be worth hundreds of billions of dollars in the next 20 years and global tech giants have already begun the race to lead the industry South Korean researchers are in the mix as well our young jung-min reports this moving computer graphic shows what it would be like when a personal air vehicle slice across the urban sky a local aerospace research institute is working with automobile companies aircraft manufacturers and universities to develop these flying cars we have successfully manufactured and tested light aircraft using our own designs and technology over the last five years based on our know-how we are currently participating in the personal air vehicle project flying cars take off and land vertically using tail rotors they will not only be capable of flying but driving on their roads as well low speed models can speed by at up to 100 km/h while high speed ones can fly as fast as 200 kilometers per hour south korean technology is competitive for high speed models because we have been developing till Trotters since 2002 through years of studies we've developed improved tiltrotor technology Korea also has a strong IT infrastructure which helps provide services for flying cars the advanced vehicle requires new technology such as slider batteries new energy sources and self-driving technology as well as solving technical issues such as making lighter flying cars experts say it is equally important to make detailed safety rules for them another part which is very important is regulating the traffic's some vehicles may fly right near or above land was some you know the vehicles may go up above that so there might be some strong as of road for these vehicles so we have to make you know quite precise regulations to make these vehicles freely flow experts differ on exactly when these cars will be fully commercialized but many expected to be around by 2040 morgan stanley forecasts the market to grow to 1.5 trillion dollars by then global tech giants including the US France and Germany have already started developing flying cars and will compete with South Korea to lead the future market in Germany Arirang news
