 welcome to NCDOT now I'm Lauren Hamlin this week were turning up the heat on summer safety by looking at ways to keep you and your family safe as things warm up first up did you know that in 2018 52 children died from heatstroke in cars either because they were left or became trapped more than half of these cases were because an adult forgot about the child in the back seat to help avoid this catastrophe put a bag or phone next to the child's car seat so you'll always check the back before leaving the car keep a stuffed animal or momento in your child's car seat when it's empty move it to the front as a visual reminder when your child is in the back seat making a habit of checking your vehicle before getting out could save a life don't forget about your teen drivers as school lets out for summer either the period between Memorial Day and Labor Day is called the 100 deadliest days of summer due to the increase among crashes for teen drivers so what can you do to keep your teen drivers safe educate yourself and your teen about risky driving behavior talk with teens early and often about the dangers of risky driving situations teach by example and minimize behaviors such as speeding or texting on the phone win behind the wheel encourage them to call a parent if they're in a potentially bad driving situation and let them know they'll be picked up without consequences with summer right around the corner people will be taking to the skies in record numbers with their personal drones while the technology is fun it's important to fly safely and legally remember to not fly above 400 feet never fly near airports avoid flying over people or events and always keep the drone within your visual line of sight to register a drone or get more safety tips visit the division of Aviation's website that's all for this week's edition of NCDOT now from all of us here at the North Carolina Department of Transportation safe travels
