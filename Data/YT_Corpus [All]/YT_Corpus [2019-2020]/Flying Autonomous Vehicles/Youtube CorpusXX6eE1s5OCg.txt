 How can we trust that these startups will create a safe vehicle for us to travel in. You know you don't want to be stopping too many times to recharge your battery, so I want to be going from point A to point B in a stretch; so I would actually say the range. I would get in them if it was like tested(X4), and then I don't know, even then I mean it'd be cool to look at, but I don't kind of scary to be honest. How do I know the vehicle is safe when I get in it; meaning if we got in one of these is it like driving up, like flying a plane. You don't know. One of my biggest concerns would be how do I know that the battery wouldn't die; How do I know I wouldn't crash. My concern is about really the people who's living under the space; will they be feeling safe if these vehicles travel above them every day. Well what I'm concerned about is that I don't want a bunch of air traffic noise everywhere I go. Is this really gonna happen in my lifetime?
