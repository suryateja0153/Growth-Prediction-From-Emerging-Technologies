 Today is a historic day here at the Mercedes-Benz Museum. We have shown the first flight of the Volocopter. So a VTOL (=vertical take-off and landing), demonstrating what mobility in the third dimension could look like in the future. The benefit of the Volocopter is adding in this case the third dimension - going through the air in a very uncomplicated way, solving traffic situations, adding a use case for customers that need to get from one point to another in a very short period of time. This is an exciting segment that we think can grow in the next 10 years. I'm absolutely thrilled to be able to showcase the Volocopter to a broader audience to conduct the first ever public flight in Europe. I am very proud of - you know - what my team  has accomplished over eight years. We now feel, we're very close to market introduction of the technology and I think we've really helped a lot to create this emerging industry. The wish of being mobile, to be transported from one place to another has been there with the humanity for ages. And what we are offering over here is what is the next generation of the mobility? This is an autonomous vehicle. It's CO2 neutral. We also want to have more electrification, we also have a fuel cell,  we are also going up in the air with the Volocopter. So what we are trying to do to be the future of mobility is any kind of an idea which one can perceive how the human could be moved from A to B. We are working on all of those ideas over here. Today the people in Stuttgart, in Baden-Württemberg, in Germany  and from anywhere in the world, they can see that very closely to experience. The backing by Daimler first and foremost gives us a lot of credibility, right? There's a lot of projects similar to Volocopter that have similar claims and so on, around the world, that do not have that traction. We know that individual mobility is something very valuable and that this individual mobility needs to become sustainable. The Volocopter is sustainable. It's battery electric driven and if using electricity  from renewable sources, we're talking about the CO2 free flight era.
