 (upbeat music) - Xwing's autoflight system, is really the brain and muscle of the aircraft. It completely replaces what a pilot does. - It does full airspace integration, all the coordination with air traffic control, with other aircraft. - We look to fill the last remaining gap in the transportation network. We think autonomous aviation is gonna revolutionize the way people and goods move around on a regional level. And that's enabled by the technology we develop here at Xwing. (upbeat music)
