 this is the tesla model x it's tesla's highest end vehicle in their entire lineup it seats up to seven adults and is otherwise known as the faberge egg but this specific model x is different you see this specific model x is one of the few to have an early access preview of full self-driving beta and we're going to take a look at it today in a couple of different examples my name's raj and i invite you to join us on this exclusive first look at full self driving beta you'll see in this first example we've just gotten into our vehicle taking it off the driveway engaged autopilot and it proceeds to head down a residential road keep in mind here there is no lane markers there's also vehicles parked on the shoulder and our tesla just breezes right through it going a safe 20 miles per hour in the residential neighborhood it avoids vehicles that are parked on the shoulder it identifies the curb it identifies garbage cans and it follows the road while staying on the right side of the road now as we go up ahead you're going to see that the road is going to turn right and the vehicle it's going to turn right not only is it going to turn right but you'll see that this road has a lane marker it avoids the vans the roto-rooter vans someone's plumbing has taken a hit and the vehicle continues down the road staying to the right side of the road and heads down to the main intersection [Music] now you see that there is a stop sign the vehicle stops at the stop sign stops to observe oncoming traffic pauses waits and proceeds and remains in the right turn lane now this is really cool because it needs to make a left at the light so it proceeds to aggressively change lanes and get to the left turn lane in a safe and efficient manner and stop for the left stop light now notice as the car is waiting at the left stop light the oncoming traffic had a green light it's not getting confused cars continue to go you'll now notice cars pulling up alongside of it cars churning from the opposing lane and all all the tesla is not phased waiting patiently for its light to turn green ah and now our light comes green and you'll see how the tesla turns perfectly into the lane all while obeying traffic laws and signs and lights and what a perfect example of watching the tesla leave a residential area go into the main roads all perfectly now in this example we test summon summon has been around for quite some time but let's just see if this new full self-driving beta has improved summon you'll see the car reverses in a safe manner it proceeds out of the parking space all still under a five mile per hour safe speed you'll see a car crosses right in front of it the tesla stops where it needs to stop checks and proceeds very cautiously as it approaches the business that our owner is waiting at our owner is waiting patiently to be picked up the tesla notices pedestrians and proceeds carefully now the one area that we noticed the smart summon has really excelled at is it remains on the right side of the road waiting for its owner to enter the vehicle and drive it away good job tesla staying on the right side of the parking lot amazing and now for our third example the tesla has just finished at one supercharger and we want to go to another supercharger to meet a friend so it proceeds out of the parking lot to the intersection and stops because there's a stop sign obeying traffic laws is full self-driving's main motto to keep our driver safe after it stops and waits for a car to pass it then proceeds out into the lane and heads down the road now observe how our faberge egg heads down the road obeying speed obeying lane markings walls being safe observing curbs cars oncoming traffic one thing to also recognize is that our driver is maintaining hand on the steering wheel and being ready to take over at any time now here our tesla arrives at the intersection ready to make a right turn [Music] it will wait and pause as a car passes on its right and the car in front of it moves up it proceeds to move over to the right turning lane at a very very busy intersection proceeds up to the intersection with caution and observes oncoming traffic now there are quite a few cars as it inches forward it's peaking it's peaking to see what cars are coming how many are coming and calculating when it will be safe to merge into traffic it's creeping a little bit more it's getting a feel for it gauging when it'll be right making many calculations per second per millisecond finds the right time lets the cars pass and find its opportunity to merge into the lane into a safe manner and continues down the road you'll see the curbs marked on the right-hand side they're highlighting in red our driver is continuously maintaining hand on the steering wheel and it comes to a stop amongst the sea of regular combustion engines of people manually driving while this faberge egg it drives itself [Music] now while we're waiting here i thought let me call out a couple of key pointers all of the examples that you're gonna see in this video had zero zero interruptions that means at no time did we have to take control of the steering wheel at no time did we have to take control of acceleration or braking it was all done with zero interruptions a true fully autonomous beta test ah yes our faberge egg is getting excited to finally move from this long wait at this intersection light and you'll see it moves amongst the sea of cars no one to know any different that this egg drives itself [Music] we're in a 40 mile per hour zone it's completely aware of the motorcyclists the cars the lanes the shoulder the bike lane the curbs it actually just merged into the middle lane because it was more efficient [Music] all while cruising through traffic lights intersections you'll see it even identifies the median it's amazing what this computer can see do and navigate as it sails down the road at the speed limit mind you 40 miles per hour not one mile over safety is the computer's number one concern now you'll see we are approaching closer to our destination it's coming up on the map there we're still maintaining 40 miles per hour sailing through intersections streets stopping when we need to stop even with this split in the road here our egg knows to continue straight and not veer to the right it even can see as you'll notice when we drive through this light you'll see the lane marking on the ground for the bike path because it can see that it's got vision it's got eyes it's got cameras it can see it all more eyes than us humans have this computer is one observant puppy allows the vehicle in front of it to pull into its parking lot and as we approach closer to the supercharger it knows where the entrance to the supercharger is so it knows it needs to make a right here now what i want to call out is this full self-driving preview is takes you from point a to point b it is not a door-to-door software it's not going to take you to door to door but it's going to take you to your destination and this is just an example of that it won't pull into the supercharger but it brings you to the supercharger you'll need to pull in and you'll need to park yourself but it brought you from point a the previous supercharger to point b the supercharger that you're meeting your friend at all keeping you safe and getting you there efficiently look at that look at this egg go and look right there on the right hand side you'll see the rest of our tesla friends all charging at the supercharger waiting for us to meet them there hello there friends nice to see you again you didn't think we were done now did you no i've got one more little surprise for you one more i think you'd find interesting a roundabout you ready for this one hold on to your butts you'll see our little egg here is approaching a roundabout you can see it on the map and as it approaches the roundabout what is this a human a human is coming the way but we're safe we observe the human and we proceed cautiously as we turn around the roundabout all on our own and make a left turn all while straightening out and proceeding down the road yes yes my friends the tesla full self-driving can handle roundabouts what what well hopefully you guys all enjoyed that wonderful series of a great examples of our faberge egg experiencing full self-driving beta for the first time hopefully these examples helped show you some of the feature sets of what this new software can do remember if you like this video hit that thumbs up button it's how people find it and remember to like share and subscribe and i'll catch you guys next time who knows where our faberge egg or another vehicle might take us in the world of autonomous driving with tesla's full self-driving beta preview thank you egg and thank you guys for tuning in until next time i'll catch you guys next time i'll catch you guys later see ya you
