 Thank You Kate Thank You Kate good morning everybody glad everybody's awake let's dive in I've 45 minutes I want to share with you what I think is a view that for me makes me excited to wake up in the morning we are living during one of the most extraordinary times ever in human history I don't think there's a more exciting time ever to be alive it's a time when every one of us if we stop and think about it have access to the tools to change the world there's never been a time where individuals have access to more information more bandwidth more capital more computational power and really the ability to find a problem and solve a problem and that creates for an extraordinary vision of the future it's also true that I think none of us really understand how fast the world is changing and for a lot of people that's scary but if you have a sense of where the trends are going if you understand the dynamics of where technologies are converging it's really an extraordinary period of opportunity so let's dive in this is the situation today we have faster cheaper computers that are the oxygen in the room the foundation or the growth medium upon which all these other exponential technologies are growing computation sensors networks AI robotics 3d printing synthetic biology augmented virtual reality blockchain all these technologies are getting faster and faster as our computational speeds are accelerating and it used to be that if you were running a company in any one of these or if you're an entrepreneur building a tech on any one of these that was enough but today it isn't it's really the combination of two three or four of these that are creating these converging new business models that is really where the excitement is where the action is where in fact for me the greatest wealth is gonna be created and I think about the notion that we're gonna create more wealth in the next 10 years then we have the entire past century we're also gonna transform every industry every business and I think that's inherent in the fact that that technology is accelerating we're seeing all of these forces accelerating the rate at which technology is accelerating it's no longer just increasing slowly its increasing at a rate that is not really possible for our brains to understand see the challenges our brains 100 billion neurons in our brains 100 trillion synaptic connections that make up everything we've ever known and and learned our brains evolved on the savannahs of Africa hundreds of thousands and millions of years ago and our brains evolved for that situation that was a situation where everything was local and linear nothing affected you that was not within the day's walk nothing changed you know century to century millennium to milleniums our brains are local and linear pattern recognition machines but today the world is anything but that right today the world is global and exponential something happens in India or China it you know you hear about it seconds later computers in about a microseconds later things are not changing century to century or decade to decade they're changing year to year and month to month and so if you were to graph it looks like this is redlined it's all of us it's our shareholders it's our board members it's our kids we have not had a hardware software upgrade in two million years since the prefrontal cortex came into existence but the technology that you're building that you're investing in that you're using is here right all of these technologies are doubling on 12 to 24 months centers and the difference between us linear thinkers and this exponential tech is either disruptive stress or opportunity depending on your point of view and so let's look at a few examples in my second book bold I talked about and open up with the story of Kodak and it's an important story so Kodak in 1996 at the top of it right 28 billion dollar market cap 140,000 employees what most people don't know what I didn't know before I did the research was that it was 21 years earlier when a guy named Steven Sasson in Kodak's labs had come up with a digital camera you know the first digital camera about the size of a small toaster took point zero 1 megapixel images in black and white on a tape drive and when Stephen walks into the boardroom of Kodak and goes here it is the future of Kodak of course what happens they say you're kidding me that's a toy for kids where Kodak we make beautiful high-resolution images and then there was the killer where they said besides we're in the paper and chemicals business and I would posit that Kodak was not in paper and chemicals business their mission from George Eastman was to preserve people's memories and they didn't hop on the first mover advantage they have they didn't hop on the new technology to enable that massively transformative purpose and a few decades later Kodak was bankrupt in the same year another company who's in the business of preserving people's memories a company called Instagram gets acquired by Facebook for a billion dollars with 13 employees and people laughed at that acquisition prices and what a waste of money right and well today it's worth a hundred billion dollars on their balance sheet and this is what it looks like when a linear technology hops off a cliff that yellow line is is film and we see this massive uptake as you jump on to an exponential tech right we see one point six trillion happy pics a couple years ago here's another example you guys all remember a blockbuster right so to two parts of the story the first is when Reed Hastings starts Netflix in 1999 we see this linear growth period when these DVDs are going out via mail and then Netflix hops onto a broadband exponential tech and when you hop on such an exponential growth curve you see this right from 2 billion 250 billion dollars over eight years now the challenge is that Netflix in late 2008 for the second time chose not to buy I'm sorry blockbuster for the second time in 2008 chose not to buy Netflix and when you go back to the earnings call in that moment in time this is what you hear she at Netflix is not even on the radar screen in terms of competition I mean how much more wrong could you be and the challenge is when as a CEO as an executive and a company you defend your position versus questioning your position and don't hop on to the next technology to be able to deliver your purpose to your consumers it's deadly so what we're seeing is this how fast can things change you've seen these numbers want to put them on one chart for you here's all the retail companies back in 2006 down at the bottom is that small little online book retailer called Amazon at 17 billion and if you'd gone to these CEOs and say listen this company's going to eat your lunch they would laugh right but ten years later the numbers are dramatic - ninety percent - seventy percent plus three thousand percent and now Amazon is bouncing between 800 billion and a trillion what we're seeing is a time where we're going from I've got an idea - I run a billion dollar company faster than any time ever in human history so my friend Chad Hurley starts youtube on his credit cards and sells it to Google for 1.65 billion dollars 18 months later right there's no way to explain goober and lifto attitude antennae to Avis or Hertz right and why didn't all the hotel companies in the world come up with air B&B part of the challenge is going to be what questions are you asking did anyone at Hilton or Hyatt and it kind of will ever ask the question hey how do we double the number of rooms we have without spending a dollar of capex we'll talk about the fact that it's the questions you ask as an executive and a leader that are far more important than what you know so check out this I charge on the far left is 2011 each of these logos are unicorns a billion dollar startups on the far right as 2015 and all want you to see here is the frequency at which billion dollar startups are emerging and it's not that any of these companies or executives are smarter than any of us here in the room it's that they are able to experiment and try crazy ideas more frequently than being inside the context of a large organization so let me share something I think is one of the most important ideas I've ever learned which is the day before something is truly a breakthrough it's a crazy idea right if it was not a crazy idea the day before it wouldn't be a breakthrough would be an expected linear improvement so I asked where inside organizations are you trying crazy ideas are you hearing crazy didn't say let's run the experiment let's look at the data so what we're seeing right now is exponential growth and I ask the question what does it feel like you know all of us are linear thinkers I have two eight-year-old boys I talked to them about this you know 30 linear steps 1 2 3 4 5 I'm thirty meters away I'm midway through the first part of this audience if I go 30 exponential steps again what the brain is not wired for write a simple doubling 1 2 4 8 16 32 in 30 doublings I'm not 30 meters away I'm a billion meters away put differently I've gone there on a plan at 26 times and that's difference between us linear thinkers and the growth of our technology exponentially is what is disrupting companies over and over again so of course all of this today is riding on top of Moore's Law here is Gordon Moore in 1965 he publishes a very famous paper he says for the last seven years we've been seeing the number of transistors on a piece of silicon roughly double every 12 to 18 months and it's likely to continue its continued for 50 years and we've given it the name of Moore's law and would give you a visualization of what that looks like right this 1958 was the first integrated circuit here's two transistors about a centimeter size each fast forward to Intel's first commercial product in 1971 about $1 per trans 2,300 transistors now let's fast forward to their top-of-the-line today the core i9 seven billion transistors less than a millionth of a penny each right and this is a twenty seven billion fold price performance increase and it's this kind of massive you know transformation of computational power that is driven today's explosion of tech but it's hard to think about what's 27 billion fold better let me give you another visualization of what this looks like back in 1956 this was a five megabyte hard drive and if you happen to have your cargo airline you can move it from office to office 120,000 dollars shipping not included now we notice when this happened right now this is 25 times more memory for a thousand times cheaper 128 megabytes for 99 bucks but did we notice when this happened right when nine years later right on schedule it's a thousand times more memory for the same price and of course it's not stopping here right now it's a terabyte for something that you can lose in your pocket my co-founder of single our University Ray Kurzweil and I are advisors investors and the company whose mission it is you know using nanotechnology to put Google's data centers on the sugar cube right this is not slowing down and so this 10 trillion full improvement is not something that we as as individuals really grok we can't think exponentially what we can do is reset this is now possible this is now possible this is now possible so this is computation over time over a hundred and ten years from Ray's book The Singularity is near and if you continue this forward what you get is the following by 2023 four years from now the average thousand dollars is now buying you the computational power of the human brain 10 to the 16 cycles per second and 25 years later now $1,000 is buying you the computational power of the entire human race right now your kids homework gets really easy so I think about this I think about the notion that whatever were digitizing and all of us here are in the business of digitizing products and services enters a period of slow deceptive growth right that first digital cameras point 0 1 then point 0 2 then point 0 4 megapixels it all looked like zero and then all of a sudden 30 doublings later the film cameras gone it's disrupting and ultimately what we see is dematerialization de monetization and democratization and I would say that every one of us here in the room is in this business let me slow this down this is dematerialization that the fact that 20 years later all of these things fit in your pocket they're ones and zeros and the cost of replication is marginally zero the cost of transmission is marginally zero and as you D materialize your de monetizing new products and services are getting cheaper and more available and at the same time we're democratizing right being able to no longer serve just your city just your town just your nation you can serve the world so I think about the fact that technology is taking what used to be scarce and making an abundant itsu as the story of my first book and it was a realization that hey what do we think of is truly scarce and aren't isn't this all changing let me give you one of my favorite examples there is a company that a friend of mine runs in the Bay Area called the diamond foundry now De Beers and every jewelry company would have you believe that diamonds are extraordinarily scarce and of course natural diamonds have some level of scarcity but the diamond foundry is a machine about the size of a refrigerator in one end comes water methane and electricity out the other end comes perfect diamonds three carats four carats five carats how big would you like it seven eight nine carats would you like imperfections in it you can add that would you like some color no problem now I want to show you what a true diamond ring looks like coming off of their machines right so we're heading towards a world all of a sudden that things were preconceived as scarce are becoming abundant it was not too long ago high-bandwidth Communications was something that was massively expensive remember when I my internet bills for broadband back in 2000 from Akamai were like you know my single one expense today it's you know millions of fold cheaper and the benefit is that everybody gets to build businesses on top of that so what would you think of as scarce energy water health care learning you know time money resource expertise energies not we used to go kill wells on the ocean to get whale oil to light our nights then we ravaged mountainsides for coal then we drilled kilometres under the ocean floor for oil today we're living in a world that's bathed in 6000 times more energy from the Sun than we consume as a species and the price per kilowatt hour of solar is plummeting right we'll talk about some of these let's start with of course what we're here to talk about which is communications we're heading towards a world where everyone everywhere is always connected at low cost right 5g 80 that's the enabler it's the kudzu growing around the planet always on always connected a hundred times faster at the same time what we're seeing is an explosion of global satellite networks that are going to be deploying around the planet to give me coverage in the Himalayas the Gobi Desert but the implications are the important part right in 2017 half the world was connected 3.8 billion people in the next five to seven years we're about to connect every single human on the planet not like I came online at 9600 baud right we're connecting four billion new minds at gigabit connection speeds with access to quantum computing on the cloud if they want with accessed ability to spin up a thousand processor cores on the cloud with the ability to to manufacture on the cloud these four billion minds are all going to want everything delivered to them digitally on their mobile devices finance insurance healthcare education all of these things and so what are these four billion new minds going to want what are they going to create more than you desire they represent 10 of trillions of dollars flowing into the global economy and for me these four billion Minds that are about to come online they're all entrepreneurs in the past to survive in the future to create and solve problems I think that this inflection of global connectivity connecting those minds to the cloud is going to create a massive uptick in the rate of innovation and it's not just everybody right it's everything being connected my friends at Cisco talked about 20 billion connected devices next year a trillion sensors let's go to 2030 with a half a trillion to connected devices and 100 trillion sensors you know we're seeing this estimate of six trillion dollars for IOT by 2025 so what I find interesting though is this we're about to head to a world where everything is being sensed all the time everywhere hundreds and thousands of satellites in orbit millions of drones in the atmosphere every autonomous car generating 750 megabits of data per second as it's going down the road augmented reality you know you're magically for hololens glass is looking forward and seeing things in millimeter resolution we're heading towards a world where you're going to be able to know anything you want anytime you want anywhere you want you can ask any question so imagine if you would that if you're the fashion business in the future you want to know hey what is the average spectral color of a man's blazer on Madison Avenue you can ask that question and the sensors are there to image it and your AI is there to to process it and give you that answer and then say hey there's a correlate with any kind of an advertising campaign in the last 30 days so I would pause it as I teach my kids and I'm in the boardrooms and companies I'm saying it's more important the questions you ask not what you know because we're heading towards a world in which we had this trillion sensor economy where you can start to get answers to crazy questions and drive new business models that were not possible before all right let's talk about transportation so something I'm very excited about is the future transportation of course this is the first autonomous Prius that Sebastian Thrun at Google built Larry Sergey and Eric and and the question is how fast autonomous car is gonna change our lives when they're going to come in and transform how we live and where we work well there's a great analogy if we go back to the past century this is the Year 1904 and if you looked in the streets of New York there's about 10% there two cars in the photograph here about a 10% penetration of bespoke expensive automobiles if you fast forward just 13 years from 1904 to 1917 this is what it looks like the horse and buggy is gone right and now interestingly enough 1904 if you read what it was like back in the early 1900s New York City's streets stank from horse manure and her urine that was the pollutant of that transportation day and then this technology called cars came along and displaced that pollutant so the question is when are we gonna see in how fast might we see the transition from driven human driven cars to autonomous cars well this is how fast the transition occurred in 1908 the first mass production car called the Model T came online by 1912 there were more cars than horse and buggies it was fast then something is 10 times cheaper ten times better ten times easier people switch so of course we're seeing massive investments by a multitude of different companies from way Mowatt and Tesla and cruise into autonomous cars and the future in my mind of an autonomous car looks like this we're sitting at breakfast with your kids or your wife or your husband and you get up and you walk towards the front door to go and go to your meeting you're AI knows your schedule it sees you walking to the front door it's had two autonomous cars circling the block as you open the door one pulls in front of you you have your aura ring sleep data and your AI knows you didn't sleep well last night so it pulled a car up with a bed in the back right the world is becoming automaticall for you it's automatic and magical it's responding to your needs before you know you need and now of course because you've sold your car some time ago you can convert your garage into the spare bedroom your driveway into rose garden whatever you want but more importantly it's transforming how and where we live and work we're seeing massive investments going on in China just came back there with the government is investing in cities and autonomous car programs to really drive the data collection but it's not just autonomous cars we're seeing it's also flying cars right we're seeing about almost a hundred startups in the Evi tall electric vertical takeoff and landing we're seeing the majors from Airbus and Bell which change name from Bell Helicopter to Bell and Boeing and Embree Air and you know about a billion dollars a year going into these vertical takeoff and landing capabilities and ubers uber elevate program is going to be in testing here in Dallas and in LA in 2021 operations hopefully in 2023 but all of a sudden it unlocks the value of real estate I live in Santa Monica where the real estate value is really expensive you know ten miles that way by the crow flying is Topanga Canyon I can buy three times the house but it can be an hour-and-a-half drive but there's lots of room to land one of these vehicles so we're gonna see a transformation with virtual reality augmented reality flying cars you know autonomous cars in the entire real estate marketplace the insurance marketplace a lot of changes coming another big area is of course meta trends of human robot collaboration let's take a look at where robotics are today this is a a friend's company Boston Dynamics this is the Atlas robot and what we're seeing here is you know amazing capability Marc raybert has been building better and better robots but what's really transforming this is not the machine it's machine learning it's the ability for the robot to be driven by effectively neural nets that mimic how the human gets long that was 2018 here is 2019 this is Atlas with some new tricks and of course this is owned by masses on that south bank Japan is going to need robots for its elderly population it's gonna need robots for manufacturing robots for taking care of people robots to you know really displace a missing workforce Saddam so this comes out of Google brain and this is a demonstration of what machine learning and neural nets look like actively so each one of these robots is making an attempt to go and pick something up and every time it fails it says okay that doesn't work every time it succeeds it reinforces a neural pathway to learn better now the beautiful thing about this is as those robots are linked together every time one robot learns they all learn it's as if you know you were back in eighth grade algebra and the kid in the front row learned algebra first and all of a sudden the entire class knows algebra right so this is what we're you know what we're gonna see is that literally it's not just teaching one robot one autonomous car at a time it's teaching the entire operating system that's supporting every single flying vehicle driving vehicle out there and of course AI and I'm sure you've spoken at length I love this quote from sundar the CEO of Google artificial intelligence could have more profound implications for humanity electricity or fire and I believe that is true I want to share with you one video that I think is one of the most telling videos and I share it with every audience because it's important so deep mind one of alphabets companies when a google's company's backed about two years ago beat Lisa Dahl in the game of Go it was predicted that go would be won in the late 2020s it was won a decade earlier by a a I and I want you to listen so alphago was the name of their AI that won against Lisa Dahl three games four games to one and I think gave them that game so it didn't seem too threatening personally and listen to what their new AI called alphago zero is able to do and how it does it really important let's play that video when we played against Lisa doll we actually had a system that had been trained on human data on all of the millions of games that have been played by human experts we eventually found a new algorithm a much more elegant approach to the whole system instead of learning from human data at learned from its own games and that became a project which we called alpha zero zero meaning having zero humanoids in the loop the next stage was to make it more general so that it could play any two-player game not just go but things like chess and shogi which is Japanese chess and in fact any kind of two-player perfect formation game what we discovered was that actually this exceeded all of our expectations alpha zero could start in the morning playing completely randomly and then by team be superhuman level by dinner it would be the strongest chess entity there's ever been after about eight or nine hours it was strong enough to be able to go out and defeat stockfish the incumbent world champion a program which was vastly stronger than deep blue their program which had previously defeated Kasparov learning without any human data learning by playing within the rules against itself that every time it elevated it played against itself so the question is what else is gameplay the insurance market the investment market the real estate market where are we gonna see AI coming in now the advantage here that we have as humans is in collaboration with AI right whenever you play an AI against a human the AI may win in a lot of these games when you play an AI and a human and team against an AI the team wins I love this example I think this came out of Columbia to AI program called la geeks and what they did is they trained this program to review agreements contracts and so they took a contract that had a number of flaws in it known flaws and they gave it to the AI and said analyze his contract and they gave it to a team of analyze his contract and here are the results the humans took 92 minutes and got 85% accuracy the AI took 26 26 seconds and got 94% accuracy let's talk about augmented intelligence one of the most important things that a nation or a company can do is increase the intelligence of its workforce there's nothing more important by 2021 AI augmentation is a three trillion dollar and a six billion dollar productivity savings so we all remember Jarvis from Ironman Jarvis is that AI augmented reality combination that is able to provide Ironman just in time information literally answer questions integrate information and deliver it to your visual cortex just at the moment that you need it and of course we're seeing amazing investments going on with Microsoft and magically my friends and magiclip are doing an amazing job Apple Google all of these companies and the question is how is this going to transform the world right for me it's about future training is not necessarily going through four years of medical school and eight years of internship and residency it's being able to be given the information you need at the moment you need it just in time and it's going to be the flexibility of the ability of the person to learn as they need so here's another example of human machine augmentation I run the XPrize foundation we've launched about 200 million dollars in X prizes launching another 200 million dollars in competitions this is an X Prize we launched funded by All Nippon Airways it's called the Avatar XPrize we ask teams to build a robotic avatar that you as a human can occupy I want you imagine in the future where I'm not here in Dallas I'm back home in Santa Monica and my pajamas it because it's you know it's 6 a.m. in the morning there and I have got a magically ped set on I've got a a a augmented bodysuit and as I walk around that avatar walks around as I see through its eyes to you you see me I feel like I'm here and you feel like I'm here and for us this is going to be the early days of disaster relief and health assistance we have over a hundred companies registered working on this competition from 15 countries and its ability of not only democratizing but de localizing ourselves and the ultimate augmentation of intelligence is happening here so we're seeing again about a billion dollars a year going into connecting the neocortex of your head and your brain to the cloud so Colonel won't know if any of you saw the the webinar done by Elon from neural link back about two months ago or so open-water Facebook Google all of these companies so it turns out that our hundred billion neurons in our brain we can't grow any more brain tissue right we are we are basically landlocked by the birth canal and our brain played a trick a few million years ago of getting these neural folds to increase the amount of neural cortex in our brain but that's ended but just the same way that my my my phone here goes out to the ATT Cloud to the edge of the cloud to process complex information and brings back the answer to my phone that's what we're gonna be doing with the brain so the prediction that neural link had they said there in primates right now they're going to be in human testing by the end of 2020 their projection is going to be a two gigabit connection speed from the you know the motor and sensory cortex of the brain out to the cloud initially for people with cervical fractures who are locked in who can't sense or control anything but this is just the beginning right this was a Time magazine cover my friend Ray Kurzweil has a set of predictions he's made he's got in being an 87 percent accuracy rate if you google it on Wikipedia and this prediction for when we're going to create high bandwidth connections between the neocortex and the cloud is 20:35 so the question is what happens to our society into our world when my you know my broadband 18t connection is not just from my device it's from my brain I think things are gonna change in an interesting fashion all right the last subject I want to cover here is an important meta trend I think for all of us which is that we're heading towards a world in which we're gonna double the human lifespan again so it used to be that as humans a hundred thousand years ago we would go into puberty at age 13 and by the time we were 13 we were having a child and by the time we were 26 our kid was having a kid and in that moment in time before there was McDonald's in the whole food when when food was scarce the worst thing you could do for the perpetuation of the species was to take food out of your grandchildren's mouth so as we look at it we see that in fact the human body was never truly designed to live past age 30 but we've changed that and my mission is how do we make a hundred years old than you 60 and there are billions of dollars per year going into extending the healthy human lifespan healthcare today is really secure right but we're heading towards a future of healthcare now three of the companies I've started the companies I'm investing supporting there's about 600 or so longevity companies a different stage of financing out there let's talk a little bit about what they're doing and how they're gonna transform our lives because at the end of the day having a population of individuals that are growing healthier and living longer is going to affect every single business here so one of the companies that I'll share with you is called human longevity and their product is called the health nucleus you go for three hours and you're digitized your entire genome all 3.2 billion letters are a sequenced your microbiome your metabolomic metabolites full body MRI brain vasculature brain MRI coronary CT lung CT 150 gigabytes of data in three hours downloaded about you and then that is of course fed into the machine learning data mining database now here's the challenge this is more data than any human physician could ever understand and all of us are optimists thinking about how we're doing but the reality is every single person is always developing cancers we are developing cancers all the time our immune system is there to knock them out in the very beginning and when the immune system fails that's when we develop a cancer so here are the results this used to be $25,000 a visit it's now about six thousand dollars a visit or though it's de monetizing and this is from the first 1,200 patients now these were all wealthy individuals who can afford a $25,000 visit here are the numbers 2% of those individuals 2 out of 100 had a cancer high grade cancer didn't know about - had a brain or it a or tech aneurysm that know about alright three and a half percent had a significant cardiac condition they didn't know about we're all optimists right I'm a pilot I fly a couple of airplanes when I get in my plane I don't take off until I know everything is you know green and ready to go for most of us we have no true idea what's going in inside our bodies right so the bottom result here was that 14.4% of these individuals had life-saving findings coming out of this exam and so we're heading towards a world where medicine was retroactive and the only time you went to the hospital is when you had that problem and guess what that problem didn't start that morning it's been going on for months or years but we're gonna transform medicine into a proactive personalized and predictive where you catch disease at stage zero when it's the most solvable here's another area that's going on it turns out that if you look at that chart right this is age along the bottom and this is stem cell populations we exhaust our stem cells and our stem cells are our regenerative engine of our body it's what goes and fixes broken tissues neural connective musculature whatever it might be but if you see we exhaust our stem cell populations by the time we're into our early to mid-30s so there are a number of companies today focused on how do we replenish your stem cell populations one company that that I love is using placental derived stem cells right placentas are the 3d printers that manufacture the baby here's another company as a friend of mine Martine Rothblatt she runs a four billion dollar pharma company in the space of lungs and she is working on 3d printing lungs so this is cartilage 3d printed into a lung scaffolding that is then put into a stem cell bath to regrow the ovl eye for the lung you can see a close-up there it turns out that our cells in our body can replicate 50 times it's called the hayflick limit at the end of 50 replications three things happen number one they should die to make room for new cells to come or number two sometimes they turn into cancers because they lose their limitations and replication and a lot of times they become senile cells they hang out and they just put out inflammatory factors so there are a number of companies this is one called unity Biosciences it was backed by Jeff Bezos in which they're discovering these syn oolitic medicines medicines that will go and find the senile cells in your body and kill them and make room for new cells to grow and what we're seeing at least in animal models in some human testing right now is a 30% increase in lifespan this is another friend this is Osman Kumar from a company called Sami Med in San Diego it's a twelve billion dollar private company you've never heard about and their technology is called the wint pathway W and T pathway cell to cell communication and what they have in phase 1 phase 2 phase 3 clinical trials is nothing short of miraculous it's what gives them a twelve billion dollar valuation as a private company without revenues as a company they have a hold on stopping eight different cancers and deadness tracks Alzheimer's getting rid of wrinkles regrowing hair it is extraordinary I'll close on on this book called lifespan that's just came out from a friend of mine David Sinclair who heads longevity at Harvard's one of the best books I've read in the last decade if you're looking for a great book lifespan is amazing David has put forward what he considers the information theory of aging that in fact there is a part of our genome called the sirtuin system that has two functions one part is it has to regulate what genes are on in your body the other part is it corrects DNA damage and as we age the the nad that powers that system is reduced and the sirtuin system becomes less effective so we can no longer regulate and repair at the same time and that's what he believes and is showing right now is why we age David takes the position I agree with him that aging is a disease and that we can not only slow aging or stop aging he believes we can reverse aging so I want you to imagine the following I want you to imagine that in the next 10 to 20 years we're gonna add another 10 to 20 years unto your lifespan how does that change the way you think and by the way during these 10 or 20 years technology doesn't stop we're seeing this massive increase in how AI and quantum computing and sensors and networks and CRISPR and gene therapy and CRISPR caste and all of those things are going to transform our ability to understand why whales and sharks and turtles can live four or five hundred seven hundred years and why we don't so I would posit that we are truly living in an extraordinary time I'll end on these few thoughts a negative mindset will never give you a positive life I'll remind you what I said in the beginning that we are living during the most extraordinary time ever in human history as I teach at singularity University and abundance 360 the world's biggest problems with world's biggest business opportunities want to become a billionaire help a billion people that's the world we're living in we're living in a time that is extraordinary and I'll close by saying don't blink it's moving fast thank you if you'd like a copy these slides you can just send a email to keynote at Diamandis my
