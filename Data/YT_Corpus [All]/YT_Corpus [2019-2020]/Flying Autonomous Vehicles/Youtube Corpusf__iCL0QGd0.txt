 tesla is going totally berserk increasing the  range of all their car models while even reducing   the price of the model s so why suddenly this new  pricing strategy might it have something to do   with the pricing revelation of the entry model  lucid air and of course we have to give you the   latest update on tesla gigafactory construction  all around the world and was the germans cut   off the water supply from giga berlin then waymo  is opening its driverless service to the public   in phoenix and volocopter's air taxi will take  part in air rescue field testing and then we'd   like to talk about a company which aims to build  cheap and powerful molten salt nuclear reactors   which could provide lots of clean and cheap  energy a lot to talk about as always so stay tuned okay it's time to spread FUD again FUD standing  for fear uncertainty and doubt this is what the   idiotic mainstream news media has been doing with  tesla since day one and they're trying it time   and time again this time because tesla has been  lowering the prices of their cars yeah certainly   tesla just had the best quarter in their entire  history despite a giant global pandemic if anyone   has declining sales it's all other car makers and  tesla is actually the only one with rising sales   really the only one worldwide anyways the pricing  of the base model s has been reduced from seventy   one thousand nine hundred and ninety to sixty  nine thousand four hundred and twenty dollars   sixty nine thousand four hundred and twenty  being a quite funny number this is of course   not a coincidence because lucid just unveiled  the starting price of the lucid air which is now   priced to start at 69 900 after a 7 500 us dollars  federal tax credit the tesla model s starting   price is by the way before incentives the stats of  both cars are really comparable the base model s   coming in at 402 miles of epa rated range the base  lucid air coming in with 406 miles of projected   range intonation on projected we have to say that  we really like the lucid air and it's indeed the   first worthy challenger of the tesla model s ever  but the tesla model s still has a giant advantage   namely you can buy it right now like really right  now but for the lucid air you still have to wait   until spring 2021 and you know that lucid has not  yet started mass production of the air so delays   are possible but still we have to say that it's  quite impressive of lucid to basically make elon drop the price of the model s much to our dismay  by the way because with that pricing we could have   bought a model s for the price which we paid for  our model 3 performance when we bought it one and   a half years ago we of course were overzealous  and bought the model 3 when it came to germany   but now the model s is so cheap that with the  added german ev incentives we'd have a model s   for a lower price it's a bit brutal but that's  life if one buys tesla one must know that we   are still early adopters and by buying a tesla now  you help future tesla owners to get cheaper teslas   thereby you actually help mainstream electric  car adoption and you are doing a good deed for   humanity anyways tesla's pricing strategy shows  how insanely flexible they are with their prices   tesla is continuously dropping prices of all its  models the model 3 standard range plus for example   is now not so far away anymore from the famous $35 000 price which elon said the model 3 would start   at back in 2016. the model y starts at 49 990 and  the model x starts at 79 990. because tesla has   the best profit margins in the whole electric car  sector since they were the first ones to closely   cooperate with battery manufacturers such as  panasonic with in-house battery production and are   now even starting to build their own batteries and  are just continuously innovating on every front   thus they can reduce their prices at will and  still make good profit this is very very different   from other car makers who have very low profit  margins if they have profit margins at all on   their electric cars thus tesla can react flexibly  with their pricing to any potential challenger   such as now happened with the lucid air  which gives tesla an insane advantage   over its competition we are very sure that lucid  can't just drop the price of their cars randomly   because they just don't have the volume  production yet and also not tesla's profit margins   and please consider subscribing to our channel  because we are probably the only ones on youtube   who regularly do news updates on both electric  cars and space flight we know that's a bit weird   but we are interested in both so thank you very  much for your support tesla is also continuing   to increase the range of all their cars the tesla  model x now got a range increase from 351 miles   to 371 miles and the model x performance even more  from 305 to 341 miles just like that the model 3   also got a range increase with the long range  version now reaching 353 miles which is quite an   insane range for a price of $46 990 and the model  3 performance now stands at 315 miles of range   this was achieved by using a new heating pump thus  making the tesla model 3 more energy efficient   and it now even comes with chrome delete a  new center console and freaking cool looking   uber turbine wheels of course the model y also  received a slight range increase and the model s   performance received the most impressive increase  it's all nicely summarized on this table here   by rob mauer at tesla daily so yes tesla really  has the highest flexibility and continues to   improve their electric cars while making them  cheaper at the same time this is freaking awesome   still on the topic of tesla we know that giga  shanghai is finished so nothing to report   there we are basically all just waiting  for more model Y production to ramp up   it's only a matter of weeks now at giga texas  or tera texas in the latest drone shots from   Joe Tegtmeyer thanks as always for these  amazing shots joe we can see that they have   actually already started to dig out holes for the  pillars while some holes have already been filled   with concrete and steel frame construction has  even begun amazing also beautiful how we can see   the outline and the massive size of the future  factory in this shot here Tobias Lindh meanwhile   shows us in his latest awesome drone video thanks  a lot tobias for these amazing shots as always   how fast giga berlin continues to grow we don't  even know what to say anymore the progress is   crazy fast but suddenly the germans say halt  tesla you work too fast we don't like that   in germany and you haven't paid your water bills  that's why we will now cut you off from the water   or that's what the good old mainstream  news media would want us to believe   that evil tesla just doesn't pay their water  bills this is what supposedly happened last   week on thursday the news media of course were  printing one headline stupider than the other   when in fact an accounting error had caused the  problem and not tesla being evil and not wanting   to pay their bills anyways this shows again the  brutal deterioration of the mainstream news media   it just keeps getting worse and worse in other  news waymo has now opened their self-driving car   service in phoenix arizona to the general  public waymo has a fleet of self-driving   chrysler pacificas which use lidar to scan their  surroundings while this is certainly impressive   we should not forget that these cars can only  drive in areas that have been mapped before so   you couldn't just take one of these cars and  let it drive for example in new york city very   much in contrast to the tesla robotaxi service  where elon said that the full self-driving beta   will be rolled out to select testers this week  tesla's robotaxi service will probably brutally   disrupt waymo but still we think it's nonetheless  cool to be able to drive around in phoenix   without driver meanwhile volocopter a german air  taxi company has conducted a feasibility study   which came to the conclusion that the volocopter air taxi would be ideal to be used as   an emergency air rescue vehicle the focus of  the study by charitable air rescue service   ADAC Luftrettung and sponsored by the non-profit  adac foundation was to determine if rescue   services could be improved by using multicopters  to quickly transport emergency doctors in rescue   scenarios though intended to work alongside  existing fleet of air rescue helicopters electric   multi-rotor flyers could lead to more efficient  use of helicopters in the future they could for   example be used to transport emergency doctors  for onsite treatment in the majority of cases   while helicopters could be reserved for patient  transport and only deployed if needed real   operational testing of the volocopter air taxi for  such a scenario is now set to start in germany in   2023 now to something completely different you  know that we often talk about renewable energy   on this channel because we think that fossil fuels  are really not the best idea and transitioning to   sustainable transport in the form of electric cars  and renewable energy in the form of solar and wind   are really good ideas because emitting gigantic  amounts of co2 into the atmosphere might be   you know a bit dangerous and might lead to some  unwanted or unforeseen side effects which might be   difficult to control in the future we even talked  about fusion reactors sometimes which will also   enable us to create giant amounts of energy but  what we mentioned only once in an earlier video   this one here are molten salt reactors in that  video we explained how molten salt reactors work   the short version is that instead of water as a  coolant here you have a molten salt that takes   over the role of coolant and also acts as fuel and  the cool thing is it would act as a fission source   thereby self-regulating itself and thus a  dangerous water overheating and explosion   could not occur of course there are still quite  a few design challenges to overcome until we   can have mainstream molten salt reactors for  example the corrosivity of hot salts is a problem   and the changing chemical composition of the  salt as it is transmuted by reactor radiation   nonetheless the company elysium industries is  working on a molten chloride salt fast reactor   short mcsfr so what is so cool about this type of  reactor well it can consume spent nuclear waste   and weapons waste and then transform it into  useful energy the reactor can create up to   1200 megawatts of usable electric power which  is not bad considering that mcsfr would leave no   radioactive waste products nay  in fact it would clean up the   waste of standard design nuclear reactors  molten salt reactors should get more love   especially elysium's design because nuclear  is not instantly evil as some would want us   to believe mcsfr reactors could become a viable  additional energy source in the near future   while at the same time ridding us of nuclear waste  so we can see that tesla is expanding like crazy   and they might actually even build a gigafactory  in india about which we talk in this video here   and don't forget our first ever live stream on  sunday you can get all your questions answered so   thanks as always for watching the js disruption  report and then i would say on 2 the future
