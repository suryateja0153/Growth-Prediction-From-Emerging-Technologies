 on Monday we analyzed the possible implications of this global crisis for SpaceX and now we of course want to do the same for Tesla astonishingly it seems that the crisis will not delay works on the Giga Berlin in China the general health situation is improving again and Tesla has actually sold by far more cars in February than any other electric car manufacturer there then Tesla is already busy investigating possible locations for their future cybertruck and Model Y Gigafactory apart from electric cars we'd also like to talk about another interesting future industry sector which will become extremely important in the next decades geo engineering specifically carbon capture last but not least another driverless delivery robot is undergoing tests now this time in Michigan quite a lot to talk about today so stay tuned so in our monday's space report which you can by the way watch right here we talked about our assessment of the current global crisis situation and what implications it could have on the future development of starship now we want to do the same for Tesla how will Tesla be affected by this spreading global pandemic amazingly the current crisis doesn't seem to strongly affect works on Giga Berlin even though tesla has recalled around 30 of its employees back to the US last week because of the rapidly spreading virus and the travel ban work on Giga berlin is progressing further according to the german magazine Zeit Brandenburg's minister Jörg Steinbach says that the building of the gigafactory will still start in mid-april of course such construction work is one of the branches not so strongly affected by the virus because normally the construction workers are quite far away from each other so we might actually really see giga berlin progress as intended the current plan is still to have gigafactory 4 finished by mid 2021 and production start around summer 2021 however we do think that the global supply chain will be affected by the virus and tesla even though being very well vertically integrated is still in need of some parts from different suppliers for building their cars for example in the Fremont factory or the Giga Nevada or for the solar roofs at the Giga Factory in Buffalo or of course at Giga Shanghai there will be an impact of this crisis on the supply chain but of course also on the purchasing power of the people themselves in times of crisis people just don't buy as many cars as normally right but apparently a lot of toilet paper humans not so smart after all in times of crises so some companies might face bankruptcy because of the crisis leading to people losing their jobs thus reducing the purchasing power and so on therefore we suspect that the Tesla sales number which we estimated it to be over five hundred thousand possibly even six hundred thousand cars in 2020 now probably won't reach such high values anymore if Tesla manages to sell 500,000 cars this year it would be already an insane achievement but even four hundred and fifty thousand would still be excellent considering the global market situation however don't worry because we think this crisis will not have long lasting implications on Tesla Tesla will still grow exponentially in the coming years the current situation just leaving a dip in sales numbers for 2020 and maybe 2021 after that we will see a return to the exponential growth trend meanwhile in China things are looking already quite a lot better now for Tesla even during the height of the virus crisis there Tesla was able to sell three thousand and nine hundred Model 3s in February that is 50% more than the largest Chinese electric car manufacturer BYD was able to sell the other brands weren't even able to sell half as many cars as Tesla so much for the famous demand problem what of course contributed to the good sales is the way a Tesla can be bought by online ordering which turns out to be quite excellent under current circumstances where people shouldn't leave their homes therefore despite the health crisis in China in February Tesla was still able to sell quite a few Model 3s and these numbers are of course bound to improve with the number of new infections going down towards zero still on the topic of Tesla Elon teased via a Twitter poll the possibility of a Giga factory in Texas which the vast majority of people thought was an excellent idea now it appears that Tesla is already actively scouting for location for the new future Gigafactory in the central us so it appears that not only Texas is very high on the list of possible candidate states but Tesla is apparently also eyeing Tennessee according to TechCrunch Tesla is currently negotiating with officials in Nashville Tennessee ah Nashville the home of country music we sincerely hope that someone will drive through downtown Nashville in a cybertruck windows down listening with volume cranked up to Johnny Cash or Waylon Jennings if you guys won't do it we certainly will on our future cybertruck road trip anyways the reason why the Nashville area might be interesting for Tesla is of course that other EV makers are also located in the area Nissan for example builds the leaf in Smyrna and Volkswagen is currently expanding their plant in Chattanooga to build electric cars for the US market why the hell does every city in Tennessee sound so cool Elon wrote in an email to the Wall Street Journal incentives play a role but so do logistics costs access to a large workforce with a wide range of talents and quality of life also Tennessee would be nearer to the East Coast which might also be a point of consideration because apart from cybertruck the gigafactory will also produce model Ys for the US East Coast states so we of course are very curious to find out which state then will ultimately be chosen for the future Tesla Gigafactory now let's talk about an emerging industry sector which in our opinion will play a gigantic role in the next decades until not long ago this sector absolutely didn't exist at all we are talking about the nascent field of geoengineering on Wikipedia we can read climate engineering or climate intervention commonly referred to as geoengineering is the deliberate and large-scale intervention in the Earth's climate system usually with the aim of mitigating the adverse effects of global warming since we by now all know with five sigma confidence level that earth is indeed warming very fast in fact extremely fast as this animation based on NASA climate observations shows it's probably an excellent idea to counteract the effects of the increasing temperature here on earth now this is every time a controversial topic and we find it fascinating how emotional many people can get when talking about climate change we ourselves always look at scientific journals and scientific data and when the global scientific community arrives at the conclusion in many independently peer-reviewed journals that the likelihood that we humans created this warming effect is 1 million to one then we tend to believe this as long as no other data is available to prove the contrary people also often say but but Earth's has warmed up before too and currently we're anyways in a quite cold era in Earth's climate history to that we say well yes you are right earth underwent giant climate cycles in the past with wildly varying temperatures we can reconstruct nicely by how much the temperature actually changed back then the last time when the temperature on earth rose so fast was around 250 million years ago where a gigantic chain of volcanic eruptions in today's Siberia the famous Siberian traps led to a rise in the global temperature by 8 degrees Celsius within a time span of some 10,000 years and as we know this led to the largest mass extinction ever the so called permian-triassic extinction event where 96% of all marine species and 70% of all terrestrial vertebrate species became extinct now whether you think global warming is man-made or not or whether you like to call it bad or not doesn't matter because what we can agree upon is that it wouldn't be very smart if the global temperature rise would exceed 2 degrees Celsius now why is 2 degrees Celsius an important turning point well turns out that 250 million years ago when the Siberian traps erupted the carbon dioxide which was released only led to a rise of the global temperature by three degrees Celsius at first but what happened afterwards was the real disaster the giant methane hydrate reserves buried deep within the permafrost in the soil and in the sea floor was then released because above a certain temperature threshold methane hydrate releases methane in gaseous form and methane is a 30 times yes 30 times more powerful greenhouse gas than co2 and that's when things really started going south 250 million years ago this methane hydrate release led to another 5 degrees Celsius of temperature rise leading to the total of 8 degrees Celsius therefore we really don't want to try to find out what happens if we reach 3 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels scientists around the world concluded that it would be extremely smart to limit the temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius maximum in order not to get too near to the methane runaway greenhouse danger territory and we now are already at 1 degree Celsius warmer than in pre-industrial times and global carbon dioxide emissions are still insanely high with around 33 gigatons emitted per year yes Giga meaning billion so 33 billion metric tons of co2 emitted into the atmosphere each and every year as we see on this chart here by the International Energy Association at least the emissions started to stagnate that is already something but still the concentration of co2 is now at 410 parts per million compared to 280 parts per million before the Industrial Revolution we can measure these values very very accurately by the way and reconstruct them from ice core samples from the Antarctic or Greenland to find how much the co2 concentration has increased in the last thousands of years so we can really measure this stuff this is not some wild guessing so in order to stay under the 2 degrees Celsius target Elon is of course helping by shifting our whole economy to a sustainable transport with Tesla's electric cars but also with giant buffer batteries that make electricity generation with wind and solar energy perfectly viable now so transitioning away from fossil fuel power generation and fossil fuel cars to renewable energy creation and electric cars and hopefully someday also electrically powered ships and airplanes is one part of solving the problem but unfortunately this won't happen overnight and it will take quite a few decades until we see the emissions in this chart here go lower and lower towards zero it might be as late as 2050 where we can see global co2 emissions below 10 gigatons per year so until then we're going to continue to pump out co2 like maniacs so even with our shift to electric cars and renewable energies this might not be fast enough this is now where climate or geoengineering comes into play turns out there are actually quite a few companies already thinking about this stuff and coming up with brilliant engineering solutions how to slow down or hopefully even reverse the growing amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere Climeworks is such a company we will put the link to their home page and YouTube channel into the description what they are doing and yes they are already doing this is to set up co2 capturing machines all around the world they already have quite a few such machines in Switzerland and Iceland in order to capture co2 from the atmosphere the captured co2 is then pumped into the ground into carbonate rock formations where the co2 then reacts with the rock and turns into solid carbon all the co2 we emit into the atmosphere came from below the ground yes dead dinosaurs and dead plants from millions of years ago turned into oil and coal respectively which were buried deep in the ground and which we released into the atmosphere like idiots thanks nature really thanks a lot so Climeworks is just reversing this process which totally makes sense and what is even cooler the captured carbon can be sold and used for other industry applications such as for the beverage industry or for greenhouses because we all know that plants need co2 by the way the argument that co2 is awesome because plants need it to live is only valid if actually enough plants exist to absorb all the co2 but we emit giant amounts of co2 while destroying rainforests at the same time so less trees to absorb more co2 this argument would only hold if we would plant billions upon billions of new trees which we apparently don't instead we burn rainforests again like idiots anyways Climeworks is one of the first companies in this new sector of geoengineering we are extremely happy to see geoengineering companies emerge and we will do our part to not only promote such companies but also to support them okay next topic there exist driverless delivery robots driving around in Michigan you were surprised about that one admit it admit it okay let's try that change of topics again you know that we like to investigate and talk about all disruptive technology trends not only electric cars and as we know automated drones will be a huge market which is already now growing insanely fast we talked for example about the Nuro R2 driverless delivery robot in this video here which soon will undergo trial runs in some American cities such as Houston and here's another one from the company Refraction AI called the REV-1 or Rev one it's currently being tested in Ann Arbor Michigan as we see in these shots here it can be loaded up with around 80 pounds or 40 kilograms of groceries medicine and other items has an operational radius of one mile or 1.6 kilometers the top speed of 12 miles per hour or 20 kilometers per hour and is fully autonomous and we currently can see impressively during this virus crisis that autonomy can also be a boon in China for example groceries and medicine are delivered with autonomous airborne drones but also with driverless delivery robots therefore such driverless delivery robots can come in very handy in times of such crises now we predict that by the late 2020s you will see such driverless delivery robots roaming around in almost every city around the globe now you might say this is brutal and unfair towards the poor delivery workers they will all lose their jobs now admittedly automation does destroy some jobs but what people then forget is it also creates many new ones do you for example remember the cool jobs of Lamplighter or ice cutter or switchboard operator well they don't exist anymore but many new ones were created in their place so yeah automation will happen and it's not only Bane as we can see in the current crisis but also boon helping humanity through this dark time and also creating many new jobs in the process and on top giving us cool-looking driverless futuristic robots which have been promised to us since decades now in sci-fi movies the future really is now so what do you think about the impact of the current global health crisis on electric cars and on Tesla do you agree with us that this will only lead to a small dent in Tesla's sales numbers and Tesla will recover pretty fast and what do you say to Climeworks carbon capture idea I mean this is a genius idea right so now you have just watched the JS disruption report where we talk about the latest developments on electric cars renewables and other amazing new techs on every Wednesday so then I would say see you next time and on to the future
