 one day when we no longer need to actually drive our cars what might that mean to the design of the interior of the cars KPIX 5s Devin feely went to check out plans from one Bay Area company so if in the future people no longer have the responsibility of actually driving cars themselves it begs the question what are you going to do with all of that extra time and how could you redesign and reimagine the inside of the car to do it I push go and the ride begins from the outside it looks a little like a Star Trek shuttlecraft for the cupholders well only a ring of light and then when you put a cup on it then it drops down but it's the inside that is revved up the imaginations of Engineers at gang fin a Chinese company that hopes to reimagine what the inside of a car looks and works like in an age of autonomous automobiles but the experience inside is what makes you say wow I really like this ride or it was convenient or I could work and we think that's where the opportunity lies their prototype is packed with features some whimsical like an interactive LED screen on the inside of the roof and some that are deeply practical like front seats that rotate 180 degrees and minus the steering wheel gas pedal and break the cabin is almost cavernous compared to a conventional car the big paradigm shift is when you combine the autonomous drive with that mobility services model right so you don't own the car anymore you're not buying one car to do everything that you need in your whole lifetime this is the second generation of the design an earlier model demoed for KPIX reporter Kid Joe two years ago still followed the basic blueprint of a traditional car but even then the roadmap was clear the steering wheel folded away the seats rotated or slid backwards like a recliner but the question then is now is when will the technology finally be ready and when it is will the public be ready to embrace it we think there's again a huge opportunity inside to create something unique the company is still in the prototype phase but they hope that as autonomous technology becomes more and more widespread that they will partner with some of those makers to get cars like this out on the road in Sunnyvale Devin feely KPIX 5
