 [Music] this vehicle that you see in the background is our reference and scenario gathering unit it is equipped with radar sensors with camera sensors and the high-definition GPS that allows us to create an virtual 360-degree view around the vehicle to collect the data to create a virtual world and this will be used to validate and verify autonomous driving functionalities [Music] we will start here and three to soften and then we will extend the radius who will go out to Germany all over Germany we will gathering data in Europe and around the globe at the end [Music] you can learn about the behavior of other participants in the traffic of road users and you can use them for your virtual simulation and virtual verification and validation of your autonomous driving systems the scenarios are gathered with this vehicle and we are using them in a time-lapsed manner so we can do a lot of kilometers per day more than you would be able to do in a real car [Music] we need to gather all the data from all traffic scenarios that you can imagine around the flow because if we want to develop an autonomous system we need to know all these different scenarios that can happen in the world [Music] you
