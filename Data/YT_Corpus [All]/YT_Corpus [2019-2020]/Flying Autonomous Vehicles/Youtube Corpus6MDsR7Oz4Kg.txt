 three years from now we can get in one of these and go to our next destination that's right wow that's pretty soon yeah we like to say it's closer than you think what we think is that when when we launched in 2023 it's gonna start at something like uber black pricing on a per seat basis and so we think it's a shared product kind of fundamentally shared products we're thinking about it on a per seed basis and so we'll be able to launch into a black pricing and then by applying the power of the uber network the demand that we can generate and a kind of the operational efficiency that we're doing behind the scenes we think we can get to over acts like pricing on a per seat basis within a couple of years I've really gotta optimize in the network and eventually we think with mass production and when ultimately the economy's so that when they become self piloted we'll be able to get to something that's pretty competitive with car ownership so you could conceivably fly every day in a more rational way than driving every day that's our hope that's our North Star how long will it take for this to go from being piloted by a person to fully autonomous it's a really interesting question and that really depends on regulation and so there are a VA shion's a really highly regulated industry and so we have to abide by all the rules and then work with the FAA to figure out how this new type of technology fits into the current rules and so we have a teams that are working on that as well we know that there are certain rules that we'll have to actually change to allow self piloted or autonomous vehicles to to carry passengers and so we're already starting to identify that and understand what are the key learnings that we'd have to gain from the piloted versions of these in order to unlock that future state where we can have even more at lower price points that are self piloted what we want to do is really create a product that just seamlessly connects different modes together so one of the technologies that enable this is electric motors right so the same thing spinach has low the same thing that's in it Hyundai's electric cars that they sell that same technology it enables this type of a vehicle to be built because it lets you kind of redesign it and make it vertical takeoff and landing without one big rotor like a helicopter that's an enabling technology but what it's a bit more subtle is that ride-sharing itself so the technology that powers over is also enabling technology that we believe that this type of a vehicle has to be really works in a shared context so it's works when it's a shared product where we can pool people into the vehicles and move them efficiently around so we can minimize the number of takeoff and landing spots and so to power that we need that technology behind the scenes that weaves the ground leg into the air leg into the ground leg into one seamless trip so that as a person who just wants to take a ride and get somewhere fast you'd have to think about it you can just say well I want to take an uber air and then we provide the car I would matches you within the bursar to get you to get you to the heliport to the Skyport so we and we provide all of the the technology sequencing and behind the scenes to make this just a magical trip and that's really what we're trying to create is just multimodal end-to-end products that happens to save you a whole bunch of time by having an air leg in the middle is this uber air something that anyone any uber customer can use yes so basically this will be a product that shows up in the app just like uber black an uber acts Lewbert in Vegas here this week and yeah anyone will be sucked it so just like in with uber copter right now in New York if you're in the right part of Manhattan any rubric ustomer can access that and take it as long as that if the time is worth more than than the little bit of extra cost associated Hey see news viewers thanks for checking out our YouTube channel subscribe by clicking on that button down here and click on any of the videos over here to watch the latest interviews show highlights and digital exclusives thanks for watching
