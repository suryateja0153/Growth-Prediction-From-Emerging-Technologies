 and welcome back this morning a look at what could be the future of commuter travel I want you to picture drones racing through the sky shuttling people from city to city all the jetsons right it sounds like a sci-fi movie but the technology may be closer than you think and it could make standing in Airport lines a thing of the past this may look like your average drone okay main pensaron but to Greg rule and Peter Schmidt this drone represents the future of air travel more people want to fly which is great you know the airlines have come up with a system that lets people afford it but it concentrates all those people into these airports and you have to wait in line and you're stuck in traffic and it's often so in 2017 the to form transcend air their goal to make air travel faster and easier from city to city like LA to San Francisco or New York to Boston if you work downtown to this hop on this aircraft and go right to the downtown where you want to go rule an entrepreneur an engineer and Schmidt also an engineer and former airline executive came up with this prototype a five passenger vertical takeoff and landing aircraft engineer to land almost anywhere scaled it down to this size so we started with what's called the outer mold line which is the shape the shell of the aircraft and then we scale that down to this size and then we had to make sure that not just the shape but the weight scale down as well so the full-sized aircraft will be 40 feet across from propeller tip to propeller tip 34 feet long and stands nine feet tall and away just under 7,000 pounds so the way about what an SUV ways but it goes a lot faster so it will fly up to four to five miles an hour they say this new technology would cut down city to city travel times by almost 75% and would cost about $300 one-way today transcend air is still very much in its infancy their latest aircraft the VY 400 is their 15th prototype we needed to learn things about the performance of the large-scale aircraft by flying the prototype but we knew to get to a faithful flying prototype we had to learn about design and construction at this scale that was evident during a test flight in December you heard it just goes silent that is the power just killing go ahead entirely oh this is why we have two aircraft [Music] despite this latest setback transcend air says they hope to be operational by 2024 all over the world you're seeing these incredible traffic cams and commute times that are above you know two hours this will be a part of solving that puzzle [Music] you you
