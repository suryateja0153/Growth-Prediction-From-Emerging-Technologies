 Flying has been a pipe dream for humanity since the beginning of time, yet yet it's still reserved for special trips, vacations, or long distance travel As congestion and air pollution wreaks havoc in major cities around the world innovators have looked to the skies for improving the future of mobility EHang, an autonomous aerial vehicle company based in Guangzhou China has developed an urban air mobility ecosystem to tackle this problem. EHang is a company who provides the whole solution for urban air mobility, Which means we produce the vehicle we have the whole ecosystem. The EHang eco system includes three major points The design of the vehicle itself, communication between vehicles and the infrastructure for arrival departure and charging. It recognizes that it isn't the only manufacturer working on this problem and actually believes it could be an advantage to make the landing pads universal to all manufacturers It's too early. this market didn't even exist because of the regulation so now I believe we are all pioneers in this industry and technically, our advantage is that we have the whole ecosystem because we not only think about the vehicle how its flying of autonomously but also how what happened if in the future thousands of drones flying in the same space? We have a solution for it. The vehicle can travel for about 30 minutes before needing a charge depending on the direction and payload among other factors, it has a top speed of a hundred and sixty kilometers an hour. To EHang two of the biggest barriers in the urban air mobility field are acceptance and regulations Normal people, as a human on the ground, you are not always looking into the sky so the acceptance is ok because if we are flying over 200m this vehicle is a small point you don't know it really existed. it depends on the flying attitude, but the higher your flying you cost more money, this is where we need to find a balance
