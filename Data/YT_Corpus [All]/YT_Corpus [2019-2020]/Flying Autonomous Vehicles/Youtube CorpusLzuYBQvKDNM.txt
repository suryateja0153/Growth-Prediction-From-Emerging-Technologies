 this is a scene from the movie star wars flying cars are travelling swiftly across city skyscrapers you may have thought that this is only a science fiction but it is soon becoming our reality and sooner than you may have expected flying cars will come into operations as early as 2020 in Dubai and is expected to start operating in major cities in u.s. like New York and Los Angeles by 2022 and then globally by 2024 there are approximately 100 different flying cars being developed now yet out of these only several of them are considered to be commercially viable so far the most practical and affordable option which is just around the corner from its debut as hexa from lyft hexa is going to launch a personal flight experience shortly and you can book your slot in advance at early bird price of $199 this is a phenomenal price considering that long-distance flying cars can cost up to a million dollars to purchase though the hexa ride will only be about for 15 minutes it will be a practical option if you want to try a flying car ride [Music] another option is fall aqaq der Bala copter 2x is expected to be launched and due by next year as you can see it is actually closer to a helicopter and it can only fly and is not capable in running on grounds like cars but it can land and take off in limited space as it has replaced the huge propellers and helicopters with multiple small propellers there are many flying cars with similar concepts as it is relatively easier to develop not too different from helicopters not quite what you have expected from flying cards well take a look at this one this is pop up from Airbus and this one is a bit closer to the concept of flying car we have in mind if travels by flying like this and when it lands it takes off its propellers and puts in its wheels the reason it is designed like this is to reduce its weight when flying but it comes with the constraints that it requires to stop by the storage that keeps propellers and wheels whenever you switch from flying to driving there are other models under development which are closer to the concept of flying cars but they will still require further technological development the most prominent advantage of flying cars is that I release you from the traffic jam if you are commuting in New York or Los Angeles you may be familiar with agonizing traffic jams which can easily take from one to two hours for simply traveling 10 to 20 miles you can be freed from such pain with flying cars however as you can imagine owning a flying car is not going to be so affordable to most consumers at least in the near future it'll be much more expensive than Ferraris and will likely cost at least a million dollars to purchase so if individuals are unlikely to own flying cars it will be probably operated as taxis and now you may be wondering what difference will it make when there are already helicopter taxis helicopter taxis cost about $9 per mile so more than $200 to travel from Manhattan to JFK Airport according to / it is expected that per month cost of flying cars will be around $6 per miles in the initial stage but it is expected that it will be feasible to drop the cost to $2 per model as technology and infrastructure matures when the price reaches $2 per miles it is actually not so different from normal taxi fares this price issue has a rather significant impact the existing transportation market is segmented by distance and cost and as this matrix shows stops from bicycles cars trains ships and flights and helicopter is an expensive outlier the motor vehicle transportation market can be further segmented into taxi bus etc flying cars are likely to start coming into the picture in the next one or two years and we'll start by occupying a very small segment in helicopter markets but in four years when the price comes down to price levels of taxis it will start eating up the motor vehicle transportation markets and in 10 to 20 years once the battery technology develops further and allows flying cars to travel long distance and will start taking up almost all areas of the transportation market in fact Morgan Stanley and other analysts predict that flying car market will grow up to five billion dollars within the next few years and up to two point nine trillion dollars by 2040 considering that current car market is worth about four trillion dollars this could imply that flying cars will throw up to more than half of the transportation market who would be the winner in this promising markets at the moment aerospace companies such as Airbus and Boeing are market leaders in fact stop price of Airbus and Boeing doubles since flying cars emerged though of course and may not be purely viewed to flying cars these two companies are likely to be ahead of the game also in terms of various infrastructure and regulatory aspects such as application of state of art technology and proactively addressing regulatory constraints placed against flying cars next are the car makers it is expected that flying cars will be mostly autonomous vehicles also known as self-driving cars so the car makers that are ahead in this field would have a competitive edge in particular od is expected to be a leader in the segment as it is one of the leaders in autonomous vehicles and also actively engaged in flying car developments and partnership with Airbus lastly there are a number of flying car startups it is not easy to predict who will be the winner from the segment list and follow copter are ahead of the game in terms of product development Kitty Hawk and opener are supported by Google pair a future by Chinese funds while there is fierce competition going on at this very moment I suspect that two to three of these firms will make it to the leading group outpacing the others as it was the case for most new technologies so if you ask me I'll probably book a place for the $199 flying car right of left hexa for an experience and maybe buy one of Airbus stock each week which cost about $30 per stock bullying is a bit pricey as it goes up to $300 per stock would you like to join me in investing in the future of transportation
