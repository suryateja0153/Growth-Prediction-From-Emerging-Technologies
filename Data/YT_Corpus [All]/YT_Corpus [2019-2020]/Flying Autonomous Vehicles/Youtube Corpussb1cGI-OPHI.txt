   [THEME MUSIC]    HELLO, I’M BOB. WELCOME TO OP-ED.TV. ARE AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES, DRIVERLESS CARS, TRUCKS, BUSES, REALLY THE WAVE OF THE FUTURE? WILL THEY UPEND THE U.S. ECONOMY LIKE NOTHING SINCE THE INVENTION OF THE AUTOMOBILE? WILL HACKERS HAVE A FIELD DAY WITH THESE FULLY COMPUTERIZED MODES OF TRANSPORTATION? LET’S FIND OUT. MY GUEST IS SAM SCHWARTZ. KNOWN AS GRIDLOCK SAM. HE IS A TRAFFIC AND TRANSPORTATION EXPERT. A FORMER NEW YORK CITY TRAFFIC COMMISSIONER. HE NOW RUNS HIS OWN ENGINEERING COMPANY. SAM HAS WRITTEN A PROVOCATIVE NEW BOOK, NO ONE AT THE WHEEL, DRIVERLESS CARS AND THE ROAD OF THE FUTURE. WELCOME.  THANK YOU.  FIRST THINGS FIRST, DID YOU REALLY COME UP WITH A WORD GRIDLOCK?  I WILL TELL YOU THE STORY. IN THE 1970s, I WORKED ON MIDTOWN TRAFFIC. WHEN WE WERE WORKING ON DIFFERENT SCHEMES, WE TALKED ABOUT THE GRID SYSTEM. LOCKING UP. WE NEVER MADE IT INTO ONE WORD. 1980, THE TRANSIT STRIKE, THE FIRST TIME IT WAS EVER IN PRINT. I WROTE AN ANTI-GRIDLOCK PLAN. AND I MADE IT TO WORDS. WITHIN DAYS, THE MEDIA HEARD ABOUT IT. SUDDENLY, IT BECAME A WORD.  THE TWO WORDS TOGETHER.  I RELEASED IT INTO THE LEXICON.  I HAVE BEEN HEARING FUTURISTIC STORIES ABOUT THE WAY WE ARE GOING TO TRAVEL EVER SINCE I WAS A LITTLE KID. MOST OF THESE STORIES NEVER CAME TRUE. NOW, THE STORIES ABOUT DRIVERLESS VEHICLES ARE ALSO KIND OF FANTASTIC. HOW SURE ARE YOU THAT DRIVERLESS VEHICLES WILL BE A DOMINANT FORM OF TRANSPORTATION IN THE REASONABLY NEAR FUTURE? BY REASONABLY I MEAN SAY THE NEXT I DON’T KNOW, 20 OR 30 YEARS?  IF WE ARE LOOKING AT A 30 YEAR HORIZON, IT IS VERY LIKELY THAT THE MAJORITY, IF NOT 90% OF VEHICLES ARE PREDOMINANTLY AUTONOMOUS. AND STILL WILL BE SOME PEOPLE THAT WANT TO DRIVE THEIR OWN VEHICLES, AND IN THE UNITED STATES, THAT IS LIKELY TO BE PERMITTED. THERE ARE OTHER COUNTRIES WHERE IT MAY BE PROHIBITED. IT MIGHT BE SAFER TO ONLY HAVE AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES. YOU WON'T BE ALLOWED TO DRIVE. I PREDICT, I SHOULD PATENT MAKE AMERICA DRIVE AGAIN.  THAT IS INCREDIBLE. UPWARDS OF 90%. THE ISSUE IS THE PROS AND THE CONS. WE ALWAYS HEAR ABOUT SAFETY, IT WILL CUT DOWN ON TRAFFIC DEATHS, YOU WON'T HAVE AS MANY ACCIDENTS. GIVE US A SENSE OF THE MAIN REASON THAT AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES WILL BE GOOD FOR US AND THEN A FEW OF THE REALLY BIG CHALLENGES THAT WE NEED TO LOOK OUT FOR.  THE BEST PART OF IT IS, IT WILL LIKELY REDUCE CRASHES SIGNIFICANTLY. NOT AS MUCH AS THE HYPISTS WOULD LIKE TO SAY, 94%. IT WILL BE A BIG PERCENTAGE, PROBABLY MORE THAN 50%. WHAT THEY ARE NOT TELLING YOU IS THAT THOSE FEATURES THAT THEY PLAN TO PUT INTO AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES, MANY OF THEM ARE ALREADY HERE AND PEOPLE THAT CAN AFFORD IT CAN HAVE BRAKING DEVICES THAT PREVENT FORWARD COLLISIONS. THEY HAVE DEVICES THAT WILL DETECT WHETHER THE VEHICLE ON EITHER SIDE. YOU WILL HAVE WARNING SYSTEMS. WE COULD CUT TRAFFIC DEATHS IN HALF BY 2023 IF WE MANDATED ALL CARS HAVE THESE SAFETY FEATURES. THAT MEANS FEWER PEOPLE DRIVING WHILE INTOXICATED, OR IMPAIRED. WE WILL REDUCE TRAFFIC DEATHS A GREAT DEAL. THAT IS PROBABLY THE LEADING REASON. WE WILL NOT SOLVE THE TRAFFIC PROBLEM, DON'T BELIEVE THAT THAT IS PART OF IT. YOU WILL HEAR PEOPLE SAY WE WILL HAVE AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE TRAINS BECAUSE THEY CAN ALL FOLLOW MORE CLOSELY TOGETHER. THAT IS TRUE, ON A HIGHWAY THEY COULD DO THAT. HERE IN MIDTOWN MANHATTAN, THEY COULD NEVER BE VERY EFFICIENT BECAUSE WE HAVE LOTS OF PEDESTRIANS THAT ARE WALKING, BIKE RIDERS, PEOPLE THAT ARE DOING UNPREDICTABLE THINGS. ON HIGHWAYS, YOU'LL INCREASE THE CAPACITY, YOU MAY ALSO FIND THAT A THIRD OF THE VEHICLES ARE EMPTY. WHAT I CALL ZOMBIE CARS ON THEIR WAY TO PICK UP OR THEY JUST DISCHARGE THE PASSENGER. SAFETY IS THE NUMBER ONE REASON. THE SECOND REASON, TRAFFIC CONGESTION, DON’T BELIEVE IT.  YOU ACTUALLY SAID IN THE BOOK THAT THERE IS A CHANCE THAT THERE WILL BE MORE CARS ON THE ROAD, NOT FEWER IF WE GO TO AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES. WHY IS THAT?  IMAGINE YOU TOOK A CAR HERE EVERY SINGLE DAY, IF YOU ARE IN MIDTOWN MANHATTAN, YOU MAY TELL THE CAR TO PARK ITSELF AND THE CAR COMES BACK TO YOU AND SAYS, BOB IT'S 80$ TO PARK, WHAT SHOULD I DO? GO HOME. THOSE ARE EMPTY MILES. PICK ME UP AT 5:00. THOSE ARE EMPTY MILES. FOR THAT COMMUTE, YOU HAVE DOUBLED THE MILES. YOU ADD THAT TO CHILDREN THAT COULD DRIVE PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES, A WONDERFUL THING FOR PEOPLE. ALL THAT ADDS TRAFFIC. ABOUT 30 MILLION PEOPLE RIGHT NOW THAT CAN’T DRIVE IN AMERICA BECAUSE OF SOME DISABILITY. THERE IS ANOTHER MILLION CAN'T DRIVE BECAUSE OF AGE RESTRICTIONS. SENIORS AND YOUNG PEOPLE. ADD ALL OF THOSE TO CONGESTED ROADS AND YOU HAVE MORE VEHICLES.  INEVITABLY THERE WILL BE GHOST CARS, THESE CARS -- ZOMBIE CARS WITH NO PASSENGERS IN IT. THAT IS A GIVEN. THAT WOULD BE STRANGE.  HOW DO YOU PULL ONE OVER?  LOOK OVER TO THE LEFT, THERE IS NOBODY IN THE VEHICLE. MAYBE A DOG. SOMEBODY IS SENDING THEIR DOG TO HOME. IN THE BOOK YOU MENTION THAT THERE HAVE BEEN STUDIES ON THIS. A LOT OF THE SAFETY FEATURES THAT ARE IN THE TYPES OF CARS THAT WE DRIVE NOW WILL SAVE LIVES, WILL REDUCE ACCIDENTS AND THAT SORT OF THINGS. SOME OF THE STUDIES THAT YOU REFERRED TO SAID THE SAFETY FACTORS IS ALMOST AS GREAT AS WHAT THEY EXPECT FROM AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES. SO, WHY SHOULD WE BE ALL IN ON AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES. IF THERE IS NOT AN ENORMOUS SAFETY BENEFIT, WHAT IS THE BIG MAIN REASON TO WANT TO HAVE THESE CARS?  THE PUBLIC WOULD LIKE TO HAVE VEHICLES THAT ARE AT THEIR BECK-END CALL. YOU HAVE APPS, WITHOUT A DRIVER, THAT IS WHAT IT IS. IF YOU ARE GOING OUT AND DRINKING, IT IS GREAT TO HAVE AN AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE. I THINK IT IS A MISTAKE IF WE FOCUS ON THE PRIVATE AUTOMOBILE. AND SUBSTITUTE AUTONOMOUS FOR THE PRIVATE AUTOMOBILE. THE GREATEST BENEFIT COULD BE IN TRANSIT. TRANSIT, IN 90% OF THIS COUNTRY IS TERRIBLE. IT IS TRANSIT FOR THE POOR AND THEREFORE IT IS POOR TRANSIT. WE CAN ALMOST OVERNIGHT TRIPLE THE AMOUNT OF TRANSIT SERVICE FOR LOW INCOME PEOPLE IN 90% OF THE COUNTRY AT THE SAME COST. BECAUSE YOU DON’T HAVE THE DRIVER, USE SMALL VEHICLES. MAKE THEM FAR MORE RESPONSIVE. TRANSIT WOULD BE THE WAY THAT WE COULD SOLVE A LOT OF OUR TRANSPORTATION PROBLEMS AND ISSUES. I DON’T SEE THAT AS THE FRONT RUNNER.  I WAS JUST GOING TO MENTION, THAT SEEMS TO MAKE SO MUCH SENSE TO ME. YET, I’M NOT STUDYING THIS THE WAY YOU STUDY IT, BUT EVERYTHING I HEAR IS TALK ABOUT DRIVERLESS CARS. INDIVIDUAL CARS. I PRESUME THAT THESE WOULD BE CARS THAT WOULD BE EITHER LEASED OR OWNED BY INDIVIDUALS. WHY NOT MORE OF AN EMPHASIS ON TRANSIT? WHY ISN’T THAT A BIGGER POLICY ISSUE WITH OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS?  I THINK IT IS A HUGE POLICY ISSUE AND OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS SHOULD TACKLE IT AND TACKLE IT NOW. ONE OF THE PROBLEMS IS WASHINGTON. WASHINGTON JUST ISSUED AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES 3.0. IT SAYS, MY INTERPRETATION IS, WHAT IS GOOD FOR AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES IS GOOD FOR AMERICA. IT IS A LAISSEZ-FAIRE, HANDS-OFF. LET THE INDUSTRY DO WHAT IT WOULD LIKE TO DO AND STATES DON’T GET INVOLVED. I FEAR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL DO SOMETHING THAT IT HAS NOT DONE MUCH OF AND THAT IS TAKE OVER BASIC TRAFFIC CONTROL FROM THE STATES. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE STATE OF NEW YORK, CALIFORNIA, ALL STATES BEGIN TO THINK ABOUT THE IMPACTS AND ONE OF THE THINGS I RECOMMEND IS THAT THE AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES BE REQUIRED TO FOLLOW THE RULES AND REGULATIONS OF ANY STATE OR CITY THAT IT IS IN. IN NEW YORK CITY, WE MAY DECIDE THAT WE WANT TO HAVE VEHICLES MOVING NO FASTER THAN 10 MILES PER HOUR ON 5TH AVENUE OR ANY AREAS WHERE WE HAVE PEDESTRIANS. THEY CAN’T GO INTO BIKEWAYS AS WE SAW TERRORISTS DO A YEAR AND A HALF AGO. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE CONTROLS, LOCAL CONTROLS, WE MAY BE PROHIBITED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT UNTIL WE HAVE A NEW ADMINISTRATION.  ONE OF THE THINGS YOU MENTIONED TO ME IS WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE SAFETY ASPECTS OF AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES, YOU ALSO THINK ABOUT HEALTH ISSUES THAT YOU CONNECT THE TWO. CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BIT?  WE FOCUS ON SAFETY AND OVER ONE MILLION PEOPLE, 1.3 MILLION PEOPLE DIE A YEAR WORLDWIDE IN TRAFFIC CRASHES. MORE THAN 5 MILLION PEOPLE DIE FROM INACTIVITY DISEASES. IT IS JUST OVERTAKING SMOKING AS THE BIGGEST KILLER ON THE PLANET. INACTIVITY IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO HOW MUCH TIME ONE SPENDS IN AN AUTOMOBILE. IF WE SPEND MUCH MORE TIME IN AN AUTOMOBILE, BECAUSE IMAGINE THE AUTOMOBILE OF THE FUTURE MIGHT NOT BE THE FRUSTRATION YOU HAVE BEHIND THE WHEEL RIGHT NOW. YOU MAY BE CATCHING AN EXTRA 30 MINUTES OF SLEEP IN IT. YOU MIGHT BE WATCHING YOUR FAVORITE MOVIE. YOU MAY BE WORKING IN IT. YOU MAY HAVE YOUR COFFEE IN IT. -- JUST PUT OUT A YOUTUBE, YOU WAKE UP IN THE MORNING, YOU HAVE YOUR COFFEE IN THE VEHICLE. YOU CONTINUE ON AND DO YOUR WORK BECAUSE IT HAS A GIANT SCREEN. AND THEN YOU HAVE A ROMANTIC DINNER. AND THEN YOU GO TO SLEEP IN YOUR VEHICLE. PEOPLE WILL JUST GET FAR LESS ACTIVITY. WHAT IF WE REDUCE THE CRASHES BY 50%? WE SAVE RATHER THAN A MILLION WE GO DOWN TO FIVE OR 600,000 PEOPLE DYING. WHAT IF 5 MILLION FROM INACTIVITY DEATHS GO TO 7 OR 8 MILLION? ALL DEATHS ARE TRAGIC, BUT AN INACTIVITY DEATH COSTS SOCIETY MORE THAN A TRAFFIC DEATH. A TRAFFIC DEATH TENDS TO BE A SHORT DURATION OF MEDICAL CARE. AN INACTIVITY DEATH TENDS TO BE YEARS OR EVEN DECADES OF MEDICAL CARE TO DEAL WITH.  I WILL MOVE ON FROM THAT ONE. YOU MENTION DRONES. YOU TALK IN THE BOOK ABOUT, IT MADE IT SOUND LIKE DRONES COULD BE UBIQUITOUS. DO YOU EXPECT THAT?  UBER HAS AN APP CALLED UBER ELEVATE. WHILE IT IS NOT OPERATING IN THE U.S., IT IS VERTICAL TAKEOFF AND LIFTING VEHICLE TO COME RIGHT TO THE HEART OF MIDTOWN MANHATTAN AND LAND AND PICK YOU UP AND TAKE YOU OVER THE TRAFFIC. IN DUBAI AND A FEW OTHER PLACES, THEY ARE BEGINNING TO EXPERIMENT WITH IT. WE MAY HAVE MORE AIR TRANSPORTATION, WE MAY HAVE MORE DELIVERIES. I ATTENDED A CONFERENCE AND ONE OF THE MAJOR PIZZA COMPANIES SAID WE WILL DO AUTONOMOUS PIZZA DELIVERIES, WHAT WE HAVE NOT FIGURED OUT YET IS WE CAN GET FROM THE OVEN TO THE FRONT DOOR, BUT HOW DO WE GET THAT PERSON TO COME OUT AND WALK 50 FEET TO GET THE PIZZA? THAT IS THE CHALLENGE. DOES THE DRONE BRING IT ALL THE WAY IN?  MY QUESTION IS HOW IS THIS A GOOD IDEA TO HAVE THE DRONES FLYING OVER US ALL THE TIME AND PUTTING ASIDE THE POSSIBILITY OF AN OPEN VEHICLE BEING LIFTED UP. THERE IS PLENTY OF TALK ABOUT DRONES BEING DELIVERY SYSTEMS. FOR ORGANIZATIONS LIKE AMAZON, SENDING PACKAGES TO YOUR DOOR AND THAT SORT OF THING, IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE WE CAN EXPECT CHAOS IN THE AIR. YOU HAVE THESE DRONES FLYING OVER ALL THE TIME. MANY OF THEM, LOADED WITH PACKAGES, I WOULD ASSUME SOME OF THOSE PACKAGES ARE EXTREMELY HEAVY. INEVITABLY, WHEN YOU HAVE ANY KIND OF THING MOVING AROUND, THERE WILL BE ACCIDENTS. YOU CAN HAVE THESE THINGS FALLING FROM THE SKY. I CAN IMAGINE TELEVISIONS IN A DRONE FALLING DOWN OR AIR CONDITIONER OR SOFAS OR I DON’T KNOW WHAT. HOW IS IT A GOOD IDEA TO HAVE AN AIRBORNE DELIVERY SYSTEM IN THIS COUNTRY?  WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE BEGINNING TO THINK IS HOW DO YOU HAVE A CENTRAL LOCATION WHICH WOULD BE A BLIMP THAT HAS CONTAINERS WORTH OF GOODS AND THEN THE DRONES CAN DELIVER FROM THOSE CONTAINERS. IN DENSE AREAS, FORGET ABOUT IT. I DON’T THINK WE WILL SEE IT, YOU OPEN YOUR WINDOW ON THE 15TH FLOOR OF A HIGH-RISE IN MANHATTAN, YOUR PACKAGE COMES IN. DOES NOT MAKE ANY SENSE. IN SOME LOW-DENSITY AREAS, IT'S EXPENSIVE TO DELIVER PACKAGES, THIS MIGHT BE A MORE EFFICIENT WAY TO DELIVER THOSE PACKAGES. A LOT HAS TO BE PROVEN. THINGS DO FALL OUT OF THE SKY. IN NEW YORK CITY WE'RE USED TO HAVE HELICOPTERS ATOP BUILDINGS AND THEN --  I COVERED THE HELICOPTER CRASH.  THINGS DO FALL FROM THE SKY WHEN THEY ARE FLYING ABOVE US. I WAS SURPRISED TO HEAR THAT THE NEW AMAZON DEVELOPMENT MAY HAVE A HELIPAD FOR JEFF BEZOS. IT HAS BEEN PROHIBITED SINCE THE ACCIDENT.  YOU TALK QUITE A BIT ABOUT AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES AND PEDESTRIANS IN YOUR BOOK. WHAT ARE YOUR CONCERNS?  I AM WORRIED ABOUT THAT. THE AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES HAVE NOT FIGURED OUT WHAT A PEDESTRIAN IS GOING TO DO. IN MANY CITIES, A PEDESTRIAN WALKS UP TO THE PATH OF THE VEHICLES AND STOPS AND WAITS UNTIL THOSE VEHICLES PASS. HOW DOES AN AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE KNOW THAT THAT PERSON IS NOT CONTINUING IN THAT TRAJECTORY? IT DOES NOT. THE AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE, THE FEATURES RIGHT NOW ARE TO DETECT THAT PERSON AND THEN TO START, STOP, START, STOP. EVENTUALLY, THE INDUSTRY WILL SAY THEY ARE USELESS IN URBAN AREAS UNLESS WE DO SOMETHING TO THE PEDESTRIANS. MY FEAR IS THERE HAVE BEEN SOME IDEAS OF THAT HAVE BEEN THROWN OUT AND ONE IS, EVERY PEDESTRIAN IS REQUIRED TO WEAR SOME KIND OF IDENTIFICATION THAT IS DETECTABLE BY THE VEHICLE AND THAT PROVIDES INFORMATION AS TO THE INTENT, I WILL CROSS AND YOU PRESS A BUTTON. YOU CAN THEN CROSS.  SO BECAUSE WE HAVE AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES, PEDESTRIANS WHO HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE VEHICLES WHATSOEVER WOULD BE REQUIRED TO HAVE SOME KIND OF A DEVICE?  SOUNDS CRAZY BUT LET'S GO BACK 110 YEARS AGO. PEDESTRIANS CROSSED ANY WHICH WAY THEY WANTED. LET’S GO BACK 110 YEARS AGO, IF YOU HAD A GUEST OVER HERE TALKING ABOUT WHAT IT’S LIKE TO WALK THE STREETS OF MANHATTAN. AND YOU TOLD THE GUEST IN A FEW YEARS WE WILL SHINE A LIGHT IN YOUR FACE AND IF IT IS THE COLOR RED YOU WILL HAVE TO STOP. IF IT IS THE COLOR GREEN, YOU CAN GO. IT WOULD BE AS OUTRAGEOUS AS WHAT I AM SAYING RIGHT NOW THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE A DEVICE. A LOT OF PEDESTRIANS LED THE CHARGE IN 1910s, 19 20s TO STOP THAT FROM HAPPENING TO CONTROL THE PEDESTRIANS. ULTIMATELY, IT BECAME A CRIMINAL OFFENSE IN ALL 50 STATES TO NOT OBEY THAT READ LIGHT. PEOPLE WERE THROWN IN JAIL.  THEY WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS OUTRAGEOUS. FINALLY SOMETHING THAT IS EVEN BEFORE MY TIME. THE PEDESTRIAN WAS NOT REQUIRED TO HAVE A DEVICE. I THINK IT IS GOING TO BE A LITTLE STRANGE. THAT WOULD INCLUDE KIDS AND OLD PEOPLE AND EVERYBODY ELSE. YOU CAN’T LEAVE THE HOUSE WITHOUT THIS DEVICE. WHAT ABOUT GOOD OLD AMERICAN FREEDOM WHERE YOU CAN JUST GO WHERE YOU WANT WHEN YOU WANT?  PEDESTRIANS HAVE BEEN WALKING FOR CENTURIES. MY OTHER FEAR IS FENCES WILL GO UP AND YOU WILL HAVE CATTLE GATES.  CONGESTION PRICING. CONTROVERSIAL. MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ARE HOPPING ABOARD THIS THING. YOU ARE IN FAVOR OF IT. EXPLAIN HOW IT WOULD WORK AND WHY YOU THINK IT IS IMPORTANT  I WAS JEALOUS OF LONDON WHEN LONDON BEAT NEW YORK TO IT. WHAT HAPPENED IN LONDON IS THEY CREATED A ZONE AND IN THE ZONE YOU GET CHARGED AS YOU ENTER THE ZONE, AS YOU TRAVEL THE ZONE. THE FEE IS OVER 15 POUNDS, MAYBE $18 TODAY. IT REDUCED TRAFFIC BY ABOUT 15%. 85% OF THE PEOPLE CONTINUED TO DRIVE AS THEY ALWAYS DID. YOU MAY SAY THAT IS NOT TERRIBLY MUCH. IT TURNS OUT, IN TRAFFIC SCIENCE, THAT LAST 15% CAUSES A LOT OF TRAFFIC JAMS. TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF VEHICLES YOU GET A TRAFFIC BENEFIT. TIMES HAVE CHANGED. WE HAVE UBER, LYFT, VIA. WE HAVE TO HAVE A SPECIAL CHARGE FOR THEM, WHICH THE LEGISLATURE TRIED TO DO AND NOW THERE IS AN INJUNCTION AGAINST THE UBER AND LYFT.  THANK GOODNESS. WE WILL TALK ABOUT THAT.  WE WILL HAVE TO EVEN MORE ON THAT IF WE WANT TO SOLVE THE TRAFFIC PROBLEM. THE GOVERNOR HAS PUT FORWARD A BUDGET. $1 MILLION FOR CONGESTION PRICING. ONE BILLION COULD BE TURNED INTO $15 BILLION WORTH OF BONDS FOR CAPITAL RECONSTRUCTION. THIS TIME, THE MAJORITY OF NEW YORKERS ARE SUPPORTING IT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A RECENT SIENA POLL.  THE GOAL IS WHAT?  THE GOAL IS TWOFOLD. TO RAISE MONEY FOR THE TRANSIT SYSTEM. THE SECOND GOAL IS TO REDUCE TRAFFIC CONGESTION. TRAFFIC SPEEDS ARE FIVE MILES PER HOUR IN MIDTOWN DURING THE HOLIDAY SEASON. FOUR OR THREE MILES PER HOUR, WE CAN WALK FASTER THAN THAT. THEY HAVE NEVER BEEN THIS SLOW. I HAVE STUDIED TRAFFIC AND FOUND DATA FROM 1915, SLOWEST EVER TODAY.  WON’T ALL THESE INNOVATIONS HURT POORER PEOPLE OR LOWER INCOME PEOPLE MORE THAN THE WEALTHY? WHY SHOULD THE BURDEN OF TRAFFIC CONGESTION AND THE BURDEN OF PAYING FOR MASS TRANSIT FALL DISPROPORTIONATELY ON PEOPLE WHO CANNOT AFFORD IT?  IT IS A GREAT QUESTION. PEOPLE ENTERING MANHATTAN IN A CAR CANNOT AFFORD THE PARKING IF THEY ARE LOW INCOME. THE PARKING IS JUST THAT EXPENSIVE. ON AN ANNUAL BASIS, IT COULD BE AS HIGH AS $8,000. WE DON’T FIND MANY LOW INCOME PEOPLE THAT ARE COMING IN DURING THE BUSINESS DAY. THE COMMUNITY SERVICE SOCIETY, THAT REPRESENTS LOW INCOME NEW YORKERS, THEY'RE BIG SUPPORTERS OF CONGESTION PRICING. THE CITY IS ALSO INTRODUCED HALF FARES FOR LOW INCOME PEOPLE. THEY WILL PAY HALF THE AMOUNT OF OTHERS ON USING THE SUBWAY. NOT TO SAY --  WHEN WILL THAT HAPPEN?  IT IS HAPPENING. THE MAYOR JUST ANNOUNCED ABOUT 30,000 PEOPLE IN THE NEXT MONTH.  THEY COULD NOT GET IT OFF THE GROUND.  I KNOW.  WE KNOW WHAT ULTIMATELY HAPPENS, BOTH THE MASS TRANSIT AND TO THE POOR PEOPLE IN THIS CITY. WE ARE RUNNING OUT OF TIME. THE FINAL POINT IS YOU MENTIONED THE SURCHARGE ON UBER TYPE OF VEHICLES AND TAXICABS. THIS IS ANOTHER $2 TO $2.50, AS SOON AS YOU STEP INTO A CAB OR AN UBER. THEY'RE EXPENSIVE ALREADY. THE MASS TRANSIT SYSTEM IS TERRIBLE. PEOPLE OFTEN HAVE TO TAKE CABS THAT ARE VERY EXPENSIVE EVEN THOUGH THEY DON’T HAVE A LOT OF MONEY, THEY HAVE TO TAKE THEM AT NIGHT IF A LOT OF PEOPLE WORK NIGHTS AND THAT SORT OF THING. HOW CAN ANYBODY JUSTIFY ANOTHER $2 TO $2.50 SURCHARGE? HOW CAN THAT BE JUSTIFIED? IF YOU GO THREE QUARTERS OF A MILE, I TESTED THIS MYSELF, IT WOULD COST YOU ABOUT 11 OR $12 BEFORE THE TIP.  I WOULD SEPARATE THE YELLOW TAXIS AND I DROVE A CAB 50 YEARS AGO IN NEW YORK CITY.  WHEN CABS WERE AFFORDABLE.  EVEN THEN, PEOPLE SAID THEY WERE NOT FOR LOW INCOME PEOPLE. NONETHELESS, I THINK THE LEGISLATURE MADE A MISTAKE IN TREATING YELLOW TAXIS ALMOST THE SAME AS THE FOR HIRE VEHICLES. IT SHOULD BE BASED ON DISTANCE AND TIME, WHICH IS WHAT TAXICAB TRIPS ARE. THE FOR HIRE VEHICLES SHOULD BE CHARGED BASED ON DISTANCE AND TIME AND ALSO THE TIME THEY SPEND IN THE CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT. I DID NOT WANT TO SPEND THE AFTERNOON WITH MY PASSENGER. I WOULD NOT MAKE ANY MONEY. THE CAB DRIVERS ARE NOT MAKING ANY MONEY. THEY ARE LOSING A LOT OF MONEY TO THE FOR HIRE VEHICLES. WE DID NOT THINK THIS THROUGH. NOW THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY WITH THE NEW CONGESTION PRICING PLAN, THE LEGISLATURE HAS TO FIX WHAT IT DID TO THE YELLOWS AND IT HAS TO COME UP WITH A NEW PLAN ON THE FOR HIRE VEHICLES.  THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING IN. I HOPE WE CAN GET YOU BACK HERE AGAIN.  ABSOLUTELY.  WE WILL BE BACK IN A MOMENT WITH A FINAL WORD.    THE MASS MEDIA'S OBSESSION WITH TRUMP NECESSARILY MEANS THAT OTHER IMPORTANT STORIES GET SHORT SHRIFT. MAYBE WE'D PAY ATTENTION TO THE DEVASTATING ONSLAUGHT OF CLIMATE CHANGE EVEN IF TRUMP WERE NOT PRESIDENT. WHAT I DO KNOW IS WE NEED TO PULL OUR HEADS OUT OF THE HOT SAND AND START PAYING ATTENTION BECAUSE PRETTY SOON IT WILL BE TOO LATE. CALIFORNIA, OVER THE PAST YEAR, EXPERIENCED THE MOST SAVAGE AND DEADLY WILDFIRES IN ITS HISTORY. THE FIRES HAVE DRIVEN THE STATES' LARGEST POWER COMPANY INTO BANKRUPTCY. THE EARTH’S OCEANS ARE WARMER THAN THEY HAVE EVER BEEN. CORAL REEFS ARE DYING AT A STAGGERING RATE. THOUSANDS OF THE WORLD’S SPECIES ARE IN DANGER OF EXTINCTION AS OUR SOME ENTIRE ISLAND NATIONS. EACH REPORT WE GET CLIMATE SCIENTISTS IS MORE DIRE THAN THE ONE BEFORE. EACH NEW REPORT AND EACH DIRE WARNING IS MET WITH A COLLECTIVE SHRUG. HERE ARE A FEW RECENT HEADLINES FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES. GLOBAL WARMING IS HELPING TO WIPE OUT COFFEE IN THE WILD. GLACIERS ARE RETREATING. OCEAN WARMING IS ACCELERATING FASTER THAN THOUGHT. U.S. CARBON EMISSIONS SURGED IN 2018 EVEN AS COAL PLANTS CLOSED. THE EVIDENCE IS ALL AROUND US, THE PLANET IS ON FIRE. WHY BOTHER TO PAY ATTENTION? MAYBE IT WILL JUST BURN ITSELF OUT. THAT IS ALL FOR NOW. SEE YOU NEXT TIME.   [THEME MUSIC]
