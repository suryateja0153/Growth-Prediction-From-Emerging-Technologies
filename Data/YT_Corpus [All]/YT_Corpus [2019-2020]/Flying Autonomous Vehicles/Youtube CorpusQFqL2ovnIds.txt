 - Vertical really started in our founder's mind, Stephen Fitzpatrick, when he was coming in to work one day, stuck in traffic and thought "There's got to be a better way than this." (intense music) The thing that's really exciting about urban air mobility, we can really change what our world what our civilization looks like. - Urban air mobility really represents the biggest disruption aviation has seen since the dawn of the jet age in the 1960s. Vertical as a company is founded on the premise of combining the pace and agility of F1 with the rigor of aerospace. We were set up very much with a vision to help with urbanization and electrification of aviation. The fly-by-wire is the brains of the aircraft. It's really central to how this aircraft comes together. Having selected Honeywell for the fly-by-wire control system we saw it as a real opportunity to capitalize on the expertise Honeywell has developed. (intense music) - We are really weight-sensitive on our aircraft. Having these much smaller systems is a real big thing for us. Going to a company with the pedigree that Honeywell does in this area, they'll achieve all the standards and all the safety, integrity levels that we need to hit. Takes that worry off our minds so that we concentrate on actually building the aircraft and making this aircraft work as a complete piece. - Vertical and Honeywell is a really great example of how I think aviation needs to operate going forwards. (intense music) We've always seen that partnership as a real key differentiator to give us de-risked programs, rapid route to market, and the ability to scale. But also to bring in the best possible technologies and the best minds to give us a really competitive product. - I think urban air mobility is gonna change the world. And everyone wants to know about it, everyone's really keen and interested. It just brings this real energy to what we do. (intense music)
