 hello ladies and gentlemen and welcome back to drone the sky yet again and welcome back to part two of our three-part video series involving the dji mavic mini and the dji fly application so today with part two we're going to be focusing on the dji fly application itself all the settings how to use it what it all means and so called hidden features which aren't really hidden just not well known so we're going to get on with that now and i'm going to run you through it so let's go okay so here we are in the initial screen for the dji fly application now when you first start out you'll see this screen once you've connected to your drone and got it set up now with my drone i've got a particular setting i've turned on in which when i connect to my drone i'm taken straight to the drone's camera view as opposed to this view and i'll show you how to do that later but for now we're going to start here so let's start at the top left and we'll rotate around in a clockwise direction explaining all the features so first of all let's go to altitude zone so here we are in altitude zone and basically what altitude zone is as i zoom out here is a google map and it covers restricted areas and no-fly zones and certain other color-coded areas that warn you when you're entering restricted airspace or caution airspace whatever it may be so first of all let's start at the top see where it says wanaroo that's where we're currently located well i'm currently located now if i'm going to click that it's going to show me continents and certain or as it says here popular cities and certain other things now this relates more to a thing called fly spots but you can use it here if you're planning on traveling from your home country to another area for instance if we say africa and algeria it's going to show us a map for algeria in this case and as we zoom out again we can see all the other countries zoom in zoom out but let's go back to australia so here's australia if you look on the bottom left you can see a blue dot that represents my current location within western australia so as we come across to the right in the top right you can see a magnifying glass now that gives us the ability to search for a certain area so you can see my previous searches here let's clear the history let's search for an area let's say sydney and it gives us options let's say sydney and new south wales and there we go it takes us to sydney and new south wales all right now just while we're over sydney we'll zoom out a bit here scroll around okay as i zoom out you can now see that we've got kingsford smith i believe it is international airport with color codes so if we go to the right here where the map legend is you'll see an eye within a circle so if we click that it brings up what the color codes mean so as you can see restricted zones authorized zones and so on and the good part about it it tells you what those zones actually mean so red being the most restricted tells us that highlighted on the map these areas is prohibited geotana unlocking license you have to go through flysafe at dji.com we're going to get onto that in a bit anyway now to the right of each zone there's a switch that goes blue or gray so when it's blue it turns the color on if i turn it off for instance and go back we'll see that the red restricted area is no longer showing there's really no purpose to turn that off unless it's sort of interfering with you on the map but it's good to keep it on so you know if you're getting close to a restricted area so if we go below that it looks like two squares over the top of each other that's the map layers and what that allows you to do if we click it just like google maps we can change it from satellite view to standard view now if we go below that we have a crosshair with a dot we click that it just takes us to our current location wherever we are in the world there we go it shows i'm on neves road in western australia now below that we have a plus and minus that's just the zoom in and zoom out aspect and also we can pinch the screen with two fingers and zoom in and zoom out just like normal google maps now if we go below that it says nearby fly spots and there's zero so there's no nearby fly spots where i'm currently at now there's a reason for that we're going to cover it in a second but don't worry about that for now so to the left of that the top left we have what looks like a triangle with three lines we click that and this is where you'll find a thing called flight plans now it says it's empty at the moment again there's a reason for that as it says choose a new fly spot to add so i'm going to explain that in a second let's get out of that so if we go back and now next to altitude zone we have fly spots let's click that one so fly spots is identical to altitude zone except it's used for a different purpose now what fly spots is is locations that have been tagged by users of a thing called sky pixel which we're going to cover again pretty soon but what sky pixel is is a user community for dji products in this case drones and an individual can go to a location make a fly spot or go into a flight plan and make a fly spot and take photos and what happens is anybody else using this fly spot aspect of the dji fly application can look at their fly spot see there's a picture next to it so they know what that fly spot looks like if they want to go visit that fly spot and i think i've said fly spot many times now but there's one problem with this concept and that is fly spots only work in mainland china they don't work or aren't used anywhere else in the world i don't know why but it seems to be only in mainland china but we'll go through it anyway just in case you visit china or they provide an update in the future where it covers other countries so let's go up the top where it says wanaroo let's click asia and let's go to china so it's taking us to china so we're going to zoom out a bit here so now that we've zoomed out we can see little camera icons all over the map in mainland china these are the fly spots so let's say we go to china and we zoom in and we see this one just here and looks interesting to us so we go okay i want to see what this fly spot is let's click it so we see that this fly spot is i think it's taligao maybe national park or forest park in china now what you've got is where it's located exactly to the right you see add to the flight plan remember we had an empty flight plan before so if i'm now to click this button it's going to add it to my flight plan now if we click navigate here we can select google maps it's going to take me to the actual google map itself and as you can see we can't find a way there that's because we're currently in australia and we're probably not going to be driving over multiple continents and oceans to get there but that's what happens there if you're in china you can actually navigate there using google maps now if we scroll down you'll also see there's more recommended fly spots and they've got a distance so in this case it says 7569 kilometers and again if we click it it's going to allow you to navigate there from wherever you are in mainland china you'll also see next to these recommended fly spots there's images okay so if we go to this one that's uh i think it says county in somewhere i'm going to try and say it if we click on it it shows you another fly spot but more importantly it shows you images taken by sky pixel users of that fly spot so we scroll down here we are here so at this fly spot this is what it looks like so we can scroll across these are all the pictures taken from that fly spot it's obviously a snow field or something now to the left of that again we have the flight plan button we're not going to go there and what looks like a speaker now i haven't got a translator on my phone at the moment but it says policies and regulations now i'm of the belief since i've never used this that whatever's written here relates to that fly spot so possible policies and regulations for that fly spot area in regards to flying drones and local laws and so forth if you do know leave me a comment i don't know i don't speak obviously mandarin or chinese or whatever it may be so that was fly spots we can't actually use it unless we're in mainland china now if we come across to the right where it says mavic mini at the top right we'll see a little book next to it let's click that so what this book is it's a help manual or a manual that relates to whatever drone you're flying at the time okay so see how we've got mavic mini at the top if i click that we can change it to something like a mavic air 2 and there you go the features and information below have changed because it all relates to whatever drone you're flying at the time so i'm going to change it back to mavic mini okay so you'll see we have function tutorials tips flight safety and user manual so we click function tutorials it's going to provide you with video tutorials that relate to basic functions of the mavic mini and advanced functions and you can watch those to get information if you want to know how to use your drone now we have tips and these tips relate to as you can see here photography and flight tips next we have flight safety now this one here isn't really mavic mini specific it sort of relates to any drone really and then we have a good one and i like this one user manual so they've consolidated everything to do with the mavic mini such as release notes what's in a box what's in the fly more combo everything to do with the mini all in one area so you don't have to access the dji website because they've consolidated it within the app and if we go down we have obviously all that again but it's sort of uh non-categorized and in the top right we again have a magnifying glass so we can search for specific things within certain areas now if we go down to the bottom right we'll see go fly so what this button does this takes you through to the camera view for your drone and the control area so we're going to go to that last now if we go left we have profile so this is where your user information is when you log in now when you start using the fly app i'd recommend straight away you log in because not only does it give you all the information but it allows you to actually go above a certain altitude in a certain distance if you're not logged in it's going to limit you to a certain altitude and certain distance for safety reasons because you're not listed within the app so log in straight away so in the top left you can see a profile picture related to me and also my username so if we click it it's going to give you your information so again my account name there's my email my username my gender apparently a male that's good and country or region and you can change your profile image if you want now below that we have some numbers so 4.71 hours 26.5 kilometers 59 flights this is a combined total or aggregate of all your flights you have made with the dji fly application now bear in mind i have two drones the mini and a mavic air ii so this is the combined total of both drones flight data but if we go to more down here we can see that we now have the flight data center so within the flight data center we have every individual flight that we've made with these drones broken down so for instance this one here we the first one 541 meters 20 meters altitude and duration was 10 minutes now i believe the attitude relates to the highest altitude gained at the time of flight if we go to all aircraft we can select which flight logs we want to look at so obviously we have a dji mavic mini there or drone the sky which is my mavic air 2. but let's click the minis one and there you go there's the breakdown of all my mini flights so let's scroll through and let's pick this one here where it says 486 meters distance see to the right we have what looks like miniature google maps but they're blacked out so let's click that for this so what we have here is a flight log in an animation form so see in the bottom left it looks like there's controls for controlling a video well this is a video in essence but an animation of your flight so it's currently running and we can see numbers changing we can see altitudes and distance changing now if we zoom in by pinching you can see that the h represents the home point so where i took off from you can see my drone there is the blue triangle there we go we've got a strong wind warning as well and you can see a green torch and that's the distance sorry that's the direction that my mini's facing we've also got the data at the top right which is gps battery power and duration of flight now if we go to the right we can see that we have what looks like a joystick if we click that it is actually a joystick what it's showing here is what i was doing with my joysticks at the time of flight now if we watch the joysticks we'll see that every once in a while the lines that are protruding from the four sides of the joysticks go blue as we can see here so in this case i'm pushing forward on my joystick to get forward momentum and you'll notice as well the blue lines will either be full or they'll be half or they'll be quarter or they'll be whatever it might be that's because it's telling me how much i'm actually pushing on the joystick at the time so if it's half it means i'm doing a 50 push on that joystick in whatever direction if we turn that off we have h for home point so if i scroll away here maybe i'm looking elsewhere i've flown multiple kilometers away let's say we zoom in here and we say we want to go to our home point we click that it takes us back to home point and again we have layers to change to either satellite or standard map view now if we go to the bottom right we'll see that we have a time date stamp and a bar at the bottom showing the progression of this animation now to the right of our profile here we have dji forum so let's click that so the dji forum is as it states a forum for dji product users so if we go to the menu icon here we can pick what we want to look at within the forum so for instance we can look at things to do with service developer options for the application events coming up products if we go to social it takes us to the social aspect of this forum and here there's users who ask questions provide information say as you can see greatest find or picture my thoughts as a new owner you can get in there it's like a chat room or board sorry a post board so you can ask questions answer questions or get general information so below that we have dji store obviously that's going to take you to the mobile version of the dji store so you can buy products now we have find my drone so if we click that again we're presented with another google map and to the right we have again the legend so we have the home point we have in this case an n with an arrow that's the north point so we want to know which way we're facing the time if we go like this you can see that i'm facing north the blue dot with the triangle pointing outwards and my drain looks to be facing what's that south west by the looks of it so that's just the north point selection let's click that off again we have layers and you can in this case have standard satellite or mixed now below that we have what looks like a set of mountains within a frame if we click that it's going to take us to our drone's camera at the time that we're in this find my drone so there you go there's my drone's camera view now why is that important well obviously this is the find my drone area just like you would have your phone stolen you can find your phone using gps well this allows you to see where your drone is on a map as well as what your drone's looking at at the time that you're trying to find it so if it falls out of the sky lands in a bush or lands upside down doesn't matter because you can have a gps position and also what your drone is seeing so if you're walking around trying to find your drone you happen to see your legs past the camera you know you're in the general vicinity now below that we have start flashing and beeping so what this is when you click this it initiates a sequence in your drone in which it produces a audible tone out of the on-board speaker and also flashes its lights in a particular manner and the reason for that is again if it's a sort of darker conditions or you know you're near your drone but can't quite see it this will give you an audible time to hear and also flashing lights in darker conditions you'll be able to see it flashing away and it looks like this [Music] and also to the left of that we have use other maps again google maps is what we're using it quite possibly will allow you to use things like mapbox or something else but i use google maps and just to the left of that you can see last recorded location so this gives you a bearing or a map bearing to where the drone was last so if you have a secondary phone or you're using google maps you can type in that gps sorry that coordinates and you'll be able to find the last sort of location for where your drone logged in and then you can walk over there and start searching from that area now below and find my drone is settings so in here we have a few options so under aircraft firmware update we have check for firmware updates and check for flysafe database updates so as the firmware update for the aircraft suggests it's going to update the onboard software for your drone we also have check for flysafe database updates now this relates to the geo fencing or geo locations for your drone so remember the map where we had color coded areas for airports and so forth well the updates for the flysafe database adds new or updates areas within those maps so your drone and you know where you can fly and can't fly and bear in mind if it puts a red zone with the update somewhere means your drone will hit that like a fence hence geofence and stop flying so it won't go into a red area now below that we have firmware auto download i've got mine turned on and what it states is when this option is enabled firmware updates will be downloaded automatically over wi-fi so it means you don't have to do it manually but obviously if you're not on wi-fi every once in a while you'll probably have to check it yourself manually to see if you have updates so we go across the left sync flight data mine's currently turned on and basically what it does it auto-syncs flight data to the cloud automatically over wi-fi and you can view it on other devices which means if you log out of one device and log into another one maybe a tablet to fly your drone with your flight logs will come across once you log in now camera view on this is what i was talking about before at the start obviously we started the initial screen that we're talking about now but if you have this turned on what occurs is as soon as you connect to your drone it will take you directly to the drone's control and camera view as opposed to the screen where we have the user manual and the fly spots and the picture of the mavic mini sitting on there so i have mine on because i don't really want to see the main screen every time i start my drone now clear cache so you can see here you're able to clear videos photos music if you have music on there and anything else to do with your drone see how we've got clear aircraft flight record cache so if i was to clear that now all my flight logs would be gone so i just leave that alone it's only using 231 megabytes it's not a big issue for me if it gets too big then i'll delete it now privacy these are settings you can turn on and off this is just data that will go to dji now below that we have unlock geozone so you can see here we've got account unlocking licenses and aircraft unlocking licenses so here is where any licenses you've requested to fly into certain zones will be located and you can see at the bottom there it says go to the dji official website and you can submit an unlocking request for a certain zone so the way it works is i actually won't go onto the website if you want to visit it follow the details below here but if you want to fly into say a red zone which is restricted you need the proper authorization and you need to be able to submit it to dji at which time they'll give you an unlocking license you can also do a thing called self unlocking and that allows you to unlock blue zones and that needs to be done as i said through the official website so if you want to have a look at that follow this link here and have a look around it explains everything on the website of how to unlock certain zones but once you've unlocked it this is where you'll locate that information or request from dji now we have replay beginner guide so at the start when you first fly there'll be a beginner's guide it will show you how to set up your drone and how to fly it everything to do with that once you're done you dismiss it you can get rid of it forever but if for some reason you want to go back and look at it again and it doesn't pop up and it doesn't pop up automatically you simply click on replay beginners guide press ok and now when you start up you're going to get that beginner's guide every time until you dismiss it and to the bottom of that we have log out so i'm obviously logged into my account with my user information you can simply log out here if you want to log in with a different user account maybe your friend has a drone they want to fly your drone they can log in there so their flight records and everything's ready to go so that's profile so let's go to sky pixel okay as i said before sky pixel is a community of dji product users in this case it's where you can submit your drone photography or even something like a osmo photo if you don't have an osmo it's just like a giant gimbal for a mobile phone or it's just a giant gimbal with a camera on it that we can use to take photos and videos but anyway coming back to sky pixel as you can see if we scroll down there's a few options you see popular locations and then you see images with people's names underneath it and there's a thumbs up a comment and a share so it's like a social community where you upload whatever photos you take people can comment on it and so forth that's what sky pixel is and it directly relates to remember we had fly spots in mainland china well it's the same people that use this who put fly spots in mainland china so if we go to the left where we see these three lines for the menu you can see we have home explorer photographers messages blog on and on we go so within explore you can explore all the photos have been uploaded by sky pixel users you can look at photographers so there's particular people who upload a lot of comment content sorry you can search for them see what they've uploaded or if you know the name of a particular photographer you can have a look through there now messages these are messages you get when you upload your photos people might message about certain aspects of it you can read the messages and message back you have a blog in sky pixel if you want to read a blog certain information about possibly dji products or skype pixel changes or anything like that competitions maybe now you have sky pixel creator program so let's click that okay so if you use sky pixel a lot you upload a lot of content you think you're pretty good at what you do you can actually join the creator program and what it allows you to do at the moment obviously applications are closed but you can request to join and basically you get some perks or advantages from submitting as a contributor or creator and the benefits are as we see here get priority testing for dji products stay informed with information exclusive access to custom tasks page so on so forth go down again increased exposure chance to partner with dji social media accounts and blogs free venue rental at a dji flagship store and exclusive coupons for the online store and there you go and it tells you here how to submit an application to become a contributor or creator so i personally am not with sky pixel because my photos look like they've been made by six year old so i don't think i'm good enough to become a contributor or creator just yet so that's sky pixel i recommend you have a look at it even if you're not going to upload photos there's a lot of good content on there i know for a fact there's an image taken by an australian girl i think it was a girl of a school of fish in the shape of a love heart with a shark in it that actually won the drone aerial photo competition in italy i think it was but anyway right so let's come across we have album so as you can see there's nothing here at the moment because i haven't taken any photos or videos so album relates to the photos and videos you've taken on your drone and allows you to view them or download them to your phone in high definition which we're going to cover later anyway but we need photos in there first so that's just what that is at the moment we're going to get back to this in the next part alright so that's the initial screen covered now let's go have a look at the go fly area or the camera controls and functions for the drone alright so here we are on the control area for the drone and straight away we have a beginner flight tutorial now remember in the settings before i turn this back on this is what i was talking about when you first start this gives you a pre flight check or start the preflight check here so if i click it it gives you everything you need to check before you start flying start auto check see so look that's fantastic let's get rid of that we don't need it so there you go that's your pre-start flight check that i was talking about once you dismiss it it's gone unless you go back to settings and start it again all right so let's begin in here we're going to start at the top left yet again and we're going to rotate around so the first thing we've got is p mode so this is just the flight mode that your drone is currently in so if i click it we go to sports mode if i click it again we go to cine smooth mode so that's how you change your flight modes now we have takeoff permitted to the right so that means that my drone on startup has found all the satellites it's ready to go all the calibrations are fine we're ready to fly so it's going to say takeoff permitted now if for some reason you don't get the minimum required amount of satellites it's going to put a message where it says takeoff permitted where flight is not permitted because you haven't got the minimum requirements and you might also get a message saying caution when taking off because you don't have a large amount of satellites therefore it can't pinpoint your location that correctly but you can fly so you'll get that message there you'll also get there a requirement for compass calibration and imu calibration so imu is the inertial measurement unit onboard your drone and what it is is an accelerometer and an inertia sensor hence the imu and what happens is if your drone is out of calibration the message will come there you'll go into settings and you'll calibrate your imu which we're going to cover later and also your compass now bear in mind if your drone's on the ground like mine is at the moment and you pick it up and move it you're going to get an imu calibration error or requirement so i'll show you that now so because i shook the drone around then you saw we got the imu calibration requirement because the drone was confused it knows it's not in the air yet it's moving but as soon as i put it on a flat surface it disappears so bear that in mind just because you get an imu area when you pick your drone up and move it just put it flat and see if it clears itself before you try and go through the calibration phase also if we click on takeoff permitted it shows you the pre-flight check and also return home altitudes and a few other options but don't worry about that we're going to get on to that in a bit so we go to the right we see 77 within a circle now that's the battery capacity or battery percentage that's currently left in the drone's battery so 77. now if we click on it we'll see that we have three options they're all zero at the moment because i'm not in the air but it shows you the time frame until the drone is going to return home until it force lands itself and until the battery is fully depleted and if we click out next to that is four zeros that's your flight time left on the current battery so basically when you launch your drone initially it will be all zeroes until the drone works out how you're flying and then it's going to guestimate how much battery you've got left so i'll show you that now okay so you can see that the numbers have now kicked in we have 19 minutes of flight time left if we click on the 75 we have 17 30 until force landing and 19 minutes apparently until the battery depleted now funnily enough it doesn't have until return home so if i accelerate straight up in the air now you'll see the numbers will drop because it's detecting that i'm using power to climb and therefore my battery is not going to last as long so let's do that how the numbers have changed now if i stop in the air it goes back up okay so that's what it does it detects how much battery you're using and gives you a guesstimation of how long till the battery is depleted so to the right of that we have five bars with rc written on it and that represents radio controller signal so mine's five at the moment because my drone's two meters away from me but when in flight if you exceed a certain distance or go behind obstacles you'll find those bars will change color to either yellow or red or sorry orange and red so orange means we're starting to get a cautionary sort of signal loss in which we're not quite lost the whole signal yet but we're getting there now red represents pretty much you're going to lose your signal soon and maybe change your flight path or distance what usually takes place as well if you hit red and you lose signal it looks a little something like this now don't freak out if this occurs because just because you've lost signal that means the transmission signal is gone it doesn't mean your controller signal is gone so you can initiate a return home by clicking the return home button on your controller also there's a certain setting that we're going to cover later in which the drone loses signal it's going to return itself home anyway so don't be concerned if you lose visual feed just don't press the sticks anywhere don't try and control it just return it home so next to rc we have a satellite with 15 that represents your gps or glonass connection glonass being the russian satellite system i've got 15 satellites at the moment and we're white which means we're good to go now again we have the color codes being red and yellow if it's red your drone won't take off not enough satellites if it's yellow or orange as i keep saying you've got enough satellites but it's not as accurate and therefore it's going to give you that caution that i spoke about before saying that your gps counts low to the right of that we have three dots so we click that it takes us to other settings we're going to cover that in a bit so don't worry about that for now now if we come down we will see what looks like a square let's click that so this is your camera options this is where you can select video or photo mode so let's go through it the first thing we have is photo mode and you have two options you have single shot or timed shot so we do a single shot and click the button it takes a photo and you see a miniature thumbnail underneath your little white circle there now if we go timed shot you can see that we have a second count that we can select so what this does is depending on the seconds every let's say 10 seconds in this case if we click the take photo button as we're flying along the drone will take a photo after 10 seconds continue flying then 10 seconds later take another photo then 10 seconds later another photo that's how it works depending on what seconds you've got so let's initiate it on the ground with a two second count there's a countdown one photo second photo third photo so that's how it works and we press stop and that will keep going until you run out of space on your sd card or within your drone so below photo we have video let's click it so within here we have two other subsections we have 2.7 k and 1080p now we spoke about this in part one and it related to the horizontal pixels on your screen if you haven't seen part one go take a look at that so in 2.7 k we have the option of 24 frames per second 25 and 30 frames per second now in 1080p otherwise known as full hd we have 24 frames all the way through to 60 frames so i'm not going to go into why you'd use certain frame rates although i will cover later a thing called motion blur that we covered in part one briefly but depending on the situation depending on what photos you're taking depending what you're doing in general will determine your frames per second what i can tell you if you use let's say 60 frames per second and you include that in a 30 frames per second video when you're editing later what will take place is because you've slowed it down to 30 frames you'll get a slow motion effect so it's handy if you want slow motion for a certain scene in a 30 frames per second video and again if we press the record button we start to record with the count down there or a count up showing you how much you're recording so let's press stop so below video we have quick shots so we can't access them on the ground we have to be in the air but it's four quick shot types and it's used for basically selfie shots of yourself or anything else so let's go through those now so we have four quick shots that we can choose from there's dronie rocket circle and helix so we need to select the tiger by either dragging our finger or pressing the cross that you see here now i'm selected we then set the distance we want the drone to fly away for the drainage shot in this case 30 meters once we're ready to go we press start there's a countdown and it initiates you can see there's a percentage timer there to show you how long before the quick shot is completed and it's done now it's going to return back to its original starting position for when you pressed the start button now we go to rocket and again we select the altitude that we want the quick shot to go up to in this case 40 meters so the drone is going to go up to 40 meters we select ourselves again and we press start there's the countdown and a weight goes to an altitude of 40 meters it's now completed and it's going to make its way back down to where it started from now we're going to do circle so we select which direction we want the circle to take place either left or right and we select ourself again with the cross now in this case the distance that it will take it from you and the height that it will take it needs to be set by you at the time of selecting this quick shot so ie you'd climb your drone to let's say 10 meters and push the drone away 10 meters so then the circle is going to be 10 meters and the altitude of 10 meters of course and done the last one is helix and in this case we've got a max radius of 40 meters so this is like a mixture between dronie and circle in that it's going to start going in a circle it's slowly going to push its way out away from you to the set distance in this case being 40 meters you will note as well it seems to gain altitude yet we don't select the altitude from the menu so i don't know how that works but there you go and that's the quick shots done so we now go down you'll see a red dot so that represents the record button for video okay now if i change the photo it turns white and that's going to be a representation of taking a photo so just as we can take photos with the buttons that are physically on our controller as per part one at the top of the controller we can also do it by touching the screen now below that button we have again gallery or album so this is the album just as we covered before but now we've got videos and photos in there so at the top we have aircraft and dji fly so aircraft means we're currently looking at the photos that are housed within the sd card of the aircraft because i have an sd card in the aircraft so straight away on these videos and images you will see we have not downloaded at the top so what that means is what we're currently looking at is the cased version of the videos or photos so remember from part one whenever we take a photo or video with our drone we don't have an sd card in it we'll have a cased version so videos will be 720p by 30 frames and photos will be 0.9 of a megabyte well the same thing occurs we still get cached images and videos to our phone and it also gets recorded to an sd card in the drone now the sd card will have the higher quality footage whereas your phone might only have the lower quality but you may remember i said we can download the footage from the sd card by putting the sd card physically in a computer or by connecting the drone when turned on to the computer well there's a third way it's a little bit slower but you can do it and what it is if we look at any of these videos or photos here if we want the higher quality version we simply click on let's say a video and it brings up this menu so currently we're looking at the lower quality video so let's click it okay that's it there but now we want the higher quality version if we look in the bottom left we'll see number one a trash bin that's to delete the file but number two an arrow with a tray so if i now click that what it's doing is it's downloading that video directly from my drone's sd card using the antennas on the controller to my phone so that's now completed and what's occurred is the video that we now have here is the sd card version the higher quality version so let's press play there you go see how it's not so fuzzy see how it doesn't look pixelated because that's in hd so that's how you download it without physically connecting your device or your sd card or your drone to a computer now if you look at the top we'll see it's got a time date stamp and also next to it is an eye for information click that it gives you the file information about this particular file so we can see its resolution frame rate coding on and on we go now to the right of that you'll see a share icon which is the arrow in the box click that we can now share it on social media if we have social media accounts connected to our phone now the bottom right will have a pair of scissors that will take us to the inbuilt video editor of the dji fly application means it will transfer this high definition file we've just downloaded to the video editor and there you go we're going to cover that in part three anyway so we'll get out of that so we just go to another non-downloaded file here you'll find that if we click those icons again share it's going to tell you the download we can't actually do anything until it's downloaded to the phone all right in the top right we have a clock with an arrow that's simply the way you want your files to be sorted so we can sort it by type so top one is video bottom ones are photos or we can do it by date there we go so they're all taken on the same day so they're all going to be in the same area now if we go to the right here we have dji fly that allows us to select folders on your phone that you want to view videos and photos from so it's not locked to the dji fly application you can also look at your standard camera or also in my case a z recorder which is a phone screen recorder and the reason for that is if you're looking to make videos with the inbuilt video editor you can simply go to this folder and drag other files in that have nothing to do with your drone so you can edit it into the video and at the bottom right we have create and again that button takes us back to the inbuilt video editor so below gallery we now have the camera settings and when i say settings i mean things to do with the exposure value the iso and the shutter speed which you can't see at the moment because we're in auto so let's explain this so the first thing is auto so what auto means is we allow the software built into the drone to control our shutter speeds our iso and all the other settings that relate to the camera or video camera now if you're looking just to use this casually and you don't want to act in a i guess professional sort of manner you don't want over the top settings leave it at auto and the drone will take care of it for you and when i mean auto this is what i'm talking about let's have a look at our camera here so if i rotate the gimbal down okay and we look at a black box what it's doing at the moment in auto mode is adjusting the iso the shutter speed and everything else so it can i guess get the colors right for what we're looking at we can't see much anyway now as i scroll up you'll see that it will probably get brighter like extremely bright but then it will slowly fade into proper color and focus so let's do that now it's bright see how it darkened then so go down again we come up fast so it's bright and it darkens see how it's darkening that's the auto mode taking over and adjusting the levels so it looks normal but the problem is some people don't like that when flying because you don't want to see that unnatural progression from dark to light so that's where we come into manual mode in a second we'll cover that but first of all let's continue on to the left so next to the auto mode we have ae which is auto exposure lock because there's a padlock there now i just showed you how the colors changed as we rotated the camera up and the brightness now if we put a padlock on in this case the ae what it's going to do is it's going to stop the software from changing those settings so it's going to lock it in to the current settings depending on what we're looking at at the time so to give you a demonstration let's scroll down again here we are the black box now let's put that padlock on so what's going to occur now when i scroll up nothing's going to change it's probably going to be blown out and very bright let's scroll up see how that's bright and we can't really see anything that's because we have the lock on so bearing in mind when we put the lock on the camera was looking at a dark surface so it tried to brighten the area up to compensate now that we've scrolled up with the lock on it can't change the settings therefore everything is blown out but if i turn the padlock off the software has just taken over and it's readjusted all the settings to compensate for the excess sunlight so that's what the lock does so you'd use that let's say if you're flying along and you're in a particular area and the settings are good to go and you know that the lighting's not going to change you can lock it that way when you continue flying you're not going to have that adjustment between the different brightness levels but bear in mind if you happen to rotate your drone in flight let's say towards the sun because it's locked it's not going to change itself it's probably going to wipe your video out so like i said if you're not doing it in a professional capacity leave it unlocked so next to ae we have ev which is exposure value so even though the software controls most of it for you if you think something's too bright or dark you can actually brighten it or darken it using this so looking at my scene at the moment i would say the ground's too dark let's pretend so if i click ev i want to brighten it see how it's now going up obviously that's a bit too bright but i'm able to broaden it myself if we go down we can go like that again you can leave it up to the software to do that's not a problem but you may want to adjust the lighting slightly for the situation and when we get into further settings later you'll see a thing called a histogram this is where the exposure value may come into play because the histogram will tell you something else but don't worry about that for now that's what ev does so next to ev we have jpeg so jpeg is a format of picture because we're in photo mode at the moment that's all it is as per part one you'll remember we're talking about the output for the mini which was jpeg now below that we have three five eight nine that represents the amount of photos i can take and store on my sd card see the sd card symbol next to it so i can take 3589 photos until my sd card's full now if i click that jpeg it tells me how much space i've got remaining on my sd card so 14.1 gigabytes now let's briefly change the video now you can see that we have 57.29 minutes worth of sd card allocation for a 1080p video at 24 frames so i can film almost one hour worth of video to this sd card and if we click it again it tells me the space left alright so that's those settings there in auto mode so now let's go to manual mode so we're in photo let's turn it off okay it's a little bit dark at the moment so the first thing you see is we now have the option of iso and shutter speed and a thing called mm so first of all mm you can see it's darkened out we can't do anything with it now i believe that represents focal length now bearing in mind we can't actually change the focal length in a manual capacity on the mavic mini it's fixed so to speak but if we change something like the shutter speed here you'll see the focal length changes so that's done by the software but you'll see with the shutter speed and iso we can change those so let's get on the shutter so if you watched part one of this series i explained what the shutter in the iso was but i'm going to explain it again briefly so the metaphor i used for shutter was this we have two rooms side by side one room's full of light one room is pitch black and in the middle is a door now depending how quickly you open and close that door determines how much light gets out of the lightroom into the dark room okay so that's what a shutter is in essence it allows light into your camera and depending how fast it opens and closes depends how much light gets into your camera so that's what a shutter is and next to that we have an iso so an iso is the sensitivity of the internal sensor to light so if i turn it up to 200 you see it gets brighter and brighter because as the numbers go up the sensitivity within the camera goes up to light okay so that's what that is so when it comes to shutter if you're taking a photo at sunrise or sunset for instance and the conditions are pretty dark and you want to catch a maybe the sun coming up over a hill you would play around with the shutter so you'd probably make it slop off so we go from let's say one by sixteen hundredth of a second and we slow it down to one eight hundredth of a second okay obviously it's blurring out our picture at the moment because it's a bright day but this would allow the shadow to go slower you'd catch more light and you would hopefully catch the sun rays coming over the hill but bear in mind as well because it's slower if your drone's moving around in the wind it's probably going to blur your photo and again you can also use iso to increase the sensitivity of light to capture that sunset but bear in mind the more sensitive you make it to light the more artifacts or distortion that comes into your camera so i'm not going to go into that i'm not a photographer have a look do a bit of research but shutter and iso are also important because in the case of the mavic mini the iso is limited to 100 minimum so it means we can only go to a hundred now when it comes to natural motion blur that i spoke about in part one these are important because i know this has nothing to do with the dji fly application but a lot of people ask about nd filters and motion blur so i might as well combine them now for you so you don't have to go sort of outside the realm and go researching so when it comes to motion blur for instance the rule is whatever your frame rate is you must double your shutter speed so today i'm going to shoot a video for you in automatic mode at 60 frames per second at 1080p without any settings change it's just going to be automatically controlled i'm then going to shoot a video again at 60 frames 1080p but i'm going to get the shutter speed double the frame rate so it's going to be 1 by 120th of a second but here lies our problem if i have it set at 60 frames i must go 1 by 120th of a second so if i do that now watch what happens everything's wired out why because we can't change the iso any lower than 100 we can't go down the 50 20 10 whatever it may be we're locked at 100 for sensitivity and the shutter speed is now a lot slower so it's letting a lot more light in so it's widening out the sensor in the camera well that's where nd filters come into play so i'll quickly show you what i'm talking about now i'm going to step outside i'm going to put the microphone on and we're going to quickly run through it so in my case i use a thing called freewheel nd filters being neutral density filters they're like a pair of sunglasses for your camera as everyone says why because you can't drop the iso sensitivity down you need something to manually block the light out in this case we're using mini sunglasses so you can see here i have three nd filters and a thing called a polarizer don't worry about the polarizer only covering nd filters and the three filters represent different levels of sun blocking so to speak so we have nd4 and d8 and nd16 16 being the darkest four being the lightest now because it's a bright sunny day with no clouds i use an nd16 and you can see here it blocks the light so i simply click it on the front of my dji mavic mini's camera and we're good to go all right we're ready to go and we're going to do a comparison between the two videos showing with nd and without nd using automatic settings and also our own manual settings with that filter so let's go so notice in this frame we're sitting at 1080p by 60 frames and we've got it on auto settings and as the vehicles pass through the frame there's no obvious motion blur it's just super crisp and it shouldn't be like that when looking through the human eye notice as well i've changed the exposure value so that it's a little bit darker because before it was quite bright in these current conditions so in this video we're running at 1080p by 60 frames at a shutter speed of double being 1 by 120th of a second now notice as well had to put the iso up so we've had to make it more sensitive because the filter is actually a bit too dark for the settings believe it or not but anyway we can see the obvious motion blur as vehicles pass through the frame and that's what we want as opposed to the auto settings that we had on before it was too crisp too clear and we just didn't have that blur that's natural for the human eye so when we compare both videos side by side and we slow each video down you can see the obvious blur of the vehicles as they pass through the frame as opposed to a crisp looking vehicle that's motion blur in action and that shows you just how changing the settings in manual mode with an nd filter can affect your video so there you go that's the concept of motion blur and what you can do with frame rate change matching with a shutter speed so now let's go to the left now i'm going to rotate the camera down here because we've got a white surface and we can't quite see there we go now next to the camera settings right in the middle you can see what looks like a dot with a arrow and a torch light so that's your position in conjunction to your drone so to start off the circle in the bottom is my position and the torch is the way my antennas are currently facing now to the left of that you'll see the little triangle or arrowhead that's my drone so my drone's currently to my left so if i rotate my controller towards the drone you can see it comes around alright so now i'm facing directly behind my drone hence why the arrow is in the torchlight now as for the arrow you can see if we rotate around again it's facing away from me so if i was to rotate my drone back towards me the point of the arrow will be pointing the other way so that's how you can use that to know where you are where your drone is and what way it's facing so that way you can fly it back in conjunction with looking at your camera feed bear in mind as well that torch light gives you an indication if your line of sight is correct with your drone so in this case my line of sight wouldn't be correct but if i turn it like that you can see that my drone is now directly in line of sight with my controller now if we come to the left of that we see a 1.9 on the d and a h with zero zero so that's the distance and height so for distance my drone is currently 1.8 meters away from my controller and the height is zero because my drone's on the ground so let's lift off so now you can see my drone's at a height of 1.2 meters so if i go up that increases if i go down it decreases and obviously distance if i move away from myself it gets larger and smaller depending where it is in conjunction to me it's in meters at the moment being metric we'll change that later if you want to i can show you how to do that for imperial measurements if you're in the us now above that you see zero zero ms and zero zero ms above d and h so what that is is meters per second of its ascent descent and movement forward and backwards so if i go forwards you can see it increases and it's moving at a certain meters per second if we go backwards it does exactly the same as it comes towards me now if we go up same concept it's climbing in meters per second and as we drop down it should go into the minuses okay there you go and that corresponds with part one where i spoke about its meters per second in a cent decent depending what flight mode it's in and traveling forward and backwards at top speed so to the left of that we have what looks like a mini google map so if i click that it does bring up a mini google map and you can see your home point my position and the drone's position if we click it again it brings up a larger version of that map and we can see like we saw before in the flight logs and in the fly spots and everything like that we have a google map that's going to give us an indication of where the drone is your home point so forth now you can see in the bottom left we also have a camera view so let's rotate so if you want to check your map on the fly whilst in the air you can it's just a miniature camera view on the bottom just to keep you in check to where you're flying when you're checking the map so if we want to go back to the camera view we simply click it and if we want to reduce that map size down see in the bottom left there's two arrows pointing together we click that and it goes back to normal so now to the left we have a h with an arrow so if i click that we've got land initially so the way it works is i'm just going to get some height here so what we do if we want the drone to land so we're in a certain position we go okay we want to land we press and hold this land button so you see if i touch it it goes green at the top see that see the line so what you have to do is hold it until the green line goes all the way around and it will initiate a landing sequence now it's landing and to left it says cancel so we're going to cancel that okay now because it's too close to me there's another setting that's missing so let's move away so we click it again you can see we've got another option now and that's returned to home because i've moved away from my home point to a sufficient distance we've now got the ability for return home so again just like with land if we press and hold it will go into return home mode there we go you can hear the audible tone now my drone's making its way back but we're going to cancel that and you can see i'm getting a strong wind warning as well because it's a bit windy today and i'm up in the air so it's giving me a caution to lose altitude and come a bit closer to the ground now it's gone you'll also see why we're on the ground that that arrow now points upwards as opposed to downwards so if i press and hold that it's the take off option so as opposed to landing and returning home if i press and hold the drone takes off by itself and will hover okay so that's what that's for and now we can see it's got the landing icon yet again all right so that's the main camera view and control interface covered so now let's go into settings so we're going to click these three dots in the top right and here we are in settings and we've got sub categories so let's start with safety so at the moment we've got max altitude set at 119 usually it's at 120. what this is is it will give you a cautionary alert if you exceed whatever max altitude you have set so the reason i have it at 120 that's the max altitude in australia without authorization so you'll see when you take off and go above 120 a caution will come up in the left hand corner in red stating that you've exceeded the limits and it might contradict regulatory arrangements within your country of origin now we've got max distance set to no limit again that's adjustable again what occurs once you go past a certain limit you'll get a cautionary message in the top left hand side of your screen now auto return home altitude you can set what your return home altitude is here as you see it's written at the bottom so basically what will take place if i set it to let's say 119 meters which i wouldn't let's say we say 15 meters because the trees are below 15 meters as soon as i initiate a return home it's going to get to an altitude of 15 meters then it's going to make its way home stop and hover now bear in mind if you've got a low battery and you set it for some reason to 119 meters don't know why you would maybe you're in a mountain or something if you initiate a return home it's going to try and get to 119 metres first before it makes its way home so if you've got a low battery you really don't want your drone climbing to 119 meters before it makes its way back so pick a sufficient height for the settings you're in now update home point so this is not going to work while i'm on the ground as you can see but what occurs is as we know when we initially start the drone picks up the satellites and will set a home point which is the point that you take off from now let's say you go for a walk you fly your drone 300 meters away and you walk in the same direction and then you initiate a return home well the drone is now going to fly back 300 metres the other way because that's where it first took off from but if you're in the air and you're in another location and you click update home point it's going to update it to where the drone is currently situated so it's a dynamic home point so to speak so bear that in mind if you walk a sufficient distance or drive or whatever it is away from your initial launch point you want to update it or the drone's going the other way so now we've got sensors and these are the calibration areas for number one the compass and number two the imu or the inertial measurement unit so remember before we had an imu error i showed you if i flip the drain around it gives us a red error well this is how you calibrate it and also the compass if you have an issue i.e you start up near metal you move away but then you've got a compass calibration required this is where you do it so first of all we're going to do the compass calibration so we click on calibrate and we come up with this screen with a picture of a drone with a write-up written there with start calibration once we press start it's going to tell us to hold the drone horizontally with the camera facing out and rotating a 360 degree circle once you've done a full 360 it will tell you to tilt the drone upwards with the camera facing the sky and do another 360. once it's complete it's going to tell you calibrated now with the imu we press calibrate again and it's going to tell us that we need the drone with the legs folded in but turned on it's going to tell us to put it on a flat surface first we then need to put it on its left side then we're going to land on its back then we're going to put it on its right side now we're going to put on its tail end with the camera facing the sky then it's going to tell us calibrated so below sensors we have a battery info click that so what it's going to do it's going to give you i guess more advanced battery information as opposed to what we're looking at before with the power percentage so we can see that our batteries are now down to 3.61 volts the battery voltage is 7.22 and our temperature our battery temperature is 40 degrees we have a battery serial number there but also how many times this particular battery has been charged which is 28 times and its production date now again we have unlock geo zone remember we're in this before again we can go to that web address and unlock zones if we want to do so now remote identification what we have is uuid and identification and flight information now what this is because i'm in australia i've never actually seen this used so i wouldn't know if we actually do have the capability to track drones like this in australia but what uuid is it represents unique user identification and also identification and flight information down below now at the top it says here it's like an automobile license plate it'd be similar to a transponder in an aircraft that gives you altitude direction who the aircraft is basically the registration of the aircraft now you can turn those on and off and see here the identification for me is orion and flight information you can put in there manually and that's what will be projected to whoever is monitoring from i guess a ground station or anywhere else again in australia i've never used it if you have leave a comment i'd like to know all about it but that's what that is there i have no doubt in the united states it probably is in use but again i wouldn't know find my drone we have that option again we've already been there now advanced safety settings so the first one is this signal lost now speaking before about if you lose your signal you can select what your drone does if there's a complete loss of signal and you can't reconnect so number one we have return home i leave it as standard because i want my drone to come back to me if i've lost connection unless of course i haven't updated my home point you can also have it to descend and also hover in place so it's up to yourself i always leave it at rth return to home now emergency propeller stop now you may remember from one of my videos where i strapped a 360 camera to the bottom of my drone i actually initiated this because my drone fell out of the sky as you can see here she's coming down there we go we've lost it into the bush into the bush now by stopping the props they weren't spinning when they hit the trees therefore it was going to be less damage so that's how you do it there i wouldn't recommend it if you're at a certain height let's say 100 meters because your drone's going to fall like a brick out of the sky and below that we have payload mode so what payload mode is for as you can read there it's when you strap accessories or extra weight to your drone so by turning that on the sensors and the motors and that know there's additional weight to the drone and they're going to compensate now it's only to a certain extent i had payload mode on that video where i crashed into a tree but the weight was too great for the drone so it still went down but if you're going to put something like that 360 degree propeller protectors on your drone that come with the fly more combo you need this on let's go to control so the first thing is flight mode again you can choose your flight mode from here i don't know why you just wouldn't use the screen like we showed earlier but you can select it here now units of measurement this is where you can change between metric and imperial obviously in the us imperial but here we use metric now gimbal mode this is an interesting one so at the moment my gimbal is remained fixed horizontally so it means when i fly the aircraft and turn left the camera is just going to be looking it's still going to compensate with the gyros but it's just going to be looking straight ahead if we go to fpv mode as you can see here it says the gimbal follows the movement of the aircraft so if we turn left the gimbal will also go left right will go right so that's what that is there give it a try see what you like now advanced gimbal settings so in here we can select how fast the gimbal goes up and down at pitch speed so if i go down to let's say one and now pitch my gimbal this is full pelt that's how fast it goes but if i change it to let's say a hundred now let's try it that's how fast it goes there okay so you can change it to whatever you want and pitch smoothness so again it says set the gimbal rotation smoothness so i've got it at 13. i'm not really concerned with the smoothness of the rotation you might be as you rotate your aircraft left and right if it's too jaggedy change it here and allow upward gimbal rotation so what this is let's turn it off for a second and let's go back to the gimbal now something i didn't show you before if you look on the right hand side as i change the gimbal pitch you'll see a looks like a ruler with degrees come up so here we go see that there on the right so that's going to show you your gimbal pitch up and down so if we go all the way down we can go to 90. if we go all the way up we go to zero degrees which is directly straight but if i change that setting i was just talking about put it on what we can now do instead of going to zero we can go beyond zero to 20 degrees plus there's zero up we go so you can actually look in the sky i leave this on i don't see why you wouldn't leave it on it's not going to affect anything but it's just going to allow you more field of view up and down so remember to turn that on if you want to obviously look up in the sky or up a tree or whatever it may be now just why i'm on the subject of the gimbal here's one of those so-called secret features that people talk about it's not really a secret it's just not really known so obviously we can change the speed of our gimbal and the rotation of gimbal and so forth and those settings now bear in mind when you set the speed of the gimbal like we just did in here pitch speed that's the speed that's going to go out permanently when you use the gimbal wheel but here's a little point if you press and hold your finger on the screen in the area where we saw that gimbal ruler so just there if you press and hold with your finger it comes up so i'm not touching the gimbal wheel now if i drag my finger up and down the screen it moves the gimbal but the good thing about this feature is as follows it's not set so unlike the setting where you set the pitch before if i go slow with my finger it goes slow but if i drag my finger fast now the speed of the gimbal's fast so you can actually change the speed just using your finger here so if your set speed at the time of flight is not quick enough and you see something you want to lock onto just shove your finger on the screen and drag your finger real fast and your gimbal will drop fast and below that we've got reset that resets to the default settings now we've also got gimbal calibration here so if i click that it allows you to calibrate your gimbal if it's a little bit offset so i don't know if you noticed before when we did the motion blur video that i showed you the gimbal was a little bit offset it wasn't straight so you can either press auto like this and what's taking place is the gimbal is currently moving itself up and down left right so on and so forth and it's recalibrating and it says it's successful or you can manually do it like this but i personally probably wouldn't just leave it on auto click it and let it recenter itself and to the bottom here we have recent gimbal so if i click it once it'll take the gimbal all the way down and if i click it again it brings it up to its central automated gimbal point okay so below recenter gimbal we have remote controller so we've got stick mode so what stick mode is if we click into it here you can see what i'm currently flying my drone with ie what my sticks do but you can change from mode 1 2 3 or do custom controls for your drone i'm not actually going to change it because it might lock me into another stick mode that i don't want to use but this is where you can change how you fly your drone so try them out see what suits you best and you can select them from here now we have rc calibration so if i click that it says here power off the aircraft and calibrate remote controller so what happens is if i turn off my drone and click this again we can see we've now got the remote controller calibration area so if i press start it says push the control sticks and rotate the dials to the maximum range several times in all directions so there's no order so if i now rotate the gimbal first so it's going green back and forth back and forth not a problem now with the joysticks i'm going to go to the left first like that like that like that okay and then the right side we'll go down right left up there we go it's now calibrated okay so i've never actually had to use that before but there's a demonstration so again we have flight tutorial if i click that now we can do the checklist again we don't really need to let's skip that and at the bottom we have repair to aircraft link so if we click that it tells me to press the linking button on on the aircraft to link the remote controller what i believe that is let's cancel what i believe that is is we need to grab the mavic mini and press and hold the power button and we link like we normally do when we power up again i've never used it uh it's it's a weird one but maybe it's there if you can't link on the first time around but there you go so now we go to camera mode so we have camera and then size so obviously there's different ratios when it comes to the camera this affects the photo size so we have to be in photo mode which we are at the moment so 16 by nine this is how the photo is going to be taken but if we change it to four by three ratio that's the photo that's going to be taken okay so that's what that's for there now storage and sd card so straight away we can see format what that will do they'll completely wipe everything off your sd card so pictures videos if you're finished filming and whatever it may be simply format it there it also has a second purpose if you buy a new sd card instead of putting it on your computer and formatting it i think i spoke about this in part one just put your sd card into your drone and then press format that way you know the drone's going to format it to the correct settings for use below that we also have the capacity of the sd card and how much space is left so we've got 12.8 gigabytes left out of a 14.8 gigabyte sd card which is actually 15 gigabyte there's always 200 megabytes missing for the operating system on the sd card now we have advanced shooting settings now this is pretty good this one let's click that so the real important ones here are histogram and overexposure warning and i use these all the time so the first one will go histogram and click out so see we've got a little bar on the left there so the histogram represents exposure or it illustrates the range of tones and brightness within a scene an image or video whatever it may be so on the left side of the histogram we can break it into thirds the left side is shadows or the darker areas within a scene in the middle is the mid tones which fits obviously and the highlights are to the right so the brighter areas of the scene that you're looking at and the vertical peaks of this little chart going up and down represents the number of pixels within a certain range being the dark areas in between or bright areas otherwise known as shadows mid-tones or highlights when i change the exposure value of the image you can see that the pixel count immediately goes to the right which is the highlights because obviously the image is getting brighter therefore more pixels are taking on the highlights again if i was to drop the exposure value down or else to focus my camera on maybe a black or shadow area you'll start to see it go the other way it's a very handy tool to use and get used to using it no matter what drone you're using because it will help you out with getting that perfect sort of image or video quality so if we look at this image here you can see what i'm talking about so the next thing we have is overexposure warning what this shows is areas within your video feed or photo fade that are overexposed meaning it's too bright so let's just bring down the exposure value here so they're pretty much all gone all right so it looks a bit darker in the background so be it but we haven't got an overexposed image so if i put that up let's say oh this looks great straight away we know the ground is overexposed okay now you sometimes when you're trying to get a good shot you're still going to have white and black lines on there but if it looks like this you've probably got a problem if it looks like maybe that you can probably get away with it because it's not a massive over exposure you're always going to have an overexposure of some sort especially when you've got the sky in your video or image because the sky is just bright in general so the recommendation is have histogram and overexposure on as you're flying and it should give you a general idea of how your footage or photos are coming out so the next thing we've got are grid lines now you can see if i click that one we have that sort of grid line we turn that one on we have that sort of gridline so on and so forth now they have a purpose and it depends what you're trying to shoot at the time again i'm not a photographer but these grid lines here i use quite a lot because you can do a thing called the rule of thirds or the rule of thumb and the general consensus or concept is when you're taking a photo let's say if you're a wedding photographer and you have a scene and a couple in the middle of the scene i don't know hugging what you want to do is try and get the couple on the intersecting lines just here because that becomes the rule of thirds i think it also comes into a thing called the golden rule but anyway let's not go too far into it if you look at these example pictures here this is a demonstration of the rule of thirds of how you should shoot a subject in a scene okay so that's what those grid lines are for so now white balance we have it on auto at the moment but if i go manual and adjust it you can see it changes what they say the warmth or coolness or cool something of the image so if i go all the way down we're making it cooler it's a bit over blue but if we go like that we can see it goes up and then it gets warm okay so that's what white balance actually is you can play with that if you want i leave it on auto but that's white balance so next we have anti-flicker and this is an interesting one what it relates to is the mains power or a power point for instance with let's say an led light plugged into it so when it comes to power you have ac alternating current when you look at the numbers here we've got 50 hertz and 60 hertz in auto so the 50 represents the mains power or the ac current flicking on and off 50 times a second and 60 is exactly the same at 60 times a second now you don't see it with a human eye but when you film let's say a led light and you haven't got the settings matched you get flicker now if you look at this video here i've attempted to replicate it it's very hard to see but if you look at the roof you can see what looks like waves that are pretty much white and black alternating that's the flicker and depending what country you're in depends on what hertz we're using so for instance asia russia africa and australia we use 50 hertz in the ac therefore you'd want a 50 hertz setting whereas in north america and other countries you have 60 hertz and in japan they use both now it's very similar to when you film a tv or a computer screen you see the lines running through that's a refresh rate it's similar but not exactly the same but it gives you an idea of what you're looking at there it's mismatched video versus the screen now with this setting it only comes up in auto video mode meaning you know when we're looking before it changing isos and so forth in manual well when you're in auto this setting is available because in manual mode you're expected to change the settings to suit the alternating current hertz so if you're just going to shoot in auto mode anyway leave this setting to auto but if you're a bit more professional and you know what country you're going to be in match it to the country's hertz ac rate so the next thing we have is subtitle so what subtitle does when you turn it on is it embeds in the case of the dji mavic mini it embeds telemetry data into the video that you type or film so basically once you finish filming and you play this video in something like vlc player if you turn subtitles on you will see telemetry data like you see in this example video here so in the case of this video we can see that we've got the iso level the shutter speed the f-stop which is 2.8 in this case the exposure value and you can also see there we've got something called the cine-like now the mavic mini doesn't actually have that because this video this example video is for my dji mavic air 2 which does have d cine like so don't worry about that that's something that comes with another drone but this is how it will be represented in your mavic mini video now below that case when recording so we know that the videos and photos case to our phone if we turn this off it won't go to your phone so if you've got an sd card it's going to go to your sd card if you don't have an sd card well who knows you might just not get any footage but i leave that on anyway below that we have max video cache capacity so what this allows you to do is select i probably put on auto actually is select as it says down here when the max capacity is reached old cache files are deleted automatically so it's like a record over function like you would for a security camera once we reach a certain level or amount of data it's going to start recording over and below that we have reset camera parameters and that just resets everything to default so now we're going to transmission right so this is where you'll find the transmission signals between your controller and your drone so if you look at mine i've got frequency and it's set at 5.8 gigahertz if i click it it doesn't change so i've got an fcc type drone and controller which i think that's the american standard whereas you've got ce which is european standard and they have 5.8 gigahertz and 2.4 gigahertz so in australia we have 5.8 now if we go down here we'll see channel mode and you'll see green bars and red bars so what these are these are the channels within the 5.8 gigahertz frequency range now currently i'm sitting on i think by looks of it channel 149 but with the green bars the higher they are the stronger the signal of that particular channel if you look at the red they're unstable so it might have some sort of interference or it's just unstable in general so having a look i'm in manual mode at the moment i don't even remember changing the manual mode i'm glad i just noticed that but anyway i'm currently set at 149 or channel 149 and it seems to be quite low really i should be on another channel but you can select the channel you want depending at the time of flight so if you have a look at that and there's a particular channel that's strong in your area you can actually manually by clicking manual go across to it and select that channel and lock yourself in to use that channel only in the area you're flying now i wouldn't recommend it i recommend you stay on auto because that way the software will flick between the channels depending on their strength because it obviously fluctuates depending where you fly and what interferes in the area so don't change that unless you know what you're doing and you know you're not going to crash or lose signal i'm going to change that back to auto right now actually so this is what happens when you attempt to change it it says switching channels will automatically restart wi-fi not a problem press okay so temporarily i white it out but i've reconnected with my drone again not a problem now we're auto so that's all there is in transmission let's go to about all right in here we have the name of my drone which happens to be big sally i don't even remember writing that the model the mavic mini and again we have the update options for our aircraft firmware and fly safe database you can do it from here as well we have the i guess serial numbers for the sorry the version number for the rc firmware so the controller we have our flysafe database for apps no worries that's the version we have the app version battery information again and below that's the serial number for all the major components to do with your drone and things like the radio controller and battery which you'd probably give to dji if you were to make a claim under the refresh package if you actually applied for that when you bought your drone okay so that's about it for the dji fly application i've tried to make it as in-depth as possible but if i missed anything leave a comment and tell me what i may have missed also for your information whilst filming this video series the new mavic mini 2 has come out so just be aware there's probably not too many changes in regards to the software to be used with the mavic mini or most of the components apart from obviously the camera and so forth so you can probably use this tutorial if you just got yourself a new mavic mini 2 but again we'll soon see once it's fully released and we can have a look what they've added in regards to the fly application now if you liked the video give me a like if you didn't like the video give me a dislike but leave a comment to why now share this video with anyone who you think might benefit from what i've said here today and the rest of the video series also subscribe to the channel ring the bell you'll be informed when new videos come out on this channel for your information as well i have a facebook group and also an instagram account if you want to maybe join there as well and see what's going on but for now thanks very much for watching i'm going to go into video 3 right now which will be again to do with the video editing software within the dji flow application so i'll speak to you all again very soon
