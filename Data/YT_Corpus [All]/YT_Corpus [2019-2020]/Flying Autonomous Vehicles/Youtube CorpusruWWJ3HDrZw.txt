 [Music] hey everybody welcome to another episode of NASA and Silicon Valley live I'm your host Abbey Taber and if this is your first time joining us NASA and Silicon Valley live is a conversational show out of NASA's Ames Research Center where we talk about all the nerdy NASA news you need to know so I have here today our old friend Tiffany hi everyone I am your co-host Tiffany Blake if he didn't know we are live on twitch YouTube Facebook and periscope but if you want to participate in the chat and ask our guests questions there's only one way you can do that and that's at www.twitch.tv/esa yeah and I know you're gonna have a lot of questions because today we are talking about air taxis and the future of urban transport and we have a couple of awesome guests here to tell us all about that hey guys hey why don't you tell everybody your name and what you do here sure hey everyone I'm Siobhan Dooley I'm an aerospace research engineer and I do research on new aircraft and how they enter our airspace awesome and I'm Joey I'm a research aerospace engineer and I look at new ways to manage air traffic okay a good team so Abby before we get into the show how about we remind our audience about our really cool clock here yeah yeah for sure this is our moon countdown clock where we are counting down the next five years to 2024 when we're planning to send humans to the moon as part of the Artemis program so this clock is counting down the days hours minutes and seconds to 2024 when the first woman and the next man will walk on the moon's South Pole so what exactly get excited for that and if you want to learn more you can go to nasa.gov slash artemis but for now let's get into the topic of the day right yeah can you guys start off by telling us how is NASA reimagining urban transportation yeah so there's um this new concept that's come about it's called urban air mobility so you might hear us call it um okay so what is like UAM yeah right so one can and above them an air to air traffic management system that has everything from small delivery drones to passenger carrying air taxis flying safely and efficiently above urban centers or you know almost above anywhere almost every day and that's that vision that we're really trying to enable where we have new aircraft new entrants making our lives easier yeah by providing functions that we all really need ok amazing so how did we get here what like what led to this moment we're working on this now yeah so industry has really been pushing things forward there's folks know right as you we have automobiles and as automobiles have been moving and developing you have this new advent of electric yeah electric cars right so that same technology can now actually also be applied to aircraft so we have electric propulsion for aircraft so just like you have this new clean and efficient way of providing transport for vehicles this new clean electric transport can be applied for aircraft ok so we have new automation also that's coming into play so new control systems that are onboard vehicles and it's really that combination of those two things electric propulsion technology plus automation has really led us towards this new kind of mode of transportation that we're really excited ok awesome awesome so these air taxis you've been describing I think you came with an image of an example yeah right ok let's let's bring that up and you can talk to us about what we're seeing sure cool so this is a concept vehicle this is what we call an electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicle you can see it has four rotors two on each side so what's a rotor a rotor are blades that spin to help generate lift kind of like a helicopter okay right so helicopter you typically have one rotor above and then you have a tail rotor behind and so what these rotors do is they provide lift this is just one configuration of a potential urban air mobility vehicle there are many condition figurations you can also see here that that vehicle also has a wing right yeah so how would these vehicles kind of fly you can imagine that they would take off and then shift to forward flight leveraging their wing to have efficient performance okay a cross between a helicopters take off in a plane flying board all right yeah you have a couple of questions here I'm ready we have big bad Tom he says don't we already had our taxis better known as a plane question that is a good question so traditional commercial aircrafts current-day aircraft that we all fly in today those are for longer flights typically right so you might fly from San Francisco to LA or San Francisco to New York or wherever you are interested in flying those are over longer longer trips so you're covering lots of miles right and also those aircraft use fuel so jet fuel these new air taxis or urban air mobility vehicles are electric propulsion vehicle so you're no longer relying on jet fuel and in addition they're typically flying shorter emissions there's a lot there's a kind of a wide range of their mission types but you're typically flying shorter missions and you're using a different mode of fuel right and in inside of within a city or yeah we'll see something and they're also small city limits yeah yeah smaller smaller between cities right so you would normally book a flight from San Jose to San Francisco right that's the concept but we all wish with the traffic right right taking us off the road like so hovercat here says will they be like large multicopter battery-powered what kind of range are we talking about yeah so there's a whole host of different configurations some have four rotors like we saw in that image some have two some have many and they can also have some with wing configurations they typically about four to eight passenger carrying in terms of this size and many of them are electrically powered so yes battery power is is where many of them are doing we're talking about passengers but actually cargo could be one of the first things that really starts to test this concept out okay makes sense yeah so passenger vehicles cargo delivery are there other applications that you guys see is really important yeah so one of the major applications we can see coming forward is emergency services okay so one can imagine if you have current-day helicopters being used to provide ambulance support services these vehicles could be flown in areas that might be dangerous or difficult to get to and provide those same emergency type services so there's a whole host of applications awesome right so that's easy to see yeah how we're gonna use them how it's gonna be super helpful mm-hmm there must be challenges for people like you to develop these systems are there a few that you would highlight Li yeah so I would actually take a phrase that's used by the FAA so that's the Federal Aviation Administration right right so we are working very closely with them to see if we can make ribbon Air Mobility a reality mm-hmm one of the phrases that they like to use is they like to focus on the aircraft the air man or air woman and the air space so what does that mean well these vehicles they're new right so these aircraft have to be certified there are going to be interesting challenges on how we a so certified these these vehicles as they have different performance characteristics we mentioned that they're going to be battery powered or electric vehicles that has implications on their certification okay certifying them is safe to fly like the brand new and we're gonna declare them safe for the the skies in our cities right okay yeah and then if you talk about the air man or the air woman part that import air person that implies that we have to also think about what is the role of the pilot and how do they interface with potentially new controls right like if they have different ways relying whole new trainee potentially a pool of pilots that may not have the same training that our current pilots today have so what how do they actually fly these vehicles that's also a really important question that we have and then the last piece which i think is also really important is how do we integrate these vehicles in our airspace right it's not just one or two of these vehicles that may be flying in the future you can imagine hundreds or thousands of them and if that's the case how do we integrate them safely and efficiently into our air transportation system into our national airspace right an interesting part of the research actually if you look at those three buckets right the the aircraft and the air man or a woman and the airspace some of the things that are done in the airspace now for the current traffic may be better handled by one of those other buckets some of the things that a pilot takes care of now maybe can be better handled by the airframe itself so understanding these where these things should get handled in this new way of travel is an important area research as well yeah okay we have a good question here from space roars he says are we going to have air traffic lights is there going to be a direct path they follow mannerisms things like that that can help you with navigating yeah this actually exciting part she might as we talked earlier about the advances and vehicles that are allowing us to get to this point in time but actually the advances in airspace management are really important as well and these two things are converging so yeah there actually will be stoplights they'll be digital right they won't actually be floating and hovering up there yellow green yeah and there would be a set of procedures and policies and rules that people that are operating in this in this airspace would need to follow in order to have the whole thing still work safely and efficiently so figuring all of that out is a big area of research and we we do collaborate with the FAA to figure out what is a good path forward yeah yeah and you said this is about helping these new vehicles get into the National Airspace right can can you define for everybody what that really means the National Airspace System yes it's it's what enables us to have air traffic and air transport in the u.s. today it's a collection of everything that makes that happen so it's it's the runways you can think of the air traffic control towers the airports the radars it's actually the vehicles as well and the people that take care of all these things and actually run them day to day but it's also things you can't touch its things like rules and procedures and frequencies all of that stuff together makes up the National Airspace System okay so how do you introduce new things into that you can see it's a delicate dance to make sure you right don't harm what's working well now and enable these new new ways of travel you guys are the choreographers of urban air mobility I don't think this is a question on the list but I'm sure the people are asking themselves why does NASA work on this it's a good answer for that yeah I thought so I'll jump in you know the thing people forget is that first day on NASA stands for Aeronautics and we do a lot of Aeronautics research and even people that do remember that Aeronautics is part of what we do they may forget that air traffic management is actually a major part of Aeronautics is how do you actually allow these vehicles to get up in the air and fly around and do what they do right and we have a pretty good history here at NASA Ames and within NASA as a whole of doing that kind of research so it's really natural that this idea of this new airspace management concept kind of originated with us yeah and I would say we're we're also been collaborating with the FAA for a number of years so as our research has been developing we've been collaborating with the FAA to transfer technologies and new research capabilities to really make our airspace much more efficient our air traffic management really improve efficiencies as much as we can mm-hmm yeah I know you guys work closely and I know that our Aeronautics research goes way way back here at names we act at the center here in this research center we started as an Aeronautics lab right in 1939 December 20th 1939 which makes tomorrow our birthday so we're glad you could be here and help us celebrate yeah so do you have any favorite fun facts about that air traffic management research that's so important that we do here yeah all right first well I was told there would be cake yeah we've research in air traffic management and you know a lot of the tools are behind the scenes there are things that people won't see every day I bet yeah but there are the kind of things that save people 5 minutes here 10 minutes they're on their way to somewhere right everyone has landed at an airport and it's kind of waited to get a gate right how do you optimize that and make people get to their gate faster how do you let people route around bad weather quickly and efficiently and save 5 minutes and a smoother ride to get to where you're going and these are time savings for us as passengers but that translates also to money savings for the airlines right and these things add a 5 minutes here 10 minutes there over the course of a year over cross all the airlines right these savings really add up and these are the things that a lot of the things that we've we've originated research here at NASA is awesome and I think some of these efficiencies have come from flying in the air some of them actually have come from trying to make the surface operations much more efficient and so really like Joey was saying it's it's all about time that's our most valuable commodity and so how do we how do we save our time and that's where we develop algorithms tools work really closely with air traffic controllers to give them tools to make their jobs easier and so that's something that we've been doing research on fundamentally for the last 30 years so yeah yeah that's going back it's not just research it's transferring it to the FAA you make them real yeah right right right they actually put it into use right yeah right yeah there's some tools in our air traffic control towers almost every air traffic control tower today has some technology that we have worked on in here at NASA I don't think people know that we have a question here from just me and my laptop what part of the traffic or air traffic management do you see controlled autonomously I think if if we think about how many of these operations that are going to be in the future of people people's minds you know race a little bit and you think about how how much how many new flights there will be the current system isn't set up to handle that many more flights that quickly so actually a lot of the functions to enable these new entrants are going to need to be automated as well as some of the processes on the existing side in order for them to know how to integrate and manage this new traffic as well but we're not going to have enough controllers that can talk to all of these aircraft to do all of these things all the time like they do with the aircraft today yeah so a lot of those functions are going to be automated so there will be a lot of automation to enable this to happen do I take any more oh yeah I mean there's there's plenty the chat is really blowing up people are very interested in this topic there's some some questions about you know how do you be so Hobbs 5-5-5 says how do you prevent midair collisions with air traffic yeah we're with air taxis yeah so like Joey was mentioning there's going to be new automation that's going to come on board the vehicle potentially as well as tools for air traffic management services so what are the intersection of tools that are onboard the vehicle as well as services that might be provided provided from potentially air traffic controllers or other entities and that's kind of what we're investigating and then where does automation help ensure that we reduce any issues in terms of safety impact so safety is kind of one goal how do you ensure safe operations yeah it's kind of the tools we developed they look at a few different layers right of how you make this have the air traffic management layer there's usually a strategic look ahead like how do we not put too many vehicles in one spot oh yeah it's really hard for them to avoid each other it's logically you kind of keep them apart through this ground automation and having them share what they're gonna do with each other but then more tactically a lot of onboard capabilities may be important to keep them separated yeah great so all these tools that you guys are talking about a lot of that work is done at aims here but also in all other NASA centers across the country right so you guys have a lot of partners yeah definitely so NASA Armstrong NASA Langley Glen almost all the NASA centers that are focused on aeronautics aren't contributing to making urban air mobility a reality oh this is pretty exciting yeah yeah a big collaborative effort yeah the window when did all this begin for urban air mobility and what's going on today yeah work is happening now so one of the areas of where this kind of first started in terms of NASA involvement is what we call the Grand Challenge franchise the Grand Challenge is an activity in which we are working collaboratively with the FAA as well as industry partners both vehicle industry partners and airspace industry partners okay to kind of develop an ecosystem so we can really begin testing out some of these concepts what does it mean to fly a vehicle what kind of data do we need to collect to help with the certification process understand the performance of these vehicles and then also start understanding what does it mean what kind of tools and technologies with huns software do we need to build to actually have some sort of air traffic management system for these vehicles as as many of them start coming up and becoming a reality so the Grand Challenge is a series of flight demonstrations and simulation activities we're where we really hope to explore all the safety cases as well as collect data to help us move the industry forward yeah make sense you get as many minds as possible thinking about it predicting what you have to work out now right and doing the work yeah yeah definitely it's definitely a very collaborative effort awesome great legit twitch channel asks where they be miniature airports for places to pick up and drop off that'd be cool yeah so some of the concepts that are coming up in terms of infrastructure which is actually a really important concept is a concept of vert apart to vert apat or Skyport sky paths however you wish to call it but you can kind of imagine like a helicopter pack right you know kitties could be on the ground or on actually the the top of a building right and so these could be locations where these aircraft could take off because remember they can take off vertically and land vertically so they don't need a runway yeah they don't need a runway like a normal aircraft today so that was what's gonna allow operations in an urban center right yeah is this gonna mean the end of traditional flight or is this really just complementary to everything we use today yeah it's definitely not an end to the current day aviation okay in fact you can think of it as a compliment to help you actually use current day aviation even more right so one can imagine that you might want to get from wherever you're located a suburb to your nearest airport and normally we would have to sit in traffic drive maybe half an hour or 40 minutes to get there who knows so depending on where you're located now what if you can take one of these air taxis or air shuttles to get to your airport now it's actually much easier to use a commercial aviation like we do today so these are just another form of transportation to help us use current day aviation yeah and about air taxis or air shuttles yeah you just kind of made it a distinction there do you think that these are gonna be taxis that I call up and I say I personally want to go to my specific friend's house or is it gonna be like a subway or a city bus that has a route so most likely as this industry develops initially you'll probably more be more like a air shuttle or an air Metro where you have a series of designated locations where you have pickups and drop-offs and at scheduled times okay that's mostly to help us understand what are the feasibility in the beginnings yeah of this type of Transportation but on-demand air mobility is something that industry as well as we are researching and investigating of how to enable it so we're actually looking at both how do we have a arrow Metro or air shuttle as well as on-demand urban air mobility okay yeah stay tuned pretty cool right yeah we have a question here from again from space warmers what elevation will they be flying at what if you're you're in the city do be weave through skyscrapers yeah good question good question so picture here so since these vehicles have kind of a wide range of configurations they have different cruising altitudes that they would fly at you can expect though a range of typically from some arts like a thousand to 4,000 feet is average that typical range of these of these vehicles of the urban air mobility vehicles that are a little bit larger than remember then some of the drones that have been flying below 400 feet and then they are also kind of smaller than your traditional aircraft because they only have about four to eight passengers typically okay so that's the altitude they would be flying at terms of weaving between skyscrapers we're looking at procedures as well as ways for these aircraft to fly safely um and that includes safety of the passengers on board as well as the safety of the people on the ground right of course I see a question here further for the both of you seriously gaming as what are Siobhan's Li and Joey's thoughts on noise pollution from these and what are their thoughts on potential objects falling to earth yeah that part definitely want to avoid the objects falling to earth and in general noise pollution speaks to a larger issue of kind of public acceptance of these kind of operations mm-hmm so we can solve a lot of technological problems and make sure things stay safe and efficient in the air space but if the public's not ready to accept these kind of operations for whatever reason whether its environmental including noise or something else then this won't ever take off so to speak right so part of the research when we do our testing is actually making sure we're starting to ask some of those questions and collect some initial data on public acceptance so that we can feed some of those conversations to see what kind of barriers might be there yeah it's a kind of that public acceptance question yeah so noise is an issue and I think you'll see a lot of the manufacturers of these vehicles designers of these vehicles and of the airspace procedures are kind of cognizant of that if they want to be aware of trying to minimize the impact or acceptability of these operations so it is something that is considered in the design of all the pieces of the system right right good to hear what's another question we have here Hobie's 555 would there be weather restrictions on air taxis yeah so just like today in commercial aviation today weather plays a big role and how how aviation you know goes on today and similarly it will play a role for these new vehicles for these urban air mobility vehicles one of the things that we're trying to understand is when we perform tests as part of the Grand Challenges understand what is your performance when can you fly at what gusts of winds are there limitations on your performance and then those are some of the things that we're really trying to investigate so we can answer that question in a better fashion once we have data on how these vehicles actually perform under different win under different wind wind levels as well as different types of precipitation yeah okay it's a really specific stuff yeah yeah really interesting kind of related to that is you know understand the performance of the vehicle so that it knows what it can handle situations can handle but then actually on the weather side actually doing the research to make sure that that informations available to those operators okay whether we use today for Aviation's really focus around airports and the in route environment and you know there's some specialized stuff for helicopters and cities but that all needs to scale up quite a bit in order to provide the right information to operators so that they can fly safely given the performance characteristics of their vehicle yeah so a lot of cities aren't outfitted for that level of granularity of weather all right so how do you get those weather services and other requirements develop so that you can actually enable these operations safely so that's a larger of research that we poke into and we also try and encourage industry and universities and other folks to come along with us on that research yeah kind of along those lines that whether it's actually very interesting in an urban center right yeah so as you have wind flow between buildings as you have kind of different types of Eddie's kind of put round off of building to building surfaces you have interesting effects that can occur and so that's really important for us to have some knowledge about and understand such that we can have safe safe these vehicles so that's actually a really big part which I was referring to you can imagine I felt that in cities right yeah of course walking between two skyscrapers yeah and yeah it's so good to know you're thinking about it let's see what other questions we got we one day see a return of airships or Zeppelin's ghosts of ETS who knows yeah so I you know airships the dirigibles have been have been around for quite some time and have been used you know obviously in the past and now we see the Goodyear blimp once in a while right so you know airships do have some some purpose and due off our use for some some use cases but how they're going to be integrated in airspace it's a similar question just like a lot of these new entrants how do how was your performance like what's your performance characteristics based on that how do we integrate you safely into our airspace so the same types of questions apply regardless of what what type of vehicle you may be yeah yeah but the vehicles you guys are talking about are much more smaller for a trek petrol one do you have any idea how much energy it takes to vertically lift the passengers gave a number of eight passengers but just in general yeah so typically what you what is desired is you want to have vertical lift up above 50 feet and such that you are climbing at a rate of about 100 feet per minute so the energy that's required obviously depends on the weight of that individual airframe plus the number of passengers or cargo that you might have onboard so I would say it actually does vary depending on your configuration of your vehicle mm-hmm but what is neat is the fact that there's been quite a bit of development and distributed electrical propulsion which means you can use these electrically powered rotors have them distributed across the airframe such that it's actually much easier to to provide it for further math that's a new technology so in that in that vehicle concepts right had the rotors along the wings yeah cool and the airframe when you guys say that that means this like the structure of the aircraft correct just how that aircraft is configured does it have two rotors four rotors that wing what does it look like yeah yeah yeah okay cool we probably have time for a few more questions yeah we have a question here from decked the werewolf what Pera densities would be required to make long-range high-capacity flight possible using battery power hmm yeah power is a big issue yeah yeah so the manner in which battery technology is developing is is something that industry is really moving forward with things that they're concerned about is their charge and discharge rates and then also how quickly can you recharge because your your actual battery on boards but you can fly another mission or go on another trip right and so there is quite a range of energy density that's required again depending on your configuration right depending on your mission profile am i flying 50 miles or am i flying 40 miles right so depending on the mission you wish to achieve you do see a kind of a range in terms of the battery or power requirements for that vehicle and just bring it back to the question of the vertebrates kind of designing the system and the power requirements you know you you may want your vertebrates close to a substation that can supply the right amount of power to recharge you quickly so all of these things are definitely interrelated yeah you you sort of touched on this already but maybe to sum it up for Fergus Diggins can you comment about the possible infrastructure that might be needed for the shorter range trips will use existing airports or combination of existing and new you talk about rooftops but like how did you sum that up yeah I think that if we're talking about a new mode of transportation with new use cases there's probably going to be new infrastructure needed and that's when we talk about these verda ports and and charging stations and and all of these these things that don't exist as well as things like surveillance as well as weather monitoring we talked about earlier surveillance like keeping an eye on on those like knowing where the vehicles are yeah right not so much how they get used but yeah just where the vehicles are right now I know freak radars and they can see all the bigger airplanes in the sky keep track of that infrastructure doesn't necessarily let us have full visibility into the area where these things might be flying so surveillance as well as again the recharging and the landing and the takeoffs all that's infrastructure that definitely has to be considered when designing a system and I would say infrastructure it's actually a big big part of this right and the FAA is as well as NASA as well as industry and other research institutions they are looking to understand what are the infrastructure requirements and there are sensory requirements but also things such as lighting requirements right and what kind of procedures are need to be developed for that type of infrastructure so there's a whole host of information that would come along with the infrastructure that we meet that will be needed for these vehicles to land or take off from locations near us right Sears there's lots of interesting research there yeah yeah research kind of lead the way to those answers yeah right yeah yeah discovers the questions yeah yeah that's interesting maybe just one more and this question came in a while ago from Hobbes 555 so maybe it's been answered but I want to know is this like flying cars what's the mission can we call these flying cars or is that something else well so if you if you want to call them flying cars technically can I mean some of these vehicle configurations do have wheels right when we're landing cool some do some don't right so if you have wheels and you can actually do taxis I guess technically if you can hear y'all the flying car you know people do call them urban air mobility vehicles do the fact they can perform a number of different functions and have slightly different operations than what we were used to today right so the terms you use can change but essentially it's like an air taxi a flying car I know whatever you wish to call it yeah and I think that the car implies a lot of freedom right and that's that automatically we were mentioning earlier yeah so most of these the initial vehicles are probably more like the air Metro Siobhan Julie was mentioning earlier right there kind of designated where they're going to go so if you wanted to call that a car sure you could but in general it's more like a subway or yeah it's it's going where it's going to go and okay it can help you get there quickly just turn it off yeah okay cool all right well let's move on to our next topic so that we don't run out of time but we're gonna come back to work since later so I know that NASA has already done a bunch of research for several years that really help lay the groundwork for this urban air mobility work that you're doing so Joey you were a big part of that can you tell us about the system you worked on yeah so for the past five years or so we have been working on how do you manage small drones at low altitude at kind of a big scale how do you have thousands of small drones flying over the state of California taking care of things okay so again that's the current air traffic management system was not designed to handle that kind of traffic so how do we enable those use cases in those business cases to occur without overloading the current system and keeping everything as safe as possible so that's what came about our research was called UTM UAS traffic management and again us traffic man just means how do you manage drones all right how do you manage travel yeah the drop the UAS is the drone yes right but yeah we were focused again on small drones we're talking with fifty five pounds and under okay and we're talking about low altitude typically 400 feet and under yeah but again you can accomplish a lot of things just in that airspace with these kind of vehicles and it made us ask certain questions and develop certain systems and test certain things with partners and the FAA that lays the groundwork for some of the still open questions for urban air mobility that we have been talking yeah yeah that sounds familiar yeah kind of work you're doing you mentioned lots of applications what are some examples for small drones there there are a lot usually the you can actually classify them into some of the more interesting ones into the 3ds dirty dangerous and dull jobs there's a lot of jobs you can do with these drones that can actually keep people safer that are doing them right infrastructure inspection for example you know looking at a cell tower taking pictures and making sure it's working correctly people die climbing those towers every year right and and other kind of powerline inspection these jobs aren't always the safest jobs but you can make them safer by using drones right and then things like there's agricultural applications as well taking pictures of your field and doing analysis on that as well as public safety things fire and police agencies are using these more and at the local level large company talking about delivering things to your doorstep again all this can happen with drones under fifty five pounds and under four hundred feet so there's a lot of things you can actually do with them right yeah for sure and how do you will let everyone do all those things simultaneously and keep the airspace safe exactly that was kind of the research that we were looking at yes because that's always the key really yeah what was your role exactly so I was the chief engineer for the project so it was really about kind of coordinating a lot of the technical aspects of it I did focus a lot on the software aspect of it so we talked about automation earlier in the airspace management how it's gonna have to be automated in the future to handle all of this traffic so how do you build a system that enables all this stuff to happen you know it's it's cloud-based and it leverages a lot of best practices in the software industry with our knowledge and expertise at NASA for air traffic management right so how do you marry those two things and that's really what what we were looking at and Joey won't admit this but he was the brains behind the the UTM project and I would say that Joey and his team most recently won the NASA software the Year award so that's actually kind of a big deal so give Joe a shout-out for that yeah yeah we we have a lot of brains on the project which is great right that's how you make it successful in Elon perspectives having a lot of people with a lot of different backgrounds to come to that is how you kind of get to these innovative solutions and NASA's a great place to kind of allow that to happen yeah awesome Congrats Thanks so what are some specific abilities you you gave the drones or the system like you want to keep them keep them separate specific examples you know we had sort of a clean sheet to begin thinking about how to get this done really again it's a clean sheet but with the understanding of how the airspace works and the other vehicles work right so with those bounds what what do we want the system to do one of the key things is how do we help make sure the drones don't run into each other right yes for starters helps them stay safely separated you know at some degree also how do we keep them separate from traditional aviation how do we make sure they don't fly into other aircraft right can you build some system that helps helps with that process you know one layer of this isn't gonna be the end all and be all of all these answers but how do we start this process of keeping the airspace safe also how do we allow folks that are doing these operations and the vehicles that are doing a supper to be identifiable right we don't want just rogue or unidentified flying around the airspace is they need to know what's there right to keep the airspace against safe there's kind of a security aspect to that as well and then how do you have some priority for important operations right so for example recently there was actually a drone that delivered a human kidney for transplant that was actually transplanted into a person Wow successfully right so that was demonstrated one one important use case for drones yeah how do we let that happen without being hindered by drones that are delivering hot dogs to people to make sure the hot dog drones get out of the way right kidney drone come through these priority operations need to be thought of as important in the system as we design it out yeah there's a lot more of the important class of operations you you can you can think about but the idea is how do we make sure that can actually occur right then all of this can occur right you'll get your hot dogs you'll get it but after the kidney is revered thirty seconds later and I would actually add the services that Joey just laid out they are extensible and applicable for any new entrant right so Joey was talking about how they were applied for drones yeah if you can think about for these larger urban air mobility vehicles for any new entrant or Zeppelin these same tenants can be applied so it's actually a really great foundation for us to build off of and extend for new entrants into our national airspace yeah yeah it's so clear how right supports the same things challenge Lee's working right I mean the key thing is you know the current system again the air traffic controllers don't want to be controlling a 40-pound drone at 200 feet right they're not you have enough to do with their crane they don't want to hire 10,000 more operators so again they're kind of this is the automation of the airspace and allowing these new entrants and again a lot of these things will translate over to this this air taxi urban air the ability world yeah finding out how much of that transfers over how much of it has to change a little bit but we have a foundation to start with totally yeah yeah so they're kind of enters a Jenni CD 25s questionnaire management will be autonomous and it will be autonomous it will have a autonomous aspects right it doesn't mean you just push a button in the airspace is completely right free to go and the autonomous the the I thought it was nature of it will increase over time right you know when you get started you only have so many operations and you might have a good amount of human supervision but the unit's things scale out how much of that can be automated and making sure you do it again in a safe way it's more of like a continuing right so it's there's gonna be pieces of it that are automated some functions and then how does that can house that continuum grow that's right over time yeah make sense building up on it right exactly yeah so the drone traffic management system what does it look like or feel like for a user a pilot like if I want to fly my drone what am I going to see yeah in the future hopefully it would be very transparent it shouldn't be a big burden to actually use the system so there's actually be a layer between you and the airspace and it would be kind of a service provider to get into the airspace almost like a cell service provider right you want to make phone calls you have a cell service provider yeah you can talk to other cell service providers plainly so you would have one of those providers that get you access to the airspace right you would tell them what you want to do maybe your intent I want to fly from here to here and I'm gonna do it about this time mm-hmm the idea is that these service providers share that information amongst each other they do what's necessary to keep the airspace safe and be conflicted and and messages flowing that need to flow and you as a pilot just take care of your mission right you just fly your operation how much of that operation is automated and not automated you know that depends in the future how far you go but a pilot would be in charge of that operation and would do it cleanly and receive information back from these service providers about any changes in the airspace or things you need to know right like there's a storm coming up exactly there's an emergency operation that's right yeah that kidneys coming through right no it's something I know I was just gonna add that I think there's the whole host of different types of operations yeah it kind of lends itself to setting up different missions right and then I'd also add that the tools and the technologies and the integration with the partners that was built up under UTM I think is a great model they interface with a whole host of industry partners along with the FAA that same model of collaborative innovation is what we're aiming for yeah yeah and I wanted to go back to earlier you somebody asked about like traffic light source I forget what the question was maybe you're saying there would be digital traffic lights right not physical things up in this guy but you told me that we can think of the drone traffic management is like rules of the road that we know when driving right yeah you know we think about driving today the folks that are driving in general you hope and expect that they know the rules of the road right they know yeah what a red light means they knew what to do when you both come to a stop sign at the same time they know how fast you can go on the freeway and how to change lanes those kind of things don't exist for drone traffic right so how do what are those procedures what are those rules who has the right away in certain scenarios and how do you share that information to make sure that everyone's aware of the same rule set and those other things so that is a lot of the research we do as well so that's really the drone traffic management system it's you know defining those rows LaRose the procedures making sure everyone's checked out on all those things to enable all these operations to happen yeah yeah and you know and you have on your phone it does you want as a traffic jam ahead right so that's the next level of service was right and that would be part of the ecosystem as well oh there is weather ahead or there is a lot of drones over here so maybe you should go over there right sharing data so that you can make those decisions yeah awesome yeah that's really clear cool oh we have a question here from Chen Dane will Dee's Jones have an option for multitasking for example the drunk could be delivering a kidney and also acting as a traffic camera in route so will they have like different yeah I think the person waiting for the kidney would hope maybe this it's focused on the kidney but in general yeah it's all about the vehicle capabilities right what did they design the vehicle to do and the idea with our research with traffic management and and and all those sorts of things how do we make sure we don't cut off any of those use cases how do we make sure we enable folks to do the things they need and want to do in the air space safely so yes and we have looked at drones being repurposed in routes and right mm-hmm you may be doing regular traffic surveillance but then maybe there's a search and rescue thing that has to happen and that drone could be repurposed in flight and take off and do something so this idea of repurposing is definitely out there yeah and I would say for whether it's a single task or repurposing or multitasks you know what you need is a secure communication and navigation platform right so you have to be able to communicate to that that vehicle that drone or that you am and be able to have that communication be secure and that's I think as you have multiple tasks that still is the foundation is how do you have safe and efficient operations right yeah cool so this year you guys actually had a big milestone yeah right yeah tell us about what went down right I mean we've been doing this since 2014 you know researching this drone traffic management system and we've been kind of building up in complexity of the kind of cases that you can handle so when we got to this summer we actually executed a flight test to demonstrate the most mature version of the system we have and we do that an urban environment so we flew in downtown Reno and we flew in Corpus Christi Texas with the help of the FA test sites at those areas and many many partners doing that with us right and and showing how this system would work in an urban environment and finding out where the limits are where the gaps are and where it works really well that's what we did this summer and that was a really exciting time for us awesome yeah you guys got video of that didn't you oh yeah we probably have something you tell us about if we can for sure oh yeah you're looking at Reno here are you looking at a couple of drones taking off from the top of a building and you can see they're flying near the casinos and they're coming really close to each other but actually more space then you can tell from the ground here and the key thing is that the two pilots for those vehicles know what the other one is doing because they've been sharing information you can see one holding up here all another one passes by again that's the rules of the road stuff we were talking about so testing all those concepts and here you seen kind of a Mission Control Center with folks from NASA as well as the Nevada Test Site working together to execute these these activities sweet interesting so you were not the only one there were you doing you guys yeah I had the chance to go out and observe the UTM tests both in Reno and Texas and I would say seeing the drones flying in that urban environment really makes it tangible right this is a reality that's coming to see how it's a combination of software they leverage cloud services plus the drone technology plus the interplay of the folks on the ground you really see what Joey was referring to as earlier as kind of the National Airspace kind of in a miniature version you're running in these field trials which is great to see and it really lends itself to help us understand what are still some of the major questions that we have to address so all the data that's collected from these demonstrations is really I think very valuable oh yeah what was your experience like Tiffani well I was going to cover and help them amplify you know the research that they're doing for the public but I mean I would say Reno was cold and then Texas was very very hot but I would say you know it was really a great experience to see the team kind of just I feel like every test day was different mom they learned something one day and they applied it the next day and even when there were challenges to see them all kind of come together six come up with a plan fix it the next day was was really great to see and to have covered this project for like I don't know three four years now it's kind of like great to see you know they've come together yeah this accomplishment with them it's it was really really cool that's awesome yeah but what would you say you learned in the end from these tests in downtown yeah you know maybe it sounds kind of silly to say out loud but it's really important to know that we learned that the system works yes right actually you'd actually do the things we've thought it should be able to do right it helps drones stay separate again it's not the only layer of doing that right but it's a key layer of doing that you can make sure you have access for priority operations you can actually identify the drones in the airspace digitally and in other ways so all of those pieces were executed in that in that airspace and the other key thing is finding out more about what it takes to fly in that environment right like what kind of what kind of things makes this hard right let's go there and fly that and it's not again it's not just flying one drone right a lot of folks can demonstrate something with with one drone and a lot of folks have done that a lot of use cases but bringing a full system out with many stakeholders trying to collaboratively manage this airspace and execute Shen's is really important to do and finding out where where more work needs to be done and where things look like they're solved right and that's what these flight tests do for us right perfect yeah and so what's next for the drone traffic management project so a lot of this you know we've been continually handing off to the FAA we talked about a partnership live but it really is a tight partnership yeah we meet with them often probably more often than they would like right we're talking with them quite often to make sure we understand what the FAA is thinking about where this is going to make sure that what we're research is tracking with that and maybe leading it a little bit if we can but they're going to be executing a pilot program as well a second part of a previous pilot program and we want to help them in that execution and really that's about taking the technologies that we've been developing with the FAA and our industry partners and making them real in the airspace it's an important step in that direction so we're gonna we're gonna keep going that way all right excellent we have a question here from resonated games is there any fundamental concept that those in the private or commercial sector testing of the drones should be paying attention to there are so many pieces to this right so a lot of folks are specialized in a certain area might be on the platform itself building you know detect and avoid sensor how do you actually see things in the airspace and get out of their way and I think that continuing to push all of those lanes is important I think understanding the ecosystem as a whole is also really important I think folks that do work on important sensors and it's important platforms it's important for them to also understand the ecosystem in which those drones will operate so just trying to keep pace and understand where the research is heading and where the FAA is signaled things are going just trying to stay abreast of all that stuff is really important here's a comment on the during traffic management system maybe you can respond twisted metals asks the pilot will be watching a movie just like now 95 percent of the time so a drone pilot will be watching on screen I don't know I would love to watch movies 95 95% of drone pilots I understand okay are they watching their flight on screen oh I see are they physically watching the aircraft or are they watching some representation of their operation on a screen I guess that's the question yeah I think it's more the latter right again because we're trying to build a system so that these vehicles can go beyond visual line of sight of the operator of the pilot oh yes all right so they're not gonna be able to just watch it in the sky right right and that's how you enable all these business cases you can't have someone watching the drone if you're gonna go deliver that thing yeah you know fire whales away you can't have someone or a line of someone's watching that so how do you build a system that allows that so yeah there would be some representation of the operation occurring that the person that's in charge of that operation would have access to yeah it might be as simple as a moving map with some alerts that are coming on to it write something like you'd see on your you know for for your regular driving right something that's letting you know where you're going or it could be more advanced right it could be a 3d view it could be a first-person view really depends on the mission and the environment you're flying in and what the future rules actually are to do that so yes yes yeah yeah I would add regardless of whether it's a drone pilot or a pilot onboard one of these new types of vehicles there's gonna be different ways of interacting with the vehicle and controlling the vehicle just as automation increases and there's changes in how those vehicles fly I think there's going to be some changes in that traditional pilot flight deck or cockpit relationship yes and how you interface with that it's gonna change and that's also another interesting area of research all the way from you know human-computer interface logic that goes behind that as well as what button do I push to to land or take off or is there an easy fly button right so there's all kinds of new ways to engage with with aircraft whether it's a drone or some of these new vehicles and I think that's a really interesting area yeah I think one of the key things we're seeing a lot of research on from industry as well as you know the NASA side is how do these pilots maybe control more than one of these right it doesn't have to be a one-to-one relationship between one pilot and one active operation or can you expand that further right can you actually have three people controlling eight vehicles or can it be one controlling too like what are the limits of that and tools need to exist in order to make sure that again happens very safely yeah we have a question here from Tamil 101 is there any corporation with autonomous car research I expect there would be similar challenges and opportunities for with communication and control so I think the same principles of of autonomous car autonomous vehicle self-driving cars however you wish to call it those some of those same principles are I think important in aviation as well so what can I understand what my environment is presenting to me right so do I have some awareness of what my environment is for airplanes that would involve or aircraft and drones it would involve weather alright knowing how strong your communication signal is to your base operations but all of those same types of questions about communication safe communication reliable communication understanding of the environment around you being able to react appropriately to the environment around you knowing the rules of the road that Joey kind of reference whether you're actually on the road or flying and flying in the air those are all same principles I'm glad yeah yeah make sense cool I want to jump back to another topic that I want to make sure we don't miss of course one of the coolest things I recently learned about the urban air mobility research is the simulation work that you guys do yeah can you tell us about that yeah sure so you know I think for all our twitch fans out there you guys might have Microsoft Flight Simulator have used that so just like you could emulate flying a Cessna or a piper or even like a 747 we have advanced flight simulators here at Ames they are kind of a combination of flight simulators some are fixed meaning they don't move and some move and actually allow you to see all feel all the forces that you would experience like you were flying in in real life so using we have a lots of different kinds of simulators and it's not just we have that the fact that we have those simulators is that we have or we're developing performance models for these new types of vehicles and so we can know then how they actually fly right right I don't exist yet so you have to invent the right model of it right exactly it's to take some concept vehicles understand how these vehicles would fly with their performance be and then how would they actually fly in an emulated world in our airspace and go through some of those same questions overall been talking about now how do I interact with my controls do I have a joystick like I would for a helicopter like a cyclic or do I have something else and what is that mode of interaction those are questions that we can also think about for these simulators yeah along with how do i interface with some new traffic management system specifically for my vehicles building off the work that Joey's been doing so there's all kinds of different things we can investigate with these simulators right testing everything and how it comes together exactly yeah right and we're gonna see what this looks like let's do that simulation video and tell us what we're seeing sure this is gonna be so this is a video from one of our fixed base flight simulators so flight simulator that does not move this is what from one of our researchers Mike fury and his simulator here you can see that it shows a vehicle taking off of vertically and now it's moving forward in flight and what's actually really interesting is some of these vehicles as they move forward in flight have this transition period because you have to transition from vertical takeoff to forward flight and helicopters that kind of occurs instantaneously but for these vehicles you're gonna have this transition period and that's interesting to kind of understand and now you can see the vehicle flying in an urban center in this case it's a model of San Francisco and our simulators we can model almost any type of urban environment or you know any landscape that we wish to understand or understand the procedures of flying how would I land how would I come in for my approach these are some of the things that we can explore so you can see this vehicle now coming in for its approach and its landing and this is an interesting question as you come in for your approach and your landing you can see that vehicle kind of pitch up a little bit so how does that feel right so if Joey and I we're sitting in the back with coffees in hand yeah that coffee spill or kind of how would we get a war me first so understanding that passenger experience is actually a really big part of some of the work that these simulators can do so it's not quite this simulator but we have another motion simulator that allows us to understand what is the passion passenger experience what are the forces of elements yeah what does it feel like right I'm glad you're here I got sick on a whale watch this year so I would like you to find so these simulators this this for me was one of the coolest things I heard about do you have a favorite aspect of this researcher what's a really cool thing you want to share yeah so I'd say the number of questions that this research is kind of highlighting is really interesting and the fact that it's this new era of aviation this new mode of transportation is is very exciting so as this technology kind of develops and these these new vehicle configurations come to life and we're starting to explore them I think the really interesting thing is that this is a area of work that's going to continue so all those folks that are interested in understanding or maybe even participating in this area you have a chance to really be part of it so people out there have a chance to be part of this new era of Transportation they can actually be involved which i think is really neat right yeah this is by no means finished and said all right we ready help me exactly yeah awesome what are you doing what I'm looking forward to or whatever yeah you know just taking a step back and looking at it from the outside ameri-ghen a little closer to being Jetsons world right we're talking about flying cars before yeah you know we're still a few steps away from that but you know we're getting there we're gonna hopefully have some more operations in the urban environment than we had before great they're gonna happen safely they're gonna get us closer to exactly where we want to go it's real it's really neat to see that's totally cool yeah got a bunch of questions piling up we do yeah so eventually you were speaking about like the pasture passenger experience and things like that legit twitch channel has a question well people will be required to wear parachutes what kind of safety measures would we expect in oxygen masks life jackets things like that yeah I know and I think that's a great question and it raises the fact that as these vehicles are getting certified there is that aspect of ensuring safe operations and in the case of off-nominal events ensuring that those folks on board have the appropriate mechanisms to ensure safety of Larry right so just like we have the safety briefing we all love to sit in when we get when we go fly on the aircraft there has to be some think most likely similar for for passenger carrying vehicles even if they're urban air mobility vehicles so safety is the number-one concern for us for the FAA and for industry that's developing these vehicles so there will most likely be something similar yeah we just don't know quite what yet Johnny cz 25 trying to pronounce these names well the will it have aircraft cameras with special software to create a landing point I know that you have worked on yeah landing so there is ins there's a there's a lot in that question yeah because it it speaks to the number of ways you can accomplish things right so yes you even you look at the small drones they do have cameras of different types that help identify if a landing location is safe to land or not because you can plan ahead of time I'm going to land in this open field right and I'm gonna go there and I'm gonna land that everything's good but you get there and there's a car there or people are having a picnic right right do you have a system on board that can help you identify that and then go to an alternate location so some visual technology is used to do that some of that has been developed at NASA Langley for example to do those sorts of things and in general when they're planning their operations there would be some visualization probably of where they would like to go and how they would like to get there so you could put a point on a screen and then that be translated into a flight plan and that can be communicated to the system all these things are things that are possible and we've seen examples of already yeah yeah Annie okay so you're all over that hate on that yeah we have a question here goofy joy resonator ticket game says if you could snap your fingers and solve one aspect of industrial drone flight what would it be question I mean if you can solve the detect and avoid problem for all vehicles in all classes with a sample of a finger that that was doing live right so that that's that's the last layer safety right how do you make sure that I see that thing that's coming at me and it's very close and I'm out of its way that means one drone being able to see another one coming and move each drone could avoid the things that needs to avoid whether they're static things on the ground okay um maybe yesterday there wasn't a crane there and today there is a crane there right and that's not on my maps how do I detect that as well as other things flying in the air whether it's a traditional Cessna with a real pilot on board that can't see your little drone yeah or maybe doesn't have the same maneuverability as an urban air mobility vehicle how do how do these vehicles detect those problems and then avoid them right if you could solve that problem you you get a long way towards a lot of the safety questions that need to be answered yeah and there's a lot of ways to do that and there's a lot of folks working on that and there's some very good solutions toward it but if it could be universally solved that would be that would be awesome how about this one from hovercat will the flight controllers and software firmware be open-source it's something to think about yeah so that's an interesting question for some of these vehicles you're their manufacturers that are developing some of these vehicles are have a whole host of configurations and some of them are working with the traditional flight management computers or flight management systems that you have in commercial aircraft today and some are some are you you know depending on the safety cases as well as the secure communication piece that's required it might not be quite open-source but just like we have simulators today that help us understand the performance as well as the controls for those vehicles I'm sure something similar will be developed so that folks out there who want to try them out or can want to fly them and and their own simulator will be able to do so but as as the industry is developing their tools they're pulling from you know existing tools for flip for flight controls today as well as developing their own so it's kind of a mixed bag right now okay yeah you know for the small drones we're looking at in and generally everything should be performance based can you do that how can you prove you can stay within the bounds of a certain performance envelope okay like I know I can control my vehicle under all these conditions and I can show you how I do that mm-hmm now that may mean you use an open-source pieces or everything's open source or not I can't say that if there was a single open source solution for a piece of that and it was proven to perform in a certain way then that would be very valuable yeah but I don't think it'll be a requirement that everyone uses an open source in particular element okay yeah yeah I see another question here but you made me think of it you mentioned the word security so legit twitch channel s could drones be subject to hackers will there be security measures in place to repel unwanted or harmful signals so the answer the first question is yes definitely I mean any any piece of IT technology right it can be some potentially that's right if it's not built correctly so the answer is yes and again it's part of not necessarily getting to you want to be as secure as possible at all layers but in general we know that's not likely to happen so how do you build enough layers and such that as you layer them all on top of each other that overall the whole thing stays secure right it's kind of a Swiss cheese approach they call if you layer the Swiss cheese in certain ways you cover up all the holes and you can't see through it security I think that's what you want to look at with these drones so that even if a given drone was hacked let's say that it can't cause damage to the further system or the folks on the ground does it have other safety mechanisms to make sure that no harm can really come from that so there's a lot of work in cyber security related to not just the drones themselves but the traffic management system as a whole that if that was hacked that would be bad as well right so how do you build all these layers and yeah yeah I think security has to be the vehicle itself the communication protocols between the vehicles and their operators so there's like Joey was saying multiple layers of security are really required so anything that's learned from this fear of drones can be obviously applied to other types of vehicles as well so it's a question that's something applicable for all all vehicles yeah all right good and general research wise we like to consider security a first-class citizen in the research process right it's not something you tack on at the end there's nothing you make sure you're thinking about an engaging industry within the FA with and cybersecurity professionals with as you build up the system because you don't want to come up again with a great technological solution that easily hacked and the whole thing falls apart breaks so you want to make sure its robust from the beginning yeah exactly consider that a long way yeah how third I just totally butchered your name how do you deal with increased radio traffic yeah so I it there's probably a couple pieces of that one is like overuse of a given channel right there's just too many people talking on his chat sake right and there's also just kind of a certain band being overused for example command control we talked about earlier that's one of the things we looked at in our flight test in Reno and Corpus Christi was for these small drones command control different different radio frequencies we use when do they get saturated when do you have problems with them turns out if you you know if you fly near an apartment building there's a lot of people with Wi-Fi routers and if you're conflicting with that you may have trouble communicating with their drone these are really known issues but actually kind of taking a look at it in a real open environment was important and I would kind of add to that you would have you would want to understand what kind of concept would not saturate like a radio frequency too much so you want to ensure that any concept that's being developed Joey has mentioned that air traffic controllers may not want to be talking to every one of those every one of those UAM vehicles so that's part of the concept so understanding hey how is this actually gonna work that's a really important part of ensuring that we don't saturate certain pieces that we know have limits to them and that includes spectrum as well as frequency so that's coast but that goes to the foundational research what's the concept of operations yeah a lot of what you've been saying today is plan for that right challenge I know figure out what it is today and yeah and plan around it yeah here's a turbine air mobility question from widget tricks channel again could this research eventually lead to people being able to own and operate their own air taxi do you think that's coming yeah I think there's gonna be lots of different use cases and modes of flying I think there's gonna be cases where some made maybe some folks may be able to own their own vehicles most likely you'll be serviced like we use today we've seen a big rise in service based technology right so we're all used whether it's vehicles or food delivery services yes right so we've seen more of that coming along so most likely urban air mobility will be accessible as a surface service but who knows right you know maybe we can all really be the Jetsons so Joey's vision of the future may come to life yeah we're close it's funny I mentioned the Jetsons and yet like when I told my mom we were talking about drones on the show today she said oh like the Bruce Willis movie like element that was like yeah mom exactly like that because a question from hurricanes what's your a reasonable tip for a flying taxi driver great question so I would say I go back to like the foundation so what is the National Airspace you gotta know your rules of the road you have to know your procedures you have to know your safety and your certification aspects if you know those right you can fly safely and get to where you want to go from point A to point B you have to have those foundations just get like a driver's license before you operate great you've got to have some sort of certification before you before you fly yeah for sure yeah the old joke is what a Seabiscuit in the third that's my tip so that's it you guys actually understood that question differently I was taking it I was gonna say 10% 15% my hairdresser what's the tip in a right relationship it's awkward but am I saying I want all of all of the advice that she finds we gave I want my driver yes he Tyvek well read up on all of that right right all right well let's take a few more yeah we have Joseph urban here says well cargo air taxis be allowed to fly autonomously before passenger air taxis so maybe Joey and I will tag-team this one but I'll start I think as autonomous applications come forth certification I go back to that because that's also part of this how do you certify and an autonomous system right so that's a question that we have and we're doing research to explore what that means generally folks do believe you know car flying cargo may come before flying passengers right just as a natural progression but there are still lots of questions even if you're a cargo autonomous flight mm-hmm yeah no I totally agree I think but cargo stuff is where we'll learn a lot probably before the passenger stuff but that's a somewhat separate question from how autonomous they're allowed to be in the air space how do they prove that they can still stay safe you know you have the benefit of not having people on board but you still can't have it doing bad things in the air space or to anything on the ground right so there's a lot of questions to answer but I would guess yeah a lot of the things in cargo would happen prior to passenger activity mm-hmm make sense I think it goes back to what you said Joey its performance based solution right so let's understand the performance of these vehicles and then how do we integrate them into our national air space you know those are still the questions that need to be resolved yeah always the same cool here's a cool idea from space TV net they're asking will augmented reality be used to display virtual roads in the sky could you do that yeah definitely can we sort of have and we've seen it and we've done a little bit here as well awesome and the roads you know it can be as simple as just you know cylinders that you know you have to stay within but again when we're getting to these beyond visual insight things and there's not necessarily a pilot on board for the small drones obviously be hard to carry a pilot um you know it it is more about how much can s be an autonomous operation right but visualizing your plan visualizing the airspace structure visualizing different aspects of your operation augmented reality could be a key part of that we actually tested some of that in Texas as well we had folks with the goggles on looking at the data from the air traffic side as well as the management side of that and interacting with the aircraft in the air in terms of you know zooming in on them and saying information that's available digitally so you could see folks managing in a dense environment maybe just being aware of everything that's going on it could have a lot of value so yeah a lot of some work is actually going on in that direction already that's awesome that seems like a perfect use for that kind of psychology yeah yeah we have a question here from Megaman bxr do you think drones will play a bigger part in crime prevention ie monitor the streets overhead in real time etc we already know that a lot of public safety organizations are looking at using drones more and more um yeah and if you think about safety and security one of the big things we've seen a lot of success on you can just see it in the news is you know search and rescue operations cities are able to buy these drones that can actually see heat on the ground so at night they can be flying and see a lost child in a field right and and then send folks to that location you know obviously you can do a lot of good things with drones right yeah one of the other use cases is a fire department wanting to send a drone out ahead of the truck because it can get there faster to survey the scene before the people get there to fight the fire mm-hmm that's another use case that people envision again the airspace has to be ready for that go back to the the hot dog drones you they have to get out of the way of that that fire drone coming through right so without a unified a system to share that information you can't really make that happen completely but yeah there's a lot of interest in from police and fire and other agencies to use these for the things that they already do I think we already see a lot of emergency response applications right I think with the recent fires here in California we saw some of that here as well and the tools provided a great insight for some of those for example firefighters to fight to fight the fires that were we're blazing and then also for like volcanic eruptions there's been you there's been a whole host of other use cases for surveying and providing emergency response but like Joey was saying we need the rules of the road there right how these aircraft are going to operate or these drones are gonna operate to really enable them to do their missions right and we think about you know Public Safety keeping the public safe but these drones can actually keep the first responders safe as well right so they can send a drone to the top of roof to see bad guys or whatever it might be or someone who might help without actually putting people in harm's way first right yeah so a bublik safety does go both ways so there's a lot of really good uses for this in the police and fire realm right and in some cases like in a testing I didn't know in Corpus Christi we had the fire department there with their drone as well so working closely with the research in helping exactly yeah we had the fire department as well Corpus Christi police and fire were great partners awesome they're organized by the FAA test site in Texas and again they had drones already in their inventory they're using them permissions already you're participating with us in the flight testing right yeah getting some feedback on the concept as a whole and us understanding how they are to use their drones and make sure that the traffic management system and the concept still accommodates what they would like to do yeah it's really important to get that feedback early and often so yeah we're already seeing these agencies do that and the police were interested in using it obviously to identify drones right like if in the future there's more of these in the air they want to know that they're supposed to be there or they're allowed to be there or they're doing something good and not bad so uh police who have an interest in knowing that the airspace is safe around the public as well of course yeah yeah yeah I have a question here that's making me picture the fifth elements and dohno asks with drones you can have many many small missions starting and ending constantly so how do you ensure efficient use of airspace with an unknown number of vehicles entering the airspace at any time it sounds like a lot of unknowns there's a lot of potential groans yeah and I think you do want to take a step approach right a gradual approach you know we don't have to build the system right now to handle 20,000 operations a minute than a city block right they don't have to have that system ready today yeah but how can you start to enable 30 40 50 operations over a city at once right and then you'll start to see where there are some issues with them sharing the airspace or information so that they can all accomplish what they want to do and it slowly you can build up those densities and that's kind of an our approach in the research yeah and we see that approach being adopted as well in industry right as they come up with standards around this based on our research to help inform the use of the airspace they're not looking to solve the problem 20 years from now they want to enable more and more operations today and tomorrow and it is that scaled approach so we'll come up with those solutions we want to make sure that the architecture and the concept will support them in the future don't box off any solutions and and it's it's gonna work it's it's gonna work and I would even up level that complexity right so you can have drones operating below 400 feet then above that you could have these electric urban air mobility vehicles flying across urban centers and then above that your commercial air traffic so how do you have interoperability across all of those layers and that same density of operations and that's actually where where the real fun research is kind of like where where some of our work comes into play is how do you have that air traffic management system to support all of these new entrants and all this density of operations we respect in the future right I'd raise you one up level right now go 60,000 feet right so really additional air traffic and then you have folks that want to fly over 60,000 feet rows no not maybe autonomous vehicles maybe not but how do they show that airspace up there with autonomous vehicles how do they get up there first and the phrase in an efficient way it's actually busy exactly so all these things have to interoperate and to work well together yeah that's a level of cartoon yeah oh I love space for you don't take maybe one more question are there well we have a question here what was the biggest barrier for you personally getting hired but we always get questions like this and people want to know like how did you get started at NASA and you know yeah yeah your background exactly sure so um so I'm an aerospace engineer so that's what I studied in school that's what I got my my bachelor's and my master's in and to be honest I've always been passionate about aircraft and flight and specifically flight controls and that's how I got started but I think there's a whole host of opportunities and avenues I don't think you have to study aerospace engineering or necessarily even just aero so there's there's a whole different set of fields and disciplines that make our research a reality right we have people who are psychologists engineers you know analysts people who work with data so there's a you can really do anything it's all I think it's all about the passion if you're interested in kind of seeing how we can push the bounds you bring in all of these new entrants bring in an innovation into air traffic management I think there's so many ways you could come in and play a role here and just to illustrate that with this drone traffic management project that we had we had folks that were Aero engineers that are important to understanding the system and how the vehicles work and and all those sorts of things I'm a computer engineer so I'm not an aero engineer by training so that's important in kind of building help the systems we had a lot of computer scientists computer engineers helping with this as well and then you do get systems engineers and physicists and other folks that really matter and doing these human factors people right that understand again Siobhan Julie was talking earlier about what are these new control systems look like how do people interact with them it's a completely new system we're talking about so I don't really know how the human needs to interact that's gonna impact them exactly and what makes what makes their job easier or harder right so all of those kind of folks are really important in building out a system like UTM and that's what we had on our team yeah it sounds like it makes sense really you've talked about so many aspects of this work to profess its different layers you kept saying different layers of the system you need so many different perspectives on that so that's awesome that's good news for people out there yeah it really does take a team I think it you have a team with a whole wide range of disciplines that really allows some of this technology to come to light right sounds like it it's a great place to solve hard problems that's what Aeronautics really offers and I think what it brings a lot of people that's what brought me in it's a good place to solve really hard problems I make an impact fascinating awesome yeah well this has been awesome and thank you guys for joining us maybe we can just about run out of time but thank you for being here
