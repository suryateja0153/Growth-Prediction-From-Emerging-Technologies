 Actuation motion control: that's a pretty key part of the flying taxi experience because those things have to be steered somehow, and they have to be steered mechanically. And that's where electromechanical actuation comes in. - You will have movable wings, you'll have movable rotors, you'll see what we call utility functions that are powered by electromechanical actuators. - Electromechanical actuators are beneficial especially for urban air mobility because they are lightweight, they're efficient, they are made to work in harsh environments. - They have to survive typically severe working environments. So that could be in tough spaces, tight spaces. There's also other environmental factors; the unit itself has to withstand all these environmental variables for prime component reliability and life. Honeywell has been in the electromechanical actuation business for over 60 years. Reliability is key;  we want the dual-redundancy that electromechanical actuation can provide to ensure a reliable aircraft. The ability to be safe, the ability to be precise in positioning and maneuvering is critically important and electro- mechanical actuation can help deliver that.
