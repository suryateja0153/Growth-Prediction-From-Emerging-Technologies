 new tonight the future of driving is being developed and refined right here in Indiana yeah the technology behind semi automated honest vehicles was on display this morning at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway news 8's Richard Essex was there and has more we hear an awful lot about cars and trucks that can drive themselves we're not quite there yet but that truck behind me may look like an ordinary truck but it is far from ordinary it is one thing to read about self-driving vehicles for to see it on TV but to have the driver of a semi take his hands off the wheel when you're in the cab nothing short of unnerving no hands on the steering wheel which scares everyone Gregg Barnes is an engineer he's helping take the fear out of the no hands on the wheel technology that is rapidly coming down the road and but it's the technology pieces that go together that someday will bring us that truly autonomous safe vehicle that will bring us a cleaner environment and a safer environment the pieces and parts that allow the driver to drive without hands is kind of like using building blocks very complex building blocks engineers have developed a system to warn truck drivers of vehicles in their blind spot the steering wheel shakes just a little bit to give them a warning another piece of the puzzle is keeping trucks in their own lane the driver is given a warning to the steering wheel which brings the truck back into its proper lane the smart car has to understand that there's a dumb car next to it tech technology that allows this truck to operate in a parking lot without an active driver is a small step to truly autonomous vehicle gonna have the old stuff and there'll be regions where the new stuff can't go in like no one can really say when we will all surrender our driver's license to this new technology but that day is coming in Indianapolis Richard Essex Busch TV news 8
