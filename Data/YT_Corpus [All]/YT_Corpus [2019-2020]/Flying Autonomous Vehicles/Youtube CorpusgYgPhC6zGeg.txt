 [Music] we are delighted to have dr. Jamie winters with us today jamie is a professor of geography and director of the autonomous systems Policy Institute at Syracuse University she is a proud two-time graduate of the University of Kentucky having earned her bachelor's and her PhD in Lexington Jaime's research focuses on four main themes the design regulation and social impacts of emerging technologies especially autonomous systems and artificial intelligence international migration and the politics of belonging racial formations and dynamics and the politics of social reproduction is interdisciplinary some say radically interdisciplinary and draws on a range of methods including oral histories archival work discourse analysis interviews and life work histories professor winters is editor-in-chief of the international migration review the flagship journal in migration studies and she is associate editor of cultural geographies she also has interest in historical geography and the role of post-colonial theory in the thinking about human geography more broadly she frequently writes about critical pedagogy and digital geographies in all of her work professor winter situates her research at the intersection of academia policy and advocacy Jamie is exactly the type of faculty member you would want and expect to be at the Maxwell school a renowned researcher and an outstanding teacher she is already and I know she will be for generations for Maxwell students in alumni as one of those faculty members they think of found lee if not foundationally when they recall their time as a student at syracuse she is a Sara Lee Syracuse University faculty representative to the Board of Trustees and she's a great colleague and a great student at the Maxwell school and of the University and now I will turn it over to Professor winders for her talk on autonomous systems and policy Jamie yes ok so first off I just want to say thank you to all of you for joining us for giving me the opportunity to talk with you about a new Institute on campus the autonomous systems policy is try direct and after an amazing introduction like that the best thing I could probably do is just sit down and be quiet because I can't follow that but I do want to share with you for about 20 minutes some of the things that we're doing with the autonomous systems Policy Institute and since I can't hear you I'm just going to pretend that you're laughing and all of my jokes as I talk so today I'd like to talk about really two themes in this presentation and the first is I want to introduce you to the autonomous systems Policy Institute which is housed in Maxwell but involves faculty from across campus and then I want to spend some time talking about kind of the the possibilities and the pitfalls of incorporating emerging technologies into a crisis response like the one we're in right now so the autonomous systems Policy Institute which we affectionately call SP was launched in may twenty nineteen so we're about a year old our mission really is to focus on interdisciplinary scholarship and teaching related to the design and technology of autonomous systems the policy law and governance guiding their uses and then the wider societal impacts of autonomous systems we really want to work to shape the policy and the ethical frameworks that guide the use and development of these emerging technologies our goal is to be the leader in interdisciplinary research and teaching on autonomous systems we want to to work across different domains of autonomy so looking at driverless vehicles looking at drones looking at things that go all the water things that go under the water and then finally we want to bring together academic insight community needs and industry developments together into conversation and so we want aspies research teaching and the policy guidance we offer to really connect technology to its effects on democracy and civic values and to connect humanists and the social scientist and natural scientists and the professional fields because the reality is that we can't think about technology without also thinking about those policy and societal implications and for this reason a speii involves faculty from all eleven schools and colleges on campus we have people focused on policy in the social sciences we have folks from our engineering school the law school faculty from Social Work in public health Public Communication faculty in our design school in BPA folks from the Natural Sciences architecture education School of Management and we think it's really only when we take this broad perspective that we can really get our heads around these new technologies so what is an autonomous system so there are a lot of definitions that we could use but we've sort of latched on to two key criteria when we think about autonomous systems and so the first criteria is the ability to act independently of humans in theory so something that is kind of automated the second one is really important which is also the ability to make decisions independent of humans and that's really the kind of key criteria so you might think of an elevator as being automated it no longer has an attendant in it who pulls levers or moves it from floor to floor but elevators shouldn't be autonomous right you should not be getting into an elevator and having it use the floor for you much of the work that we're doing focuses on what we might call mobile autonomous systems so things like autonomous vehicles unmanned aerial vehicles things that that float on the water autonomous submarines but we're also interested in what you might call in mobile autonomous system so things like HUD machines wearable devices and we have a strong focus as well on artificial intelligence so I just want to walk us through some examples of how autonomous systems are used in the world around us the places we're beginning to see it impacts so we might think about something like the September 2019 drone attacks on the Saudi air fields or more recently the u.s. drone strike that killed theory commander Kasim Soleimani in January 2020 both of these events led to a lot of conversations about not only how inexpensive drones were as a technology but also the difficulty in countering them we might think about something like precision agriculture in the ways that drones and also small robotics are increasingly incorporated into crop production and really lasering in on precise places to put pesticides or fertilizers so it's needing to use less of both of using drones to do head counts for herds of animals to monitor to monitor cattle or horses or sheep we can think about the ways that autonomous systems are changing engineering so things like bridge inspection so here you have a picture of a drone being used to inspect a bridge using these new technologies really reduce the risk to the inspectors who no longer have to get into sort of a cherry picker and look under the bridge and be at risk it also makes it easier for drivers who might be on this bridge which out longer needs to be shut down to be inspected we might think about things like the controversies over Tesla's autopilot and the pictures you see online of people sleeping behind the wheel or some of the prototypes of autonomous shuttles or autonomous vehicles that we see tested in a number of us these we might start to think about the ways that these technologies can change the future of work right so in areas like care work and the incorporation of robots into healthcare the ro-bear you see here in Japan or sort of a companion robot being used for elder care in places like Italy so thinking about these technologies as ways to address a shortage of care workers or the exoskeleton you're looking at here on a construction worker of using these technologies to address fatigue among construction workers or something like the Tesla factory which is almost fully automated which can lengthen the workday and kind of reconfigure how factories work now lest we start to think that these technologies are only impacting the future of kind of physically demanding jobs we can look closer to home at the ways that things like artificial intelligence are beginning to reconfigure fields like Social Work HR even something like journalism so we're seeing white-collar positions change as well we might think about the implications of things like drones for health care so we're increasingly seeing drones you used to deliver blood or to move transplant organs from one hospital to another we've seen a lot of conversations around drone use in this capacity in places like Rwanda but also in US states like North Carolina we might start to think about something like the active platooning right where you have multiple big rigs that are connected and that are traveling in unison maybe you have a safety driver up front but certainly not in the other trucks we can start to think about the implications of this new technology for things like supply chains logistics for truck drivers and delivery persons as well as the environment so if these trucks are traveling in unison they can be closer together they're more efficient and speeding up and slowing down so it has a positive environmental impact on a long enough timeline this technology is looking to incorporate things like tella operators so maybe you don't have any drivers at all but you have someone who could kind of be anywhere with Wi-Fi who's controlling anywhere from two to ten of these trucks we can also start to raise questions about the built environment so if you've got four big rigs that are traveling together what kinds of spaces do you need in order for them to couple and a couple so what needs to change in the built environment how the cities incorporate these new technologies we can also think about the use of technology like drugs to fight forest fires or wildfires and this is something we're really seeing a lot of in disaster and emergency response but of course you also then have the challenge of drones or in private hands as well so hobbyists have grown out so how do you regulate who's flying their drones where how do you encourage hobbyists not to fly in disaster situations so that first responders can get out there we can also think about how do we introduce these new technologies to children and so here I'm showing you an example that was shared with me by Diana Cooper who's the head of US policy at Hyundai urban air mobility and what you're looking at is the lego police chase and so we can start to think about what a toy what message - toys like this sin - children about a technology like drones that only criminals have drones that drones are things that the police have to bring down that drones are a crime tool so what are the long term implications of how we socialize children - these technologies you know and finally we can think about the political movements that develop around these technologies so we can think about concerns about drone warfare concerns about killer robots and war we can think about the ways that in some places like Ohio we're beginning to see pushback from bus drivers transit employees around the idea of autonomous vehicles pittsburgh is sort of a testbed for a lot of autonomous vehicles and there been some protests there around the idea that their community has kind of become a guinea pig for these new technologies and also the question of why are we investing in these new technologies and we have immediate needs in our communities so all of these really complicated dynamics and uses and possibilities were really the motivation for creating a speii right and we wanted to put the research and the teaching that ASPI does at the center of the Orangemen diagram right where questions of design and technology overlap with questions about social impacts and the policy law and government and so our goal here is really to offer a kind of 360 comprehensive understanding of these emerging technologies and that vid came out of conversations with about a hundred faculty members but also conversations with about 100 external stakeholders last year asking them questions about you know what do you see is the most pressing research need and more importantly what kinds of skills do we need to give our students in order for them to be able to shape the design regulation and impacts of autonomous systems in productive and fair manners and that really led to this kind of grey Venn diagram where we want to keep the teaching and research that ASPI does in constant dialogue with industry developments policy debates in the that are impacted by these technologies so what makes a skate unique there really are two things that we're doing that we're not seeing at other places and other Institute's the first is we're the only Institute to work across domains of looking at driverless vehicles drones maritime and we do this because the reality is that cities and governments and even ecosystems are going to have to adjust all of these domains of autonomy at once and so we need to be thinking about them together and kind of comparing trends and you know identifying best practices from one domain to the other the other is what I've already mentioned which is our interdisciplinary breadth so we draw from all of us use resources and that gives us a reach that other Institute's don't have so where are we headed as I said we're in year one we're really focused on kind of building up interdisciplinary capacity among us use faculty and external engagement so we've done some events we've pulled together some research team we're beginning to transition to year two which is all about curricular developments we want to create a new major in kind of the interdisciplinary study of autonomous systems we would like to offer a graduate level certificate of Advanced Studies and autonomous systems we want to formalize some industry partnerships and by the time we get into year three we won't ask me to be positioned as the leader in this interdisciplinary research and teaching to hold educational events and other cities things like workshops for congressional staff and again one of the things that we want to do is keep that strong internal focus on research and our students but also that connection to external developments so what have we done so far as I've said we're about a year old we've submitted a number of grant proposals and really drawn in faculty from across campus you can see some of the topics here we're beginning to work with other Institute's as well and also exploring partnerships with government agencies thanks to Scott Barrett and his amazing team we've had a ton of external engagement all of much of which has slowed down quite a bit more recently but we've had touch points with probably 300 stakeholders so really kind of getting the word out we took the lead on some cluster hires in autonomous systems and artificial intelligence and so the university is committed to about 16 new faculty lines in these areas we recently launched a research series with policy briefs working papers as well as a series of interdisciplinary working groups around some of the big topics associated with autonomous system so surveillance and privacy infrastructure and sustainability future of work and so on and so forth and so we're in the process of getting these working groups up and running so for the last part of this presentation I just want to talk a little bit about the connections between emerging technologies in kovat 19 so in the last month we've seen a lot of examples of how autonomous systems are being used to fight and to respond to co vid 19 so to go back to my opening slide we've seen iPads on robots for graduation ceremonies in Japan we've seen drones being used to spray disinfectant in Indonesia and Chile in China we've seen robots used in care for Koba 19 patients in Italy allowing doctors to communicate at a safe distance we've seen a lot of autonomous disinfecting robots in China in u.s. grocery stores in hospitals they're robots that roll around Chinese cities dispensing hand sanitizer most commonly we've seen Police Department's around the world using drones to monitor and enforce social distancing so in Spain France Malaysia Dubai Britain closer to home places like Elizabeth New Jersey Daytona Beach if we look at what's going on in the Mayo Clinic in Florida we've seen them using their shuttles to transport potentially contagious samples we've seen some cities starting to wonder if autonomous public transit systems would keep transit workers and passengers safer now all these examples really show the immense potential of autonomous systems in responding to global crises like kovat 19 of meeting that immediate need of reducing exposure especially among essential workers they also raised some really complicated questions about their long-term impacts right so while thinking about an autonomous public transportation system would drastically lessen the exposure of safe subway workers to viruses it also might eliminate those jobs all together in some cases using drones to monitor social distancing can certainly help us flatten the curve but beginning their use in the midst of a state of emergency really can preclude those larger conversations about privacy surveillance and data collection and so when we think about these new technologies they raise all these these questions about both their immediate positive impacts but also these really complicated long-term consequences so to end I want to sort of juxtapose some of these uses of emerging technologies in the kovat 19 fight with the final slide from a presentation that I was supposed to give at the University of Liverpool in England in March now I never gave this talk since my flight coincided with the new travel advisory so as a good academic I'm just going to recycle part of it here so the presentation itself that I was giving focused on cities and emerging technologies and in particular trying to think about the nuts and bolts of what does it take to create smart and connected responsive cities in practice and so one of my answers to this question about how do you create smart connected cities that keep all the different stakeholders engaged is that you have to have a really big table you have to bring to the conversation advocacy groups industry both big companies and small startups urban planners workforce development folks public schools universities all these different groups have to be involved because the list of questions that we have to think about are really complicated right of sort of thinking about the impacts of incorporating these new technologies into our daily lives so how do you create teams to understand and respond to these technologies what agencies have to work together maybe in new ways what new skills do existing workers need what new hires are necessary what parts of the cities are will be most impacted what groups and why and then that big question of who should really be at the table for these decision makings about both the regulation of these technologies and their long in their short term impacts and so the take-home message of this pre kovat world talk with incorporating emerging technologies into kind of the existing cities existing urban fabrics is really complicated and when it's done well it requires input from a lot of people in crises like the ones we're experiencing right now there just isn't always that time for these long deliberative conversations right we feel the need to just act and that arrangement may work in the short term but in the long run failing to sort of gather all those stakeholders at the big table for these conversations about design regulation societal impacts is likely to create more problems than it solves it's a one of aspies goals is to be that big table and to help us identify and operationalize all those really positive impacts of autonomous systems while also keeping us focused on those thorny questions about who's at the table and who's missing how can we regulate these systems in ways that allow innovation but also keep a focus on the public good and what kind of unexpected outcomes these emerging technologies might create and so that's really our goal with what we're trying to do with ASPI so thank you for listening and I would love to hear any questions or your thoughts about ask me or about any of these aspects Thank You Jamie we're please remember to use the icon at the bottom of your screen to raise your hand and leave your hand raised and we'll call on you in order and when we call on you will ask you to unmute your microphone and you can ask your question or if you prefer you can use the chat box in the bottom right hand of of your screen so let's students from the audience yet if folks just a minute Jamie Giselle whom I think you know has her questionnaire hand up so just I'll unmute your microphone at the bottom of the screen and you can ask your question Thanks as a terrific presentation really interesting founding on the last thing you said about the need for a bigger table and how we're looking at things during a crisis versus how we're looking at things in the long term how are you seeing the question of policymaking so to speak this idea that the standard may change according to the circumstances because it's one thing as you mentioned for us to be inspired so to speak by by what's going on in a really difficult time period but projecting out that worst case scenario and having it be the standard for all ways is just a difficult proposition so if you could maybe just elaborate a little on the last item you or you were discussing yeah so this is a great question this issue of what my kind of dynamic flexible policymaking look like particularly in a crisis moment and I think one of the things that a lot of folks are suggesting might be a bit unique about the situation we're in is that many of the emerging technologies whether you're talking about autonomous systems or you're talking about AI are in the hands of industry more than government and that is slightly different from what we might have seen say in the era of nuclear sort of nuclear developments and so I think it's a real challenge because a lot of the the these innovative uses that we're seeing are not being driven by by policy or by government agencies it's really in the private sector and so I haven't really yet seen a lot of those conversations about dynamic policymaking and how we might think about regulating these things that have now kind of come to market but I suspect that we're going to start to see these conversations in the next in the next couple of months that's my hope anyways thank you Jamie professor David Robinson has his hand up David you can unmute your microphone and you can ask your question David hi Jamie a very very interesting presentation of a highly complex topic I was wondering as you were speaking whether one should analytically maybe consider spatial scales as one of the key variables in in how we approach to analyze this obviously made a technological impact for example you were talking of cities like we have structures and that you were talking of systems so many different systems but if you compare them to the robot going within a hospital that's it's probably a micro scale but if you talk then of you know putting things out in fields or by the way does this only work in daytime I wondered whether in fact we can get rid of the you know the like the neccessity neccessity of light impacting certain occupations and activities but my main focus will be on things like scale yeah operational scale to try to interpret what many kinds of different applications actually are focused on so I think this is David thinking as a geographer I think this question of scale is incredibly important and it actually links back to Giselle's question about dynamic policymaking because for some of these technologies they're regulated at different let they have different impacts at different scales but they're also regulated in different ways at different levels so it'll take something like drones so there's a federal level FAA policy regulating where they can be used under what kinds of circumstances and and by whom and and that's the case in the US and FAA policy in the u.s. is often the template for how other countries are responding but then if we think about in the context is a disaster or emergency response much of that is controlled at the state level and here I'll give a pitch for our first sort of entry in through our research series which really focused on how states do and don't incorporate drones into their disaster response so there's a very uneven stake level of how drones are regulated when you get down to the municipality some places have banned the use of drones within within their their kind of district limits when you get down to the to the level of individual units within a city government you might have say the fire department which is using drones in particular way and maybe the police force hasn't used it yet so this is a very complicated way of saying that when we start to think about what kinds of dynamic policymaking do we need in order to use these technologies quickly ineffective ways that don't create problems down the road we have to think about the the connections among all these different scales Jamie I have a question from Pat Martino in the in the chat box and Pat is asking a two-part question has SP formed private sector partner or do you seek to do so and certainly if you have examples that'd be great and two if these result in issues of patents royalties etc is there a structure to address this that get into all of the questions of intellectual property which are really big in an area like this but in terms of private sector partnerships we have spent a lot of time this last year talking with different potential partners getting a better sense of the things that interests them where their interest kind of aligned with our interests we had a number of potential industry partners that are not only interested in the research but that are also very excited about the idea of creating new new curriculum around this topic so this is the sort of private sector partnerships was something that was very much in the works up until about the beginning of March when many of for example my ability to travel got really limited but it's certainly something that we're very interested in we're in the process of sort of mapping out a menu of sorts of all the different ways that we might partner with with industry and with private sector folks Jamie Indira has a question Indira you can unmute your microphone and you should be able to ask your question hi Scott great to see you see you Jamie that was a really interesting presentation I had no idea that a time assistance could could do so much like just seeing all the pictures everything like wow I was just wondering about like what you think should change with regards to how society should think about drones in an autonomous systems I know that you were discussing how a lot of drones and autonomous systems are owned by the private industry and so a lot of states and municipalities have to laws and everything around in some places you know don't even like trials and I think there's still like a lot of that fear around and also with with the like for kids and what kind of message that sends and because it seems like on the surface you know as generations are younger they're like a lot open to technology but I would just wondering how you how you would like you know society to evolve but there this is a huge question and it's one that just hasn't sort of been kind of mainstreamed these conversations about emerging technology which is very lot of the kind of public conversations around this topic are very focused on the technological innovation then there are the questions about the regulation but you know if you think about something like drones this is a technology that like most forms of emerging technology whether you're talking about the internet or kind of computer precursors has military roots but the the real reach of this technology will be much more in the commercial sector and so I think there when I what I would like to see kind of in terms of social understandings of these technologies is that 360 view that we talked about of paying close attention to all of the ways that they can create beneficial benefits that they can and you know have impacts on sustainability and environmental impacts that they can help us have more efficient logistic systems and supply chains but at the same time keeping that conversation always focused as well on questions of privacy and security of data ethics of what kinds of data are are collected as well as thinking about all the different ways that people might interpret or make sense of this new technology so for some drones may always sort of have this strong military connection for others you know when we start to see them and write it into Amazon deliveries how do we begin to message to people who live in neighborhoods that drones flying around your neighborhoods are part of the same kind of infrastructure that you might associate with UPS delivery trucks so you know so I think my hope would be that we would have that comprehensive 360 V looks at both the positive but also the kind of really complicated potentially negative impact Thank You Jamie Caitlin is up next Caitlin you can unmute your microphone and ask report hi good afternoon such an interesting presentation especially on a quarantine Monday afternoon professor winters good to hear your voice again um just really curious about the pace of kind of autonomous technology development and in particular you know how does the public sector keep up with what some of like this the rapid development of these algie's across the board it's not just drones it's vehicle it's not just vehicles it's so many other things that I am not privy to so how like what are your thoughts on just you know how the public sector can you know keep safety or are some of these checks and balances in mind will not stifling the innovation that is clearly happening yeah so this is this is a great a great question I'm just jotting it down here so I don't forget you know because as you point out Caitlin you know the technological development the pace of change is incredibly rapid and it's it you can you can easily four see how that the pace of technological innovation can just outpace our ability to regulate it and so one of the things that in terms of the public sector that I often say when I talk to city planners or when I talk to public officials is when we start to think about how we incorporate these emerging technologies into our cities into our disaster response systems into our economies the starting point needs to be what is so I'll use the example of cities plan for the city that you want rather than trying to reconfigure your city to respond to the emerging technologies you know and so I think this takes us back in terms of thinking about kind of how the public sector can respond and incorporate these these new and emerging technologies again sort of think about are there places to where the technology can help us address the things that we've already identified as being foundational to how an effective city runs to how a city that's fair and just runs how do we think about incorporating these technologies into the city that we already want to create as opposed to completely reconfiguring our cities around these you know and we can see a very different model if we look for example at a place like China so if you look in many European cities and US cities the question is kind of how can we incorporate say driverless vehicles into the city as it exists when we get into some Chinese cities China is is sort of contemplating completely reconfiguring cities around this technology so the city responds to the technology as opposed to figuring out how do you incorporate this technology into the city that we want so I think that would be my starting point is you know for cities local government state governments to kind of take a moment and step back and think about what is it that they want for their communities and then look at where these technologies can help them reset go great thanks Jamie professor Robinson has his hand up go ahead professor Robinson yes Jamie I suddenly thought that one dimension of this whole issue that you haven't mentioned is given this sophisticated technology being applied in so many different contexts what about the problem of what we're facing even as we listen on these different machines hacking that's to say that all these wonderful things happening I mean I think pretty soon one can bring down a drone by sending out some pulse signal to it that's to say overriding its management system what about that because I I was going to ask a question which I decide not to about what about the criminal potential for all of these automated systems that's to say can't I avoid police checking I can operate a robot to go on robbed somebody's house with impunity since I'm not the human but in fact identified for the entire legal process what about those dimensions yes so this issue of sort of cybersecurity are huge and in terms of how you bring down a drone ironically one of the most effective counter drone technologies is birds of prey and I'm very sad that despite the fact that I asked the Maxwell school to let me invest in an eagle that we could train to bring down drones that they wouldn't do that but you're right you know these technologies they're very dependent on you know sort of constant connectivity they create they collect immense amounts of data and because something like an autonomous vehicle is dependent on sensors of all sorts on cameras the hacking potential is huge and so this is something that lots of folks across all the different domains of autonomy spend a lot of time thinking about of how do we how do we not only how do we ensure that these systems are safe in the sense that the risk to life is is diminished but also how do we keep these systems secure right and so there have been a number of very high profile news stories about the ways that you can make a small adjustment with stickers to say a stop sign and a lot of autonomous vehicles won't see that as a stop sign right so how do we how do we kind of build out much more reliable system so there's the are the system secure and then there's our the systems safe and I think both of those conversations are going on right now we have some folks in the school of in the College of Engineering who are very interested in kind of safety assurance this is a big conversation that's going on with the FAA right now about how figuring out how do you certify different delivery drones is safe it's a very big conversation among autonomous vehicles drive driverless vehicles about what are the safety standards right is it is it we drove X number of million miles and we only had X number of disengagement sware the safety driver had to take control of the car is that how you document that these vehicles are safe and reliable is it something else so so these are conversations that are happening not only kind of in the policy and regulatory world but they're also happening in the in the different industry sectors Jaime Pat Martino sharing an example of autonomous and drone technology that she's recently experienced in Florida and that is in her community their homeowners association wanted to install a new American flag pole and plan it in a prominent place within the community so management used a drone to let them see different heights locations and in sighting of that and allowing them to evaluate issues like change in landscape roadway visuals and other impacts and they also gathered around outdoors to see the options see that virtually after which recommendations were made by the Board of Directors so residents experienced this technology firsthand in a way that gave them some modest degree of social understanding of the most common areas we see locations in photography but Pat's point is really important because drones as a technology allow us to see in a different way so most of us don't have the capability to fight to fly slowly over our property or over a piece of land just can't do that see landscape in different ways I'm sure you've seen some of the footage from our own campus it just gives us quite literally a different view and so they're very they can be very useful from everything from real estate agents to photography but also to you know engineering firms that need to survey or that need to surveil and that up to without phones you're out there and you're creating sight lines you're walking it off with drones you know you can you can just see the landscape in a different kind of way Jamie didn't some of our students I think you told me the story some of our students in VP a we're working on driverless ecology do you want to share that story I thought that was interesting highly led an amazing design in the visual College of Visual and Performing Arts and one of the things he's very interested in as our a number of people in the Design School is sort of the user experience how people interact with technologies of various sorts and so Don Carr and his students were mocking up prototypes for autonomous vehicles and so they kind of built these big cardboard contraptions and they put screens in them to try to simulate a trip from a point in Syracuse to Wegmans which everyone knows is our highly beloved grocery store in Syracuse prototype into assisted living facilities and had residents get in kind of the cardboard house and then the the screen the video screen simulated a trip to Wegmans and one of the things he was interested in is a what is a technology like this something that residents of an assisted living facility might be interested in using to increase their mobility especially mobility that they control as opposed to waiting for their near do well nephew to come and pick them up or going on a weekly trip but also what kind of experience within the autonomous vehicle itself would be most conducive for their interaction so I think that's just an amazing example of all the different of why you have to have completely interdisciplinary take on these oh geez Jamie I think that's at this point so certainly first and foremost thank you that was that was great I I always learn hearing you talk about autonomous systems and autonomous systems Policy Institute thank you for doing this thank you to max for outstanding information computing technology team and to the Maxwell dean's office staff as well as Jess Murray our director of alumni engagement for organizing the event a reminder to our guests that next week we'll be hosting I believe two conversations we're working on the details right now but to Q&A is with Maxwell faculty next week the first will likely be on Tuesday April 28th with University professor and fan steel chair Sean O'Keefe speaking on the public service imperative Sean feels very strongly about public service in general and certainly in the current environment the second conversation will be with former Maxwell Dean and former Deputy Secretary of State Jim Steinberg who will talk about kovat 19 and China and China's relationship with the US and the rest of the world and that will be Thursday April 30 it's at 3 p.m. electronic invitations will be sent shortly and we certainly hope you can join us for those sessions if you have further questions or suggestions for future topics please let me know email me directly si ba RR 0 - at s yr dot edu thank you thank you Jamie thank you for our guests for coming all of you be well and go Orange
