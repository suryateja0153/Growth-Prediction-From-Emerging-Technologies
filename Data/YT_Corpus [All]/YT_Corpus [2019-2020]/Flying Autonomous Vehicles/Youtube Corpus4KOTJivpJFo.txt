 also today we have a number of PhD students that are participating in the demonstration so they're involved in various projects and one of the students who live Anderson also in my group is working with a very interesting problem that has to do with how you would get a unmanned aerial vehicle system to learn things online all right while it's flying and one of the things we're going to demonstrate today is that suppose you've got a UAV operating in a smaller area now today we essentially know if you've got good sensors how these UAVs can avoid static obstacles things such as trees etc what's much more difficult is what happens if you've got dynamic objects what happens if you've got people in the vicinity that are walking around and the system has to achieve its goals for instance it wants to fly to a point but as it's flying to a point there may be people that are walking around and interfering so how do you build an unmanned aerial vehicle system that guarantees the safety of humans in the vicinity as they walk around so the humans should not have to worry about their safety it should be the system that worries about the human safety so what we do in the demonstration today is we've got a UAV that's basically trying to fly to one or more points and as it flies to one of these points we have humans that kind of walk in front of it to the side of it and what the system has to do is it's got to determine okay where do I move to be in a safe proximity to the human and then how how after I deal with the dynamic obstacle how do I get on track again to get to my goal and it's a trade-off between trying to minimize the cost of getting to the goal because you don't want to use a lot of resources but at the same time you want to guarantee the safety of the individual so it's a kind of trade-off that you can use machine learning techniques line all right to kind of determine safety parameters a little dynamically how far away should you be from a human if a human comes into your visual view and so this is really in some sense state-of-the-art research very difficult problem but essential for a widespread use of unmanned aerial vehicles in society well it's a big problem because no one knows how to do it robustly and no one has knows how to do it resilient ly so basically you you almost want to get a hundred percent guarantee that under specific conditions all right a UAV will never collide with a human
