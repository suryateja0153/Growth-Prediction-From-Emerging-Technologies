 well hello everyone my name is Sam George I lead at your IMT I'm joined today with a my Olivia block who's going to be moderating all the questions we have a ton of exciting things to talk about today and so all the questions and answers are gonna be at the end so let's go ahead and get started so first up I wanted to talk about IO T's response to Koba 19 now as many of you know our fundamental strategy in IOT is partner led and so when the : 19 crisis first hit we did what's natural to us which was worked with all of our partners and over the last six weeks what we've put together is our partner ecosystems response to the Koba 19 crisis and what we've done is we've assembled a set of over 160 different partner solutions those are all now available up on the azure marketplace and the link that you see here and some of these are from partners like PCL which can actually dropship coronavirus testing kits or Quran virus testing stations directly outside of business and inside the station keeps workers safe monitors does predictive maintenance and then other solutions by for example partners like microchip which helps track and trace of critical assets that within hospitals ensure safe distancing and also helps keep frontline workers safe now if you're interested in joining this effort and contributing IOT solutions to it please reach out to us at iot Kogan 19 at Microsoft comm and the other thing we've been doing is accelerating all of our online training so you can see at akkad MS /ms learn IOT we now have all of our online training that's completely free and we even have a new certification that we're going to be talking about in just a second IOT and edge computing and AI are definitely being brought to bear in the fight for kovat 19 and there's a lot of great examples out on the azure marketplace of how that's happening so a few years ago our CEO satya has started talking about this vision of an intelligent cloud and an intelligent edge and nowhere is this more relevant than in IOT and edge computing solutions so what we think of when we think of this intelligent cloud intelligent edge is about enabling solutions that span both the cloud and the edge it's not for us about everything moving to the cloud and it's not like everything's going to move back to the edge instead we think the durable pattern is solutions that cross cloud and edge and IOT and edge computing and 5g and AI all play a critical role in fusing the edge and the cloud and increasingly we're starting to see that with digital twins as well we're gonna be talking a lot about digital twins today but the first thing that I wanted to do is sort of zoom back and see a long view of the industry and where things are going and what's happening now what's about to happen and then what's coming in the future so as we step back and think about these evolutions that are the evolution of connected solutions today customers and partners are building solutions around connected assets connecting to that hospital equipment connecting to industrial pieces of equipment agricultural deployments and the whole goal in this phase of connected solutions is to find insights from those those heavy assets to predict their maintenance needs to power break brand new services on top of those and what we're really starting to see now we've started to see over the last year or so is this emergence towards not just connecting assets themselves but the environments of those assets are in and so this new emerging trend of connected environments is really important one in the industry right now and that covers everything from smart manufacturing so for example with add your customers like Unilever that are connecting not just the assets in their factory but also their entire supply chain coming in as well as the products going out and the customer sentiment thereof and so it's that entire digital feedback loop spanning an entire environment that winds up being the really value of the solution and then as you look forward into the future we think that there's going to be this emerging pattern that were already starting to see some signals of of connected ecosystems and what we mean by that is is I wind up having that full connected manufacturing environment I actually lends itself well to partner partner with adjacencies like partnering with the smart cities that that those factories are in partnering with the smart energy distribution grids but those factories connect to so really exciting time and for now what we'd like to do is turn our attention to connected assets to this what's what's right now now over the last five years we've been super busy putting together what we feel is the most comprehensive IOT portfolio in the whole industry and there's a lot on this slide and many of it we've covered previously but all of it now has training upon academia mass /ms learn IOT everything from our IOT and edge device support through all of the services for IOT from connecting and managing devices at scale billions of devices sending trillions of messages data storage systems analytic systems like Azure synapse and then business process integration like power automate as your logic apps and then moving up the stack we haven't stopped there we've been introducing SAS offerings and in fact SAS platforms like Azure i OT Central Dynamics connected Field Service and more and then providing accelerators in all of the priority industries that you see here to help our partners get to market faster and finally all of that protected by a sure security center for IOT there's thousands of customers that are already benefiting from these connected asset capabilities that we've brought to market and very importantly we have our huge ecosystem now of partners all the way from developer partners in the developer community to ecosystem partners across system integrators and advisors to solution providers connectivity providers to bicep right device providers you name it IOT really takes a village it is a ecosystem and partnering market and we are here to have the best partner ecosystem on the planet now as you look at the connected asset space there's a lot of exciting things that we're bringing to market and announcing this week so this is a pretty pretty dense slide and I'm going to cover all of these things in detail so the first thing that we're thrilled to announce is that all of our free training is now up anim on Microsoft Word and you go to go to the link that you see here acha ms/ms learn IOT so this covers all of the services that we build the reference architectures the best practices all of it and it's all up there available you can go through it in a self-paced way and then if you decide that you want to become certified as a specialist in Azure IOT we now have a Microsoft certified specialty that's available at the link you see below and what this helps you do is assert to your employer to your customers that you are in fact an expert and all of the azure IOT services and capabilities so turning our attention to a bunch of the announcements that we've got around IOT devices and IOT edges I'm sorry IOT edge capabilities first I'm thrilled to announce that as your artist is now generally available so how our artists is based on our acquisition of express logic thread X and the whole thread X family and this is all now available and backed by Microsoft as a shirred artists super compact super fast in fact it's the smallest fastest real-time operating system on the planet for disconnected environments it can run in as little as two kilobytes of memory for connected environments it can run in as little as 50 kilobytes of memory and it's all deeply integrated with our IOT services including as your security center for IOT provides very fast time to market and the other thing that we've done is we've now made this all open source and available up on github and it's up there as shared source and what that means is that I can go explore it I can use it for evaluation and development we have lots of developer kits through our solution our silicon silicon partners and when I decide to take up something to market then I can come and license it with Microsoft or through the silicon partners and then go to market and that provides that license provides all of the great support from Microsoft that you've come to expect from other our other operating system offerings now we've been busy with partners like in XP and Renaissance and Qualcomm and microchip and Esty and all the others you see here forming deep partnerships and making it so that these partners have Azure artists as a first-class part of their ecosystem and developer boards and devices that all support it the other thing that I'd encourage you to check out is that as your artist now fully supports as your IP advantage so as you're building connected solutions I'd encourage you to check out how important that is it's another industry first all of this is available upon hire comm /r toss the other thing we're talking about today is that we're thrilled to announce that we've made as your sphere and Azure our toss worked better together now as your sphere is and continues to be our hero offering for tiny device security I for those small microcontrollers and as your sphere is a fully you can almost think of it as like a SAS offering or secure securing those devices and as you look at an azure speared ship it actually contains many different cores one of those cores is a cortex a which runs the Azure sphere operating system which is a Linux kernel and that's a Linux kernel that Microsoft's stand behind stands behind patches updates but there's also a few cortex-m chip cores on those sphere chips and that's where as erst as your artist comes in as your are toss provides the real-time operating system needs that Azure sphere doesn't have and so the truth should truly work better together so you can have a state-of-the-art secure device that's fully backed by Microsoft top to bottom with both as your sphere and as your art ops so azure IOT edge is our edge computing platform and we're thrilled to announce after working with tons and tons of production-grade enterprise customers we've announced a whole bunch of new features this week on Azure IOT edge first is something we call layered deployments and what layer deployments is is we've noticed working with these customers that many times when you're operating fleets of tens or hundreds of thousands of IOT edge devices that there's lots of different deployment targets that you wind up having slightly different on each device so layered deployments enables me to be able to reuse parts of my deployment across those devices and update just those components and then will automatically figure out the right devices to tar with those updates advanced diagnostics if something happens on your IOT edge device and there's a problem with your workload you can issue a single command from the cloud to the device will collect all the logs from the IOT had runtime all the modules that are running there collate that return that to the cloud so that you can do deep inspection and then x.509 certificate attestation so this works end in now from IOT IOT edge devices to the device provisioning service and individual leaf node IOT edge devices the other thing that we're busy working on will be bringing to market in the coming month is advanced monitoring and so what this is is we already support actual monitor for IOT edge but this is taking it to a whole new level you'll be able to see everything that's going on on the IOT edge device memory working set CPU count everything priority messaging so this enables a prioritization of messages that are coming through IOT edge to the cloud and so if you have an alert from a leaf device and you want that fast track to the cloud this enables you to do it and then time-to-live messages enable you to timestamp messages so that if an azure IOT edge device is offline and reconnects we can drop those messages that aren't relevant anymore so turning to Windows IOT a whole lot of exciting announcements on Windows IOT the first is first-class support for Linux on Windows IOT and what that provides is that customers can benefit from the great operating system capabilities that Windows IOT provides in terms of security and OS patching and updates and manageability and yet still be able to run azure IOT edge in a Linux VM and run all of my Linux workloads right on Windows IOT we've also been working with our silicon partners like in XP to lower the build of materials requirements to run Windows IOT and then improving our device update Center for better control of your Windows IOT deployments now turning from devices towards the cloud we have a lot of exciting announcements and I'm thrilled to announce this first one which is IOT hub private link support and what that is is v-net support for IOT hub this enables customers and partners to bring their IOT into their isolated as your net in the cloud and so what this does is it winds up denying all inbound outbound traffic to your solution but you can still tunnel into that IOT hub sitting in your Azure B net via Express route or via Virtual Private Networks from the devices on-premises right up into IO T hub this is an industry-first we're the only hydro scale cloud that has this capability super thrilled to announce this it's been a big customer request the other thing that we've been busy improving on is IOT plug-and-play so IMT plug-and-play we talked about late last year in terms of providing a schema for the IOT interaction model between IOT devices and cloud solutions from being able to offer that interaction model with visual studio and being able to generate software from that schema and then certify that as plug-and-play ready and then as those devices connect to solutions that support IOT plug-and-play liked IOT central it means that those devices just automatically connect they automatically data starts flowing you can interact with those devices without writing a single line of code from the solution super exciting stuff we're thrilled to announce a new set of preview capabilities the first is a digital twins alignment so later in the talk we're going to be talking more about Azure Digital twins but with Azure digital twins we've introduced something we call the digital twin definition language with you which lets you model that interaction pattern with anything including now IOT devices so what this alignment enables you to do is as you connect devices through IOT hub that are plug and play and those flow into digital twins then those devices will show up in Azure digital twins is just another digital twin and you can interact with it immediately we've also made it dramatically easier to use existing devices and make them plug-and-play ready you simply provide a digital twin definition language document on your connection a few small modifications to your code and your devices plug and play and then we're also announcing that final certification is just to begin I had just is about to begin just ahead of our general availability for IOT plug-and-play now turning to IOT central so far we've been talking about devices and platform services IOT central as our fully managed IT a platform that brings together all of our services and IMT edge support and everything and makes it super super easy for any developer for any customer and partner to get started with a fully hyper scale and secure IOT solution you see a lot of great pick up from this across many of the solution providers that you solution builders that you see below and we're thrilled to announce some new capabilities available now in IOT central first is general availability of IOT edge so what this means is I can now connect manage provision IOT edge devices right from within IOT central and this means that everything that I own to edge supports including our entire module marketplace including all of our cognitive services and all of those different Azure services can now interact directly with IOT central you can adapt to industrial devices using our OPC connectors and so this provides a rich new set of possibilities or hi OTC central solutions we're also thrilled to announce the general availability availability of azure Sphere support so what this does is this provides a dressier based templates for IOT central and it also means that a lot that the Asscher sphere alerts that come from the azure severe services are surfaced now in IOT central we've made a ton of dashboard improvements including both personal and shared dashboards for operators and we've made a ton of improvements in terms of being able to use multiple devices on a dashboard multiple telemetry treat multiple telemetry streams from devices on the dashboard and the best of all our two-tier pricing is generally available as well and so if you're a developer you want to get started with IOT central you can do so with two devices that are free forever if you want to start using it in production we have two different pricing models you see here 40 cents a month as well as 70 cents a month so super cheap especially for the amount of services that this solution is using and all the capabilities that it provides it's been great to see the pink up in both IOT central as well as plug-and-play and one of our partners on that is regatta Android ATO has some edge solutions that they've now made available in IOT central that help businesses do occupancy and space utilization analysis track employees ensure safe distancing I do condition monitoring and all of this is available now from regatta with an IOT central template and their edge devices that are connected to this are all plug-and-play so super exciting to see the industry's response to our efforts to make IOT easier and easier for everyone alright so as data flows in through an IOT solution it often comes in in a time-series fashion like temperature and humidity repeated every 10 seconds so a short time series insights is our hero offering or time series support for IOT it's a fully managed service platform that includes a platform as a service layer as well as a SAS experience so it has a rich dashboard for you to inspect and interrogate all of your time series data and it makes complicated data wrangling not required anymore you simply connect devices to it or you connect from other sources and away you go it's being used by some incredibly sophisticated and high scale customers like the ones that you see at the bottom of the slide and one of those examples is Fonterra someone that we've been partnering with New Zealand dairy farmer that's connected tons and tons of assets to IOT central using tons and tons of data points millions of data points and finding insights across it or are thrilled to announce a short time series insights Gen 2 so this is a new quantum leap unparalleled on the market for time series for IOT and it adds a couple really important capabilities one of those is a time series model and what we mean by that is the ability to add structure to your time series data and you can add multiple multiple hierarchies of that now that time series structure is also aligned with the digital twin definition language we've added multi layered storage so it's not just about a fast warm store anymore we also have support for cold storage so you can bring your own as your storage account or has your data Lake storage Gen 2 and when you do we will write Apache park' files all of that time series data directly into your store and what that means is now I can have a which query API that goes across warm and cold smartly and also I can now use all of the open source as well as Microsoft analytics tools so you can just use Azure machine learning to build machine learning and anti models based on your time series data you can use Azure synapse analytics out-of-the-box with all of the time series data stored in Azure data like storage or after storage and then we also have out-of-the-box power bi connectors and enable you to connect automatically to your time series data and have live dashboards we're putting the finishing touches on after time series insights Jen - it's soon going to be generally available and so if it has the features that you need you can check that out start using it now and get updated in place - are generally available version of that all right so so far we've been talking about connected assets and so what we want to do is turn our attention now to this new emerging phase of connected environments so as you look across all these different environments from manufacturing plants and factories and industrial sites to smart energy with generating stations and substations to healthcare with hospitals to smart to real estate with campuses all of these historically have been connecting assets and increasingly you're starting to connect entire environments a great example is our own campus so we're in the process of redoing our Redmond campus we have 17 new buildings that are coming coming to life there and what we're doing is we're doing that is we're creating a connected environment for that entire campus and we're building a full adder digital twin instance for that entire campus and all of our suppliers are plugging into that digital twin instance so the benefits of connected environments include things like understanding and then being able to optimize everything that's happening in those environments not just the assets reduce costs to be able to provide breakthrough employee experiences like we are in our smart campus and then even to be able to provide contactless our contactless interactions like employees walking through doors and doors opening these are the kind of things that you can achieve with a connected environment now the challenges for most customers are pretty steep because doing this at they'll and building a full you know digital replica of that environment can be very challenging so what we've been doing is we've been busy over the last year putting together whole set and aligning all of our offerings around this emerging pattern of connected environments and the star of the show the center of all of this is a sure digital twins Azure Digital twins is really about modeling anything to be able to create a live model of that to control the present to track the past to simulate possibilities and predict the future and so what we have what we've introduced is something we call the digital domain definition language which is a schema to model anything we've lined that up with add your time series insights we've lined that up with Azure Maps um you can use Azure spatial anchors to find the precise location of things in these smart and connected environments and we've also lined up digital twin definition language with our IOT services like IOT hub and IOT central with IOT plug-and-play oh and it's not just about connecting to assets with digital plans is super important you can certainly do that through IOT central IOT hub through third-party offerings but it's also about connecting the business systems so for example in our smart campus to track you know to enable the employee experience that I can order anything from the cafeteria from my desk part of the Azure digital twins is taking signals from business systems that say what's on the menu today or the food supply that's coming into the cafeterias and so this digital world is an incredibly important part of fusing and creating these live connected environments so a lot of exciting offer announcements that we're going to talk through in just a second as it relates to connected environments the first of those is at your digital twins so how's your digital twins has been in preview and based on all of the amazing things that customers and partners have been doing with it we've introduced a new set of capabilities the first is that digital twin definition language and you can see a snapshot of it it's a json-ld schema over on the right side digital twin definition language enables you to model anything in terms of the telemetry that that thing sends the properties that it reports or synchronizes the commands you can issue to it and as well as relationships that it has other twins and we fully support inheritance now so I can have a conference room with a derived or a room with a direct conference room with a derived executive conference room and like I said we've lined that up with IOT plug-and-play as well as the time series insights data model once you feed digital twin definition language into Azure digital twins we materialize a live execution environment this is not a database this is a living breathing distributed object model effectively that's associated in a graph relationship and then once you've done that you can query across those relationships to any depth you can also connect input from IOT as well as business systems either through IOT hub or logic apps or directly through REST API and that makes the model come alive and start a venting and as those events happen you can handle those events and then output that data out to as your logic apps out at data like storage into and time series insights and use it with things like synapse analytics so this really completes that arc and then finally we've been busy building partnerships we're really providing the platform layer and then we have partners we announced last year ANSYS who builds incredibly sophisticated simulation using physics based digital twins and that's all built on top of our digital twins now as well as we're thrilled to announce Bentley who has I twin their i twin system or connecting critical infrastructure roads and smart grids and smart cities on top of azure digital twins we've seen a ton of cost customer use cases for this from edge technologies and Bausch for smart buildings willow with smart rail was Auto with smart manufacturing it's clear that this is an important emerging pattern and then last we're thrilled to announce this week that we joined as a founding member the digital twins consortium so the digital twins consortium is all about openness and interoperability standardizing the way Digital twins are described standardizing the specific ontologies for each market segment and we're joined by a whole set of ground breakers many of whom you saw on the former site that are going to be partnering with us and it's made incredible to see the progress of this or shim so we're really excited to kick this off and get going and then finally I want to turn our attention to add your Maps so as your Maps is our go-to enterprise geospatial developer platform Bar None for hazard solutions it includes all of the rich capabilities that you see here as well as some of the ones that we've recently announced like Weather Service power bi integration and support for government clouds now as you connect after digital twins to these environments you often want a map based representation of what's inside these environments the inside of a factory the inside of a smart building the inside of a hospital but you don't look that map freely available to the public and be able to be indexed oh we're thrilled to announce this week our Maps creator as your Maps creator enables any enterprise to take CAD diagrams and generate private indoor maps and even private outdoor maps we all provide multiple levels of detail built-in map styles and dynamic styling options and so I can then use this in my digital twin connected environment application and customers can use this in combination with all of the public map data in Azure Maps so they can provide employee experiences where they can go everywhere from getting directions from a public location into a factory right up to an asset so we're thrilled to announce as your private or a term apps creator we have a bunch of great sessions this week we have a session on Azure Digital twins and all the other ones you see here and then I think we have time for a few questions yeah we do sound thanks a lot for that presentation so you know catch up on all the links and we have one question actually that I wanted to bring up about solution axle readers when our partners is asking they're a nice Vee and they're asking hey where can I publish my solution axial resolution and there was a related question as well about the fact that there's a solution actually that are in preview now and some were broken what not so what's the story they're worried at yeah it's great question so what we're doing is part of our reference architecture work is providing the solution accelerators so that people can see the right way to put things together but as we see going forward what we've been saying is many many customers and partners are benefiting from just using the reference architecture alone or from using solutions like a jirayu T central so if you have a particular solution accelerated that you want to partner with us on please reach out I suspect if it's relevant to the köppen 19 I think you can reach out at that email address you can also reach out we'll provide links to reach out to us directly as well awesome so unfortunately we have to wrap up so our team Ashley is trying to answer as many questions as possible in Chapter doing a fantastic job Sam great presentation everyone online don't forget to go check out all the IOT session at aka tour the mess slash IOT ads build 2020 thanks a lot Sam again and thanks everyone for tuning in thank you all have a great day and stay safe [Music]
