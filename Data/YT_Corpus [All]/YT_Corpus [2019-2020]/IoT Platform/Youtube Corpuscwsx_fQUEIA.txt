 [Music] don't let the title of the presentations fool you although we are going to be focusing on an automotive use case which we think is a great use case for IOT there everything that we talk about is going to be applicable to lots of IOT industrial energy use cases so there's definitely something here for everybody and the three things that I think we hope that people walk away from from this session are number one is do you really walk away with a sense of what it takes to succeed in IOT from business perspective right number one number two is a real-world example with whatsa be she talking about their Mitsubishi connect program and the real value that they're creating for themselves as a company and their customers and then you know we're super happy to announce our partnership Google clouds partnership with Eris and where you're gonna hear both their full-stack IOT platform and how that helps customers navigate a lot of the complexity and IOT rapidly innovate and just deliver that value really quickly to customers so that's basically what we have in store for you over the next 50 minutes sound good all right all right good crowd okay so if you're here you're here for IOT and the good news is IOT is growing so just a quick stat that I pulled from company called IOT analytics that does competitive research for IOT industrial IOT and Industry 4.0 is showing that of for enterprises that they surveyed where as 12% of enterprises back in 2018 had said they had implemented IOT projects that that number is increasing to 50% by 2021 so a couple things I think take away from this stat is number one there's growth right and it's still a little bit early in now to you but there's there's a lot of growth happening there's a lot of innovation happening this is a very good time to be thinking about IOT and specifically you know one of the things that we see really clearly is this transition where a lot of companies are moving from a proof-of-concept phase and pilot phase to real deployment of two solutions in production and over the next three years you're gonna see this you know clearly increasing it's just a stat that kind of indicates that but you know this growth does beg your question and the question I think it begs is so how do you be successful in this growth how do you take advantage of it so I put together this framework having had the benefit of being in IOT for here over the past six years developing an IOT platform and you know being here with Google and many of our customers outlining what we call the seven steps to business success in IOT and it's basically a framework a way to think about how to navigate the daunting sometimes set of business considerations technical considerations and even sometimes cultural change that has to happen within a company or customer base in order to really be successful in IOT so I'm gonna step through this quickly and you know there's a lot more behind it but you know let's just kind of start at the the first part the business case so the first thing about the business case is you have to have one what you know I think the biggest indicator one of the biggest indicators of success that we've seen in working with companies who have embarked on the Scioto journey is that the companies have answered three fundamental questions really really well number one is who is my customer number two is what is the new value that we want to deliver to them with it connected service and number three is how does that new customer value then fold back into my business and add value to my business and ideally some way to really measure that and and show clear ROI companies that have done that work I've just really set very well to make many of the other business decisions and technical decisions a lot more effectively if not you know we jokingly in my team would refer to something called the IOT cul-de-sac which is not a dead end road but it's kind of like you get down the road for a while and you realize you haven't really thought through your endgame and you I don't have to turn around and go back and start from the beginning so number one number two is the connected product itself so this is it for OMS who are often the ones implementing IOT Lucian's this is the one that can sound easy because that's what you do you make a physical product but when a physical product becomes part of a 24 by 7 connected service there can be all sorts of new considerations as you can imagine you know the question is you know with a connected car is it a car with a computer in it or is it a smartphone on wheels right what what really is it and you know this this has impact on everything from mechanical design you know are all the buttons and knobs that you would normally have still needed if you're now gonna control those virtually or via an app right that affects the electrical design electronics design connectivity design right you're gonna use wired networking Bluetooth Wi-Fi ZigBee cellular which type of cellular right we're in which regions low power wide area networking all these considerations that come just into the physical product that are different that and then if it's not a a part of a correct solution the cloud platform as you're picking a cloud partner right does that partner bring the global scale security tools capabilities that you need to have to be the platform upon which a lot of this solution is built and the user application so it's kind of an interesting one because if you look at 2 & 4 right user applications and the connected product these are two areas where you're you're building the part that will interact directly with the customer and one is physical and one is digital and you have this kind of interplay between the physical and digital world and in IOT as you know a lot of the value starts to shift from the traditional physical product into the digital world but this brings up some opportunities of course but also some challenges and maybe if some culture changes I think Brian you'll talk a little bit about this because you develop software a lot differently then you develop hardware but they have to be in sync with each other right so sometimes there's even a cultural change in a company that has to take place here then you know the next step you know hopefully when you're embarking on an IOT on the IRT journey you're not just building a connected product but you are really running a connected business for the benefit of your customers and this often means how do you integrate data from these services into business systems that you use to run your business every day if that's a CRM system if it's a marketing automation platform if it's a an ERP system if it's you know ticketing system right trouble fixing but you know that's something to really think about the capabilities of those platforms and the limitations also and how that that ties into the equation you know next you know who's heard I Oh tea is all about the data right yeah show of hands the hands were a little weak everyone started that or did is the new oil we had to change this to be a little more renewable and if we should start saying an IOT date is the new sunshine that's it's a to to soft data's a new sunshine I think I think we could let's tag it right now that's first time it was said right but the point is that IOT is more than just connecting devices and connecting people there you know there is a lot to can be done and needs to be thought out with the data what types of new insights can you derive that you can never derive before what understanding of a customer can you have that you were never able to have before and this blending of IOT with smart analytics artificial intelligence and machine learning is absolutely a trend that we're seeing and we think you know the the industry is evolving towards as well finally and you know this is probably the most overlooked when a company goes after the opportunity of the IOT the companies that also do a really good job of thinking about the obligations that they now are taking on by becoming a 24 by 7 service provider is is really important because they you know in balancing the opportunity and obligation when you're 24 by 7 service provider you have a different support expectation from your customers they expect that 24 by 7 and if you bake that into the business case on the solution you're you know you have you have the whole thing together so it starts and ends with the customer starts and ends with the customer so two more quick slides and then I'm going to pass it on if you're with if you spend much time with me or my team you're going to hear that you cannot know company can do IOT alone and what we jokingly say but seriously say - is this always three legs to the stool - implementing a an IOT solution there's a platform an enterprise-class platform like Google cloud platform there's the foundation upon which Lada is built then there's an ecosystem of partners of best-in-class partners that really provide hardware software connectivity and those pieces that really either fill in gaps or accelerate innovation from from customers your eros is a great example of a partner that provides this full stack I have T solution with Google cloud you'll hear a lot more about that and then you always need pro services so platform partners and pro services because no solution is complete you always need experts either domain experts or technology experts to help bring it all together so we as Google cloud with respect to IOT we never engage with customers without bringing in partners we're always bringing in partners and there's always the three legs of the stool are always there to to stand up a solution and lastly you know I'll spend the least amount of time on this but if you look at from the platform perspective what Google cloud brings is you know a set of managed services that allow companies to connect millions of devices ingest that data process clean store that data and then develop those insights and business outcomes that you want as a plan this is you know a platform that with the other two legs of the stool find it brings the whole solution together for customers so with that I would love to hand it off to Brian who's going to tell you a little bit about species great thank you good morning everyone my name is Brian Arnett I am I need this thing as you can see I am actually I'm a product planner I've been a product planner for the OEM industry for over 25 years I've worked with currently working with Mitsubishi Motors and was recently tasked about two years ago to investigate as part of the product planning at Mitsubishi Motors to get into this telematics game we saw a lot of as you guys know there's the General Motors and and a lot of the OEMs out there are all talking about connected cars and what connected cars means to the OEM industry and we needed to figure this out we need to get part of this game so we started to investigate the telematics industry and we started talking with many different suppliers including Eric's and what we quickly learned is that the biggest lesson of all is we come from two completely different worlds in the automotive industry we have been building cars for a hundred years using waterfall approach to engineering our engineers are basically ingrained in their methodology and go through a series of waterfall check-ins and so suddenly when we start bringing in IOT into the on-board environment into the vehicle we start to realize that we need to blend these two worlds together we need to have some type of a hybrid approach between waterfall development and agile development and so what we're finding is that there's two cultures and we as an automotive manufacturer we need to learn how to be more agile and you'll hear that from probably a lot of OEMs out there from the automotive side you'll read that how automotive manufacturers need to think faster need to move faster to be competitive and so by partnering with ares and working on the IOT space we actually learned how to improve our culture from an engineering perspective to implement more an agile approach to our development and start rethinking basically how we develop vehicles from a more agile point of view not just a waterfall point of view so like any good connected car program we had you know we need to start with a vision so what is it that we want so essentially we encapsulated our vision as the car will be integrated into the IOT network by advanced connected car technology of Mitsubishi Motors in the future our connection of each other and the world around us will only grow we will be part of the Internet of Things connecting you more directly to your world Mitsubishi Connect will provide innovative connected services by applying the information network to provide a more personalized enriched driving experience and what is really important here is the statement where it says we will be part of the Internet of Things connecting you more directly to your world so a lot of times manufacturers think of things as a hardware perspective we connect a cell phone to a car and we do a remote engine start and we're done what we need to start thinking about is connecting the customer to the car not just the devices and so this is also something that automotive OEMs are starting to think about is how do we connect our customers into our world not just bring our device bring their devices into our car so that's something that is very important as we also look at what is our strategy going forward the u.s. traditionally has been the largest market for telematics services in the United States almost all om major brands now have some sort of some sort of aggressive fitment penetration in connected cars and as you know traditionally most of the automotive profitability about you know over a majority of it is traditionally gained by fixed operation expenses sells of oil sell of parts maintenance services things like that with the growth of electric vehicles rapidly you know real being realized in the marketplace some of these traditional fixed operational services and some of these traditional revenues are going to disappear so we need to start thinking about new business models and new ways to generate new future service revenues for things in the automotive sector and becoming more connected to our customers and delivering more on demand related services through IOT you can see from the chart here which is provided by SPD automotive by 2025 over 90 percent of all vehicles shipped to the United States will have an embedded connected and also a smartphone tethered device in the vehicle so within a very short period time within the next five years or so virtually every vehicle shipped in the United States will have some sort of connected device so you're looking at you know a SAR of about 17 million new cars sold every year so by 2025 you're gonna see a rapid expansion of IOT and services being offered in the automotive space so we have only five years to really learn how to get this right so from a Minister beeshees perspective we we looked at it from kind of a three-stage approach and I guess this is kind of like your stool first we looked at it from phase one perspective so we introduced something called a smart phone linked display audio most people know this is like Android auto we introduced the Android auto capability into our vehicles and we have a tethered smartphone system in our vehicle where we can do custom om applications that are approved by Google and can be downloaded from the Google App Store and put on your cell phone and so forth then beginning in 2018 just last year we introduced Mitsubishi Connect which is basically at ECU or a telematics control unit or an embedded device that is installed into the vehicle and then next or our phase 3 we get into more of the analytics and this is where we are going to start learning more about our customers how to service our customers and how to grow our business and then the service or attention of our customers through the analytics that we're going to gain through both the data that comes from the TCU and the data that comes from the tethered device so today Mitsubishi connect system is in the market and launched about a year ago we offer two-year we call safeguard and remote service bundle with the purchase of any Mitsubishi vehicle that is equipped with this so safeguard services include things like automatic collision notification SOS emergency assistance roadside assistance stolen vehicle tracking remote services include things like remote climate control remote door lock car finder parental settings things of like that all of which offer connectivity through your smart phone and you can see the application there in the center we also offer Google home capability where you can use Google you know talk to your car through the Google home device to remote start and so now we're starting to establish a relationship between the customer and the car more directly when you're not in the car and so that's very important typically OMS only were able to make a relationship or establish some kind of connection with the customer when they were driving and when they were in the car now we're able to start establishing some type of a relationship and starting to be able to provide some branding exercise to those customers when they're away from the car and so when they have their smartphone or they're at home in the morning getting ready to go just simply ask Google to start their car pre condition the climate control so some of the key business challenges that we faced that we were looking at Mitsubishi generally is a much smaller company then you know then the Toyotas or the Volkswagens of the world so economies of scale were very important and necessary for us to make a valid business case it talked a little about earlier about having the business case so of course we had a business case and we knew right away that in order to make this work we needed to do it on a global scale we did not necessarily have the volumes only in the United States so we didn't have the volumes only in the European market so we needed to look at this from a big global perspective and so that we started looking at what kind of partnerships we could have in that perspective and quite frankly there weren't many with expect with the exception of maybe Eric's so we needed somebody to deliver automotive-grade IOT services on a global scale we needed we needed a vendor to help us to provide technical leadership and manage the complexities that we were quickly realizing as an automotive manufacturer we weren't experts in IOT we were car guys we needed somebody who could help us become experts and guide us in the IOT place and lastly we needed somebody that could be flexible and adapt to the automotive processes as a change request that we constantly make we're a waterfall development company we're learning as we go we needed somebody that was flexible and easy to work with and understood that we're learning along with them so one of the partners here that it will speak next two areas and they have delivered on a lot of this for us and have been able to be really instrumental in in helping us manage the complexity and helping me and our team at Mitsubishi worldwide learn the IOT space the next thing we needed was Mitsubishi needed an end in modular solution that could adapt globally and grow at the speed of of the feature innovation so we needed to look at the the stack of technology that was available and here's basically a picture of Ares full stack of services so the edge client the connectivity manager the IOT transition services the core services all the TSP services including the call center operations you can see the complexity gets quite overwhelming from an automotive manufacturer so we need somebody to handle all of this and then we also needed somebody who would be able to be flexible with this stack in case something were to change in the future or be able to adjust this stack so this is one of the one of the key requirements we had of a supplier and then lastly as I mentioned we needed the ability to work with our mo partner we currently work with AT&T the mobile network operators to provide seamless 4G LTE connectivity sim provisioning turning on the HA the SIM chip turning off the SIM chip managing the subscriber statuses all of that needed to be done the call center off the authentication tool needed to be developed from a global perspective not just in the United States but also in in Europe and around the world and then we also needed we needed a kind of connectivity a connected vehicle ecosystem that provides significant that provides a significant set for hackers basically the industry needs to have a secure vehicle right as we start getting into the IOT space and we start bringing the outside world kind of into our vehicle one of the biggest concerns of of an OEM is the security of the vehicle obviously we are a very heavily regulated industry I think there's a government agency for just about everything related to the connected car with Nyssa or the Homeland Security or Department of Transportation or whatever we are constantly having to report to the government authorities and so here comes IOT and we're all God on what government authority do we have to report to now when it comes to this so security is one of the things we definitely wanted to make sure we had a good handle on so we need to secure the vehicle while protecting the driver we needed the ability to update the hardware our affe and our services without inconveniencing our customers and we needed to be able to differentiate services based upon the identity of the primary owner or the secondary owner or whether it was a fleet customer or was a retail customer we have many different types of customers when it comes to purchasing vehicles and so it's very important when connecting a car to not just connect the car but to connect the customer and so in order to connect the customer we have to know who that customer is we have to be a little control and manage that so that's very very important and Ares has delivered on many of those areas so that's a little bit for me I like to turn it over to Drew and he could talk to you a little bit about the technical side of the IOT integration Thank You Bryan and thank UI we're so proud and grateful actually to have Mitsubishi as a customer of ours it's it's fantastic and I'll just say we we use the word automotive grade those words actually has a bit of a proxy for reliability and security and complexity and we're really happy that you know even though this is a very mature market actually relative to too many IOT markets that our platform we're winning among quite a few automakers which is actually very difficult to become a supplier of automakers so so that automotive grade really does mean something so if we if we kind of go through several of the key challenges that that Brian mentioned one of them is complexity and actually complexity is one of the key challenges overall in the Internet of Things it's it's very difficult especially for OEMs who are as Brian mentioned generally their business has been about making Hardware potentially for a hundred years like in in in the automotive space and trying to get to services and software can be really challenging and there's a lot of complexity in that this this picture over here on the right is just one view of some of that complexity there's there's other views that you know different different views of how that complexity takes shape and one of the things that that Mitsubishi did that was that was pretty smart to help manage that complexity was they created what I kind of think of as this pyramid of responsibility so they really only had two main suppliers they had eros and they had their hardware tcu provider and then they counted on those two providers to deliver everything else so if you kind of go back to to Mario's picture pretty much everything else was delivered by those two providers so Aris we delivered the platform with all of those remote operations and the analytics that that that's there the UI is the mobile UI and the and the the smart speaker U is the call center the cloud actually in the connectivity we managed all the connectivity as Brian mentioned and then along with the TC provider we actually shared responsibility for the firmware and I'll talk a little bit more about that in a minute okay and then here on the right this is a picture of our Stax very simplified picture of our stack and if we if we go to again one of the key challenges that that Brian mentioned of how do you how do you actually deliver rapidly both for the initial launch and then even being able to add additional services ongoing if you think about a car it's in the market for 10 years so you really don't want to have those those features frozen for 10 years and you have to have an architecture then that that can support that agility not just in the delivery of the initial vehicle but actually on going over that 10-year life cycle so this this architecture is key I'll just walk you through really quickly each one of these kind of major box boxes here has actually something like 10 to 20 micro services in it so I'm not going to go through all those but I will walk you through generally how the architecture looks so starting down here the the edge client that's actually software running in the vehicle so that's actually where we collaborated with the the TCU maker to allow us to put that edge client in the in the vehicle and that is if you look at kind of previous generations of connected cars that is relatively unique a lot of the previous generation connected cars did not have an edge client that was really an extension of the cloud platform they actually just aligned on api's or protocols and that that actually is one of the areas that causes problems with being able to develop rapidly and actually extend the services and platform eventually later on so we have the edge client we have our connectivity platform so our connectivity platform we'll talk about that in the next slide the device platform is actually again really key for being able to abstract the the vehicle from the rest of the services so the edge client the edge client includes capabilities like connection management authentication authorization OTA all of the the the local interfaces to actually perform remote operations all of those capabilities are here but it communicates back and forth to the device platform in an abstraction that allows us to just make changes here without having to make changes in the full device platform or even in the service platform so very key for this is actually getting that abstraction correct and we've seen a lot of platforms again where there's there's tight coupling especially between here and here or maybe even between here and there between the the service platform and the and the and the edge client that actually constrains that those eventual developments okay and just a quick note if you if you think about the IOT core the IOT core actually is part is one of the micro services here in the device platform that's part of the communications infrastructure all right and then from a connectivity perspective eros is actually you know we we provide connectivity for the Internet of Things in many many horizontals so we have customers and are many many verticals we have customers probably in every single Internet of Things vertical in the market and what we've seen for you know with with many years of experience is generally you know particularly large programs they fall apart if the if the customer really does not pay attention to connectivity if you if you really go into the market and you think cellular connectivity is more or less similar to Wi-Fi or wired and you ignore the complexities of cellular connectivity then you'll run into problems at scale there will be problems if you if you really just think about it you know it if you have problems maybe with making calls or connections in a particular room of your house you can always move to another room or or reposition yourself but a car can't do that you know car sitting in your garage I can't do that so you need to have a connectivity management platform that's really optimized for handling the Internet of Things which is very different than you know the what you need for consumers and consumer handsets and then there's other aspects of of cellular that come into play like you know security and we'll talk a little bit about security in a minute being able to optimize the the response times across the cellular connectivity you think about a remote operation on your vehicle you need to have it happen quickly rather than and actually you have to balance the speed and user experience with the power management that's going on in the vehicle as well and as Mario mentioned as as we as we moved to you know from 3G to 4G even on into 5g and particular and potentially even incorporating Wi-Fi you need to have a connectivity management system that can actually handle all of those different modes all right and then one of the other challenges that that Brian mentioned was security and in in with regard to the security need to really take a security domain approach there are actually at least eight major security domains in the connected vehicle space and each one of those security domains needs attention independently and then you need to make sure that you cover the full supply chain if you think about from the time the car is created until the time the car is crushed there's so many different parts of that lifecycle that come into play and each one of those stages in that lifecycle needs to be secured and then relative to connectivity again if you ignore connectivity something that we see again from from have seen from from customers in the past that connectivity is a really critical part of the security domain again a relative to a cellular cellular it was designed to be a many-to-many type of communication mechanism if you think about it so you have to apply the security mechanisms to make turn that many-to-many into a secure private network mechanism and one of the the most famous pacts actually in connected vehicle in the last few years was at least exacerbated by the fact that that the connectivity security domain was ignored so there was a in that case there was a hole in the vehicle on the edge which in itself was was bad but what happened was the the hole was exposed via connectivity so that anybody who was on that connectivity provider could actually access that hole and it's key here actually to assume that you're never done you have to regularly scan and and that that's also why OTA updates are so critical all right and and then the last thing I thought I'd spend a few slides just talking about why Eris is moving to GCP and we're really proud as mario mentioned to become a partner of Google and last year like perhaps some of you I was sitting here at Google next and we were contemplating you know potentially moving to two GCP and ultimately I just want to share some of the reasons why we chose to make that move so number one we think of cloud 2.0 is really kubernetes if you think about cloud 1.0 being really about virtual machines primarily cloud 2.0 is about kubernetes and of course Google is is creator and the biggest contributor to kubernetes but in particular GCP has really a large lead on managed kubernetes so if you look really across the the cloud providers and you do your own evaluation like we did you'll find that in managed kubernetes Google actually has a very strong lead and the way we look at it is and I you know I love our DevOps team but if I have to make a choice of hiring one more DevOps person or hiring a data scientist I'd rather hire the data scientist and getting a good managed kubernetes infrastructure in place allows us to control really our DevOps workload the second reason is about really being customer and developer friendly and you know I go back to this this this quote at the bottom that that's my quote actually if of cloud 1.0 ROI is if you think about those ROI is those were really about you know having your own private data center where you had tens of usually operations kind of usually standard operations folks and the ROI is were relatively easy for kind of reducing a large number of operations folks and moving those to be DevOps folks in the cloud but now your CEO or when you say when I say your CEO I mean my CEO is actually saying hey we're still spending too much money in the cloud what can we do that's that's an improvement and again as we as we kind of look around the the industry at different cloud providers what we see out of DCP is that you know just from cost transparency and kind of optimization ease there are really large advantages in GCP and I think you can you can get to to some of these same capabilities in some of the other cloud providers but not nearly as easily and for us in our our kind of old cloud provider we actually ended up with 15 separate accounts in order to manage all of the access controls and have cost visibility the cost visibility that we wanted and what we see in GCP is it's just tremendously easier to more automatically get that visibility the access control and the cost optimizations that we're trying to get to and in the last the last big reason is we do see this opportunity to actually collaborate with Google and their customers on making the Internet of Things less complex and easier for OEM so you really see that nearly every single om on the planet is on this journey from unconnected product to connected service and that's really important that difference between that those words product and service as Brian mentioned often times in the in the automotive space the only interaction that the the actual automaker might have is maybe even just at the point of the dealership and that might be the last interaction that they have with the customer previously so the fact that they can they can have a connected vehicle they can understand how the the consumer and the owner is actually using the vehicle they can have opportunities to interact with the owner on a regular basis is really it's a it's a game changer in the business and in the business of many OEMs so for us we see you know some of the areas that we're working with provisioning at IOT scale in a secure way seamless connectivity and OTA updates of edge devices I've mentioned a few times about why that's important in the space the advanced remote operations services if you think about especially in the moving things area the the fact that you have you know mqtt and and an IOT core and and some of those things those are those are great but it doesn't make sense for every single OEM to reinvent how remote operations are done a lot of that needs to be more standardized and shareable and leverageable and then the automotive grade edge computing where if you think about the future where again the the if you think about web web 1.0 - web 2.0 and web 1.0 you also had more of very rudimentary kind of logic getting pushed to the edge to your browser and then kind of interacting over rudimentary api's back to the platform that's a similar thing that's going to happen as in the in the edge computing area so that we have the edge computing logic is more of a adaptable updatable set of logic that can get easily pushed to the edge interact in a really optimized way with the the cloud-based platform so these are some of the areas that we're really excited about working with with Google on and being able to to provide - to some of Google's customers [Music]
