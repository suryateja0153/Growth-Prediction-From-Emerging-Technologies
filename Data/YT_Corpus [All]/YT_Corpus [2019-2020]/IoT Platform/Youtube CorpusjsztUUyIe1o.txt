ARE GROWING SO CAN YOU TELL US A MUCH I WAS JUST DOING A TALK HERE FOUR YEARS AGO WE WERE TALKING ABOUT CONNECT IOT DEVICES TO NOW AND YOU IN PREVIEW NOW WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IOT AND MAKING THINGS GO FASTER SEE HAPPENING IS THE FIRST COUPLE IOT TO BE POSSIBLE, TO BE POSSIBLE HAVE MILLIONS OF DEVICES SENDING THAT WE HAVE BEEN ON OVER THE LAST IOT EASY, MAKING IT SO I CAN GO QUICKLY. YEAH. AND WE REALLY IOT CENTRAL THE SASS OFFERING FOR IN ABOUT 15 SECONDS, CONFIGURE IT THE SAME DAY, IT'S PRETTY INCREDIBLE A COUPLE YEARS. COMING FROM FAR FUTURE IT'S ABLE ENABLING THE CONNECTIVITY TO ENABLE THEM TO BE ABLE TO MODEL IS HAPPENING IN ALL ASPECTS OF IT, ON EQUAL FOOTING WITH A LOT OF THE THE PARTY SO AS WE ARE MOVING TOWARD TO THAT WAVE AND BRINGING YOU TECHNOLOGY ONE AND STILL ADDING FEATURES AND TELL US ABOUT THE BIG ANNOUNCEMENTS DID DURING YOUR SESSION TODAY?  WE HAVE A REALLY WELCOME POSED AND THE IOT AND EDGE CAPABILITIES, OUR THAT AZURE DIGITAL TWINS AND IOT INITIATIVES WE HAVE FOR THE UP COMING AND PLAY AND IT REALLY BORROWS ON WE SAW MANY DECADES BACK WITH WINDOWS WANTED TO DEVELOP A PREFERENTIAL TO BUILD SOFTWARE OR FIRM WEAR AS SYNC IT WAS SUPER FRAGILE AND TYPE INNOVATIONS THAT REALLY WINDOWS AND THE WAY WE ARE DOING THAT IS IN AN OPEN SOURCE WAY USING OPEN WORKS ON ANY OPERATING SYSTEM, ANY A CAPABILITY MODEL THAT THE DEVICE A CLOUD SOLUTION AND THEN THE CLOUD THAT DEVICE THE TELEMETRY AND DATE IT RECEIVES AND WHEN IT CONNECTS SOLUTION AND STARTS SENDING THE YOU KNOW WHAT THE DEVICE DOES AND  THAT WILL REQUIRE THE HARDWARE  YES. WHAT IS IN IT FOR THEM ON BOARD THE PLUG AND PLAY? ABSOLUTELY BOARD SO WE ALREADY HAVE THE AZURE ARE ADDING CAPABILITIES FOR PLUG AND VISUAL STEWED -- STUDIO AND TOIL AND THEY ARE PART OF AN ECO CAPE P -- COMPATIBLE AND GET GOING CENTRAL AND I'M BUILDING AN APP TO CATALOG. YES. I SEE THE  THAT MEANS THAT I WILL JUST ADD THE DEVICE AND EVEN BETTER MAKING SO YOU WILL BIBLE TO GO TO THE DEVICE CAN DO IN IOT CENTRAL APPLICATION THE DEVICE. SO THE APPLICATION AND PLAY THE DEVICE SIDE OF THE TO CONNECT THEN THERE IS THE BACK THE SERVICES IT TAKES TO CREATE YOU NEED TO HAVE A DEVICE CLOUD NEED TO DO TRANSFORMATION OF THE DATA FOR ANALYTICS AND APPLY REAL HIGH VISIBILITY AND DISASTER AND THE SASS APPLICATION AND PLATFORM AROUND CENTRAL AND BEING SASS WE LIGHT UP. WHAT ARE THE LATEST WE DELIVERED IN IOT CENTRAL SINCE WE HAVE DONE MULTIPLE DASH BOARDS IS USER PERSONALIZED, YOU CAN TOGGLE HAVE A WHOLE NEW SET OF OPTIONS CONTINUOUSLY FOR EXAMPLE THE SERVICE FLOW EXPERIENCE SO AS YOU ARE MONITORING FOR PATTERNS YOU AUTOMATICALLY TRIGGER AND AZURE AND A BUNCH OF OTHERS. MORNING IN THE KEYNOTE YOU SAW "STARBUCKS. CENTRAL CONNECTING TO AZURE SPHERE TO CONNECT TO THE ON PRIM COFFEE LOOK AND FEEL TO IT PART OF OUR BUNCH OF NEW FEATURES THAT IS GREAT THAT CENTRAL DOES IT HAPPENS TO EXACT PLATFORM SERVICES. SO INSIDE, BUT THEY ARE CRUCIAL, RIGHT?  ABSOLUTELY. YOU REALLY NEED TO RICH AND POWERFUL AND SO WE ALSO  YEP. LIKE TOP OF YOUR HEAD, OF GREAT SET OF INNOVATIONS WE BROUGHT. WE ALREADY ANNOUNCED A PARTNERSHIP AZURE MOBILITY AND CAPABILITIES HAVE LONG-TERM STORAGE SUPPORT AND PART OF IT IN VERY FAST SUB SECOND IN LONG-TERM STORAGE WITH STILL FOR QUERYING BUT MUCH, MUCH LESS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT LIKE THE REASON OVER THE DATA THAT THE DEVICES ARE TIME SERIES INSIGHTS SUPER POWERFUL ERRINGS OF THE CENTRAL AND CAPABILITIES BE A TOUGH QUESTION WHICH IS IOT WHICH WAS VERY MUCH MORE OF A PROOF IT'S LIKE PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD OKAY SO WHAT IS THE STRATEGY MID  ABSOLUTELY. SO WE HAVE A RICH AND IT REALLY STARTED OFF FOCUSED  YEP. TO BE PRODUCED. WE'VE MAKING IT AVAILABLE WITH OR MAKING IS GOING TO SPEED THINGS UP A LOT AN IOT EDGE DEVICE TO IT AND BEING INTO IOT CENTRAL AND MANAGE THE THAT ARE RUNNING OUT ON IOT EDGE EXTENTABILITY POINTS THAT ARE COMING ONE AND REALLY PART OF THE VISION A HOSTED OPERATION PLATFORM THAT AND DELIVER IT TO YOUR CUSTOMERS WORRYING ABOUT ALL THE TOIL AND TO SAY THE DIRECTION WE ARE GOING FOR IOT? IOT-365 IN A LOT OF ON TOP OF THE PLATFORM AND GET TO BUT VERY WELL COMPOSED. AZURE CALLED DIGITAL TWINS. YES.  GOING IN THE FUTURE. IT'S IN ANNOUNCEMENTS LATER THIS YEAR. WHAT THAT DIGITAL TWINS GET USED IN ENVIRONMENTS PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT. SCENARIOS BUILDING OR AN ELECTRIC GRID WHERE OF THE ENVIRONMENT IS CRITICALLY YOU TO HAVE A MODEL OF AN ENVIRONMENT TO CONNECT IOT DEVICES TO THAT MODEL ALIVE WITH IOT. IT ENABLES YOU TO THE EVENTS IN A SERVERLESS WAY AND SUPER POWERFUL AND ANNOUNCED JUST AND PLAY CAPABILITIES TO IT AS WELL TYPES OF SYSTEMS. SO WHAT DOES INTO DIGITAL TWINS. SO WHAT IT INSTANCE AND WHEN I CONNECT AN IOT AND PLAY LIKE IOT CENTRAL. GOT TO STACK THE LAYERS ON TOP OF EACH AND IOT CENTRAL. THAT WILL COME AND IT WILL BECOME A FEATURE IN CENTRAL AS WELL AS DIRECTLY.  FOR WHEN IT COMES TO BUILDING IT THE CONNECTIVITY OF THE DEVICE IN YEP. THERE IS SOMETHING YOU MENTIONED CONNECTIVITY. YEAH. PHYSICAL IS RIGHT. PARTNERING COMPANIES EASY BECAUSE BEFORE HAVING THE ABILITY NEED TO HAVE A CONNECTION, A CONNECTION GREAT POINT A LOT OF TIMES WHAT CONNECTION ALREADY AND SO TEACHING SERVICE IS PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD PROVISIONED IN THE RIGHT SOLUTION A MOBILE NETWORK OR AN OVERLAY NETWORK JUST DOWNLOAD AND ANNOUNCED SOMEWHAT PROVIDERS AND WHAT THEY ARE IS IT'S DEVICE WAKES UP ON THEIR NETWORK DEVICE PROVISIONING SERVICE TO FIND AND A FULL RENDEZVOUS WITH FINDING ENABLED AND A SOLUTION AND IT JUST ACCELERANT. THE FUNNY, NOT SO ALL THESE FUNCTIONALITIES RIGHT. BOOTH AND TONS OF DEMOS ON THE BOOTH  THAT IS RIGHT. AND WE WILL SO A FEW MORE WORDS ABOUT YOU KNOW BECAUSE. THE INTERESTING PART REST OF THE WORLD. WE'RE SEEING FLOW INTEGRATION IN TERMS OF CENTRAL. 365 STORY. WHEN WE COME TO TALK THE DEVICES CONTROLLING THE DEVICES, TO THE WORLD OF IT. IN TERMS OF POINTS. SO WHAT'S GOING ON ON THAT WORLD ALSO CAN START WORKING WITH OF OURS HAS ALWAYS BEEN ON SECURITY. WAS AZURE SECURITY CENTER FOR IOT, AND IT'S REALLY A FIRST BY A LEADING IS IT ENABLES YOU TO MONITOR EVERYTHING RUNNING IN YOUR IOT SOLUTION IN AS WELL AS IOT EDGE DEVICES AND FOR EXAMPLE, BECOMES INFECTED WITH TO A BOT NET, FOR EXAMPLE, WE'LL TEEN IT ISSUE AN ALERT DO A REMEDIATION, IF AN ADMIN WHO HAS ACCESS TO THE WE DETECT THAT WE CAN GIVE YOU THE THAT THEY HAD ACCESS TO TO HELP AND THEN THAT ALL WORKS TOGETHER SIEM SYSTEM. IT'S SUPER AMAZING. REALLY KEEP AN IT SOLUTION REALLY OF THE 15 MINUTES AS DISCUSSING EDGE AS WELL WE DIDN'T HAVE TIME SECONDS. 30 SECONDS. IOT EDGE. 10 IOT IS NOW GA FOR IOT EDGE. WE WORKLOAD TO AN ON PREMISE KUBERNETES OF ARM 64 SUPPORT FOR LINUX. AND LINE IS NOW GENERALLY AVAILABLE MISSING BUT ANYWAY A LOT OF WILL IT'S DOING GREAT IN THE MARKET. GREAT EXAMPLE. MORE COMING UP AFTER  FUNNY YOU SHOULD ASK THAT QUESTION. THE EXCHANGE 4. 0 POP THREE AND TO DO IT RIGHT WE DESIGNED A SPECK WE TESTED THE FEATURE WE SHIPPED THAT WE WERE SO CLEVER WE BUILT NOBODY WOULD NOTICE IT. UNTIL A AND THEN WE GOT AN EMAIL FROM SOME HE WORKED AT MICROSOFT. YEAH, THE OUR EASTER EGG BROKE SOME TOOLING THAT HE RAN. AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THIS EASTER EGG WOULDN'T AFFECT KEYWORDS AND YOU'D NEVER REALLY DID AND THAT IS WHY YOU DON'T EVER BECAUSE SOMEBODY'S GOING TO FIND YOU JUST DON'T WANT TO DO THAT. EVERYONE TO THE XAMARIN SHOW I'M A BIT OF XAMARIN 101 FOR YOU PREVIOUS BINDINGS AND COMMANDS AT THE RESOURCE AWESOME ALLOWS YOU TO CREATE DIFFERENT PAGE LEVEL OR APP LEVEL LIKE I SAID. ABOUT STATIC RESOURCES AND STATIC THAT MAIN COLOR, SET IT RIGHT HERE. COOL BUILT INTO XAMARIN FORMS CALLED TO REALLY CHANGE ANYTHING AT ALL ONE OR TWO PROPERTIES IN YOUR CODE UPDATE IN YOUR APPLICATION AUTOMATICALLY AWESOME. LET'S SEE WHAT IT MEANS VISUAL STUDIO SIMPLE APPLICATION, BINDINGS HERE TO DO RESOURCES. SO BOLD. I HAVE A BLUE BACKGROUND HERE INCREASES BY WHATEVER I'VE ENTERED. SET ALL THESE PROPERTIES ON EVERY
