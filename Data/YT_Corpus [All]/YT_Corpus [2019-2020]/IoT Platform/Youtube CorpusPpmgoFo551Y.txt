 In the previous tutorial, we explain how  to use the text tool and I/O field. In this tutorial, we will use these components to  display one integer and one bool value. For integer value, we will choose the "Bucket Brigade.Int1" variable. For bool value, we will choose "Bucket Brigade.Boolean" variable. Assign variables to the text tool and I/O field. Now we will add "Graphic list" to our screen. The graphic list can display "n" images by user choice. Set component size. Now, we want that display four different states (images). First, choose the variable "Bucket Brigade.Int1". Then we have to define four states and assign four images to those states. Click "Manage Graphic List Images". Define states 0,1,2,3 and assign image for all states. Click the "Save" button and reload the "Client page". To test graphic list insert numbers from 0-3 into I/O field. The graphic list will change images as you set in Editor. If you insert value which is not defined in the Editor  the graphic list wouldn't display any image.
