 "Event View" is an advanced component for tabular displaying events. In this video tutorial, we will show how to use the "Event View" component. From the screen list, choose "Example events". The event view screen is shown. Click on layout picture, on the right side of the screen will appear Event view Panel. Now we will create a test variable. Go to "Configurator" page, select Variables and add an internal variable (EventTEST). Select created variable, chose variable type, check Event checkbox. Add desired values in the fields: Event bottom value, Event top value, Event bottom text, Event top text. Go back to the Editor. Click on the Event layout picture. Now we will add created variable to Event view, click "Choose Variables" and select the desired variable "EventTEST". Also, we will add I/O Field to change the value of the variable (EventTEST). Save changes and go to the "Client page" (platform.inviewscada.com) page. Event screen is shown, user can choose a date to display events   in the desired time period. There are three options to show specific Events: Variables, User actions or both. Now we will change the value of a variable (range of the variable is 50-100). If a value is more than 100 events will appear on the screen, the same will happen with values below 50. Refresh table data, Export table data, Delete all selected item from the table, Show hidden alarms are add-ons for easier management.
