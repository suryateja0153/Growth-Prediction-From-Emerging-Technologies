 Ampelmann Operations provides safe offshore access for people and cargo. Our vision is to provide offshore access as easy as crossing the street. In order to get there, we need a lot of data. And right now offshore Internet access is very limited and we can only use a small bandwidth. ConNXT is our out-of-the-box IoT solution, which fully runs on the Microsoft Azure IoT Suite. With ConNXT we connect assets for our customers, collect the data and control their operations really quickly. ConNXT, for us, is really the Swiss Army knife of data access for offshore systems. So, the moment our systems are plugged in, large amounts of data start to flow around. We use many different Microsoft products for further analysis. For example, we link it to data, that is stored in Dynamics to correlate specific data points to specific products and items. Ampelmann has built a really great solution. And what you see is, this is a journey we are on with them. And what we'll do in the future is to be able to tap into new sources of data, such as weather forecasts. By collecting more data points, we are able to better understand and analyze the behavior of the Ampelmann system in relation to vessel motions and weather conditions. With that data we can improve our design and gain a high availability.
