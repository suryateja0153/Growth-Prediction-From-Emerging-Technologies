 [Musica] Good morning, welcome everybody welcome to the final day of the ACCA convention 2020 They have been four incredible days with so many people following our presentations and the latest news that we have proposed and showed and many more that you'll see this last day I truly suggest you to continue following this event in order to take advantage of our current offers that are valid until the end of this day so don't miss this opportunity at this point I'll straight move on to today's news we've already gonee through the main convention announcement, that is usBIM The Cloud BIM integrated system remember usBIM is the applications and functions integrated system to manage the digitalization of constructions and infrastructures in a easy, secure, shared and collaborative way exclusively online and with any device a true innovation we have then presented usBIM 10 the usBIM applications package which is free to anyone especially to those watching preview and that have followed the event I repeat, it is a version of usBIM with 10 applications, free space and cloud obviously usBIM is not just about this ten applications but it is from now on the world of applications that we will quickly see again to better understand the path that we are taking and later on we will take a deeper look at it I'll quickly show you 14 more applications of the usBIM integrated system some of which are already available and can be purchased on our online store others are coming soon let's start immediately with a series of applications that regard the Open BIM, therefore working on IFC files, as you know we are the company with the largest number of IFC certified applications in the world, we truly believe that Open BIM is the future, so let's get started with usBIM.clash this is an application to create clash detection and to highlight interferences between federated models in IFC format or even in other BIM formats such as Revit, Edificius Sketchup and so on, with BCF control report production consequently it's an application to verify for example conflicts that can arise between the structural and the building installation models and so on let's now move on to the second application usBIM.merge is an application to merge the content of different BIM models in IFC format in a new IFC file both with regard to the geometry and the information data IFC files are a bit difficult to handle but we are at the forefront in terms of IFC files production and maintenance as you will find out today and by the end of this presentation so here it's a matter of taking two IFC files and create a single one or create a part of it from a file in addition, the third application usBIM.compare which is an application to compare different versions of a BIM model in IFC format and immediately get the differences in terms of geometry or information meaning that I can produce a model with my BIM authoring software and update it over time each time exporting IFC files, obviously also upload them to usBIM.platform and thanks to this application that allows us to immediately see the differences between the various versions of the IFC model that we have reproduced moreover usBIM.checker is the application to verify and edit the entity properties of a BIM model in IFC format and manually with various filters and advanced functions or automatically through data imported from an Excel file this application is also very important and it is useful to carry out timely verifications on IFC files at this stage I would like to welcome our expert Valerio Good morning Valerio Hi Guido and welcome everybody Valerio will present usBIM.checker a great innovation to check IFC files So let's get started with the presentation Let's immediately see what are the main characteristics of usBIM.checker the BIM validation tool complete and quick that enables professionals and BIM specialists to work directly on IFC project data, to check and produce BIM models with defined properties and values, in fact usBIM.checker fully manages IFC parameters verifies, inserts, edits and delete object values and properities of an IFC file either manually or automatically by comparing with predefined templates in usBIM.checker you can take advantage of the usBIM.viewer potential being integrated to import, view and federate BIM models in addition, you can search for properties in fact you can verify the object properties of the BIM model and you can control values in detail you can also verify the consistency of property values in a BIM model in IFC format as compared with predefined values. With usBIM.checker you can edit properities therefore you can insert, delete, update the properties of an IFC model manually or automatically by means of comparison with 151 00:07:55,460 -- 00:07:59,830 user predefined templates or you can add properties thanks to usBIM.checker you can add che aggiunge al file e fc properties and values to the IFC file that are generated by different BIM tools and imported in usBIM.checker from Excel files furthermore you can generate consistency checks between properties and values contained in the IFC file and those defined in the control templates therefore with usBIM.checker you control the quality of your project and your model through BIM validation processes which are complete and reliable that was all from my side, thank you for your attention I let Guido to continue the presentation Thank you Valerio we'll see you later to explore another interesting aspect it is now the moment of our fifth application, the digital signature consequently usBIM.digitalsignature is the application to digitally sign directly online any file that stored on the usBIM integrated system and to view all the signatures on each document that's very important generally we send files via mail we apply our signature mettiamo and we send it back that can be confusing on the contrary, in the usBIM integrated system we can sign files are directly on the platform, therefore a big advantage and no mistakes. Let's now take a look at how easy it is to use it all the files that are stored on the platform can obviously be checked and then even automatically be signed imagine that with usBIM.chat I can simply share the link and have the document signed basically I can rapidly ask a colleague of mine or any other collaborator to sign a document and from a link in the chat you can straight go and see the signature on the document the sixth cutting-edge application regarding the blockchain our application usBIM.blockchain is the application to guarantee authenticity the date certain and immutability over time of any file stored on the usBIM integrated system that is registered on blockchain the problem of having the guarantee of authenticity of immutability over time of digital models is something we believe it is crucial we are the first ones and, I believe, the only ones so far to have implemented the possibility of authenticating files on the blockchain on our platform you can do that in a very simple way too you just need to select a file and request its authentication on the block chain and that's it, all automatically registered on the bitcoin blockchain therefore a blockchain that is public inviolable and obviously highly secure, see the operations are very easy, you will also receive a certification with the characteristics and the links to verify that the file has actually been authenticated on the blockchain at this point let's move on to our seventh application that is usBIM.reality a functionality of usBIM.browser to navigate BIM models in virtual reality or with the realtime rendering this function is active on all the 3D models that are stored in usBIM.browser so either IFC models, Revit, Edificius Sketchup models and so on to navigate in virtual reality, it is obviously necessary to have an adequate virtual reality viewer it is a valuable application because it allows us to practically navigate in virtual reality any model that we have on our platform and any format, as you can see we can also investigating the objects, therefore if the digital twin on the platform contains other documents linked to objects we can view them directly from virtual reality so we are taking a tour directly in the model we haven't created a model beforehand to navigate it as it normally happens but we access in any model that we had on our platform here you can see how I could have a federated model with structural, MEP, architectural and switch between models querying the objects to see the information that we have loaded on each object of the BIM models next, eighth application IoT, Internet of Things usBIM.IoT is the application to integrate the BIM model with systems and internet of things sensors, to view sensors data on the model in real time and obtain a dashboard with information summary and sensors control specifically, on our model on the platform through usBIM.IoT we can connect the sensors that we have in our building for example, then we can control room humidity and see it on the colour or verify the Co2 levels or the temperature, everything is transmitted by sensors and connected to the models that we have on the platform we could manage electrical power in this case we are verifying for example the production of a photovoltaic system and read it directly from the model or from any device as we've already mentioned usBIM is on cloud and can be used with any browser we can carry out security checks again directly on our model as we can see a window has been opened and on the model it is highlighted in red that the window has been opened obviously this connection can happen through many systems that are on the market today clearly it is a very powerful tool, we can receive information from sensors but we can even activate actuators directly from the model, here we have switched the light off directly from the model we can activate cameras or even control everything with Alexa for example and see the effects directly on the model, hence the integration between Internet of Things sensors and BIM models that are on our platform next we have our ninth application regarding facility management usBIM.facility the application for building maintenance management and the advanced integration of all the facility management functionalities with the BIM model and process or with the document production of the digital BIM consequently, we can connect 2 worlds, two systems that were completely separated until yesterday that are the facility management with the BIM areas we have created a connection between the two worlds this means that I can connect my BIM model to a facility management model and, as a consequence everything concerning assets control asset verification and maintenance it can be done straight on the facility program everything can be reported, accessible and visible directly on the BIM model here we can see for example which are the activities and operations done on the fan coil units of course some operations can be performed straight on the model we can select an object on the model for instance and activate maintenance requests meaning a total integration moreover, we could have some applications to manage maintenances, some mobile application to manage maintenance consequently everything I perform on my filed of activities is immediately reported on the system and is likewise rapidly addressed on the BIM model, next the tenth application, we have usBIM.project an application to schedule processes of construction assignment, design, execution and maintenance with the integration of BIM model together with activities time and resources, meaning that we can create some activities and work phases to which we allocate time and resources to manage our projects next, our eleventh application regarding Gantt so we have usBIM.Gantt, the application for BIM projects scheduling the well-known 4D BIM project management to plan and optimize the time-variable in construction processes in this case we create a Gantt diagram of a building construction activities for example and straight on the BIM model we can see works progress, costs and so on twelfth application usBIM.editor is the application to work directly on and edit the IFC models to create drawing models process rendering, navigate them in immersive virtual reality and much more yet without using any BIM authoring program, I'd like to have here on stage Valerio, hi Guido welcome back Valerio this time you will show us usBIM.editor fine then, let's immediately see what are the main characteristics of usBIM.editor with usBIM.editor you open view and federate BIM and IFC models that are produced by any BIM authoring software such as Edificius, Revit Archicad, Allplan, Tekla, EdiLus and so on you can view the model taking advantage of different style and options you can create groups and selection filters on properties or on classifications you can edit the model and manage its properties, for example you can delete replace or add geometric and information properties of the single entities, delete, duplicate and shift the BIM model entity, create properties and classification templates to automatically apply to other models or import your properties from an Excel file into the IFC model and automatically associate them to an entity class or to a class selection create a new version of the IFC model to export in usBIM.editor, manage an extensive BIM objects library and insert new objects in the IFC model directly from the supplied BIM objects library which offers thousands of free resources, also take advantage of the integration with external software such as Sketchup, Blender or Rhino Grasshopper for modelling solids, as a matter of fact you can create 3D solid models of any type and shape and you can import them in usBIM.editor solid models can be contextualized to the objects of the BIM model that you are managing in IFC format and you can edit the objects geometry of your BIM model but through external solid modelling tools and find completely changed objects in your model in usBIM.editor, you can assign materials to each object of the IFC model exporting them from the integrated HD texture library make the most of the artificial intelligence to produce maximum quality renders at the highest speed insert the rendered IFC model in a pictur and take advantage of photo editing tools, view and manage all the information of the IFC objects through tables, schedules and reports, automatically obtain all your drawings organized in customizable drawing models create and customize floor plans, elevation views, cross-sections isometric cut-aways, create working drawings directly from the IFC model construction documents are dynamically connected with the IFC model and at each project variation, all the documents will be automatically updated, finally you can export all the construction documents in DXF, DWG PDF format and so on in usBIM.editor view the results of your architectural choices in real time and your material choices starting from section planes previously created by isometric cut-aways, navigate the model in immersive virtual reality and thoroughly evaluate your design choices create appealing multimedial presentations to share with your clients or collaborators thanks to the BIM video studio integration working on IFC files allows you to freely manage information access data during the building's entire lifecycle enrich the BIM model with information produced by different specialists involved using a single tool and get the most out of an open interoperable standard that allows you to create valid processes thank you so much Valerio let's continue with more presentations thank you too let's now take a look at the thirtheenth application, usBIM.render this is an impressive functionality to create professional photorealistic and realtime renderings of BIM models viewed in usBIM.browser also IFC or Revit models Edificius, Sketchup can be viewed online and in your browser this means that we can produce renderings directly on our browser without needing any special graphics cards and they are extremely photorealistic renderings because we use cutting edge technology let's take a look at a small example to see what we can do this is what we see in our browser which is a model that is uploaded on our platform, by activating a function it is immediately launched a rendering process on the server even if you don't have a particular graphic card you'll be able to obtain stunning results in this case we have just speeded up the rendering time I guarantee that the time to produce the rendering that you've seen and this outdoor rendering that you can see now are between one and two minutes to reach this same level of quality thanks to the integrated Radeon ProRender engine that uses artificial intelligence technology you can create renders in just a metter of seconds our idea is to take advantage of all the newest technology and make it available on our usBIM integrated system so to be able to produce extraordinary results with a simple browser finally, the last application usBIM.hololens the application for augmented reality that connects information and usBIM models to reality this is truly state-of-the-art technology having the possibility to wear hololens and navigate in our realty here we are in our headquarter in fact, directly from reality we can read the information that is on the platform and on the model so, getting closer for example to this piece of furniture or this fan coil unit we can see a part of the model and the relating information on the platform then I can enter any environment and by simply observing the various areas and the various objects, I can access their information on the platform for instance, here you can see all the data relating to this fire extinguisher this is very innovative we are using the top technology to make it available on our usBIM these were the 14 new announcements of the usBIM integrated system now another aspect still relating to usBIM and specifically to usBIM.platform, so we get to the core of BIM for this reason, I'd like to welcome on stage one of our usBIM experts Giovanni the BIM manager thank you Guido, hello everybody well, as I was saying we are in the heart of BIM this time we will explore an aspect more relating to technical standards and take a look at a Common Data Environment, the so called CDE or according to the Italian standards the ACDat now our expert will show us some new aspects of the usBIM.platform then let's not waste time and let's immediately start by taking a look at what is new in usBIM.platform well let me tak you over a presentation of usBIM.platform the ACCA software CDE, what is a CDE? The tender and public works code introduces the use of electronic tools that adopt interoperable platforms by means of non-proprietary open formats we are talking about BIM with the use of open data while the Baratono decree envisages a data sharing environment within which information processes are digitally managed UNI and EN ISO standards 19650 and UNI 11337 describe the characteristics of an environment of data sharing, for each document it must be possible to manage a unique ID which can then be useful to classify documents classifying also means endowing the same documents with attributes in this way each information container will be uniquely identified and characterized according to reference standards the ability to manage the status transition across specific environments which are also able to handle the value change of a specific attribute, have traceability of all the actions performed inside the data sharing environment being able to manage different permissions also, controlled access for different users participating in the process managed by part of the administrators usBIM.platform allows you to do all of that it is the only data sharing environment or Common Data Envionment in the world to be certified for the management of the IFC open format it is a BIM management solution that can manage the entire construction life cycle starting from design up to construction and management it is an intelligent system capable of managing works and infrastructures, in fact automatically it is equipped with all the technology integrated in the usBIM system it is an open platform, it supports and works with the IFC Open BIM and it is a solution in the cloud, a software and services that allows you, through this technology which all public administations are adopting to ensure that all actors involved in the process can collaborate between them and in fact following the latest market trends and the specifications indicated by the agency for digital Italy usBIM.platform is the only environment for data sharing today to be qualified within the cloud marketplace of digital Italy in fact it is compliant with the CSA STAR the cloud security alliance as alternative to ISO 27001 and as already mentioned, it is the only CDE to be inserted into the cloud of the agency's marketplace for digital Italy regarding software and services, it is therefore the only data sharing environment that as we will see later, allows you to make a digital twin within the solutions in the cloud in regulatory compliance at national and international levels who can use the CDE? From 2019 to 2025 all supply chain actors are required to adopt a CDE but above all, this must be promoted by public administrations let's see what usBIM.platform allows us to do as I said usBIM.platform inherits all the technology of the usBIM integrated system, here in fact we are seeing within our headquarters the possibility in the cloud to apply render technology and real time rendering directly on the IFC open BIM models created within our common data environment then like in any relevant CDE there is the need to manage permissions in a compartmentalized manner and access to the various informative contents that describe our digital twin in a complete manner, then as we can see each actor has access with its own permission level also it has direct access from the model together with guarantee of visibility only and to all the documents that needs to view in any format they are shared be it photographic material or IFC models, PDF files we can manage attributes access permissions, we can guarantee validation gates and documents transfer but in case we have an unstructured file, how can we compartmentalize the access? we could for example use bookmark functions that punctually direct us to the informative content that we need to view or that we want view in a very dynamic way, we can add all the details for example related to our photovoltaic system and as you can see, with a simple click log in to all the technical specifications that characterize that system let's now see another application, the management of another kind of complex model linked for example to infrastructural aspects, our viewing services in cloud are the best performing worldwide, in fact they allow you to view linear works directly whithin their territorial context here we are seeing a railway section of Napoli-Cancello that runs through the Irpinia district and every single detail is modeled, it can be queried, it is rich in information as prescribed by technical specifications and information management plans each actor by simply using a web browser can access information next we see the supervisor of public works of Emilia Romagna and region Lombardia of which Pietro Baratono is administrator and is the author of the ministerial decree 562017 or BIM decree the first BIM application example on a government project that we are seeing and that has already been implemented in reality the Navetta bridge was managed using our solutions as you can see the model the simulations, all relating documents at the construction stage were managed with our cloud solutions definitely usBIM.platform with regards to the data share environment part allowed to manage all the documents, access permissions, all the logs in terms of sharing and production of the works but let's also see how our solution which is unique in the world because it is also integrated with our platform for construction management PriMus Platform you can update the PIM or Project Information Model by integrating all documents produced on site directly from mobile phone or directly from the construction site and integrate them to obtain a real digital twin this brings me to the end of my presentation well, with this we've covered what is really inside BIM inside the CDE an aspect which is really peculiar thanks Giovanni for your help thank you everybody for your attention at this point let's completely change subject and let's move on to a great news for us this year we won a prestigious award actually for the second year running we won the building SMART international award this year in the technology leadership category with our project usIFC.server and that's exactly what now I want to talk to you and I would like here on stage Michelangelo, welcome Michelangelo, hello everyone michelangelo will later introduce himself I just want to add that he is one of the most experts in IFC worldwide and for this reason I want to address him some questions, starting with regards to the usIFC.server technology what exactly is this technology usIFC.server is a revolutionary technology which basically allows any device to read and edit an IFC file shared in the cloud it is a life-changing technology a bit like transition from photography to film projection that is no longer sharing static photo frames but a continuous flow of data that modifies the model from anywhere and with any tool and by anyone who edits it with any device well this seems something really exceptional that I believe you will explain in detail in your presentation shortly shall we also say a little with regards to what we are doing in terms of IFC? well we are currently deeply involved in the development of the Open BIM in general and in particular, we are actively participating in the development of new standards for linear infrastructures so, both IFC rail and IFC for infrastructures therefore, we are at the forefront with the open BIM and the IFC thanks Michelangelo, please go to your workstation in our Mind gymnasium from where Michelangelo will introduce this great innovation that is named usIFC.server Here we are Michelangelo Let's now explore our solution in detail usIFC.server usIFC.server revolutionizes the concept that we have of IFC files today transforming their use in the BIM process from static to dynamic, as we have already seen, IFC models are monolithic difficult to manage and update with usIFC.server it becomes not only possible but also fast and easy to keep them updated using any client software and/or device and without the need for proprietary formats practically, usIFC.server makes IFC files available simultaneously to multiple users who collaborate with each other and share the model completely in openBIM format with the ability to read and modify it dynamically with different software and any device, as we have seen from the buildingSMART technical roadmap the API are the way forwrad ed usIFC.server provides special APIs for connection in support of CDEs not only for downloading and uploading IFC files directly to the server but also for accessing all data and more importantly, usIFC.server is the real-time management of the single information of an IFC file, making available to any client of the special APIs for accessing, modifying inserting and deleting any entity or property of the IFC files uploaded to the server, as we can see on the right some examples of different ways of accessing the information whether it is via an integration with the BIM authoring, with the Internet of Things Virtual Reality and so on we will see some examples in detail integrations like this until now were practically impossible for an IFC file and when we say any client we really mean any client like the ones we have seen in the building SMART technical road map, such as smart cities connections to sensors, digital twins and other ecosystems of all kinds which require such APIs for seamless integration I hope everything was clear so far now let's see a video with some practical use cases of applications using usIFC.server with different clients editing of IFC of files with authoring software that become client of usIFC.server the example is made with Autodesk Revit [Music] this is a model made with Revit thatwe export to IFC and load on usIFC.server [Music] this is the IFC model uploaded to usIFC.server showed in the browser, thanks to a small plugin installed in Revit all changes made to the model are sent to usIFC.server [Music] here is the IFC model updated in the browser [Music] let's add more information to the modified objects [Music] let's now modify the geometry of some walls with Revit [Music] here are the changes in the IFC model with no file export [Music] the changes are carried out in real time and are seen by other users who are using the model in the browser [Music] IFC files visualization in virtual reality thanks to the data created by usIFC.server example made with usBIM.reality by ACCA software this is the IFC file edited with Revit viewed in virtual reality [Music] we can see the changes made with Revit and further information added on the CDE [Music] now we update the IFC model directly from virtual reality everything happens in real time [Music] download from usIFC.server the IFC file of the model modified with Revit and with virtual reality [Music] let's verify the correctness of the edited IFC file by opening it with others visualization software such as Solibri [Music] let's now we check it with the visualization software usBIM.viewer+ simultaneous viewing and editing of multiple IFC federated files thanks to the partial serialization of data possible with usIFC.server example with the usBIM.editor by ACCA there are 22 federated IFC models with 110,000 items of 3.2 gigabyte serialized by the server and viewed in the cloud with no problem [Music] let's see the federation of models with punctual works and linear infrastructures buildings, railways, roads and bridges still in the browser we can navigate the federation of IFC models in first person with perspective view [Music] now let's select only some parts of different models of the federation [Music] only the selected parts are serialized and brought to the editor for further elaborations, reported here in usBIM.editor only some parts of the entire federation of the 22 IFC files [Music] let's replace the old electric traction pole with a new model [Music] let's now move the antenna of the telecommunications on one of the buildings and remove some of the bridge protections let's add three new properties to this building object [Music] [Music] all IFC files of the federation have been updated in real time [Music] [Music] the use of clients as mobile devices and IoT to update in real time IFC files stored on usIFC.server facility management example with usBIM.facility by ACCA This is ACCA software headquarters [Music] this is the IFC model used for facility management [Music] [Music] let's see an example of asset tracking [Music] the maintenance worker is moving an object inside the building [Music] he records the operation with his mobile phone [Music] the IFC model has been updated in real-time [Music] ok at this point I would like to mention a few words by Guido Cianciulli, CEO of ACCA software that together with us strongly believes in the openBIM openBIM and IFC open your mind, our mission is to develop new technologies with the use of openBIM, with usIFC.server we have obtained unique results in the world never seen before, not even seen with the use of proprietary formats thank you everyone for your attention Thank you Michelangelo and this now brings us to the end of this presentation today I personally wanted to present you all these announcements because they are the innovations that will bring us to the future I remind you once again you can take advantage until the end of the convention of some great offers that we are promoting I repeat, I am really convinced that I have you showed some things there will drive us forwrad the digitization of the construction industry passes through our great innovation which is UsBIM thank you all for your attention I wish you many great things Goodbye [Music]
