 In this tutorial, we will show how to use the "Map Navigator" component. "Map Navigator" is an advanced component that shows a geographic map. To add a map we need a new screen. Go to "File - Edit Screens". Add new screen "Map", click "+" sign and close popup. From the screen, list choose "Map". Go to the "Indas" components menu and choose "Map Navigator". Set component size and position. You do not need to set any parameters to display the map. Click the "Save" button. Now we need to add navigation to our screen. From the screen list, choose "Top menu". Add a new button, set "Map" for name and for manage actions set "Switch (Map)". Click the "Save" button, go to the "Client page" and reload it. Click "Map" button. Our map is shown. We explain how to add map markers in "inVIEW - Configurator - Tag Tree" tutorial. If we click on markers, nothing happens. When we have created map objects, we did not assign a screen to map objects. Go to the Editor, then to "Configurator". Click "Tag Tree". Choose "Facility1", click "Hide map" button assign screen to map object and click "Update" button. Repeat this step for "Facility2" and "Facility3". Go to the "Client page" and reload it. Click on map markers. When we click on map markers, the chosen screen will be displayed.
