 IoT makes companies to find new ways  to monitor and manage devices, as well as analyzing data to generate business opportunities.  But How to do it? And how can we make sure  the data exchange is correct and secure? Here is Benchy! An extension application of sensor.live IoT platform for M2M encrypted IoT Data. Leveraging sensor.live is the first step.  It enables IoT devices to connect, and send the data to the Cloud safely and effectively. Add with Benchy, it allows users to encrypt  their data directly on sensor.live. The back-end technology of Benchy  is driven by BiiLabs Alfred API. The encrypted data will be  automatically transferred to IOT data marketplace, which has digitally signed timestamp  and become tamper-proofed. This enables industrial players to easily access blockchain technologies, with no barriers. Together with sensor.live, Benchy and Alfred,  the automatic data exchange will drive IoT M2M, further achieve in wide ranges of  vertical applications including energy, smart buildings, smart medical devices,  manufacturing, and more. From now on, you will be able to focus on  solving customers’ needs, and further maximize the business value.
