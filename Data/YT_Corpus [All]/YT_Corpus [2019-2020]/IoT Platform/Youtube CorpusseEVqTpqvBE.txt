 [Music] we're gonna talk today about building blocks around digital and IOT for manufacturing it's a topic that is super near and dear to our heart as Hitachi we are a manufacturer that's what we do it's in our core DNA we also have consulting companies and technology companies and healthcare companies and a bunch of other things but when it comes down to it at our core for a hundred and eight years since we were founded we've been doing manufacturing we have a hundred and forty five thousand manufacturing employees across almost 200 factories that exist in 21 different countries so when we talk about as we're going through this today we talk about the challenges that are facing manufacturers we talk about the challenges that are facing really all of us that work in the industrial space we're living it every day we're trying to modernize our own plants we're trying to modernize our own operations we're trying to connect our supply chains in different ways we have these same challenges that you guys the manufacturers in the room are facing so hopefully we can kind of power through it together in the conversation and have some good discussion so we are gonna do our very best to leave time at the end for questions so if you guys come up with questions there are microphones around the room I've been warned that my co-presenter the wonderful mr. Rob Lively he's gonna come up and talk technology for a bit goes a little bit long so it's possible we may not have time for questions but we're gonna do our best so I just realized read me I have not introduced myself my name is Ellen Dowd I'm a senior vice president with Hitachi I'm responsible for our digital solution portfolio for the social innovation business so you saw the video that talks about our story around social innovation but for all intents and purposes we believe that by changing business you change the world and that's essentially what we're talking about as we go through this so let's talk about this crazy world it is pretty insane right now there's only really one way to describe it which is massive change massive transformation we're all going through it it's everything from the fact that the world is shrinking we've got globalization pressures that are happening we have generational shifts we have all of these trends that are happening and what that's causing is a shift of power and a shift of sort of dominance in the business market so if you think about the Fortune 500 for the first I don't know eight decades of the fortune 500 existed that list was almost entirely static the same companies were on it year after year to the point where if a company fell off of the list it was news we talked about it over the course of the last 15 years 52 percent more than half of the fortune 500 has dropped off the list that is a staggering number and it's particularly scary to the manufacturers because for the majority of the 20th century that's who dominated that list yeah there were a few retailers some energy companies some financial services companies but for the most part it was the manufacturers that were dominating that list so we are seeing pressures as manufacturers as industrial companies coming from every direction that you can imagine how we respond to that is gonna dictate how we actually survive in this new economy so you can't talk about digital without the word disrupter coming reasonably close in the same sentence it follows pretty closely after digital but I'm gonna argue that what we talk about as disruptors aren't actually disruptors anymore we've moved well beyond the disruption phase we're now officially to the point where these are just the facts of our business this is how we exist how we survive how we're actually getting through working with the competition reaching our customers generational shifts are they're pervasive connectivity you're everything is connected our devices are connected we're doing computing at the edge we've got 5g that's coming out is gonna be widely adopted within the next three years connectivity is at a rate that we've never seen before and the maturing technologies are becoming mainstream I a machine learning blockchain these aren't new concepts anymore they're mainstream technologies so we need to start thinking about not so much about digital disruptors and more about digital and labor how are we enabling our business okay so here is the good news this is I think where the opportunity really is so if you look at the numbers so a couple things I'm a consultant I've been a consultant my entire life until the last few years and as a consultant I really like statistics so you guys are gonna have to bear with me just a little bit I'm gonna rattle a whole bunch off but there's a point here and they're actually pretty interesting so let's start with the fact that Gartner did a survey talked to 1,500 executives that were out there and asked them this question and before I give you the answer to how many of them said this I'm gonna again audience-participation bear with me I'm going to ask this group of people who in this room believes the digital is a critical competitive advantage or will be a critical competitive advantage for your company okay about the same so 81 percent of those participants responded that they believed this was a critical piece of their agenda it was gonna be a differentiator for them going forward second question bear with me guys come on you guys didn't seem really excited about the hand raising but I'm almost done I promise so second question how many of you think you're seeing the results that you should be seeing yet from digital initiatives really small number same thing happened there twenty four percent said they were seeing the results so how is it that everybody believes it's a priority the executives believe it's going to be a differentiator but nobody's seeing the results it's a really really interesting thing sorry guys it becomes more interesting when you think about the why my knee-jerk reaction when I hear that is oh well they're just not investing enough they're not putting enough money into these programs they need to spend more on digital then they'll see more results turns out that's not the answer either you look at what HBR is a Harvard Business Review has actually figured out if you look at digital leaders top 25% of adopters in digital laggards the bottom 25% of adopters they are spending almost the same exact amount of money on IT as a percentage of revenue it's almost exactly the same it goes from three point two percent to three point five percent that's the gap it's tiny it's almost negligible but if you look at the gap in terms of their business performance it's amazing eighty percent improvement on operating income eighty and fifty seven percent increase on profit line so those are huge results without a lot of incremental spend that's a huge opportunity sorry guys I'm a little parched I think I'm drinking water out of a milk carton is what it looks like so this begs the question and this is really the important thing how are they doing it right if they're able to not spend that much more money and yet achieve these fantastic results what are they doing differently than the rest of us what are they doing differently than their competitors so this is what I think we're gonna spend the rest of the time talking about setting the stage with statistics and what the industry is doing and all the pressures that we're having is interesting but I think we all are interested in understanding how do we achieve these results how do we approach these problems in different ways tackle them in different ways so that we can start seeing some of those massive benefits that are available to us if we do things a little bit differently so let's talk about what we think are the top four things that you should be thinking about doing differently you should be thinking about changing your mindset so the first thing is and it sounds really simple but it's actually probably the hardest part of all of this envision the actual business change that you're trying to accomplish what do you want to be when you grow up as a company what do you want to be in your industry how are you going to change the way that you're doing business so this could be anything from moving from being a product company to a services company changing the way you think about R&D maybe it's not product R&D anymore maybe you're looking at innovation how to build true innovation programs inside of your company how do you actually change the way that you're thinking about your business so that you can design technology to help you achieve that change okay so this is everybody's favorite slide I'm the only one that likes it but bear with me a little bit so I also have to apologize I have managed to develop something in my foot that might be plantar fasciitis so I may sit up and down a little bit throughout this if my foot starts killing me so bear with me a little bit here but we're gonna talk about it looks like most of the people in this room are IT professionals I've already asked that question how do you actually then respond to this right so I focused a lot on the business challenges what the business leaders need to be thinking about but as IT leaders we have an enormous role to play in all of this we have to modernize the way we think about IT the way we think about partnering with our business partners so everybody is very familiar with this concept on the Left anyone who's been an IT for any period of time understands the traditional flow of projects how do you run an IT project whether it's a waterfall project or an agile project just sort of immaterial in this conversation it still starts with a solution idea you have a project you get leadership approval to go do that project you probably do a proof-of-concept let's prove the technology make sure it works let's roll out of point solution even an IOT point solution that could reap real benefits once we put it into production you can get benefits this way you can get outcomes from those projects but what you can't get is transformation well you can't get is real business change so you've got to think about how to widen the aperture let more ideas through the process get more connected programs and projects rolling forget leadership approval get stakeholder consensus understand all the people that touch your process whether it's your suppliers and your customers and your manufacturers and the people working on the shop floor get them involved in designing what this new business model looks like and what the technology looks like and do proofs of value we don't need to prove the technology anybody's doing pocs at this point to prove the technology is missing the point technology works I promise what we need to see is does it actually solve the business problem that you're trying to solve and you can't find that out in the lab and you can't find that out with just doing a data model you have to put it in production in a pilot environment do it quickly see your results get them back and then you're able to have this truly connected value chain where you're understanding that as a manufacturer the decisions that I'm making on the customer experience side are influencing everything all the way back to my supply chain and all of that has to have a digital thread all of that has to have digital connectivity that brings all of that together so we need to be thinking about how to modernize IT and then finally actually not finally sorry I have two more my third point there's really nothing that consultants like more than numbers except roadmaps we really really really like roadmaps so talking a little bit about what a road map looks like for IOT for digital and IOT it is a little bit different there are different principles behind it but it's the same general concept how you prioritize and how you sequence your initiatives probably has a greater impact on your success or failure than almost anything else and the reason is what you're going to look to do is manage these projects almost like a stock portfolio you're looking to get individual returns but it's actually more important that you get the total return so if you're looking at five different points solutions at different places within your factory one is an asset management solution that sits on one of your cutting machines if you're a metals manufacturer another one is automation that helps you make sure that you've got better quality you've got video analytics to measure work or safety those are great individual use cases when you connect those together and sequence them in the right way you're actually incrementally learning from the data that you're getting from the first and you're taking those returns that you're getting those cost savings you're getting and you're reinvesting it in the transformation so how you sequence these roadmaps is absolutely critical because the goal is not to get projects done the goal is to realize value to get to the point where you've got top-line growth all those things at the top where we talk about new channels new markets new business models new ways of getting money in the door and all those things at the bottom increased operational effectiveness reduce costs all of those bottom line savings so if you focus on the value realization and sequence and prioritize in the right way you will see the value coming out of these programs and then finally you gotta have an ecosystem ecosystems are not new this is a you know age-old concept we all exist in an ecosystem but there are in my opinion some differences some new things about a digital ecosystem so I'm going to use the example of Hitachi and Google we are two huge companies Hitachi is number 71 on the global 2000 list Google alphabet is number 65 right these are massive companies their top 100 biggest companies in the world and you know we're used to controlling our own destiny this is what we've done for the bulk of our career especially on the tachi side as a manufacturer traditional business what we're seeing is we can't be the center of our own universe anymore we can't expect all of our partners and all of our customers to orbit around us instead we've got to put the customers at the center this is not new but it is critically more important than ever before customer centricity is core to digital pettier customers at the middle of that ecosystem enable that ecosystem with technology whether it's analytics or cloud or IT IOT all of these components and figure out how you then connect your entire ecosystem together it's no longer just supplier partner customer company that used to be the ecosystem now it is how do you interact with your governments with your communities with all of the world around you because all of that is required to make yourself successful in digital so we're really excited about our partnership with Google but we also know and I'm sure my Google colleagues would agree with me even our two huge companies can't do this alone we have to have other partners in the mix other building blocks all these things come together to build these digital solutions that help drive transformation so with that I am gonna turn it over to the guy who's smarter than I am who's gonna talk about the technical building blocks how you bring these things together unfortunately you're not done with me yet I'll be coming back up on the stage when Rob is done if he ever finishes we'll see how that goes when Rob is done and we're gonna talk about case studies real-world examples of stuff do you guys actually care about what other companies are doing in this space so I'll be back well talking about thanks guys [Applause] hello everyone how are we doing this afternoon okay I'm done so I'm really excited to talk to you guys about how we use building blocks and solutions within IOT an industrial IOT in particular to solve business problems for our clients now something I think is important to differentiate as we start this is consumer IOT versus industrial IOT they do something very important in common and that is where we are trying to acquire data bring it someplace that we can do something interesting with it however an industrial IOT we see divergences in criteria that we need to satisfy that don't exist within consumer out a consumer IOT would be best represented by something like the nest thermostat that's on your wall it's sending essentially the same data up to the cloud all the time from every one of those nest thermostats and it's using the same kind of protocols and it's doing this directly there is nothing that mediates it it's directly connected to the Internet and sharing information on a cloud an industrial Internet if we look at security as an example we don't connect these devices directly to the Internet even if they could would be unwise because there's not a lot of security on that existing operational technology infrastructure so we mediate it by putting gateways in them in the middle and in that case the security requirement becomes elevated where we had secured in the consumer side in the industrial side we need Hardware roots of trust so that these devices can attest to the security of their operating system and the firmware on the scalability side on consumer IOT maybe to talk about millions of devices connected up and sending information all these nest thermostats on the industrial side we have to talk to thousands of devices and thousands of different types of devices so we need to be able to mediate that conversation and have all sorts of gateways that are doing different things at different times with different purposes so in order to manage that we need to be able to do things that allow for a variety of connectivity types and a variety of different devices that we need to talk to because we'll talk to sensors that may provide temperature information using analog signals or will talk to you SCADA systems that have their proprietary protocols or energy sub meters that speak Modbus but a particular dialect so we need to adapt to that but there are also other things that come up where they aren't a part of consumer IOT we need to manage performance so you have to be worried about latency versus throughput in the data that comes through I need to worry about do I need guaranteed data delivery or I'm okay with lost tolerance and it's based on use cases so those kind of capabilities don't necessarily arise when we're talking about consumer IOT applications but fundamentally the most important thing is at the bottom it's solution enable man with industrial IOT we're trying to go and solve problems for our customers so the industrial IOT application needs to support the development of flexible solutions and modular deployment so that we can go and build something interesting on top of it so the challenge here though is Ellen talked about an ecosystem of contributors partners and we all live in this ecosystem and need services and components from the different partners that play in this but the ecosystem also needs to support the easy participation of different vendors in this environment because plants and manufacturing environments are not greenfield when we go to deploy IOT we have certainly core IOT services that are new are providing certain fundamental capabilities to enable us to bring on new devices on the edge and in the fog but we also find that IOT touches a wide range of the enterprise architecture that provides some of these fundamental capabilities you are talking about on the prior slide all that functional requirement become building block capabilities that need to exist in order for us to deploy solutions so if I'm looking at this I can say sure there's already security in place mechanisms to provide secure connectivity of devices onto the network IOT needs this but when we go to a deployment we need to see what already exists there and if we need to amplify or enhance that capability or if we need to stand it up because it doesn't exist so we need building blocks that can do those different kinds of capabilities for us and on the data side maybe the client already has existing streaming infrastructure we need to integrate with that we need to get it to provide a common interface that we are expecting it to provide so that we can surface data up and do something interesting with it this is where a strategic partner like Google comes into play Google provides building blocks that align to each of these functional capabilities are important for industrial IOT and what's more they provide a variety of building blocks in these different areas so that as the need arises I can find the right tool set the right building block to put in place that enhances the existing infrastructure that already exists in that environment or I can stand up a full-fledged environment full-fledged capability when that capability doesn't exist where go to deploy and Google also is consistently innovating and creating new solutions so they're building new capabilities new solution building blocks that I can leverage and do think about new kinds of creativity new kinds of solutions that didn't exist before so this modular approach using building blocks allows us to reduce the time it takes to get to business value so there was a great presentation by gentleman Sam codes at box where you set a platform and strap abstracts away a messy problem so you can build on top of it and that's what the building blocks are doing they're creating a consistent set of functionality in a consistent way that data is provided and made available through the infrastructure so that we can focus on building the solutions that take advantage of that again Google is innovating and providing tools such as anthos that they discussed the other day in their thomas korean talked about anthos being a single platform where you need it because we want to reduce risk and we want to reduce the strain on the solution developers so they can develop against a common platform and this is reducing our friction to implementation so when we talk about solutions though we start talking about recipes and recipes have ingredients in the solution the specific code that runs on these building blocks is an ingredient the way we configure those building blocks is an ingredient and these ingredients are technically decoupled from those specific building blocking limitations and are reusable the building blocks if we went with the recipe metaphor are things like your oven your stove your pots and pans the things that help you to accomplish what you need to to make the recipe work so let's take a very specific example to make this a little more concrete so if we're doing predictive maintenance on weld robots in the main in a automotive manufacturing environment I need to be able to handle a couple of different things that need to deploy across this entire infrastructure that allows me to go do predictive maintenance so what does that look like first ingredient I need the right data so I can define what data points need to be except hold out of the environment and that becomes one of the ingredients my recipe that helps me to find what sensors I need what kind of capabilities need to be deployed within that gateway device then I can start talking about the modules that might need to exist in that gateway they can talk to all of these components that are providing me data and what modules that might need to be there to transform the data I can talk about the AI machine learning ingredient that needs to sit up in the cloud that helps me to convert all of this data along with data from the maintenance systems into a predictive maintenance model that I can then use to evaluate whether or not something's about to go wrong with that particular machine so all of these ingredients then can be specified within our solution recipe and that's how we take advantage of that building block infrastructure so you're layering these things and abstracting the baseline infrastructure that exists in sensors and equipment the building blocks that take advantage of acquiring that data and moving it around and then the solutions that sit on top of that and expect a common platform and a common set of behaviors so that we can take predictive maintenance solution that we've already solved and move it somewhere else even if the infrastructure is different and the set of components and building blocks that we deploy there are different so I'm going to dive one section deeper and look at what this would look like on the edge and give specific examples so on the edge the building blocks are things like a common runtime environment using containers being able to use a common message bus that allows different containers and modules are running on the edge with one another in a consistent uniform specified fashion it's the way we connect back up to our control planes we can specify how these edge devices are managed through edge lifecycle management capabilities what's the recipe the recipe is the way I configure one of these connector modules to talk to the device it needs to speak to so I have a connector module that's talking to that temperature sensor so it needs to know how to read analog signals off of an rs-485 port convert that into data that I can use or it's a Modbus module that speaks to a sub-meter and I send parameters to that modulus module that say these are the registers you read and that's what represents voltage or current so the ingredient is the configuration of this module another ingredient would be if I have that model I developed that says when this device about fail I run that in this analytic module in the middle and that's converting these data points into real information that's useful on the floor in the factory and can be connected up to other systems like their maintenance system or an inline system to notify them of problems so this brings me back to Alan's slide and this is important because if you take a look at that first piece it says we're going to tackle bite-sized chunks if you modular eyes this proach you can identify what components you need within your infrastructure to enable you to go solve that particular business problem and those are the chunks you bite off in your solution recipe you have the ingredients you know the code you know the configurations that need to be there that solve that particular business problem but that's all you're chewing at that point time so you're associating development costs and infrastructure costs directly with the business value that you're creating it also helps you to identify the value of some of the bigger pieces within the infrastructure all of these investments in data warehousing those are big things that costs a lot of money and take a lot of time to setup so being able to say that I have a whole portfolio of different use cases I'm going to go support and being able to associate that back to that investment in the data warehouse helps you to justify that as a larger scale deployment and finally we're focusing on the business need this is all focused on the solutions this is all focused on the things that we're trying to generate in terms of value for our clients and not on the specific technology that's underneath it on one of the previous slides I said industrial IOT is the operating system for solutions if I'm running and working in Excel I don't necessarily care if it's running on a Mac or if it's running on Windows machine its Excel that I'm interested in it'll work that I'm able to do inside of it industrial IOT infrastructure needs to provide the right level of capabilities and then disappear into the background so that we can allow solutions to go give the benefit to the client that they need so this is how we deliver our solutions in IOT using building blocks and solutions so I'm gonna invite Ellen back up on the stage and we're going to talk about some case studies and show you where we've done this type of engagement in the IOT era digital disruption and born-digital competitors transcend business and society catalysts of unrelenting change Hitachi and Google cloud have joined forces to accelerate your digital transformation journey proven innovative solutions business outcomes at scale on a secure platform game-changing business strategies with agility to ignite growth success starts with collaborative creation and commitment to a data first culture made lob stocks mission is to drive productivity profitability and sustainability for the red meat industry across Australia Hitachi solves business challenges with digital IOT solutions built on Google Cloud through this strategic global alliance organizations are taking businesses to the next level with data insights to drive decision makers the k2 data now is all about objectivity and M Li invests in sensors technologies that allows us to collect more and more information the value that we've got from working with Natasha she's been incredible we managed not only on-farm data but how we make best use of it every transaction that that animal goes through we need to be able to map and track we're now setting up weather stations where we can measure not only the rain we're measuring the temperature the wind we are now starting to measure the soil temperature so when you understand when the best growth is for us it's very important that we get all that livestock data and together to be able to make good decisions on where we're heading together Hitachi and Google cloud are helping meat and livestock Australia to navigate this IOT journey real-time data is collected from disparate sensors systems and aerial imagery and a massive data repository synthesized and hosted on Google cloud drives accelerated decision-making operational efficiency a dashboard view provides transparency across the supply chain to improve decision-making Google Cloud compute and storage capabilities deliver reliability and scalability the future is pretty exciting the technology we're saying today is only the start of it yeah we're gonna see a lot bigger and better ideas coming forward in the next few years [Music] all right so we're gonna talk about this for just a couple of minutes and then move on to a few more case studies I know this isn't technically manufacturing you could make the argument that we're manufacturing meat but I don't like to think of it that way I'm a vegetarian so instead we're just gonna look at this from a pure social innovation story I love this case study specifically because it brings that concept of why you need an ecosystem to life so meat and livestock Australia is a public-private partnership with the meat producing companies in Australia and the farmers who are actually responsible for taking care of these cows so it is bringing together their own ecosystem with our ecosystem so you know Hitachi came in and did the systems integration provided some of the sensors some of them we got third-party we had to partner with another company to create the drones to be able to go out and take aerial photos of the cattle and the livestock we were able to bring together that with the power of Google to create a really compelling solution that required about 17 different entities from the customer side as well as the service provider side to be successful so it's a really great story that has been able to show true improvement for this industry in Australia so I really like I really like telling this story yeah Romania factually very healthy live animals yes that's right may in fact I tried it when I watched that video I try to imagine that we're just taking the cows to a different pasture so that's that's where my head goes all right so and I'm gonna let Rob talk about this one in detail but I will say one of the things that I think is super interesting about this customer and Rob's gonna go into some of the details around what we're actually doing for them but they're a global 1000 automotive manufacturing company that knows auto manufacturing is probably not their future they look to the future and they know that they need to be a mobility company they need to be thinking about how are we going to move people around how are people going to go from point A to point B it may not be in a car that they own in the future so how do we build towards that but they also know that as volumes go down as fewer people are buying cars as they're producing fewer cars they also have to optimize their manufacturing operations in the mean time to be able to squeeze as much operating efficiency as they possibly can in order to be able to stay competitive in the market so when we first went to work with this particular manufacturer they had identified 11 different use cases that they wanted to tackle within their industrial IOT infrastructure the challenge was that they ranged from predictive maintenance and predictive quality all the way through to energy management and worker safety and as we dissected the requirements of these different use cases what we identified is that these were asking very different kinds of functionality to exist within that industrial IOT infrastructure in some places we needed to process video imaging real-time right at the edge in other times we needed to be able to do very low latency transfer of information all the way from the manufacturing floor through to the cloud combine it with other data and send responses back so that they can make decisions in real-time or near real-time about the way in which they operated the plant so these building blocks became really critical to be able to say this is how we're going to go and put components in place that support this and then the modularity of the solutions allowed us to define what kind of ingredients you know code and and configuration needed to exist at different points within that infrastructure and so we were able to take the same fundamental platform and ask it to do very very different things and still get the same responsiveness and kroll control out of it that we need all right and again I'm gonna let Rob talk about some of the details here but this customer I think is particularly interesting because there is probably nothing more old-school traditional when it comes to manufacturing as steel manufacturing steel manufacturing is one of the first literally one of the first manufacturing operations that ever existed anywhere in the world and it hasn't really modernized all that much over that time so we're working with the u.s. steel manufacturer who who is looking at solving not they're actually not envisioning this grand new world of the future they have massive operational challenges that they need to address and they believe that by looking at IOT by looking at better usage of their data they can drive real results so they had any number of problems around and experienced unplanned downtime of their part of their manufacturing line a bunch of stuff was done manually and therefore not optimized they had mislabeled products coming off the line they had any number of challenges there so we went in and helped them again prioritize those use cases and decide what to go after and the challenge here again was that when we looked at these use cases the problems that they were finding that it required a vast array of different kinds of sensors and different kind of capabilities that we literally developed with partners that didn't exist before so we were able to for example one of the one of the instances was looking at the tension on a steel line and whether or not there was potential of that steel line could break so he actually worked with the sensor manufacturers to design something specifically for that use case and then it starts fitting off some of this interesting data we needed to be able to easily rapidly deploy connectivity components out there that would take advantage of that new information standardize it bring it into the infrastructure so that we could do something with it and solve the business case the other thing was that in one particular instance the client felt as though they understood what the problem was with a particular aspect of cutting some steel and as we started to put things in place to observe what was going on we identified that that actually wasn't the case it was something else about that process that was causing the quality issues and we were able to quickly throw in an additional sensor additional piece of information plug it into the same infrastructure stream that data up and immediately convert from solving one aspect of that problem to a different aspect to that problem so once again those components and the the approach of modularity helps us to respond adapt and adapt very quickly and deliver business value for the client [Music]
