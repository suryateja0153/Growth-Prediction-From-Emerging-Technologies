 hello everyone and welcome to ignite my name is sam george i'm here today to talk about our iot services our vision and roadmap and to talk about an important generational shift that's happening from connected assets to connected environments first thing that i want to do is start with an understanding of iot's role in the worldwide response to cobit 19. you know when coven 19 hit one of the first things that we did was reached out to our partners who provide all of the vertical specializations on top of azure iot for a response and with all of the companies that you see at the bottom of the slide we've been able to put together solutions that help reduce reduce the risk of exposure to protect employees to be able to limit contact for lower transmission rates and ultimately to create safer workspaces for everyone at some of the links that you see here you have you can see all of the different rapid response iot solutions that we've put together if you're interested in participating in providing one of these solutions you can reach out to the email address you see below and then what we're going to be talking about as well is all of the different trainings and special specializations that we provide for certification to help customers and partners get trained understand how to use all these technologies that we build and then ultimately provide these solutions so to highlight this i wanted to go deeper into a particularly noteworthy uh covet 19 protection solution and that's in close partnership with rxr realty a solution that they call rxwell and rxwell is um something that protects the entire environment as well as the employees that are in it um let's take a look at that and hear from the ceo in his own words i love new york i love new york to a fault my name is scott reckler i'm ceo and chairman of rxr realty from our formation in 2007 we became one of the largest owners of office properties in the new york metro region and we were on that path to re-imagine the future of their workplace and coveted to bring people back to work rejuvenates and reactivates our city streets and our small businesses and the energy that makes new york great in talking through things with the microsoft team we develop what we call rxwell converting all of our doors to touchless doors as you walk in having thermoscanners we were already down the road using azure ai iot and edge as we began to shift to the rxwell solution we were able to just accelerate some of that and think through what were the other use cases for us engaging with the microsoft team was very natural because we had an alignment of vision the microsoft resource team was way ahead of the curve when it came to iot they ensured that we designed arcs well in a manner that was scalable args well now has been rolled out in our headquarters building we feel good being back at work so now we're in the process to roll this out to some of our peers in new york and other parts of the northeast so rxwell is really an end-to-end solution that covers uh that actually spans both the cloud and the edge and protects employees it helps employees attest to their their health it ensures a safe working environment as employees are in an environment and it really provides a level of safety that's really unprecedented in these times one of the things that we love the most about the rxwell example is that it very much aligns with our vision you know several years ago we started talking about how our mission is to provide solutions and capabilities across the intelligent cloud and the intelligent edge and we think that this is really the new compute paradigm you know it's not just about the cloud anymore it's not just about the edge it's about both working in concert and to work in concert it requires the technologies that you saw in rxwell such as iot and ai and edge computing and increasingly things like 5g and digital twins now if you step back and look at what's happening in the industry you're seeing a generational shift that's happening from what we call connected assets to connected environments and ultimately connected ecosystems what we mean by that is that early iot solutions were really concerned about the asset right you wanted to know whether the hvac unit was going to fail or whether the elevator was making reliable trips or needed servicing and increasingly like you just saw with rxwell you're not just concerned about the assets in a building you're concerned about the entire environment the people in it um everything that's happening in it and then over time what we see is this move towards connected ecosystems where once you have connected environments you're starting to see companies form partnerships over insights in their own unique connected environment so the first thing we want to do is turn to connected assets because that's very much where customers are engaged today over the last five years we put together the world's leading innovative portfolio of products and services in iot and it covers everything from our iot and edge device support from the tiniest of devices running in kilobytes of memory up to the largest multiblade server stacks running full azure services on premises we have a broad set of services for iot that you see here that help customers and partners put together solutions that span the intelligent cloud and the intelligent edge and then we also have solutions and solution accelerators that help customers and partners get to market quickly and produce these now importantly at the very top you see all the different priority verticals that we focus on and for each of those verticals we have a set of really industry-leading partners that provide all the vertical specializations that are required for all of these services in each different industry you know iot is going to touch virtually every business and every industry on the planet and that really requires a rich partner ecosystem and then over on the left you see azure defender for iot which is our rebranded name for azure security center for iot and the idea with azure defender for iot is that it protects everything both in the cloud and out on the edge and keeps you safe over the years thousands of customers have already gone into production with azure iot all of them that you see here plus many many more importantly what we've done is we've built up an incredibly deep ecosystem of partners all the way from system and system integrators and advisors to solution providers connectivity providers that you see here solution aggregators partnerships out in the device and developer ecosystem and many many more this ecosystem is really incredibly important because as i mentioned iot is going to touch every business in every industry and in microsoft's opinion that is not a winner take all market that is a market that requires these deep ecosystems and partnerships now today at ignite in addition to showing off some of the new customer scenarios that are using all of this what i'm going to be talking about is a set of product announcements and all of them that you see here so let's go ahead and get to those first is we continue to refine and expand our developer certifications and training over on the left you see our developer specialty and what that is is as develop as customers and partners get certified or learn about all of our different offerings and want to get certified and attest to their expertise they can take this uh certification process over on the right you see microsoft learn now for every single service that we build for every capability that we build there's microsoft learn content and all of that content is freely available so you can go up to the link that you see here and go and check out anything that you're curious about and learning more about what we do and then again as you gain expertise and you want to attest to your expertise you can take that developer certification i wanted to start the product announcements at the iot and iot edge device level first thing is that we're thrilled to announce azure sphere and att partnership on a guardian module now what a guardian module is is it's a pattern hardware pattern where you plug a secure device into a fundamentally insecure one and it provides a layer of isolation now typically azure sphere has only been able to work over wi-fi but with this new att partnership will be able to work over cellular as well so we're really thrilled to announce that it enables you to seamlessly connect devices really from anywhere and it provides azure spheres industry-leading rich end-to-end security offering it helps you protect the device to constantly monitoring it to provide updates and of course now that works over cellular so we're thrilled to see that on the tiniest of tiny devices you have sometimes only kilobytes of memory to run and that's why we developed azure rtos azure rtos is compact it runs in as little as 50 kilobytes of memory it enables incredibly fast time to market and it harnesses the full power of azure you can connect directly to our iot services from it and the best part is it's all available up on github and we're going to be showing that off in just a second there's partnerships with all of the companies that you see below including the world's leading semiconductors so we're thrilled with those partnerships azure rtas is already generally available and what we're announcing today is an adaptation layer for free rtos so if you have a free rtos application and you want to take advantage of microsoft's industry-leading rtos you can actually just take that same pre-rtos application and you can run it directly on azure rtos makes it super easy to migrate and it actually makes it faster when you run on on on azure rtos which is great this will be available up on github this month now with azure sphere and azure rtos they actually work better together so azure sphere devices are actually pretty sophisticated devices that runs not just the azure sphere operating system which is a linux microkernel but actually has chips on it that run the arm cortex m's that actually run any rtos and we've made azure rtos work first class on azure sphere so both of these work better together turning to iot edge now what iot edges if you're unfamiliar is it's our edge compute platform for iot devices and it enables you to run cloud services or your own services that are containerized and to push those directly to run on the device and once they're on the device it can run entirely offline and disconnected one of the things that we've been busy working on based on customer feedback is iot edge support for industrial environments now many times in industrial environments you have to adhere to strict network isolation requirements oftentimes the network is actually tiered or sliced uh and there's certification standards like iso 95 that quantify this and so i'm thrilled to announce support for azure iot edge support for these industrial networking environments and we do that by supporting nested iot edge devices and so you can see over on the lower right hand corner you can see the different network slices and you can actually arrange in a hierarchical fashion azure iot edge devices we're also thrilled to announce security enclave support so if you're running very sensitive workloads that have very high value intellectual property require strict privacy and so on you can create a workload that's fully encrypted in transit and in deployment to the device and then runs in a secure enclave or protection of that combined these two features really make azure iot edge the most robust production ready and industrial grade iot edge platform on the planet and once you're managing fleets of devices you need rich monitoring support across your fleets and across individual devices so we're thrilled to announce it's available now our new monitoring support where we output a prometheus format from iot edge that can be used with azure monitor as well as any other monitoring framework that supports prometheus which is widely deployed and then coming soon we have azure monitor integration and you'll see all of that working first class right in the azure monitoring portal all right so from turning now from the tiniest of devices up to the cloud we start to talk about some of the announcements that we've got on our services so i'm super super thrilled to announce iot hub support in azure stack hub it's going to be available in public preview in october and what this does is this enables iot hub which is already broadly available all over the world in the cloud to run on-premises in isolation it's the only offering like this from a hyperscale cloud provider and enables you to run entirely offline and disconnected and it still works with those iot edge devices across that network tiering that i just talked about on premises as well we've also added support to our iot hub device provisioning service for private link or vnet support we already made iot hub available in vnets but now the device provisioning service services available there as well and what this really enables is another industry leaning level of security or the only hyperscale cloud provider to to enable this and so your iot hub and your device provisioning service run in isolation right in the cloud in a v-net that's supplied by a customer or partner and then you tunnel into it from a v-net on-premises or through express route so azure defender for iot now i talked about this earlier when we were looking at our connected assets slide azure defender for iot is a rebranded name for azure security center for iot but we've also added and that's already generally available but we've also added a whole bunch of new capabilities from our recent acquisition of cyberx so all of that is available in public preview now and what that is is azure defender for iot previously had to run software on a device in order to monitor it but now with the cyberx capabilities we can actually discover and manage uh unmanaged or end and discover and monitor unmanaged devices so devices with no software agent running on them simply by doing deep packet inspection across the network now azure defender for iot also plugs into azure sentinel and azure sentinel gives you left to right visibility across your entire data state so as you can see in addition to those iot edge devices or iot devices being monitored by azure defender you can now monitor all of the different unmanaged devices and as i mentioned the best part about it is you can simply put a device on your network and it will discover all of those unmanaged devices and it's got a rich set of ml based behavioral analytics that will tell you whether one of those devices is behaving in an anomalous fashion this really helps you do asset discovery risk vulnerability management and what it does is it also helps unify the it and ot teams to provide a comprehensive view to make sure that those devices and assets are functioning properly but that they're also secured now turning to iot plug and play iot plug and play is something we announced late last year and what iot plug and play is is it breaks down the barriers between devices and solutions in particular it means that advice can self-describe it can say all of its capabilities in a json ld schema format using something we call the digital twins definition language as itself describes that when that connects to solutions in the cloud those solutions can then automatically adapt to those devices and what this means is it means that any device that's plug and play enabled can work with any solution that understands plug-and-play so we're thrilled to announce that iot plug-and-play in the platform is now generally available as well as in our sdks and that includes everything that you see here including our device catalog support support for solution builders as well as device builders and our certification so our certification is now ready and we're doing final certification uh and inserting those certified devices into our device catalog once you've certified an iot plug-and-play device not only does it work with solutions like azure iot central that support plug-and-play but it also works with all of our other offerings including azure digital twins time series insights and all the partner solutions that support that as well now iot plug and play is not a it's really about an ecosystem and here's some of the different providers and what they have to say about building that plug and play ecosystem now so far we've talked about things like azure rtos uh and iot plug and play but i want to show you when you start combining these two and then you start adding support for um what i'm about to show you in github code spaces as well as vs code you can go from what used to be days to set up or an entire day to set up a working embedded environment to just minutes so let's go ahead and check out how that works so here you see the github site for azure rtos and again you can just go and browse at your self what you see here is open with code spaces so what that does is that creates a containerized workspace that's running in the cloud that has a full working environment as well as vs code as well as all of the dependencies that are required to build azure rtos and here i have the digital twin definition language for my embedded azure rtos device uh i have i'm sending temperature and humidity uh the temperature is being set in celsius and that dtdl then is used to describe the device in the azure rtos code for this sample then what i do is simply fill in my iot hub connection strings and the device provisioning service scope and i can build it now i'm building it entirely in the cloud and it only took me about five minutes to provision this working environment in the cloud and i just fully built now what's super cool about this is that i can run a little bit of software on my computer locally and i can connect to a local device and so i can actually debug and step through code in the cloud and it's running right on my device i've flashed that device from the build output in the cloud right down to the device now what's cool about this in vs code you have access not only to azure rtos but all of the iot hub connections so i can see the device up in iot hub i can actually send commands from iot hub back down to my device using some of the new plug-and-play uh plug-and-play apis and the device actually responds to that and so here you see a few examples of the light or the heat sensor from our temperature sensor from the device uh changing in response super super cool um so this is a level of productivity that's simply unparalleled it's we've really never had it before it's a first in the industry really thrilled to talk about that turning our attention to uh to iot central so iot central is our iot app platform that takes all of those azure services that you've seen so far and combines them and harnesses them in a low code no code iot app platform so that anyone can get started with iot and go to production immediately so we're thrilled to announce we're now doing monthly updates of iot central and more importantly documenting all of those monthly updates so all of the capabilities that you you're about to see are now part of those monthly updates we've updated our continuous data export feature so that you can now filter what data is being sent from iot central to downstream data services you can also add message enrichment so you can add extent additional metadata as that as that device data is sent to downstream azure services we have rich support for jobs at scale which is the way you manage all of your devices and so we have property update jobs and filters you can rerun failed jobs you get live updates of how your job is going you get batching support and all of this is already available we're also thrilled to include live data and telemetry from your devices and so now when you connect a device to iot central you can see the raw data that's coming across and you can interact with that in iot central as well as through the azure command line interface you can also upload data like telemetry from your devices and so you can configure devices to do that right from within iot central and then it it'll upload those directly into blob and file storage and we're thrilled to announce a new template that's available now in iot central for object motion detection with live video analytics so you can take azure live video analytics and harness that on your iot edge devices and manage that all from within iot central coming soon we have full support for iot plug and play and then later in december we're going to be introducing a one dollar per year per device pricing model and so this is great for really low volume low data devices and that'll be coming soon we're really thrilled about that one it's great to see the amazing pickup that we've seen with iot central we're seeing companies like sensoria who developed sensoria health which uses iot central as well as the iot hub fire connector for azure and what they have is they have a sensorium mat which helps them and their practitioners reduce the risk of als pressure ulcers for wheelchair users so iot central and a local device is being used to monitor that and then operators and nurse practitioners can monitor that right on right from the cloud so it's really amazing use case to see it's great to see all of the new medical devices that are being produced and connected to cloud-based solutions and importantly that are being done with our fire support as well as all of our hipaa certification for all of our azure services now turning our attention to connected environments so far we've been talking a lot about connected assets but what we're seeing like we saw in the very beginning of the talk is this movement towards connected environments now connected environments aren't just about real estate like we saw in rxwell but it's also things like manufacturing where you're starting to track not only the manufacturing assets in the factory but the inbound supply chain the outbound distribution networks you're starting to track energy right the energy distribution grid and the inputs to energy you're starting to track healthcare and agriculture and these types of rich environments that are not just about assets but are about everything that is going on in an entire environment now we've built azure digital twins as the service in azure that really fuses and marries the physical world and the digital world in the physical world you can take input sensors from things like iot central or iot hub as well as third-party offerings feed that into azure digital twins and marry that with signals from the digital world both from azure and things like powerapps and dynamics and teams and office as well as all of the different third-party offerings out there and we're thrilled to announce that azure digital twins will be generally available uh next month in october and azure digital twins is really an industry first it has an open modeling language that's based on a json ld schema that we call the digital twin definition language or dtdl that enables you this rich flexibility so you can describe not just devices but people places things and importantly relationships now dtdl is all open source and it's up on github at the link that you see below and once you model an environment you send that model to digital twins and we manifest a live execution environment you hook in all the different signals like from iot hub or iot central the digital twins and it keeps that model up to date and then as that model winds up changing you can send changes to downstream services so with azure digital twins then you can model anything you can track the present uh track the history of that and then use that to predict the future so let's look at a few ways that customers are taking advantage of that so ge ge aviation is using azure digital twins to combine data from two disparate systems creating a living replica of an aircraft now one system keeps track of the performance of an aircraft when it's in the air and the other system keeps track of everything that happens to an aircraft once it's on the ground so currently that's reconciled using a manual process but with this new system in place using azure digital twins ge aviation will have a living digital replica of that entire life cycle of the aircraft that's really useful to help track the performance of the airplane to increase efficiency and ultimately decrease the cost of maintaining that airplane johnson controls has developed a platform called open blue that makes it easy for builders and building management to create in to create and retrofit energy efficient buildings so they use azure digital twins to model every aspect of a building rooms walls pipes vents filters uh light fixtures everything and then with that living model they're able to then track what's going on track the history predict the future and ultimately reduce the amount of energy that a building is using now there's multiple layers in our opinion of digital twins now we provide with azure digital twins the base hyperscale layer of a platform that then our partners can extend on top of a great example of this is actually ansys ansys is the world's leader in simulation software and their software is used by engineers to build and validate complex products and processes ansys has been one of microsoft's strategic partners for some time and they're building on top of azure digital twins to provide simulation services so with azure digital twins ansys can take their twins builder solution to a whole new level so let's take a look at how that what that looks like so in this demo we built azure digital twins that showing real-time monitoring of a mixing process typically found in heavy industries by combining the iot sensor data with physics-based simulations you can actually get better real-time insights into what's happening and ultimately better product quality ansys digital or ansys twin builder is also integrated with power bi so what you see here is a power bi dashboard that can help operators identify when a product doesn't match a recipe and then address that issue in real time saving the entire product match throughout the process the operator can also virtually monitor the mixer and ensure that liquids are mixed properly this is what the architecture looks like you see azure digital twins there in the middle and it's been a great partnership with ansys and microsoft on bringing this to market and i'm thrilled to announce that this ansys twin builder with full support for digital twins and dtdl will be available in january 2021 the link that you see here now finally the digital twins consortium we are very very adamant and believe very deeply in an open ecosystem of digital twins so we are partnering uh with the digital twins consortium as a founder along with all of the groundbreakers that you see here to bring digital twins uh the the definition language of it as well as all of the different vertical specializations of digital twins for different industries uh in an open ecosystem and bringing that to life so there's over 140 companies that have joined this digital twins consortium and for companies that are interested we encourage you to check this out last here's how you can stay in touch there's some links for you for microsoft learn as well as our iot announcements everything that i just covered in our blog post all of the developer resources that you see here as well as some upcoming deep dives thank you so much and you can stay in touch at the link that you see here we hope you have a great ignite and thanks for tuning in
