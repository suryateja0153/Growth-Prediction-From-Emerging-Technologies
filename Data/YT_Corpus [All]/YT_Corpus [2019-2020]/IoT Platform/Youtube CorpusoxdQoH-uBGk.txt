 (cheerful music) - [Narrator] Just how smart is your building? The definition of a smart building is rapidly evolving. As our world's population continues to grow and become more digitally focused, we must reexamine the way we interact with buildings. Today's buildings must run efficiently. They must be safe and reliable. And now, to truly be smart, buildings must adapt to the preferences of occupants while offering the services needed for more engaging, productive experience. If your building isn't doing all these things, then it's time to consider how prepared it is for the future and if it's smart enough to thrive in the transforming world. The Internet of Things is enabling us to connect our building systems and devices, to capture more information than ever before.
