 the Internet is truly everywhere and anything could be connected to it coffee makers fridges farms train tracks you name it all you need are smart sensors and a powerful database and you can extract immense amounts of data from any object when British technology pioneer Kevin Ashton coined the term Internet of Things also known as IOT in 1999 he had no idea it would become so big so true how does the Internet of Things work the data captured by the sensors is sent via the Internet to an IOT platform monitoring interpreting and analyzing this data allows you to make sense of what's going on and to take the best possible actions the data gathered on the platform provides valuable insights that can help optimize anything from production processes and offices or factories to traffic flows and let's look at a real-life example the city of Buenos Aires suffered a horrific flood in 2013 and in response the city's government used Internet of Things to prevent future flooding they had sensors placed in the city sewage systems that measure the speed direction and the level of the water these collect and analyze the data in real time with only a few seconds delay Simon are you okay well that is cold when the situation gets precarious they send a notification the system allows the people in charge to respond in time and take necessary actions just in time for Simon who's stuck in the sewer especially when paired with other intelligent technologies like machine learning and artificial intelligence the Internet of Things is powerful enough to help prevent inner-city floods
