  Greetings, as always we will make a quick review to this platform LoRa Server Some recommended tutorials Introduction to TTN LoRaWAN platform with a worldwide community Introduction to RFM95 modules and differences between LoRa and LoRaWAN For more than a year I have wanted to create my own professional Gateway.  we will link it initially with LoRa Server and then TTN. If you want to create a professional catwalk I recommend the following materials, they are adsequibles To create a gateway and also LoRaWAN server with a Raspberry Pi 3 B or B + A LoRaWAN gateway with the RAK833 USB / SPI 8 channels, important is multichannel, for industrial purposes This is the best investment, yes, there are cheaper but only one channel, which technically does not work for real applications I consider that this is the most professional version, for perhaps 500 nodes, well we will carry out tests ... I have selected a RAK811 node is the perfect LoRaWAN version, it works with AT commands, in a few steps it is configured It is the combination of an STM32L151 and an SX1276, it also allows to re-program the STM with a new firmware, we could try it later. We will also test with our already known modules Heltec module is ESP32 + SX1276 + Oled 0.96 ", used ESP-IDF, this method is a little complex, I recommend the RAK811 Module ESP32 WROOM 32 + RFM95 from HoperRF, Also with ESP-IDF Let's review the LoRa Server project The project started in 2015 as an open source LoRaWAN server There are varieties of LoRaWAN Servers available, including TTN has a downloadable version, it is only a little complex Initially I selected LoRa Server because of the ease and practicality of configuration It has complex features perfect for creating Open or Private Public Networks The creator of the project is called Onre Brocaar, I personally appreciate your contribution and leaving it free is a great initiative The components that we will gather are Gateway and server in a single device for this case, practice in initial tests Each component is configurable and interchangeable depending on the final application I will detail the functionality of the modules in the PDAControl documentation in the description of the video The project has a very active forum, which is a good indication that the project is in force and continues to grow Let's look at what platforms and operating systems are available ... It is technically available for all platforms and architectures, then we will install it on a Linux server In configuration technically supports all frequencies worldwide, in my case 902 to 928, For America, my country Colombia. Before all verify the frequency of your country, region or area, all my modules are at 915MHz for my country Colombia It's perfect version 1.1 The purpose of these tutorials will be to guide you so that you can create your own LoRaWAN gateways. we'll take a quick look at loraserver on my raspberry Pi LoRa Server has user management packet redirection configuration channels assigned to the RAK833, in my case 8 upstream and one downstream channels, this will be explained later in detail. Here is the RAK833 configured Currently I do not have any node is transmitting devices or nodes This was the brief introduction I am preparing documentation, I recommend RAK equipment, it will save time in programming The RAK833 is a good option I also recommend RAK2245 and as nodes the RAK811. With these RAK811 nodes + another microcontroller by AT commands, in a few steps they will have a functional node Currently I prepare a tutorial with the existential doubts of LoRaWAN, before starting with the configurations The PCBs you use are another interesting project that I will soon share, For now greetings from PDAControl
