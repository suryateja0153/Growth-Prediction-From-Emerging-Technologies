 In this video tutorial, we will use a bool variable to  change states for "Toggle Image" component. From "Indas" component menu choose "Toggle Image",  add a component to screen, set position and size. Select component and click  "Manage States Images". Set images for states 0 and 1. Click the "Save" button. Now we have to choose a variable. A boolean variable is required. We do not have a boolean variable. Click the "Save" button. Go to "Configurator" and set  "Bucket Brigade.Boolean" type to boolean. Of course, user can create a new variable. Click the "Save" button. Go to File - Reload Variables. Choose toggle image component and click  "Choose Boolean Variable". Assign "Bucket Brigade.Boolean" variable and check "Bind with boolean variable" checkbox. If you check this checkbox, you do not need to assign a set variable. Click the "Save" button and go to the "Client page". When we change the value from 0 to 1 toggle image change  images for states 0 and 1 as defined in the Editor.
