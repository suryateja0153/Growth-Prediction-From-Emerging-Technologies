 well for people with multiple sclerosis excuse me or MS walking can be a challenge the disease disrupts signals from the brain and often Rob's people of their mobility ABC force or HN introduces us to know hi a woman battling MS with the help of a high-tech robot Cathy Miska is fighting multiple sclerosis one step at a time my postures looked better my form and walking has improved so that's encouraging Cathy is one of five MS patients at Cleveland Clinic taking part in a special research study to see if a robotic brace or exoskeleton will show benefit by doing what we would call forced use then hopefully you reprogram the brain so that it actually can work better and create better walking the device is programmed to each person who uses it braces support the lower body and carry the user motors are triggered by sensors to lift the legs assisting someone to walk it's an interactive machine so not only does it generate power no it has no motors to generate power at the joints but it also senses what's happening Cathy comes to the lab for one-hour sessions three days a week hoping the device helps retrain our brain to walk with MS the circuitry kind of gets short-circuited and then it has to find alternative passages to get your leg moving or walking and that it builds it helps build that memory therapy sessions are hard work but well worth the effort when I would get out of the exoskeleton I just noticed that I would have a little bit more automatic responds with my leg and that was very encouraging researchers say the preliminary study which is currently full will help determine who may benefit from exoskeleton therapy they hope to do a larger more comprehensive trial in the future serration ABC 4 News
