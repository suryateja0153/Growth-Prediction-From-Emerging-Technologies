 hand morph a passive exoskeleton that miniaturizes [Music] grasp our passive hand exoskeleton miniaturizes a user's hand into that of a smaller person our exoskeleton allows congruent and real-time haptic feedback it consists of a glove link mechanism and smaller rubber fingers these four bar linkages with pin slots miniaturize grasping motion [Music] thumb linkage miniaturizes while preserving unconstrained movements in combination these features recreate a smaller grasp [Music] furthermore this wire restricts the user's arm reach this recreates a shorter reach these allow product designers to evaluate the usability of products with their own hands also architectural designers are able to feel the accessibility in classrooms with the shorter reach [Music] we conducted a user study to investigate how the users perceived object size is modified by the use of hand morph [Music] the result indicated that objects were perceived to be larger than they were when wearing hand morph we also investigated whether handmorph can assist in designing a product for children in this study we observed the experience of using handmorph for evaluating ergonomics of a toy trumpet participants were asked to improve the design of a toy trumpet for children we provided a hand dimension sheet and hand morph participants were allowed to use both tools as often as they wanted some used handmorph not only for testing ergonomics but even to model the clay [Music] somatosensory feedback help them to understand the usability of their design [Music] a post questionnaire revealed that the confidence in their final design and the understanding of the usability has improved by the use of hand morph [Music]
