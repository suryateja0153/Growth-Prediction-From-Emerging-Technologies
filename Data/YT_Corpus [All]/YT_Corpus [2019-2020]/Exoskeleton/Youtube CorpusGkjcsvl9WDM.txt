 Hello, I am Gordon Cheng. I am the Professor for Cognitive Systems at the Technical University of Munich. My dream exoskeleton would be  like wearing your clothes. And you would not notice that I am  wearing an exoskeleton. That would have huge implications  on people who do not wish to show that they have a disability or any kind of impairment. And it should be part of us,  like clothing becomes part of us when we function in the world. This would greatly ease the  acceptance by society effectively. We are working with a lot of  people around the world. Some of our recent advances have  come from working with material scientists. We try to understand  how materials can function. And how materials can be active –  actively sense, actively move. I imagine how clothes can  sense and act. That's going to be amazing!
