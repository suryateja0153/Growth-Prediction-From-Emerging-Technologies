 FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE LIMITED MOBILITY -- DUE TO STROKE OR A SPINAL CORD INJURY FOR EXAMPLE -- THE PROSPECTS OF WALKING INDEPENDENTLY AGAIN ONE DAY CAN SEEM UNATTAINABLE. HOWEVER, THERE IS A NEW TECHNOLOGY BEING USED BY PHYSICAL THERAPISTS AT BERKSHIRE MEDICAL CENTER THAT IS HELPING PEOPLE MAKE SIGNIFICANT GAINS IN THEIR GAIT AND INDEPENDENCE. IT'S CALLED AN EXO-SKELETON, AND THE DEVICE COSTS $160,000. CONNECTING POINT'S CAROLEE MCGRATH HAS MORE.  WE WENT TO FIRST TOGETHER AND CONTINUED ON IN THIS SMALL CATHOLIC SCHOOL AND THEN STARTED DATING IN NINTH GRADE ACTUALLY.  STEVEN AND SHARON CRONAN HAVE BEEN MARRIED FOR 38 YEARS. THEY HAVE TWO GROWN CHILDREN AND A GRANDDAUGHTER. STEVEN HAS ALWAYS BEEN AN AVID ATHLETE. HE PLAYED SOCCER AT THE COLLEGE LEVEL AND GUYS GOLF AND RAN THREE BOSTON MARATHONS. BUT THESE DAYS.  TALL ON THE LEFT.  STEVEN HAS BEEN TRAINING FOR A MARATHON OF A DIFFERENT KIND.  YOU'RE SO MUCH RESERVED.  IT'S BEEN TOUGH. IT'S BEEN THE TOUGHEST THING I'VE EVER HAD TO DEAL WITH, BOTH MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY.  STEVEN SUFFERED A BRAIN HEMORRHAGE IN 2018 WHICH CAUSED PARALYSIS ON HIS LEFT SIDE.  WE WERE IMMEDIATELY AIRLIFTED TO MASS GENERAL HOSPITAL. THE TEAM WAS WAITING FOR US AND AS SOON AS WE ARRIVED, EVERYTHING HAPPENED VERY QUICKLY.  TALL, TALL. YOU'RE DOING GOOD WITH THE WEIGHT SHIFT.  STEVEN SPENT 13 MONTHS IN BOSTON. SHARON MOVED OVER FROM DALTON TO HELP HIM IN HIS RECOVERY BUT THEY BOTH WANTED TO COME HOME TO THE BERKSHIRES.  GOOD JOB, LEFT, RIGHT, PAUSE. GREAT JOB, STEVEN.  THAT'S REALLY GOOD.  AND WITH THE HELP OF A TEAM FROM THE BERKSHIRE MEDICAL CENTER HE CONTINUES TO MAKE STRIDES.  IT'S EITHER CRY OR SWEAT. [LAUGH]  TWO PHYSICAL THERAPIES HAVE BEEN USING THE EXO SKELETON WHICH HELPS STEVEN IMPROVE HIS WALKING.  IT'S A ROBOTIC DEVICE THAT IS FIT TO A PERSON AND IT HAS MOTORS AND A COMPUTER SYSTEM AND A JIROW SCOPE HOW MUCH ASSISTANCE THEY NEED TO STAND AND HOW MUCH ASSISTANCE THEY NEED TO WALK SO THE MOTORS WILL ACTUALLY PHYSICALLY HELP MOVE THE PERSON INTO THE WALKING PATTERN.  PUSH THAT LEFT HIP FORWARD.  JESSICA SAYS IT HAS HELPED STEVEN BUILD UP HIS ENDURAS AND HE IS ABLE TO WALK FURTHER AND IMPROVED WHERE HE CAN WALK MORE FREQUENTLY WITH A CANE.  I WASN'T IN THE WHEELCHAIR ALL WEEKEND. I WALKED IN AND OUT OF RESTAURANTS AND MY SON'S HOUSE WITH JUST A CANE AND SOME SUPPORT FROM SHARON, JUST BEING THERE IN CASE I STUMBLED OR TRIPPED, BUT I WAS FORTUNATELY ABLE TO DO THAT FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS AGO I WOULDN'T EVEN BE ABLE TO ATTEMPT IT.  WE PUT YOU BACK IN AN EASIER MODE, STEVE.  THANKS.  DO YOU FEEL HOW MUCH EASIER THIS IS?  YEAH.  THE CENTER FOR REHABILITATION HAS HAD THE EXOSKELETON FOR A YEAR AND IT'S THE ONLY ONE IN USE FROM ALBANY TO BOSTON.  HE WORKED ON FRIDAY AND HIM BEING MORE AGGRESSIVE WITH IT.  WE HAD SEVERAL PATIENTS WHO WERE NOT WALKING AT HOME AND NOW THEY ARE AND THAT'S A BIG LIFE-CHANGING LEVEL OF FUNCTION.  STEVEN GOES TO THERAPY TWICE A WEEK AND SHARON BRINGS HER LITTLE BLACK NOTEBOOK TO KEEP TRACK OF ALL THE QUEUES AND STRATEGIES JESSICA AND TOM GIVE HIM.  I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT I LEARN FOR STEVEN TO USE THE SAME LANGUAGE, YOU KNOW, SHIFT TO THE LEFT OR STAND UP TALL.  FOR THE COUPLE WHO FIRST MET ON THE PLAYGROUND ALL THOSE YEARS AGO, THIS HAS BEEN A LONG JOURNEY.  SHARON IS LIKE MY GUARDIAN ANGEL FROM, LIKE, DAY ONE WHEN I GOT SICK. I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH BUT WHAT SHE'S DONE FOR ME. I OWE A GREAT DEAL OF GRATITUDE. SHE'S MY GUARDIAN ANGEL.  AND WITH EACH STEP, THEY'RE GETTING STRONGER TOGETHER.  WE ARE SO GRATEFUL AND WAKE UP EVERY MORNING THAT WE'RE WITH EACH OTHER SO WE HAVE -- WE THANK GOD FOR THAT. EACH DAY, WE'RE HERE TOGETHER.  MARCH ON, KEEP PLUGGING.  RIGHT. [LAUGH]  YES. [LAUGH]
