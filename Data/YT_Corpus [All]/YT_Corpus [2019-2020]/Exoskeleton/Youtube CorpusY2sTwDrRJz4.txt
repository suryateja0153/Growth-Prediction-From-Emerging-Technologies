 So my name is Peter Neuhaus, I am a research scientist at IHMC and I am leading our exo-skeleton project called Quix, it's to design a mobility assisted device for someone with lower limb paralysis It's robotic that someone wears around their body and it moves their joints and supports their weight as they walk over a flat ground and stairs and various terrains to replace their wheelchair. We've been working with Star Rapid since about 2014 for all of our prototyping and machining needs. We find them really easy to work with. We do all of our work, used to be in Solidworks, we switched to Onshape recently, but we produce STEP files and we send the files to Star, and along with the drawing that calls out any kind of specific holes or tolerances or threads and then within about a day we get our quote back with really reasonable price and lead time. So we only do really prototype work So it's all machining ... various metals, steel, stainless steel, aluminum and brass. Sometimes we do anodized coating on our aluminum or specify a finish on the metal parts. We've been really happy. So as we send out the parts to get quoted, they'll often come back with, well this wall thickness is too thin or we're having trouble hitting this tolerance or if you make this change, it'll reduce the number of setups. So they do help us either reduce cost or make the parts more manufacturable or just ensure that it's more reliable part, in terms of maybe if the wall is too thin and they might bust out or when they do a tapped hole that might be problematic, so they'll give us that advice and we will change the part and send it back. So working with Star has been really great. We have a sales person that we work directly with who supports us throughout the process, from getting the quote to updating us on the progress, sending us pictures of the part as they progress through the manufacturing process, then giving us tracking numbers, when they send the parts out. So we've been really happy with the service and quality that Star has given us.
