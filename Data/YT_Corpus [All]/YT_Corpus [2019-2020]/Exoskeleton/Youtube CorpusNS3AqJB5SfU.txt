 (upbeat music) (beetle cracking) - We got very curious about this beetle, we wanted to study more about it. They evolved from the flying beetle. So originally many, many, many million years ago and the beetle was flying at some point just decided to stay on the ground. When you look at the flying beetle, it has some kind of lids that actually protect the wings. And also they are very helpful for the flying process as well. But this terrestrial beetle that decided to go back to the ground, didn't need actuation of these lids. So they actually remained there and they are connecting. The way nature processed that connection, it made it with this kind of suture, This suture looks like jigsaw puzzle, where there is some kind of interlocking, (upbeat music) We found that there are two different layers of protection. So they are connected with this blade structure that basically prevents any kind of motion, right? So there is no deformation, so that would be the first layer. If for any reason the load exceeds that one that actually will break this link, what happens is that you have the delamination. So there's gonna be more graceful failure, which really allows for energy dissipation. Yes, the material fails because it's not elastic anymore, but it dissipates energy. So it allows a lot of time to deform which you know, gives you a chance to escape for the beetle. Or for us, if we are actually applying this to structures, it allows us time to you know, evacuate a building. Now that we've made the observation and we confirmed that the beetle is the optimum geometry then we actually go back to the models and try and understand the why. Because if we understand how, we can extrapolate to other materials. So right now we have polymers, can we then, you know, take this information and put it in metals or ceramics. (upbeat music)
