 Ironman is no longer just a comic book and a movie superhero and he lives in Kitchener Ontario James Hobson (repeated) created just the device to help with the task. An Exo-skeleton so unique you have to see it to believe it The making of this device was documented and posted to YouTube just last week as of right now more than nine hundred and seventy thousand people have watched it so could hit a million by tonight oh that is heavy hey guys can you believe we've had nine million subscribers it's incredible! I started my youtube journey when I was 16 back in 2006 shortly after the platform was created back then it was just a way for me to share videos I made with my friends mostly about parkour and freerunning As I grew up my interests change and I became fascinated with technology and engineering I learned how to do things by watching videos documenting projects that others had done and started making projects of my own recording videos to help inspire others to do the same along the way you guys became interested in the things I was creating and slowly but surely we've grown this audience to nine million people that's absolutely incredible that's over 25 percent the population of Canada as we've grown this channel together I've continued to reinvest everything we make back into the channel and the business to be able to continually make bigger and better projects and videos to inspire you guys into science technology engineering and math our team now has 12 people dedicated to continuing to push the envelope further and sharing our passion for innovation with the world and it's all thanks to you guys so to show our appreciation we're gonna be doing our biggest giveaway ever with over 50 prizes available including Hacksmith merch, batarangs,and even a set of original pneumatic cylinders for my very first exoskeleton which we're gonna revisit in this video and since this video is such a special video for the channel I knew it was important that we find that perfect sponsor for the video so without further ado this video is sponsored by Raid Shadow Legends... wait really just kidding well not about the video sponsor this video is sponsored by Raid Shadow Legends and I know they sponsor everyone in fact it's become a bit of a meme on YouTube but honestly that's a good thing sponsorships are what allow youtubers to make amazing content for you to enjoy in fact Raid sponsor us over a year and a half ago you know before it was cool to be sponsored by Raid and they actually helped fund the initial creation of our aliens power loader project which is why we were happy to work with them again and honestly out of all the mobile games we made ads for I played Raid Shadow Legends the most it's an epic RPG where you collect train and outfit your team of heroes to go on the adventure of a lifetime and for the first time ever it's now available for free on both mobile and PC there's tons of detail and champions and it's honestly rather addictive to level up your heroes in the tavern and upgrade their armor and weapons plus if you face off with a plan boss there are weekly awards waiting for you and a PvP is your thing check out the brand new tag arena with special awards for those who dominate in this fast paced best two out of three competitive PvP arena what I like most about Raid Shadow Legends is building up the ultimate team of heroes equipped with all the right armor and weapons not unlike what we do here on the Hacksmith Channel Try Raid Shadow Legends today and you'll get an extra entry into our biggest giveaway ever simply go to the video description click on the special links below and if you're a new player you'll get a hundred thousand silver one energy refill ten mystery charts and a free champion slasher all this treasure will be waiting for you right here in your inbox be quick though because the rewards will only be available for the next 30 days good luck and I'll see you in-game Now, because the channel has come so far from its original days in a little basement apartment in Toronto I thought it would be interesting to reflect a bit about how far we've come and revisit one of the projects that really started it all my Elysium exoskeleton I grabbed some popcorn and I watched my entire 16 part series and wow I was not very good at making videos some of the videos didn't even have background music anyway I wouldn't want to make you sit through all 16 parts so I've edited them all down into a short two-minute montage enjoy Gotta get some perforated square tubing for the exoskeleton six feet of it okay so I admit this is a really ghetto testing setup but I really want to see but if I put another guy on the front I think we'll have something Think it'll pick up the battery now? safety first yeah so I think we're making some really good progress with this just a quick little concept to show it then I'm hoping to do is that some cylinders up back of the chest for now I'm just going to steal this webbing and in the backpack straps so the one mounted off the shoulder with a bolt will allow the entire arm to rotate up and down like this whereas the other one will let it rotate around like to introduce you to my mannequin named Tony he is actually quite similar to my size which is perfect because this means that I can actually putthe exoskeleton on him so I can do the measurements because otherwise it's gonna be pretty hard to make the exoskeleton fit when I'm the one whose supposed to be wearing it better but I got the shoulders mounted it's actually surprisingly flexible but we're almost getting ready to throw them together there's a shoulder joint and then this is going to attach on to the frame just have to make some straps actually pull it to my arm so I'll have like a spacer some padding especially on the bicep I'll keep everything in place but I'm pretty excited I think this is gonna work out quite well so you might notice I'm kind of mixing universes here...Ironman Elysium well an Iron Man suit is the end goal someday so you know might as well start early all right so that's about a hundred and seventy pounds or just under 80 kilograms definitely something I can't curl myself 170 pounds It worked Oh Wow. Absolutely phenomenal stuff so where is it now well besides showing it to fans at various conventions and events it's mostly sat on a shelf in the original test I use cinder blocks that weighed approximately 171 and a half pounds or about 77 kilograms but a lot of people seem to think it was fake weights so let's prove it once and for all and use real Olympic weights since this is just an upper-body exoskeleton my very human legs still have to hold the weight so I'm wearing a weightlifting belt and I got some gloves on to hopefully protect myself like nothing at all I think we can do more I think of World Record is two hundred forty nine and a half pounds held by Dennis saplinski....? 255 pounds. More than the world record, let's see if I can do it world record that was pretty good let's smash the world record let's do 275 pounds Just gonna do one rep that's frickin sweet now the best part about this Elysium exoskeleton is how much it's inspired makers around the world to pick up some tools and work on projects in their garage I'm here with one of my fans who's been with the channel since the original Elysium Lift. This is Bogdan and as a special sign of appreciation for coming out and seeing us... a set of Batarangs. Thank you! No Problem. Keep on watching. Good luck with the Exo. Thank You.
