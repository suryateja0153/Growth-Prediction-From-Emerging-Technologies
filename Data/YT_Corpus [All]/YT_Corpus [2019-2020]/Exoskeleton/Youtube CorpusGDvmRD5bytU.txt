 hallo it's Jang here with four mega construx products mega construx halo products at that to show you I finally got all three of the exosuit sets including the mark one Spartan suit prototype and the other two this one is inspired by Halo Wars 2 and this one is completely made up and also as a bonus because I got it and it also kind of goes with one of these products I'm gonna show you this sword base invasion it's Spartans vs. skirmisher is just another one of those 4 figure packs you get these open built as needed and show them to you up close with the exosuits I don't know why I personally was expecting these to be a little bit more varied in their size and shape and kind of stance you know there is some variation there but for the most part you know they're the same height and everything they just look like they could in a hypothetical world be competitive against one another and I feel like I get similar value between each of the sets and I want to show you each of these one by one first I need to wind things back though because right out of the box you get three complete figures which you then have to individually partially disassembled to put them into their full exosuit setups the Skyfire set is based around a marine with a pretty colorful color scheme and the head is kind of a school bus yellow with a nice dark grey that not only goes around the front of the breather space and also on the top but actually lines the visor so that's always a good thing to see especially on these lighter colored heads and then you get some paint application on the main armor piece and the most of the rest of it is just using the colors of the plastic with a very very light grey and medium medium dark almost indigo blue and the weapon here is just a plain black saw the breacher exosuit is obviously based around a banished brute there's not a whole lot special done to this one just a little bit of paint application on the main armor and of course on the helmet always important and beneath that helmet the skin tone for this one is kind of the the dark grayish brown color which is good you know it's a nice non-controversial color to always be able to use for the Brutes be nice if that had a little bit of paint application on it but I'm not complaining because he does have his helmet on pretty much all the time and then lastly the Marc one prototype set comes with an older style of marine with that potala k-- green that's pretty perfect for the Halo universe just generally speaking there's not a perfect match between the armored plastic color and the helmet plastic color which is not uncommon to see it's a little bit of a difference in the hue I think it's a little bit closer to the plane I in Kherson then it appears on the camera I think the camera is picking up a little bit more of the difference just based on that the angles of the light hitting it the paint application on the face there is a little bit a little bit messy on this side with the microphone boom and the weapon is just a plain black assault rifle it is the newer style of mold which has a rail on top so it can attack it can accept attachments you know optics and such and also it will accept muzzle and attachments if you have any of those now this is a funny looking thing but I just wanted to be sure to show it at one point the helmet that is specific to the exosuit which is based off of Fred's helmet design just placed on the figure normally nothing about this really matches up so let's move on alright so fully suited up the brute is a proper brute really carried the whole theme throughout the neck with the color scheme and also equipping a giant and gravity hammer there for some reason every time I look at this it just invokes thoughts of the the jump pack roots I'm not a big Halo Wars 2 player myself I played it a bit when it came out and not too much after that went through the campaign did a little bit of multiplayer with a friend or two and then kind of gave up on it so not up on everything with the game itself but I do believe this is a made-up thing that definitely could be in the game you know it kind of makes sense and it looks pretty good just generally speaking I wouldn't mind this being a jump pack unit that is purely melee focused and would probably be pretty good at taking down buildings as well structures just in general and yeah take a closer look at to the articulation capabilities I also need to put that lower spike on the grav hammer push that in just a little bit more because there was a little bit of gap as I rotate it around keep in mind that all of these are built basically the same and again you do have an actual figure right in there whose embedded in there you just change out the body armor to basically encapsulate the figure and make sure that it stays perfectly just in the right spot so the head is always exactly where it needs to be on each of these and then their arms are in there these are hollow structures their arms are inside and then their full legs are inside so those are kept in there pretty well and look at this you've got this joint here which gives you a nice range and then you've got this shoulder joint which allows you to rotate let me see if I can give you a better look of look at that from the side there we go the shoulder joint can rotate all around you have to be a little bit mindful of the fact that there is an actual figure inside but the joints are lined up pretty well with the basic figure so you know things are rotating pretty much where they should so nothing is being stressed too badly and then you have a ball joint for the the elbow here so this can rotate up and down which is good it can also be turned all around in different ways so ultimately you're able to bring an arm all the way out like that or you can bring it in rotate this around either way and you can actually rotate it inward like so if that was a sword that might be a useful look and rain across the chest completely him you know you know go too far let me see if I can move this other one out of the way and get that yeah it's just gonna keep on going you can also rotate the wrist here sorry it's kind of small you know the whole thing is a little bit dainty so it's a little bit difficult for me to figure out exactly what sort of angles I need for you to see these things I will do my best and try to learn and do better in the future so there's the elbow joint being used maximally to come right up to the chest which is pretty impressive articulation for a suit that you build up oops I just accidentally pulled this out that you build up beyond a already articulated figure that's inside I'm actually pretty impressed now I did just show a couple pieces coming apart that was my own clumsiness this does not come apart the way that the second-gen cyclopses did you know those were really really flimsy and not good really with their builds this is not like that this is much more sturdy there's a lot more friction in these joints you got a ball joint here which allows the legs to go forward at the hip forward and back you can also splay which is interesting there's not a lot of room force playing in and out because again there is an actual leg a figure leg inside but there's a little bit of room there you can also twist this ever so slightly but you get more available motion at the knee which again that was my fault right there I actually assembled these wrongly my fault yeah I'm messing up a little bit but I am human happens sometimes there we go now I got it right so you do have a little bit of a limitation with the me how far it'll go back that's just because of the the bulk of these pieces you can't rotate that around as well because it is a ball joint so you know you can use that compounded with the upper leg to get into some interesting poses and you also have a little bit of room with the ankle being able to move on its own ball joint so this can be rotated in and out around it can be angled side to side just a bit you can also go up and down again I apologies if I'm not capturing this all that well this is all new to me some degree but overall I'm pretty actually I'm very satisfied with this model the shield is just attached to the side of the arm there it looks really nice yeah it's pretty cool and you know it's mega so no stickers or anything it looks like a decoration is a print and the build is pretty proper you know you have these basic pieces that they do share between the different sets but then you build upon those which starts to make things very very unique and by putting different figures in each that also kind of just seals the deal they like that's the the least important part mostly what you build here is what's most important to make these unique and to make them interesting and cool this as far as I know is completely made up and if I'm wrong about that please check the comments to see if someone else has already corrected me if they haven't let me know what is the canonical source for this I am not familiar with any such thing feels like it's just like a Darer derivation of the Spartan one program mixed with a little bit of the direction they went with the cycle cyclopses and then brought back into the use of regular Marines that is not a Spartan in there as we heard he saw dual wielding what are supposed to be pistols of some sort Gigantor pistols are essentially and cannons for a mech this thing is very bright and I don't mind it you know has a little bit of that that Corp kind of look yeah I think the the weapons are the the weak points of this also this is supposed to fly it's got a jet pack on the back or a rocket pack but those engines look pretty tiny to me I think those should have been significantly larger to make more sense I mean the fire doesn't necessarily need to be bigger coming out of there but just the the engines themselves the motors themselves those little cylinders just aren't enough yeah they're not completely convincing to me but here you can see that the same basic armor pieces are used that we just saw on the brute and they've just been decorated up with additional pieces you know for the pack on the back and everything and of course the weapons that are just done differently just a little bit of decoration on the front combine with the different colors and print and it makes for something that is definitely unique that stands out in terms of articulation you're gonna see the exact same thing here so you know every I mean literally everything is the same that the figures have comparable articulation between them so you know you have the same limitations that are built into this armor system and yeah I think it just works out pretty well I think that what I'll try to do with this one is just slightly different pose here and I did with the other and I said these do not fall apart the way that can you aim I wonder like he's aiming down sights just a little bit not quite they don't fall apart the way that the Cyclops is did those cyclopses we're not good in their bills they looked nice there was a lot of things that you could do with them in terms in terms of posing them but you know I just fell apart these these don't you still need to exercise some care with them but just in general yeah trying trying with AES just a little bit not quite I think these would have like a like a sight like a heads-up display on the back that would show the sight picture from a camera view or something but yeah this is a pretty cool thing and again has the same articulation is what you just saw this one of course is 100% obviously canonical this is a Spartan one the prototype suit which is fantastic to get a lot of people will appreciate this in many many ways got all sorts of weapons on there it's kind of silly in a way totally overkill but that's exactly what it was all about and yeah once again this is using the same basic armor system but this does have those unique shoulder pad pieces or at least they're used as shoulder pads here where'd you give it a unique look you know I'm just the armor itself of course you can always add things on like the weapons systems that are attached to the back unfortunately like the rocket launcher is not able to rotate forward or anything or the other I think is that is it a grenade launcher I've got to look that up in advance but the other the other cannon that's on the side on the left side left shoulder and is not able to rotate forward you can kind of move those side-to-side rotate them slightly but for the most part they're static that is unfortunate would have been nice if there is some small system some small way to get those to move forward or at least to to rebuild them into an active ready to fire position I guess you can do artillery style shots from here but you know I'd like to be able to face those forward and they just don't give you the ability to to make that happen I did just leave on the the basic head for this one but I do want to show you the other head in one of these mechs in a different form behold the alternate to build the official alternate build from the mega constructs beyonders app was available on iOS and Android tablets evidently I wasn't able to bring it up on a phone but I was able to bring it up on a small tablet the app is actually really nice like the way that they present instructions is very very nice at hand-holding its animated really crisp and high-quality and everything and easy to follow along so this is what they suggest it does leave a bunch of parts behind but it's distinctly different from the base build and you know is at least something to kick off some creativity to let you know it's okay or to confirm that it is okay to rebuild these things differently this has the same you know underlying structure does look a little bit different from what they actually show on the package just some of them the colors are different and everything but you know all the same articulation is there it is unfortunate in particular with this set that they don't include two hands so the set only has one hand this bill doesn't even use either one but I don't know if this is supposed to be a weapon or like that like is it supposed to be a projectile weapon or a bludgeoning weapon like a mace it looks like a mace to me and then maybe this is like a power punch like a power fist you know it just goes pull like that just like I need to use my imagination a little bit maybe that's mortar on the back maybe it's a rocket pack yeah yeah this one does not come with two hands and it's too bad because this does have just such a generic color scheme underneath you know just all gray gray and black the perfect platform to build upon and it would have been nice if they did include that second hand just as an extra piece just as a spare part you know so we could finish it off that said though it is also missing one forearm so the intent was to use that giant barrel assembly on one side which I forgot to mention is actually an interesting part because it does have a color application and I can grab it right here there we go I did it did it live because he it has a little bit of green just around the ridge there I run the rim well it focus this close yes didn't I expect that at all but you know otherwise it's basically just a barrel I get trash cans so yeah I I do hope they continue this system and I do hope that they apply it to other licenses because it's a nice it's a nice base for building humanoid mechs you know and it could be something that they could do their own thing with do some non licensed stuff yeah I think there's some room there you know for a lot of folks to have some good fun finally here's sword bass invasion with two Spartans and two super articulated skirmishers which at first glance look too big but I think they're actually about right in size when those things stand up you realize that they're not exactly tiny this has one bit of cover just a small build and one container doesn't even have anything in it there are no spares that are good to put in there but you know at the very least that gives you a little bit of surrounding terrain and texture and in addition to the usual basis small bases that they have for the figures this one also has a little clear stand to let you get it off the ground a bit that's a female air assault Spartan there you see the female body mold underneath the production work on this one is pretty much on point would say the matte black surround that is on the head as a paint application the first paint application is good really sets off the visor the gold is opaque enough the blue has some metallic flake in it and it's actually slightly greenish blue so it's technically in the cyan range it's not a true blue which I actually I like this this color especially with that amount of metallic flake in it it's not too obvious but it definitely adds a bit and the yellow you know the yellow is really really bright arguably bordering on a little bit too toyish but I'm okay with it it's not letting too much light through so it just looks very vibrant you know got the nade launcher there and on the back is of course the jet pack this is a CQC Spartan with the exact same color scheme again the same matte black surround on the head the same a little bit of metallic sheen metallic flake in the armor and the same really really bright forearms and lower legs but still a pretty good looking figure overall I like just I like it in general like this level of detailing that work that they did on the head there it's just so important it just makes it right you know when they leave off a surround or they use ones that don't need one so they think they can afford to leave it off it just just doesn't have a visor that stands out well enough so when they have that just makes everything right I think it's absolutely necessary and then this one has the shotgun there as you can see and let's move on to the skirmishers I actually had to zoom out a little bit to show this to you because it's just so big let me bring back this part over here for the sake of comparison you know the size the relative size is pretty appropriate you know skirmishers are actually somewhat comparable to elites in their overall stature though they should be a good deal skinnier and this does have some specialized body pieces just for skirmisher but overall it mostly looks like an elite with the skirmisher hit on it and i don't know how much could have been done to make that better I think that the limbs really could have been thinner we've been nice if they were and this doesn't you don't really show the three toes very well in a three o'clock three o'clock foot three toe foot whatever it is you know is is really distinct on the skirmishers and it just doesn't show up that well here so really yeah it just looks kind of like an elite to me well the skirmish your head big ol skirmish your head the head is pretty good it's sprayed on the masked eyes and tongue is not too bad but the basic needle rifle there which is okay not particularly well defined I always like to see those with some paint application you can see the definition of the needles you know but those in actual pink but yeah we're all this is this is okay not great in my personal opinion there is one thing that's particularly bad about both the ones that I got so they are identical in every way including this they've had no friction in the waist just just a bad batch of parts it doesn't fall apart you know but you see there's a little bit of wiggle room in there and yeah just a little bit too much room for that to move around which is unfortunate it's not common at all to get errors like that from megabucks or maybe it constructs these days common at all but when it does happen it sucks and it bit me this time dang it alright this video was clearly way way too long so my apologies for that but there was a lot of little stuff that I needed to cover and go through this was actually filmed over the course of three separate days so hope that it was worthwhile for you thank you for your patience and I will talk to you again soon
