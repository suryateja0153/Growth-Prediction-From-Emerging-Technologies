What's up guys I'm Cletus from the [Inaudible] youtube channel Today you're going to hop in with my boys James and Ruby this is a thousand horsepower automatic Powerglide transmission drag car as well as you're gonna ride along with me in a stick-shift 1500 horsepower Corvette with no body panels known as Leroy we love drag race and right now we're at cleats and cars if we are going to go have some freaking fun this drag strip rips hopefully we can run a seven second fast in this and a decent 8 second pass in this and then after that can we go for a ride in neighbor and do a nice burnout I think let's do it Phil oh man oh yeah alright you guys are in for a treat this is something most people never get to experience you're about to jump into Ruby a thousand horsepower turbo Corvette I won't be in the car with you but I will be miked up so let's get you guys in here for a ride-along now you're in good hands James is a pro at driving this car and we spoke before and he said he's ready to set a record with this run so sit back and hang on to the burnout box where you burn out to heat up your tires and clean up for driving around the track the same when doing the burnout keep one hand on the wheel to steer the car one hand on the shifter when you're on the ship that you got to go to high gear so this way alright pull it back down in the first year to leave you'll see two buttons on the stairwell once that transbrake the loss of arm once a pump box the bug locks on the turbo car allows you to bunk the khari to build booster this way can be possible it's on at the end you see my hand hit that second lever that is the parachute it helps you slow down and holy smokes that was nuts you guys just ran a quarter-mile in 8.4 seconds which is a new record for this car and you were flying down the track at 161 miles an hour what a ride so thank you James and now it's time to get into Leroy and go even faster so quittez is taking you for a ride in his twin turbo 1500 horsepower stick shift Corvette which is the first-ever GM stick shift car that did a quarter-mile in less than eight seconds and as you can see by the crowd surrounding this car shouting taking pictures you are sitting in something special this is one of the most famous drag cars on YouTube and you're about to see why what's up guys good job Cheerilee had the bald eagle about $30 you know man that was crazy wheelspin off the line but Leroy hooked up and then blew past that other car in the left lane and if you thought this was cool well we are not done yet next we're going for a ride in neighbor for a burnout competition neighbor is a supercharged 1,000 horsepower Crown Vic built to put on a show and destroy tires now I need you guys to pay attention to Cletus and listen up for this safety briefing when the car comes to a stop now this is insane holy smokes and his burnout contest goes all night you guys have to see what this looks like from outside the car now Thank You Cletus and James for the ride alongs but wait there is more the final ride alongs you're gonna be doing isn't the most winningest drag car in the world with one of the most winningest drag car drivers in the world Dan Fletcher let's take a look inside this car now a really cool thing about this when he comes up to the staging line I want you guys to pay attention right down here to the right is a trans brake button this right here take a look at that because when he goes and races he presses down on this it puts the car in reverse and first gear at the same time which holds it steady at the lights then he's able to mash the gas it revs to about 4,800 rpms and he lets go to the trans brake and that's when the car launches and that's how you get a wheelie so this is so cool we're about to go down the track do a wheelie in this Camaro the most winningest car in the NHRA history let's get the helmet on and go for a ride and here goes a ride-along in a professional drag race and remember to watch dan's hand release the trans brake to launch the car and what I raised the other guy one by point zero zero one of a second and that's how intense and how close these professional drag races are insane all right now that was amazing that was so much fun I hope you guys enjoyed it and it was so much fun that I want to get a drag car don't worry don't worry hold up I know we have the drift sting to our right
