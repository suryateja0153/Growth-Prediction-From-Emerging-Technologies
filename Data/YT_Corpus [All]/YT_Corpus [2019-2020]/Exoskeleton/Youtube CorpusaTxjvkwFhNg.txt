 [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] good morning today we see the lecture on the force control of an index finger exoskeleton the organization of today's lecture will be as follows first we see the introduction to force control of manipulators then we see the kinematic model of the proposed indexfinger exoskeleton then we see the proposed force control strategy then we see the stability analysis based on Lyapunov then we see the results from both simulation as well as the experiment then we finally go through the limitations associated with this research study and finally we conclude coming to the introduction so force control so force control of a robotic system so before that we should know how the joint torque and the end effector force whose are related that is by the static relationship tau equal to J transpose F we can have this relationship between the joint torque and the end effector force through the Jacobian transpose relationship the Jacobian matrix is basically the derivative of derivative matrix so that gives the joint torque provided the end effected force is given then we see that when we have the robotic system in contact with a glass surface in order to clean the glass surface instead of position control because the robot is all already in contact with the glass surface so here position control will not be helpful rather force control will be helpful and now coming to the artificial or natural constraint the nature will constraint is that the magnitude of the like for example we cannot apply more force on the glass because if we apply more force on the glass the glass gets broken so that the control becomes failure so the contact force must be applied in such a way that that depends on the stiffness of the environment so the stiffness of the environment gives you the natural constraint but at the same time in order to have the glass to be cleaned the direction towards the glass should be controlled for example this is the X direction towards the glass the manipulator has to move in the X direction towards the glass the direction towards the X must be controlled so this implies artificial constraint so now let's consider a manipulator where the tool is in contact with the environment which is basically the hot surface extraction point P is the point of contact and thus the manipulator with its end effector having the tool so now when we see through the impedance force control we observe that there is stiffness of the environment through this control what we observe is we have the stiffness of the environment which is used to control the tip on the surface through the force control so here we can see that F equal to K into e multiplied by X minus XE which is the force acting on the surface by the tool where ke is the stiffness matrix of the environment stiffness matrix of the environment and X E is the non-deformable position of the environment and we consider exd be the desired position trajectory of the end-effector and X being the actual position trajectory of the end-effector tool it means the tool which is in contact with the deformable environment then we can have the relationship between the joint torque and the infinitesimal variation of the joint angles that is Delta Q by the relationship which is tau equal to J transpose ke J Delta Q that's a relationship that gives between the joint torque and the infinitesimal variation in the joint angle this is obtained from the relationship tau equal to j transpose EF what we have seen in the first slide that is the static relationship that gives the relationship between the joint torque on the end effector tip force where the Jacobian matrix is here generally six cross n degrees of freedom or size matrix which is a Jacobian matrix and the q is the generalized coordinate of the robotic system which is a joint angle independent coordinate system and the stiffness matrix here is K Q which is J transpose ke J is the stiffness matrix which is this portion so thus tau can be written as KQ into Delta cube so when we have the impedance control implemented on the manipulator the control law will take the form tau equal to J transpose into KP into error plus KD into error dot plus gravity portion G of Q where the error E is given by XD minus X where X D represents the desired trajectory of the in defector and X is the actual trajectory of the end effector through the deformable environment thus the block diagram pertaining to this control law is given by decide X actual KP KD multiplied by the G transpose summed up here to give the joint torque that goes to dark controller from that we get the torque actual that goes to the robotic system that gives the joint angle that is fed back here just also taken back to compute the Jacobian then it is fed back as an actual trajectory so this is the control strategy block diagram for impedance force control of his generalized to n degrees of freedom manipulator now we come to our exoskeleton so this exoskeleton is basically the thumb portion is fixed whereas the index finger exoskeleton is a 1 1 by the subject human subject it has three degrees of freedom as I mentioned in the previous lectures it has three degrees of freedom one for the flexion extension motion of the mCP joint and the second is a flexion extension motion of the VIP joint and finally the third one is the flexion extension motion of the distal interphalangeal joint of the index finger so this in this figure can provide the motion in three degrees of freedom fashion of the flexion extension movement of the index finger joints independently the kinematic model of the index finger exoskeleton shown here with the perspective that three robotic four bar mechanisms are serially connected first one for the proximal phalanx the second one for bar for the middle phalanx and the third four bar for the distal phalanx connected serially so that they form the index finger exoskeleton for the moment of the index finger the kinematic modeling is observed in such a way that we have simulated so that the serial attachment by the former kinematic equation is providing the moment in such a way that this type of simulative trajectory can be possible as you can see that the magenta line shows the trajectory of the end effector and the red line shows the trajectory of the middle phalanx four-bar and also the second red line shows the territory of the proximal felling's of the index finger part of the exoskeleton then we come to see the kinematic equations the former kinematic equation defining the end effector tip that is the index finger tip positions xif and x and y i F the xif and yif which is the index finger tip trajectory equation that is the former kinematic equation which is a function of the joint variable theta P which is for the proximal phalanx joint angle and theta M which is the middle phalanx joint angle and theta D which is the generalized coordinate of the distal phalanx for but this is this complex equation is obtained through closed loop equation that starts from the frame which is basically it starts from the base frame and it ended up in D the tip frame which is here we started here but the closed loop equation then go reach here then we reach this coupler from the coupler we move on to the line which is the base of the middle phalanx four bar from that we reach the tip which is a coupler tip of the middle phalanx from there we reach the distal phalanx tip that is how through closed-loop equation we have obtained the tip position of the index finger exoskeleton now coming to the force control strategy associated or proposed in this study is that transpose of the Jacobian method is utilized so that the ideal dynamics of the index finger exoskeleton is assumed hence the joint torque by the ideal dynamics is given by tau equal to theta dot with the update law being tau theta dot equal to J transpose K multiplied by the error thus the force which is given by the product of K with the error is used as a regulating force for the tip towards the desired force the term K multiplied by E is the one which regulates the tip towards the desired given force with the idea of ideal dynamics of the exoskeleton which leads to the joint torque to being theta dot so the block diagram associated with the proposed control strategy of the force is given by given the desired force may be a scalar or a desired trajectory it works for both so we considered first with the scalar that is a set point then we can also implement a dress.i trajectory so given the decide force it is multiplied with the gain matrix so that Jacobian transpose comes into picture so that we see here this is e k x e x the J transport which is the Jacobian transpose that leads to the theta dot so that the joint velocity is integrated by runge-kutta approach which is the fourth order method to get the joint variable theta so that through forward kinematics we obtain the actual position of the end effector of the index finger exoskeleton with the deformed initial position being also obtained with the initial angle given to the power kinematic model F of theta then that product with the summation X and X dot my X inverse my X initial minus with the product that the ke which is a stiffness matrix of the environment will give the force actual that is the actual force because this is a modeling portion because we do not have the sensor it is through simulation this approach can be used because the model which is the force for kinematic model can be utilized to obtain the force actual through the stiffness matrix and the distance or the discrepancy between the actual position of the index finger tip as well as the undeformed position of the index finger tip that is exceed is here is X initial through that we obtain the actual so the difference or the discrepancy between desired and the actual force value will give the error again that is multiplied with the control gain then it is multiplied further with the Jacobian transpose in order to obtain the data velocity which is given by this expression this update control law so now coming to the stability analysis the Lyapunov function stability analysis is prude here in order to show that the convergence error convergences happened asymptotically so the function V the lightener candidate is taken as a function of error which is given by half into e transpose into ke where V our fee is positive definite and we have zero is zero in the beginning and by differentiating we get V dot equal to e transpose ke into F decide dot minus e transpose ke x ke where K is the control gain and K is the stiffness and X dot plus e transpose ke ke into y X initial velocity where F is given by K into X minus X initial and F dot is K into X dot minus X dot initial again we have V dot is equal to e transpose ke F decided dot minus e transpose K multiplied by the stiffness matrix into Jacobian with J curve with velocity because X dot is given by J theta dot that's why we replace the X dot by J theta dot similarly with the second term also with the third term also we have replaced the tip velocity by the Jacobian multiplied by the joint angler velocity substituting the joint velocity the controller we have obtained V dot equal to e transpose K F T decide minus e transpose ke ke j J transpose K so here we obtain we substitute the controller which is theta dot equal to ke G transpose that is J transpose into K so this controller as I show here this controller J transpose ke is implemented here in order to obtain this equation assuming now F dot decide because F is a desired a velocity which we decide force so the velocity is zero here and initially they are 0 F decided dot and X initial dot or zero so from the above assumption we have V dot getting simplified to V dot is equal to minus term of e transpose ke x ke into J J transpose ke which is less than equal to 0 thus we prove that for the positive definite light no candidate we greater than 0 we have V dot less than 0 thus implies that the error converges to 0 asymptotically which implies that the system is stable asymptotically so we have performed the experiment by having the desired force given with the actual force obtained through these sensor feedback where the sensor is a force sensor which is basically fsor 4:02 sensor which is giving the force fairly based on the resistance value change this is the force sensor which is attached to the body surface so that the finger pad will be pressing it with the desired force applied by the exoskeleton Master here the human finger acts as a slave so the block diagram for the experimental study is given us where the model portion has been replaced by the actual exoskeleton with the actual force getting obtained from the force sensor attached to the decided deformable object to be grasped schematic shows that ex mental model or X mental exoskeleton one on D human subject grasping a deformable object where the force sensor is attached to the surface lateral surface of the body of interest to be grabbed and the exoskeleton master may the slave human subject finger in order to grab the object with the desired force of interest so this is the X metals set up showing how the exoskeleton is helpful in or aiding the patient or the human subject in order to grab an object with their desired a force because the exoskeleton acts here as here finish physiotherapist in order to make the impaired or the non grasping hand to grasp an object with the desired force of interest we see the results here from the simulation study also through the external study given the force of closely to five Newton the desired trajectory is obtained so fast in order to trace on the system stays here in the convergent position for a time of one second and similarly this is observed with the sensory force feedback trajectory and hence we have noise associated with this sensory feedback so given the three Newton desired force we have obtained the actual trajectory coming and setting settling in the desired setting point of three Newton then the time domain specifications for the simulation and the X mental study are as follows the rise time being 0.037 second and the peak time being 0.05 second a setting time is 0.01 second the maximum peak overshoot is 8.2 percentage and the peak value of the forces 15.1 - in the simulation and similarly for the experiment the peak value is three point three seven newton and the maximum peak overshoot is 16% Asia where the settling time is point nine approximately once again now coming to the overall limitations associated with our external study is as follows there are there are as follows one first one is we have consider only the static force analysis but actually we need to consider the dynamics because the dynamics is given by highly coupled equation which is tau equal to mass plus because we need to consider the inertia matrix and the Coriolis matrix and the gravity term in order to obtain the joint torque but what we have considered through ideal dynamicists you wrote so with this we have defined our system control strategy whereas actually the coupled highly coupled dynamic equation must be considered with the inertia matrix Coriolis matrix and the graph gravity term coming into picture that must be giving the real study and we have confirmed in our study that the error gets converged to 0 asymptotically as time tends to 0 the error becomes 0 that's what we have observed through the life no stability but practically what is observed what is required from the study is robustness once the disturbance is given because the human subject where we target the usage of this exoskeleton designed will be for the patients who have not used or who are not grabbed an object due to impairment of their hand will have a rigidity so that rigidity will mix will provide more impedance while grasping an object so that impedance will be the disturbance to be considered here and how the control strategy is going to be robust towards the disturbance applied so that must be the future study immediate study for our such work and also we must be doing statistical analysis with the current rehabilitation paradigms and coming to the conclusion here we have started this lecture with the basics of force control of n degrees of freedom robot manipulator then we have implemented our proposed two control strategy of force with the concept of ideal dynamics or with the assumption of ideal dynamics of the proposed exoskeleton in order to perform the grasping task and both simulation and affinity study has been performed in order to see how the grasping has been done with the desired force input and our future study will be focusing fully on the robust control strategy of the exoskeleton in grasping an object with both multi step input and also the time varying continuous or discontinuous input variations of the decide force along with the disturbance analysis thank you so much [Music] [Applause]
