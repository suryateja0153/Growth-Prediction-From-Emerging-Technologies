 my world of hope used to be adventure racing no it's about curing paralysis that is the goal that is the vision to cure paralysis in our lifetime question is what are the steps along the way to do that so today I was trying the exoskeleton just to get up and walk and again it was really different to anything I just tried before to get up and like walk on your own we need physical access as we need people getting out of their chairs moving my hope for the future would be to walk on my own again to be able to just go a response my confidence and welcome build a community of people who are taking their first step and we're establishing an exoskeleton access program at dublin city university to allow people with spinal cord injury stroke to access the exo when I heard about this I was like he's like hopefully give it a try and it's just brilliant I'm just delighted that I'm after getting the opportunity to do do you want to walk again you don't feel like you're walking again go and use it it's brilliant
