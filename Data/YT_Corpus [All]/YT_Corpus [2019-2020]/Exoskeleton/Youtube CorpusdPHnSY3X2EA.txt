 Exoskeletons are the stuff from the future. You see them in science fiction movies like Alien and Iron Man. But reality can be different. Exoskeleton is a Greek word for outer skeleton. The prefix exo means outside. This term is used to describe an outer skeleton of an animal, like a crab. Exoskeletons date back from the 1960s. In the 1960s the US government showed interest in a wearable robot suit to enhance the performance of a soldier. In recent days we see an increase in popularity of the use of exoskeletons. Over 60 percent of a highly skilled workforce in manufacturing industries like shipbuilding perform lifting and carrying tasks for at least a quarter of their normal work time. At Heesen our people are the core of our business. We use innovative technology to enhance the health of our workers. The biggest health risks are repetitive stress injuries. These exoskeletons are specifically designed to reduce those injuries. We are experimenting with exoskeletons that support work at and above shoulder level. They can be easily put on like a backpack. While working they still give you maximum flexibility. The exoskeleton works with a spring. The supporting force counteracts the gravitational force on the arms. When wearing the exoskeleton your arms feel balanced and weightless when your using your tools. We are testing the exoskeletons for interior building for mounting the ceilings. We are using them for building the hull for grinding and welding above shoulder level. and at the painting department for grinding. In the near future I expect that the exoskeleton will be part of the standard equipment for workers executing tasks at or above shoulder level.
