 [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] good afternoon today the topic of my presentation will be on hand exoskeletons a brief review the organization of today's lecture will be as follows first we have the definition of hand exoskeletons then we see the state-of-the-art and that too especially classification of the hand exoskeletons based on the power transmission method and then we come to the design challenges in developing a new exoskeleton which will be a novel one and then finally we conclude our lecture coming to the definition what is in hand exoskeleton and exoskeleton is a variable interactive system for the hand so it is worn by the patients or the elderly people to assist themselves there are various hand exoskeletons developed in order to help the elderly people as well as the stroke patients who have lost the control of the hand for example you can see here the exoskeletons such as hand EXO's exorcists prototype to cyber grasp and the EXO glue or the famous exoskeletons for the hand now coming to the classification of hand exoskeletons based on power transmission method there are various ways we can classify the hand exoskeletons one will be the design and the other will be controlled and the other one will be the sensors used there are several ways we can classify the exoskeletons in order to review them the method which I have chosen here in this lecture is on the classification based precisely on the power transmission method how the force is getting transferred to the fingers on what design methodology so based on the power transmission method I have classified the exoskeletons for the hand into three types the first one is the hand exoskeletons employing mechanisms that means the frames or the mechanisms for some six per mechanisms without cables and the second type is classification of the hand exoskeletons employing only cables and the third one is the classification of hand exoskeletons having both cables and mechanisms the mechanisms is the one which also includes the linkages coming to the first category which is the classification of exoskeletons and exoskeletons employing mechanisms we first start with the design that is the direct drive hand exoskeleton developed by Choi and hecho Choi which is entitled by the paper a semi direct drive hand exoskeleton using ultrasonic motors why it is called semi direct drive because they have used a six power mechanism such that excluding the four link lengths of the mechanism to link lengths forming the fifth and sixth will be from the human finger and that's why it is called semi direct drive hand exoskeleton the direct drive hand exoskeleton generally have the actuators lying on the hand part itself here in this design they have utilized the smallest possible ultrasonic motors which are having high power-to-weight ratios and I have categorized in such a way that main focus is on the number of degrees of freedom and the actuation and the sensing involved in the exoskeletons based on this classifications that is mechanisms and the other one using cables only then the exoskeletons using both cables as well as the mechanisms so in this case of the XS written developed by Choi ATL so what is the degrees of freedom how many degrees of freedom that is giving so for each finger there are four degrees of freedom possible by this exoskeleton as you can see all flexion extension of the mCP P IP and the d IP joints could be produced by this exoskeleton and also the abduction adduction of the mCP joint will also be produced by this exoskeleton and hence four degrees of freedom for each finger and the actuation is done by the ultrasonic actuators which is having as I mentioned high power-to-weight ratio and the sensing is done by force and position sensors and they have modeled this exoskeleton with the forward and inverse kinematics analysis along with the force analysis with both simulation as well as the experimentation of this proposed exoskeleton this has been modeled in the year 1999 then in the year 2007 Kawasaki it will have developed a direct-drive exoskeleton which is providing 18 degrees of freedom that is three for each finger four for thumb and two for wrist the actuation by this exoskeleton developed by Kawasaki is done by the auditory mechanism of the DC motors they have employed for the sensing four sensors have been utilized for the senses along with the angle sensors and the only thing here is it is quite heavy so that it lies down and above that the hand part is placed coming to the next model proposed by procow ETL they have developed the hand exoskeleton termed as handsome which is the hand exoskeleton with spring-operated movement enhancer that is why hand spring operated movement in answer that is definitely a spring is attached there and it has one degrees of freedom which is quite passive what this exoskeleton does is to extend to the fullest of the stroke patients who have lost the control of the hand that is for the elderly or the patients who lost the control of the hand it is always closed and that closed or fluxed completely flexible hand part of the patient is extended completely by this exoskeleton by a passive actuator which is a spring and they have used series elastic cuts to have the passive actuation and the senses utilized or force and torque senses being utilized and coming to the next hand exoskeleton developed by eggball which is called hand which is exorcists - that is hexoses prototype - exoskeleton is the one shown here they have they have already proposed the exorcist exorcists one prototype but we are seeing here that wants to 1 which is the hexoses 2 prototype of the hand exoskeleton it has degrees of freedom for totally one for each finger and it has the actuation that is under actuation by the electric motors because of all the combined flexion extension of the three joints of each digit is done by a single motor and hence it is coming under the category under actuation the sensors used here or four senses now coming to the fifth type that is the latest model which has been developed is the one which is the hand exoskeleton which has three degrees of freedom for each finger using one limb mechanism they have used a mechanism with your series elastic actuator such that both grasping as well as the manipulation can be done by this exoskeleton because of this series elastic actuation each finger will have your work volume each finger will have your work volume because if they have used only the actuator linear actuator then they will not be getting a work column rather they will be getting a straight line trajectory or curved trajectory instead of your work volume and the sensing is done by pressure sensors and the series elastic actuator as I mentioned will have a small linear actuator the motor driver which is customized by them and the spring and the potentiometer for the angle feedback now coming to the second category of handy exoskeletons that is first done by de Cicco it'll and this is the one has been developed in the Carnegie Mellon University and this exoskeleton is a one which is actuated by pneumatic Pistons via a cabling system and it has two degrees of freedom providing the natural flexion extension of the index finger with the thumb support that is the thumb is fixed here they have targeted only the index finger first so that natural finger flexion extension motion of the index finger can be obtained by this exoskeleton through pneumatic actuator and they have used two actuators that is two pneumatic actuators for having this motion of the index finger and the sensing is done through EMG signals in order to obtain the subjects intention or the patience or the wearer's intention through EMG signal recording and then coming to the exoskeleton designed are developed by VG and homel both position control and force control have been done by VG and homel in this exoskeleton development one it is basically a cable driven ex skeleton which is the Bowden cable which has the capability to both flex and extend the cables and then it has degrees of freedom that is 4 degrees of freedom per finger and hence the actuation part is very big here very huge one for this developer exoskeleton and the sensing is done by both Hall sensors and for census Hall sensor is meant for the bend sensor to get the bent angle of the mechanism and the force sensor used to have or to get the feedback force from the exoskeleton applying on the finger and the actuation is done by the DC motor through Bowden cabling systems now coming to the exoskeleton developed by Muller settle in the year 2004 it has a degrees of freedom to just one degrees of freedom for the flexion and extension case and the other one for the mCP and pap joints and this is basically the closure opening and closing of this two systems one is for the thumb another one is for the combined collective four fingers the actuation is done by electric DC motors with the cabling system and here the sensing of the system is the EMG signals to obtain of course the subjects intention now coming to the exoskeleton designed and developed by Madison and Brooker which is basically entitled under the paper which is augmented robotic device for EBA and maneuvers it has a degrees of freedom one for the prototype one and two for the prototype two this is a prototype two we are not showing the prototype point here so this prototype has two degrees of freedom and the actuation is through pneumatic muscle actuator which is the artificial actuators muscle actuators and the sensing we have the they have the force sensors to sense the force applied on the fingers then in continuation to the hand excess skeletons employing cables we have the another exoskeleton which is recently developed in 2017 by Papa I tell which is a portable exoskeleton in order to perform activities of daily living such as grasping and object manipulation so it has a degrees of freedom it is basically a glue type and it is basically has four degrees of freedom excluding the little finger here so they have the four digits considered in this exoskeleton design so it has four degrees of freedom so that flexion extension of each digit except the pinky is considered in this design and the actuation is by electric actuators with their cabling system and the sensing they have used both force and flex sensors for this exoskeleton and now coming to the another one which is quite skin to the patient that is the exoskeleton is not shown as an external device it is almost merged with the hand itself that means the exoskeleton here the hand exoskeleton is here happening or behaving as here next to skin to the patient's hand it is called X X so Glau poly and it has degrees of freedom one that is flexion extension of the index finger middle finger and the thumb that is they have done collectively for the thumb index and middle finger fluxing here that is extending here they have the activity here so that through that the cables are pulled in the dorsal side so that extension happens and they have the actuator system pulling the cable passing through the homicide to these three digits but this schematic shows only the cables passing through the dorsal side so that the actuation is done through the cabling pulling so that extension happens similarly they have the actuator pulling the cables attached to the these three thumb index and middle finger pulled for flexion motion so that's the degrees of freedom is one here for this overall entire hand exoskeleton and it is actuated by two DC motors one for flexion and another one for the extension placed in the dorsal and homicides of the hand and the sensing it used for sensors both load cells as well as pressure sensors and it is proposed by we can get all in the year 2016 and it is entitled under the paper development of a polymer based a tendon driven variable robotic exoskeleton or robotic hand in continuation to the hand exoskeleton see employing cables we have the one which is proposed by nice it´ll and this is the exoskeleton which has a degrees of freedom for that is accept the thumb actuate in the four other fingers index finger middle finger ring finger and the pinky for natural flexion extension of each finger and the actuation is done by linear actuators D Z linear actuators and the sensing we have position and four sensors in this exoskeleton developed one and this is also acting almost closed the hand part that is almost close to the hand so that it also behaves like a next skin to the user and then we come to the ex Glau which is proposed by kirsten IAM try and l3 and f allow a repeat this is proposed to by kirsten m3 and f allow he has proposed this exoskeleton which is called ex Glau and it has degrees of freedom v that is each digit has flexion extension combined Li and actuation is done by v DC linear actuators one for each as shown in the schematic the same thing it has position sensors astronomers research work has been done by professor camper in this regarding the control of the exoskeleton for the stroke patients now coming to the third and the final classification of exoskeletons implying both the cables as well as the mechanisms first is the model proposed to by Rizzoli Ethel in the year 2007 so here you can see that the degrees of freedom for this exoskeleton proposed is six degrees of freedom to track any movement of the fingertips three for the index finger and three motors for the thumb so that this mechanism can track any trajectory traced by these two fingertips and the actuation is done by the electric actuators with cables and pulleys the sensing is done with the force feedback through haptic interface now we come to the exoskeleton which is using circuit us joint s-- is the one proposed by naka Guevara et al and it has 5 degrees of freedom each finger one degrees of freedom providing the extension and flexion of this each digit and the actuator is the electric DC actuator and the senses utilized to hear or force and post instances then we have the hand excells proposed by the author I could not remember so this author has proposed this hand EXO's exoskeleton which has degrees of freedom 3 that is active 3 degrees of freedom that is for flexion extension of the mCP joint p IP joint and the d AP joint and 3 passive degrees of freedom that is 1 rotational degrees of freedom that is passive 1 rotational and 2 translational rotational translational degrees of freedom so the rotational joint 1 rotational joint is meant for the abduction adduction of the mCP joint and the two translation joints are meant for having the distance varied between the mCP joint and the PAP joint and the PAP joint and the d IP joints so that this exoskeleton can be applicable to various hand sizes that is why these 3 passive degrees of freedom are used mainly the to translational joints providing the distance between the joints that is a pap di P and P ap mCP can be varied so that this exoskeleton can be used by the patients with various hand sizes now the actuation is electric actuators with cables and pulleys with this mechanism and senses are both position and four senses finally we have the exoskeleton which is having the degrees of freedom 8/3 for the index finger and three for the collection of these three fingers that is a pinky ring finger and the middle finger and then two degrees of freedom for the thumb here precisely one motor is used for the thumb opposition that is in the CMC joint and one motor for the coupled MCP and IP joint for the thumb because the index finger and this motor this collectively these fingers have the motors respectively that is three and three for them because flexion extension of the CMC four of the mCP PAP and di P so three motors for this combination and three motors for the index fingers MCP PAP and the AP joint and two motors for the thumb so one for the thumb opposition at the CMC joint and one for the coupled MCP and IP joints flexion extension then the actuation of course is done by the electric actuators which is DC motors and the sensing here is also four senses in continuation with the exoskeleton see employing cables and mechanisms this is the exoskeleton proposed to by Agarwal little and it has been published in the IJ or or journal in the Year 2015 and this is the exoskeleton which has two degrees of freedom this is here shown only for the index finger it has two degrees of freedom one for the flexion extension of the mCP joint and the other degrees of freedom other motor is for the collective or the coupled motion of the PAP and the dep joint because it is biologically these two joints distal joint and the proximal interphalangeal joint both are coupled by the ratio that is Theta di P equal to 2 by 3 theta P IP by this biological relationship they have performed the collective or coupled actuation with 1 DC motor for the coupled p IP and the IP next we have the cyber glove which is having 5 degrees of freedom which is a highly commercial exoskeleton which is highly versatile and actuation is done by electric actuator it has force feedback through haptic interface now coming to the quick cable the difference or the comparison between the cable driven mechanism and the direct drive mechanism I see all know that the cable driven mechanism will have lightweight exoskeleton in the hand part because the actuation part will be lying in the forearm or away from the hand part whereas the direct drive mechanisms will have the actually sitting on the exoskeleton on the hand part itself and hence the system with the director mechanism will be bulkier in size and heavier in weight and the less number of actuators will be used in cable driven mechanism whereas it is more in the case of dietary mechanisms and the control becomes simpler because of the less number of motors the control is simpler in the case of director mechanism and the control is tedious in the case of the in the case of dietary mechanism it is tedious and it is simpler in the case of Jerry cable driven mechanisms and the building the cable driven actuation is easier to build and the bulky motors are not on the hand part whereas it is next to the hand part whereas the motors with high torque and the smaller size is quite difficult to get for the development of dietary mechanisms but the one possibility one solution is to use ultrasonic motors the hand part mechanical structure may be of less weight but this will be more weight in the case of dietary mechanisms now coming to the few simulations which we have done while the study of this literature review of these exoskeletons so this is the design which I have developed using pyelogram mechanisms you can see that this is the simulation showing the proxy that is the mCP joint that is C metacarpal phalangeal joint MCB join the first joint each one this is for the distal phalanx this one is for the middle felons and this pyelogram is for the proximal fellows and this is the simulation showing the mCP joint of this designed exoskeleton and this one is showing the pre IP joints simulation and this one showing only the distal joint motion of this exoskeleton and this shows the collective P IPD IP and MCB joint simulation in fluxing the hand part or the finger now coming to the other idea which is having double paragraph design the simulation showing only the mCP joint flexion shown here and this one shows the PAP joint flexion of this exoskeleton we also have developed a model based on the design by choi ethyl as I shown this is the one which is the one having six per mechanism involving two links from the human now coming to the pressing issues and design challenges so one of the most important requirement in the development of handy nice safety what are the most important requirement is safety because the developed exoskeleton link must not move in another direction must not divert its motion whereas it must coincide with the motion of the finger limbs or finger phalanx or else it may cause harm to the wearer's hand and the second one is the mechanical interface must be lightweight and portable must be the second skin to the user as I mentioned earlier it must be the second skin to the user and hence it must be lightweight and highly compacted and must be comfortable reliable and very durable must be facilitating both three finger motions and task oriented motions what is a free finger motion there's a one there's a free finger motion the exoskeleton development must be both must be facilitating both free finger motion and task-oriented motion this is a free finger motion so the fingers can be flexed very freely and this is the task oriented as you can see that the object is getting translated in order to perform a writing task with a pen that is task oriented so both free finger as well as task oriented motion must be performed by the developed exoskeleton and exoskeleton and the another thing is the range of motion must not be extended and it must be avoided by a mechanical stop by a simple mechanical stopper in the design itself then finally the very important thing is the anatomy of the human hand must be observed thoroughly before designing the hand exoskeleton as you can see that the hand exoskeleton the hand the human hand forgot first we considered the hand in such a way that coming to the anatomy of the human hand it has 19 bones 19 joints and 27 muscles moving it the human hand is moved by 19 bones 19 joints and 29 muscles there are a total of 14 Fehlings bones of the fingers of the collective five digits and five metacarpal bones meet at 14 joints and these make these fingers to move in various directions therefore the natural flexion extinction which is the normal or the common movement of the fingers is basically flexion extension whereas when we do flexion extension the abduction and adduction becomes passive so the designed or the developed the focus of the development of the exoskeleton master facilitate the natural flexion and extension of these fingers so due to which the first phase and the development of exoskeleton must be having the extraction of 3d finger motion data using motion capture system either y con or 3d max system in order to have the 3d finger motion data and from the data develop the hand exoskeleton so that the designed exoskeleton could be helpful in making on facilitating both the free finger motion and also the task oriented motion so with that notion we have developed the phobar based exoskeleton which will be discussed in the next lecture here it shows the index finger exoskeleton which is having the four bar mechanisms connected serially from the base till the distal part of the index finger and the conclusions coming to the conclusions finally with this lecture so high power-to-weight ratio actuators with affordable cost and smallify s-- are necessary to develop a lightweight and portable hand exoskeletons this observation and a deeper understanding of the human musculoskeletal functions while performing activities of daily living will enlighten the design and control of normal exoskeletons for the hand
