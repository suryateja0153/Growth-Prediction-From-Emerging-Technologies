 - The robotic uprising is happening now. Not in the future, now. The age of robots kind of snuck up on us. But that's okay, we've got nothing to be afraid of. Probably. (cinematic music) You're probably familiar with the T-800, or Terminator, from movies and TV shows. It's the ultimate symbol of the robotic uprising. But despite featuring a robot and a super intelligent AI, "Terminator" isn't really a story about robots. It's really just a retelling of "Frankenstein", with an eye towards nuclear holocaust. And Frankenstein is just a retelling of the golem myth, which predates robots by a couple thousand years. It's a story about how our creations can run amuck and destroy us if we're not careful. Later on when we started coming up with ideas for robots, these myths were a convenient fit for our fears about industrial and technological progress. But now, the real robots are here and they're nothing like these monsters from our past. So shouldn't we tell stories about the real robots all around us? (techno music) We're entering an era where robots will be all around us and will touch every aspect of our lives. Robots that do our work for us and maybe steal our jobs. Robots that ferry us from place to place and change the way we travel. Machines that are as smart or smarter then us. Or machines that care for us and form relationships with us. Robots that save our lives and robots that hold the power of life and death over us. We're going to see the places and people where this future has arrived to see if we have anything to really be afraid of. Welcome to Uprising. A new original series from Freethink. Fear not, the robots are already here.
