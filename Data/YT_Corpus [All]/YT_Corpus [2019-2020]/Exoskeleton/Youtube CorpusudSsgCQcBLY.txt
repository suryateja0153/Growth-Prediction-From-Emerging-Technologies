 [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] good afternoon today the topic of my lecture will be on the design that is optimal design and development of here three-finger exoskeleton the organization of today's lecture will be as follows first we have the introduction in that we'll be seeing quickly the objective and the motivation of this work and then the methods involved in designing the optimal hand exoskeleton the first method is finger motion capturing of the human flesh in motion and then the development of four-bar synthesis mechanism based on three proposition analysis motion synthesis of a four bar mechanism then we have the optimal four bar mechanism synthesized then we see their density resolution and finally resolving a little in series solution in object translation task coming to the introduction the objective is to understand the human finger physiology how the joints are connected how the links are connected by the joints by the physiological joints so that we design an optimal exoskeleton for the three fingers that is for index middle and thumb digits coming to the motivation followed by the accomplishments optimal design of a three finger exoskeleton to track the human finger motion accurately so that it can be used for both as a steep and rehabilitative purposes and human finger joint cannot be modeled by a single double joint because of the changing instantaneous center of rotation of the human joints and hence 4-bar mechanism based a finger exoskeleton is designed optimally in this work the kinematic model of the design excess kiloton is proposed is made or is modeled and the exoskeleton is fabricated in the rapid prototype form and then finally redundancy the solution of the design exoskeleton is performed but in this lecture we'll be seeing up to these four points that is will be seeing the optimal design and we will be seeing how the four bar mechanism can be generated based on three pole position analysis and then the kinematic model and finally the fabrication of the exoskeleton the redundancy resolution will be seen in the next lecture now coming to the methods we see that human joints is modeled in such a way that we have in general the PAP joint of the four digits is with the hinge that is the revolute joint and the mCP joint of the digits five digits are of ellipsoidal form which is shown here and the thumbs joint is that is the CMC joint carpal metacarpal phalangeal joint is made up of this shape which is the saddle shape and hence we have designed our excess keratin for these three digits based on such degrees of freedom which is finger exoskeleton having three degrees of freedom and the middle exoskeleton middle finger excess will turn also having three degrees of freedom mainly for the flexion extension and also the middle finger doing flexion extension by the thumb we have designed with four degrees of freedom where three degrees of freedom for the Kombi exoskeletons a flexion extension and one degrees of freedom for the abduction adduction hence totally we have designed an exoskeleton for these three digits with 10 degrees of freedom now comparing the human felons trajectory with that of the link made up of revolute joint and with that of the four bar mechanisms so you can see that the red trajectory is the one traced by the human feelings having the instantaneously varying joint centers and that trajectory is also traced by a link with a revolute joint that is the link with a single point joint due to which what happens here is the error is increasing because the traversing path deviates more and more as it goes till the end point whereas the same trajectory that is the desired human territory is traced by a 4-bar mechanism in that case due to the instantaneously varying center of the former mechanism we could able to pray the human desire to eject ring that is what shown here in this figure and now coming to the methods which is of tracking how the human yes so as you can see that here the markers are placed on the human finger in such a way that on the lateral surfaces of these three phalanges three markers in the form of a triangle are placed on the finger phalanges so that the subject is asked to move a flexion extension motion and then the camera which is placed on the top of this plane captures the motion that is a planar motion which is in the plane of flexion extension of the finger and those trajectories of those three markers red blue and green markers are traced in such a way that they are used to generate the 4-bar mechanism so the designed the desired four-bar mechanisms for each Phelan's is given by this notion that is for the index finger we have three four ball mechanisms that is for the proximal felons and the middle phalanx then for the distal felons so these three four bars are serially attached so that they can be meant to move the index finger in the flexion extension motion without taking the finger felons felons in a diverse to be so that precisely we can see that for the this is the figure four showing the four bar mechanism for the proximal phalanx alone and this is the figure which shows the four bar mechanism for the middle phalanx alone and this is the four bar mechanism for the distal phalanges alone and these three phalanges are serially connected to form the index finger exoskeleton this is the concept and this is a quite good idea we have to develop or to design from the previous video which I have shown here with this video so now similarly for the middle finger also we place the markers in the lateral surface as shown here and obtain the threes these three four bar mechanism attach serially and likewise for the we have four four bar mechanisms one meant for the abduction adduction motion or degrees of freedom and three more for the flexion extension of the thumb now coming to the major part of the methods which is the three point analytical motion synthesis of here former mechanism so as can be seen here due to that motion that is the Flex initiation motion of the index finger we have three decide trajectories one by the proximal phalanx and the other one by the middle phalanx and then the third one by the distal phalanx of the index finger so having these trajectories we are going to generate the four bar mechanism based on three position analytical motion synthesis method so in that we take three different points p-one from the start of the trajectory for example we consider first the proximal phalanx alone so we take this four bar this markers trajectory such that it is meant for the proximal phalanx alone so for the proximal phalanx from these trajectory from this wretched trajectory we take the start point and the middle point and then the end point these three points are taken for the three position analytical motion synthesis of a four bar mechanism that is P 1 P 2 and P 3 so now we take this diagram schematic as shown here where G 1 where L 1 l 2 and this is the coupler L 3 and then yell 4 or the link lengths of the four bar mechanism where L 1 is the ground link and L 2 is the crank link the l 4 is a rocker link and L 3 is the coupler and now we take these positions that is P 1 P 2 and P 3 these are the start intermediate and the end points from the trajectory traced by the proximal phalanx red marker then as shown in this schematic we see that V 1 vector V 1 this is vector V 1 that is pointing from point A 1 to B 1 that is vector V 1 is given by D 1 - yes as can be seen here that is equation 1 similarly vector G 1 is C 1 plus V 1 minus R 1 that is the second equation as can be seen from this schematic likewise we have C 2 that is C 2 plus D 2 minus P 2 1 P 2 1 is the vector connecting between the points P 1 2 P 2 minus P 2 1 minus D 1 minus C 1 is equal to 0 likewise C 3 minor plus D 3 minus P 3 1 and minus D 1 minus C 1 equal to 0 so the four equations how we have obtained it I have described here from the schematic then from this having the convex complex notations we can have the vectors represented by this notations which is given by the complex notations given by c II power I theta plus alpha 2 plus D e power I into Omega plus beta 2 minus P 2 1 e power I Delta 2 minus yes yi power I Omega minus C E power I theta equal to 0 similarly the equation 6 also obtained based on the complex notations of these 2 equations 3 & 4 where C D or the vector magnitudes are the magnitudes of the vector C and D respectively now coming to this equation 7 & 8 by simplifying this equations that is by taking this 2 P 2 1 and P 3 one part in the right hand side we have the equations 7 & 8 obtained from equations 5 & 6 so in continuation then we have four equations in equations nine to twelve from thee by having this representation of that is e power polar form beeper I a power plus or minus I theta equal to cos theta plus or minus I sine theta so with that representation we could have these four equations nine to twelve coming up from this two equations previously seven seven and eight then for these four equations that is that is nine to twelve we have twelve variables that is C theta alpha 2 alpha 3 D Omega beta 2 beta 3 Delta 2 Delta 3 and vectors P 2 1 and p 3 1 basically it must be small p21 and small P 3 1 ok so these are the twelve variables with those four equations and these are solved for the magnitudes theta that is magnitude C and D and angles theta and Omega so these equations four equations can be solved for this four variables that is C D theta and Omega for the vector C and D provided we give other eight parameters a priori and now in continuation so we represent from the four equations if we represent or if we assume ml equal to sine alpha minus 1 and n L equal to sine alpha 2 and O 2 equal to cos beta 2 minus 1 qul equal to sine alpha 2 FL equal to P 2 1 cos Delta 2 similarly HL equal to cos alpha 3 minus 1 il equal to sine alpha 3 JL equal to cos beta 3 minus 1 and KL equal to cos beta 3 y ll equal to P 3 1 cos Delta 3 then V L equal to P 2 1 sine Delta 2 then Omega that is WL equal to P 3 1 sine Delta 3 C 1 X is equal to C into cos theta then C 1 y equal to C into sine theta then D 1 X D 1 Y are given by D cos Omega and T casts D sine Omega respectfully then we will have a standard matrix form which is given by this equation that is matrix multiplied by a vector equal to this vector this standard matrix form will be obtained provided we assume this ml equal to this this for the previous nine to twelve four equations then we will have the magnitude by solving this matrix form we will have the magnitude C and D and the angles theta and Omega of the left diet this is the left diet that is this vector pair is the left diet this vector pair is a diet a vector pair is a diet and the 4-bar has left diet and the right diet now we have solved the magnitude for the left diet that is C and D for this vector c1 and d1 similarly theta and Omega for T that is Theta between the ground link on the crank link and Omega that is the between the x axis and e vector D one of the left diet of the four bar mechanism are obtained by solving this standard matrix form which is obtained by assuming these values for the previous equations nine to twelve then similarly we can also do the same procedure in order to get this standard matrix form for the right diet that is obtained by the vector pair or one and yes one so we can also obtain the standard form of the matrix which is given by this equation that is matrix having the members mr y NR or QR h RI rj r KR e NR m r QR or jr h RK ER and ir so we have by solving this equations this standard matrix equation we could solve for the magnitude or and yes and the angles Delta that is Sigma and Phi for this right diet which is given by this expressions are equal to root of R 1 X square plus R 1 Y square and similarly X is equal to root of s 1 X square plus y s 1 y square and Sigma and Phi are given by this expressions which is tan inverse of r1 y by r1 X and Phi equal to tan inverse of Y s 1 Y by Y s 1 X now having solved this we should also see how we could give the variables that is the alpha 3 and alpha 2 how that can be obtained because that is a value which we could able to obtain by the marker positions that is why we have taken the marker in the form of a triangle with 3 marker points red green and blue so thus having solved that try diet magnitude and the angles and the left I had magnitude and the angles for the given fixed pivot points that is o2 and o4 and the 8 parameters that is alpha 2 alpha 3 beta 2 beta 3 P 2 1 vector P 3 1 vector and the angles Delta 2 and Delta 3 fo bar linkage mechanism can be determined using the 3 position motion synthesis metrology now coming to the computation of the angles alpha 2 and alpha 3 as can be seen here we could get that alpha 3 and alpha 2 are given by 2 tan inverse off the expression which is given in terms of K 2 K 1 and K 3 likewise a 2 a 1 a 3 & a 6 in terms of beta 2 and beta 3 where these variables are the parameters are the expressions for K 1 till K 3 and a 1 till a 6 and C 1 till C 6 are given here which I can read it very fast so k 1 is equal to a 1 a 2 a 4 plus a 3 a 6 K 2 equal to a 3 a 4 plus fi a 6 similarly K 3 equal to a 1 square minus a 2 square minus a 3 square minus CA 4 square minus a square by 2 where a 1 is equal to minus C 3 square minus C 4 square and a 2 equal to C 3 C 6 minus C 4 C 5 and a Phi equal to minus C 4 C 6 minus c3 c5 similarly we go up to a 6 then we have C 1 in terms of beta 2 and eta3 - similarly it goes up to c6 thus having these eight parameters that is alpha 2 alpha 3 beta 2 beta 3 delta 2 delta 3 and p 2 1 and p 3 1 which is the vectors connecting from the point P 1 to P 2 and P 3 to P 1 we could able to have the 4-bar mechanism provided the pivot points are obtained from this user and now going to the optimal four bar mechanism so where comes the optimization so now we are going to the optimization after the three position synthesis of the four bar mechanism now we see that various optimization coming into picture so having placed the marker and the finger fell in phalanx so we want the four bar mechanism in a way that that is the optimal for ball mechanism so that the discrepancy between the desired a human trajectory that is the darker line here and the dotted line that is the trajectory traced by the four bar mechanism must be minimized that is the discrepancy between the desired human trajectory and the actual four bar coupler trajectory must be minimized that is the error here which is given by the symbol Phi and you can see that the four bar mechanism is the one which has the ground link say L 1 and the input link which is the actuated link that is the crank link L 2 then this is the coupler which is CL 3 and then we have the rocker which just follows the based on the input it rocks that is the L 4 that is the output link you can say and the input angle is Theta and the output angle is Sigma here and the dotted line is a digit desired trajectory and the the thick line is the desired trajectory and the dotted line is the trajectory of the coupler point now coming to the general optimization strategy so here we have ten design variables such that P 1 X P 1 Y similarly one go to X go to Y that is the pivot points one pivot point in the left and one pivot point in the right so we have four here 2 plus 2 4 plus this point p1 x p2 p1 y then we have the link lengths l2 l4 o that is theta and Sigma so these 10 design variables can be obtained from the general optimization strategy but the alternative smart optimization trajectory strategy is that we could have the four design variables to be obtained from the optimization methodology in such a way that by giving the input or the parameters are priori the other six parameters thus it can be having only the o2 and o4 points that a pivot points will be the design variables of the optimization output now coming to the objective function we have framed the objective function such that the discrepancy between D human path and the coupler path that's Phi equal to summation I equal to 1 to N di square where di is the discrepancy of the human point at that instant and the coupler point at that instant I and the procedures steps to get the optimal 4 bar or perform the 3 position generated motion generation by analytical synthesis using fixed pivot points that is the design variables suggested by the optimization algorithm we have used the genetic algorithm optimization technique from the matlab toolbox then evaluate the objective function then check whether the constraint is not violated and then replace the previous design by a new one that is how it continues and goes for the convergence are now coming to the kinematic model of the index finger exoskeleton having designed the three finger exit skeleton first we see the kinematic model of the index finger exoskeleton so we have design in such a way that the first 4 bar is for the proximal phalanx and the second 4 bar is for the middle phalanx and the third 4 bar is for the distal phalanx and these three are kin Ted are attached to serially as shown here in this figure on the left likewise we go for the index fingers kinematic model which is a favored kinematic equation where the XF that is the planar tip XF and XY is given by these expressions in terms of the link lengths and the angle parameters which is having Delta Sigma and alpha based on them that is for the proximal phalanx Delta Sigma and alpha and for and the middle fellings delta sigma and alpha and for the distal phalanx delta sigma and alpha for all these collectively the tip can be obtained that is xf + YF that is starting from this point we could able to reach here and then go here then from there you reach here then from there you can go here then reach here then reach here then reach the tip that is from the closed loop equation method method we could be able to reach from the start point o2 till the deposition by this former kinematic equation thus given the input theta theta d theta m and theta P that is theta P is the input angle for the proximal phalanx and theta M is the input angle for the middle felons and Tita D is the input angle for the four distal phalanx distal four bar having these four bar input angles we could be able to get the tip position that is EXIF and yif equation so apart from the Tita P theta D and theta M other parameters are the constant values now similarly for the middle finger the optimal middle finger exoskeleton is obtained by these three four bar mechanisms similarly as in the case of index finger we have the four mechanism optimal designed first for the proximal feelings then for the middle feelings and then for the distal phalanx and they are connected serially such that the optimal optimally designed serial four bar mechanism based index finger is shown here for the middle finger is XS written is shown here in the left side and then likewise for the index finger accelerated the tip for kinematic equation for the middle finger excellent tip is given here which is also the function of Sigma Delta Phi Alpha of the three four bar mechanisms that is proximal middle and distal of the middle finger finally we come for the kinematic model of the thumb exoskeleton as can be shown here the first four bar mechanism is considered for the abduction adduction motion that is given by the subscript R a by E that is abduction adduction and then we developed the second photo mechanism for the flexion extension of the same fellings then the middle phalanx four bar mechanism for the middle phalanx and then for the distal phalanx we have computed and we have designed it and hence the attachment is like this that is this four bar mechanism is in one plane and the serially connected three four bar mechanism meant for flexion extension motion is in D plane which is perpendicular to this abduction adduction four bar mechanism plane and then due to which the four bar tommix has written having four formal mechanisms meant for both abduction and flexion extension moments it has the tip motion coming in the 3d position thus it is given by x th x y th and z th given by this expression which is also based on the angles that is delta sigma and phi of these four mechanisms that is 4/4 bar mechanisms and the inputs for that is the jaw variables that is generalized to coordinate for this stomach circle Tony's theta P theta P abduction adduction and theta M theta T these four joint variables are the generalized coordinates for this term exoskeleton and now coming to the optimal parameters that is the final optimal parameters of this index finger middle finger and the thumb exoskeletons so as can be sown in the table here we have the optimal link length parameters of each four bar mechanisms that is proximal middle and distal mechanisms and everything lengths are given in the centimeters and now we can see that as you can see that simulation of the four bar serially connected for our mechanisms for the index finger exoskeleton in tracing the desired trajectory and you can see here this is the predatory of the instantaneous join center of the four bar mechanism and you can see that here you can have the trajectory compared with that of the link having this revolute link revolute joint and with the four bar mechanism with that of the human trajectory similarly we can see for that of the four bar mechanism of the middle phalanx and for the distal phalanx likewise for the taw middle finger exoskeleton we have their trajectories varying here and instantaneous trajectory of the four bar mechanism is also shown here then we have this video coming out for the middle finger exoskeleton and these are the optimal parameters of the middle finger exoskeleton then here finally the thumb exoskeleton that is for the flexion extension and also for the abduction adduction motion and thus it has four degrees of freedom and all these parameters are given here that is the link length parameters for all the four bar mechanisms totally for number of four bar figure mechanisms we have the trajectory comparison for each four were mechanisms with that of the serial and then we could also take the work volume of the four bar mechanisms for each exoskeleton that is the index finger access to the middle finger is written and the thumb exoskeleton is a 3d view both in the side view and the top view then finally we have the rapid prototype of the developed or the optimal designed three finger exoskeleton as you can see that this is made up of acrylic material the prototype is made up of acrylic material and we have the clamp also having the motor attached to these each former mechanism to have the motor attached to it and this is the complete prototype of this three finger exoskeleton designed optimally for this three fingers that is the index finger thumb and the middle finger then you can see here how the motor is attached let me closely show that here the motor shaft is attached to the motor that is a four bars input link because the input link is acting as a crank link which is going to give the angle to the mechanism and the other three other two links will that is a coupler link and the rocker link will behave in such a way that a coupler can trace the decide human trajectory so as you can see that the motor shaft is attached to the link of the crank and then this is the rocker link and we have the coupler here then this four bar mechanism that is this is the distal four bar mechanism it is placed on the just above the coupler that is this the coupler of the previous four bar mechanism that is the if this is the distal four bar mechanism then this forward mechanism is placed on the coupler of the middle four bar mechanisms and as you can see that the clamp is clearly shown here it is the clamp it's a metal element which is clamping the motor in such a way that it is attaching the top and bottom surface of the full four bar mechanism so that the planes that is this is the plane having the link and this is the plane having the coupler yeah with this we could wind up this lecture which is the optimal design and development of the three four bar based index finger middle finger and thumb baixas great and thank you [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause]
