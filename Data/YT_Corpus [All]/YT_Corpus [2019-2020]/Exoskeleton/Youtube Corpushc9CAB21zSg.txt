Our exoskeleton has an electric motor with two main functions: to maintain the knee extension during standing and to flex it only when stepping is desired. Different experts support our project. Somehow, ABLE enters another dimension, it introduces a "low cost" concept in exoskeletons It can increase the number of daily therapy sessions that we can offer to the patients during their rehabilitation process.

At ABLE we work to accomplish the dream of many
