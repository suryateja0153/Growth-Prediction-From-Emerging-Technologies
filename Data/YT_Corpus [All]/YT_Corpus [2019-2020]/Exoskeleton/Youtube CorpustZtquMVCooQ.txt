 powered exoskeleton also known as power armor powered armor powered suit EXO frame hard suit or exosuit is a wearable mobile machine that is powered by a system of electric motors pneumatics levers hydraulics or a combination of technologies that allow for limb movement with increased strength and endurance topic history the earliest-known exoskeleton like device was a set of walking jumping and running assisted apparatus developed in 1890 by a Russian named Nicholas yagan the apparatus used energy stored in compressed gas bags to assist with movements although it was passive and required human power in 1917 United States inventor Leslie C kelly developed what he called a pedo motor which operated on steam power with artificial ligaments acting in parallel to the wearer's movements with the peda motor energy could be generated apart from the user the first true exoskeleton in the sense of being a mobile machine integrated with human movements was co-developed by General Electric and the United States Armed Forces in the 1960s the suit was named Hardiman and made lifting 110 kilograms 250 pounds feel like lifting four point five kilograms 10 pounds powered by hydraulics and electricity the suit allowed the wearer to amplify the strength by a factor of 25 so that lifting 25 kilograms was as easy as lifting one kilogram without the suit a feature dubbed force feedback enabled the wearer to feel the forces and objects being manipulated while the general idea sounded somewhat promising the Hardiman had major limitations it was Impractical due to its 680 kilogram 1,500 pounds weight another issue was that it is a master/slave system where the operator is in a master suit which in turn is inside the slave suit that responds to the master and handles the workload this multiple physical layer type of operation may work fine but responds slower than a single physical layer when the goal is physical enhancement response time matters it's slow walking speed of 0.76 meters per second 2.5 feet per second further limited practical uses the project was not successful any attempt to use the full exoskeleton resulted in a violent uncontrolled motion and as a result it was never tested with a human in sight further research concentrated on one arm although it could lift its specified load of 340 kilograms 750 pounds it weighed three quarters of a ton just over twice the liftable load without getting all the components to work together the practical uses for the Hardiman project were limited early active exoskeletons and humanoid robots were developed at the Mahalo poopin Institute in 1969 under the guidance of Professor my mere vuko beretta vich leg locomotion systems were developed first theories of these systems were developed in the same Institute in the frame of active exoskeletons active exoskeletons were predecessors of the modern high-performance humanoid robots the present-day active exoskeletons are developed as the systems for enhancing capabilities of the natural human skeletal system the most successful version of an active exoskeleton for rehabilitation of paraplegics and similar disabled persons pneumatically powered and electronically programmed was realized and tested at belgrade orthopedic clinic in 1972 one specimen was delivered to the Central Institute for traumatology and orthopedics in the frame of the USSR Yugoslav interstate scientific cooperation from 1991 the exoskeleton belongs to the basic fund of Polytechnic Museum Moscow and State Museum fund of Russian Federation it is displayed in the frame of the museum's exposition dedicated to the development of automation and cybernetics Los Alamos laboratory x' worked on an exoskeleton project in the 1960s called Project Pittman in 1986 an exoskeleton prototype called the LIF es uit was created by Monte Reed a United States Army Ranger who had broken his back in a parachute accident while recovering in the hospital he read Robert Heinlein's science fiction novel Starship Troopers and from Heinlein's description of mobile infantry power suits he designed the L IFE Sui T and wrote letters to the military about his plans for the L IFE Sui T in 2001 L IFE Sui t1 LS I was built in 2003 ls6 was able to record and playback a human gate in 2005 LS 12 was worn in a foot race known as the st. Patrick's Day - in Seattle Washington Monte Reed and Li Fe Sui t12 set the land speed distance record for walking in robot suits LS 12 completed the 4.8 kilometres three miles race in 90 minutes the current L IFE Sui T prototype 14 can walk 1.6 kilometers one mile on a full charge and lift 92 kilograms 203 pounds for the wearer in January 2007 Newsweek magazine reported that the Pentagon had granted development funds to a nanotechnologist ray Borman of the University of Texas at Dallas to develop military-grade artificial electroactive polymers these electrically contractive fibers are intended to increase the strength to weight ratio of movement systems in military powered armor topic applications you topic medical powered exoskeletons can improve the quality of life of persons who have lost the use of their legs enabling system assisted walking or restoration of other motor controls lost due to illness or accidental injury such devices can also help nurses and others doing medical care Japanese engineers have developed exoskeletons designed to help nurses lift and carry patients the technology could help adapt to the growing number of people in elderly care and the need for more medical professionals exoskeletons can also help with rehabilitation of stroke or spinal cord injury patients such exoskeletons are sometimes also called step rehabilitation robots an exoskeleton could reduce the number of therapists needed by allowing even the most impaired patient to be trained by one therapist whereas several are currently needed also training would be more uniform easier to analyze retrospectively and can be specifically customized for each patient at this time there are several projects designing training aids for rehabilitation centers Lopes exoskeleton locker mat modular robotic exoskeleton unique so capi oh and the gait trainer h al v rehabilitation exoskeletons can be configured such that they provide a minimal amount of assistance aiding a patient's efforts to a limited extent and thus providing a rigorous targeted therapy session Ekso bionics of richmond california has developed the EXO GT which incorporates this ability the smart asus software allows physical therapists to vary the support of the device for each leg independently from full power to free walking and thereby meet the specific needs of patients this capability enables the EXO GT to rehabilitate a larger range of patients from those too weak to walk to those who are nearly independent the exo GT is also the first exoskeleton to be approved by the FDA for stroke patients German research center for artificial intelligence developed two general-purpose powered exoskeletons capi oh and vai BOTS they also considered human false sensitivities in the design and operation phases teleoperation and power amplification was said to be the first applications but after recent technological advances the range of application fields is said to have widened increasing recognition from the scientific community means that this technology is now employed in to lemon Appalachian man amplification neuro motor control research and rehabilitation and to assist with impaired human motor control wearable robots biomechatronics exoskeletons the medical field is another prime area for exoskeleton technology where it can be used for enhanced precision during surgery or as an assist to allow nurses to move heavy patients topic military there are an increasing number of applications for an exoskeleton such as decreased fatigue and increased productivity whilst unloading supplies or enabling a soldier to carry heavy objects 40 to 300 kilograms while running or climbing stairs not only could a soldier potentially carry more weight presumably they could wield heavier armor and weapons while lowering their metabolic rate or maintaining the same rate with more carry capacity some models use a hydraulic system controlled by an onboard computer they could be powered by an internal combustion engine batteries or potentially fuel cells topic civilian in civilian areas exoskeletons could be used to help firefighters and other rescue workers survive dangerous environments topic industry over the last decades the exoskeleton technology has been wide spreading in the industrial and manufacturing framework workers are heavily exposed to physical work load due to lifting tasks repetitive movements and non-economic postures in addition the aging of the workforce population is rapidly increasing and older workers are the most sensitive to work-related musculoskeletal diseases w MSD wearable robotics has the potential to lower the physical effort of workers and to decrease the occurrence of W MSD thus reducing the healthcare costs for companies many companies have started to commercialize industrial exoskeletons these systems can be categorized into two categories exoskeletons for upper limb for assisting shoulder flexion extension movements exoskeletons for lumber support for assisting manual lifting tasks topic products topic current products ReWalk reward features powered hip and knee motion to enable those with lower limb disabilities including paraplegia as a result of spinal cord injury sigh to perform self-initiated standing walking and stair ascending and descending Sarcos Raytheon XO s exoskeleton arms and legs

development Ekso bionics is currently developing and manufacturing intelligently powered exoskeleton Bionic devices that can be strapped on as wearable robots to enhance the strength mobility and endurance of soldiers and paraplegics various problems remain to be solved the most daunting being the creation of a compact power supply powerful enough to allow an exoskeleton to operate for extended periods without being plugged in to external power and the exoskeleton not limiting the users flexibility and mobility an exosuit with a web structure called warrior web was designed to improve a soldier's ability to carry loads and reduce injury risk the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency dar PA launched the warrior web program in September 2011 the suit featured pulleys and gears designed to mitigate risks of musculoskeletal injuries and fatigue of soldiers warrior web worked by imparting joint torque at the ankle knee and hip joints from 2014 to 2017 the Army Research Laboratory was tasked with testing the prototype at the performance and equipment Advanced Research Facility at Aberdeen Proving Ground MD during tarce k9 prototype warrior web systems were tested on soldiers over 21 weeks during the first phase of the program tasks be aimed to develop a scuba like under suit to aid in preventing injury and fatigue the goal of task B was also to utilize sensor technology in the under suit to monitor soldier health the system was tested using a multi camera motion capture system to determine any changes in gait or balance a cardiopulmonary exercise testing device measures oxygen consumption and a variety of census collected force acceleration and muscle activity data on the test subject topic limitations and design issues engineers of powered exoskeletons faced a number of large technological challenges to build a suit that is capable of quick and agile movements yet is also safe to operate without extensive training topic power supply one of the biggest problems facing engineers and designers of powered exoskeletons is the power supply there are currently few power sources of sufficient energy density to sustain a full body powered exoskeleton for more than a few hours non-rechargeable primary cells tend to have more energy density and store it longer than rechargeable secondary cells but then replacement cells must be transported into the field for use when the primary cells are depleted of which may be a special and uncommon type rechargeable cells can be reused but may require transporting a charging system into the field which either must recharge rapidly or the depleted cells need to be able to be swapped out in the field to be replaced with cells that have been slowly charging further chemical reactions can occur between substances used in rechargeable batteries such as lithium with atmospheric oxygen in the event of a battery being damaged resulting in fire or explosion recent research by John Gooden oh and a team at the University of Texas at Austin into glass battery technology is highly applicable to exoskeletal power research as these batteries benefit from a solid-state electrolyte and improved energy density compared to traditional rechargeable cells internal combustion engine power supplies offer high energy output but they also typically eyeball or continue to operate at a low power level sufficient to keep the engine running when not actively in use which continuously consumes fuel battery based power sources are better at providing instantaneous and modulated power stored chemical energy is conserved when load requirements cease engines that do not idle are possible but require energy storage for a starting system capable of rapidly accelerating the engine to full operating speed and the engine must be extremely reliable and never fail to begin running immediately small and lightweight engines typically must operate at high speed to extract sufficient energy from a small engine cylinder volume which both can be ethical to silence and induces vibrations into the overall system internal combustion engines can also get extremely hot which may require additional weight from cooling systems or heat shielding electrochemical fuel cells such as solid oxide fuel cells SOFC are also being considered as a power source since they can produce instantaneous energy like batteries and conserve the fuel source when not needed they can also easily be refueled in the field with liquid fuels such as methanol however they require high temperatures to function 600 degrees Celsius is considered a low operating temperature for SOFCs as of 2015 most research designs are tethered to a much larger separate power source for a powered exoskeleton that will not need to be used in completely standalone situations such as a battlefield soldier this limitation may be acceptable and the suit may be designed to be used with a permanent power umbilical this is particularly useful in logistical support and some industrial areas topic skeleton initial exoskeleton experiments are commonly done using inexpensive and easy to mold materials such as steel and aluminium however steel is heavy and the powered exoskeleton must work harder to overcome its own weight in order to assist the wearer reducing efficiency the aluminium alloys used a lightweight but fail through fatigue quickly it would be unacceptable for the exoskeleton to fail catastrophically in a high load condition by folding up on itself and injuring the wearer as the design moves past the initial exploratory steps the engineers move to progressively more expensive and strong but lightweight materials such as titanium and use more complex component construction methods such as molded carbon-fiber plates topic actuators the powerful but lightweight design issues are also true of the joint actuators standard hydraulic cylinders are powerful and capable of being precise but they are also heavy due to the fluid filled hoses and actuator cylinders and the fluid has the potential to leak on to the user pneumatics are generally too unpredictable for precise movement since the compressed gas is springy and the length of travel will vary with the gas compression and the reactive forces pushing against the actuator pressurized hydraulic fluid leaks can be dangerous to humans a jet squirting from a pinhole leak can penetrate skin at pressures as low as 100 psi 6.9 bars if the injected fluid is not surgically removed gangrene and poisoning can occur generally electronic servo motors are more efficient and power dense utilizing high gauss permanent magnets and step-down gearing to provide high torque and responsive movement in a small package geared servo motors can also utilize electronic braking to hold in a steady position while consuming minimal power additionally new series elastic actuators and other deformable actuators are being proposed for use in robotic exoskeletons based on the ideas of control of stiffness in human limbs pneumatic artificial muscles are a new technology in pneumatic actuators in this actuator the volume of the cylinder changes aiding performance according to thermodynamic principles a similar artificial muscle is the air muscle also known as the braided pneumatic actuator a lightweight and very flexible design that is more powerful than any other type of pneumatic actuator mechanical advantage devices such as levers and pulleys are also being used as actuators but it has not yet been proven that they can actually increase strength or reduce fatigue topic joint flexibility flexibility of the human anatomy is another design issue which also affects the design of unpowered hardshell spacesuits several human joints such as the hips and shoulders are ball and socket joints with the center of rotation inside the body it is difficult for an exoskeleton to exactly match the motions of this ball joint using a series of external single axis hinge points limiting flexibility of the wearer a separate exterior ball joint can be used alongside the shoulder or hip but this then forms a series of parallel rods in combination with the wearer's bones as the external ball joint is rotated through its range of motion the positional length of the knee elbow joint will lengthen and shorten causing joint misalignment with the wearer's body this slip in suit alignment with the wearer can be permitted all the suit limbs can be designed to lengthen and shorten under power-assist as the wearer moves to keep the knee elbow joints in alignment a partial solution for more accurate free access movement is a hollow spherical ball joint that encloses the human joint with the human joint as the center of rotation for the hollow sphere rotation around this joint may still be limited unless the spherical joint is composed of several plates that can either fan out or stack up onto themselves as the human ball joint moves through its full range of motion spinal flexibility is another challenge since the spine is effectively a stack of limited motion ball joints there is no simple combination of external single axis hinges that can easily match the full range of motion of the human spine a chain of external ball joints behind the spine can perform a close approximation though it is again the parallel bar length problem leaning forward from the waist the suit shoulder joints would press down into the wearer's body leaning back from the waist the suit shoulder joints would lift off the wearer's body again this alignment slop with the wearer's body can be or the suit can be designed to rapidly lengthen or shorten the exoskeleton spine under power assist as the wearer moves topic NASA ax5 hardshell spacesuit the NASA Ames Research Center experimental ax5 hardshell spacesuit 1988 had a flexibility rating of 95 percent compared to what movements are possible while not wearing the suit it is composed of gasketed hardshell sections joined with free rotating mechanical bearings that spin around as the person moves however the free rotating hard sections have no limit on rotation and can potentially move outside the bounds of joint limits it requires high precision manufacturing of the bearing surfaces to prevent binding and the bearings may jam if exposed to lunar dust topic power control and modulation control and modulation of excessive and unwanted movement is a third large problem it is not enough to build a simple single speed assist motor with forward hold reverse position controls and no onboard computer control such a mechanism can be too fast for the users desired motion with the assisted motion overshooting the desired position if the wearer's body is enclosed with simple contact surfaces that trigger suit motion the overshoot can result the wearer's body lagging behind the suit limb position resulting in contact with a position sensor to move the exoskeleton in the opposite direction this lagging of the wearer's body can lead to an uncontrolled high-speed oscillatory motion and a powerful assist mechanism can batter or injure the operator unless shut down remotely an underdamped servo typically exhibits oscillations like this a single speed assist mechanism which is slowed down to prevent oscillation is then restrictive on the agility of the wearer sudden unexpected movements such as tripping or being pushed over requires fast precise movements to recover and prevent falling over but a slow assist mechanism may simply collapse and injure the user inside this is known as an overdamped servo fast and accurate assistive positioning is typically done using a range of speeds controlled using computer position sensing of both the exoskeleton and the wearer so that the assistive motion only moves as fast or as far as the motion of the wearer and does not overshoot or undershoot this is called a critically damped servo this may involve rapidly accelerating and decelerating the motion of the suit to match the wearer so that their limbs slightly press against the interior of the suit and then it moves out of the way to match the wearer's motion the computer control also needs to be able to detect unwanted oscillatory motions and shutdown in a safe manner if damage to the overall system occurs topic detection of unsafe invalid motions a fourth issue is detection and prevention of invalid or unsafe motions which is managed by an onboard real-time computational self collision detection system it would be unacceptable for an exoskeleton to be able to move in a manner that exceeds the range of motion of the human body and tear muscle ligaments or dislocate joints this problem can be partially solved using designed limits on hinge motion such as not allowing the knee or elbow joints to flex backwards onto themselves however the wearer of a powered exoskeleton can additionally damage themselves or the suit by moving the hinge joints through a series of combined and otherwise valid movements which together caused the suit to collide with itself or the wearer a powered exoskeleton would need to be able to computationally track live positions and limit movement so that the wearer does not casually injure themselves through unintended assistive motions such as when coughing sneezing when startled or if experiencing a sudden uncontrolled seizure or muscle spasm topic pinching and joint fouling an exoskeleton is typically constructed of very strong and hard materials while the human body is much softer than the alloys and hard plastics used in the exoskeleton human skin is also covered with hair over the majority of the surface area an exoskeleton typically cannot be worn directly in contact with bare skin due to the potential for skin and hair pinching wear the exoskeleton plates and servos slide across each other instead the wearer may be enclosed in a heavy fabric suit to protect them from joint pinch hazards current exoskeleton joints themselves are also prone to environmental fouling from sand and grit and may need protection from the elements to keep operating effectively a traditional way of handling this is with seals and gaskets around rotating parts but can also be accomplished by enclosing the exoskeleton mechanics in a tough fabric suit separate from the user which functions as a protective skin for the exoskeleton this enclosing suit around the exoskeleton can also protect the wearer from pinched hazards topic adaptation to user size variations most exoskeletons pictured in this article typically show a fixed length distance between joints but humans exhibit a wide range of physical size differences and skeletal bone lengths saw a one-size-fits-all fixed size exoskeleton would not work although military use would generally use only larger adult sizes civilian use may extend across all size ranges including physically disabled babies and small children there are several possible solutions to this problem a wide range of fixed sized exoskeletons can be constructed stored and issued to each differently sized user this is materially expensive due to the wide variety of different sizes of users but may be feasible where only one person is ever expected to use the exoskeleton such as when one is issued to a physically disabled person for their personal mobility exoskeletons in a wartime service would be custom sized to the user and not shareable making it difficult to supply the wide range of repair parts needed for the many different possible model sizes the users can be required to be of a specific physical size in order to be issued an exoskeleton physical body size restrictions already occur in the military for jobs such as aircraft pilots due to the problems of fitting seats and controls to very large and very small people adjustable length exoskeleton limbs and frames can be constructed allowing size flexibility across a range of users due to the large variety of potential user bone lengths it may still be necessary to have several adjustable exoskeleton models each covering certain size ranges such as one model only for people that are 1.5 to two point one meters 5 to 7 feet tall a further difficulty is that not only is there variation in bone lengths but also limb girth due to bone geometry muscle build fat and any user clothing layerings such as insulation for extreme cold or hot environments an exoskeleton will generally need to fit the users limb girth snugly so that their arms and legs are not loose inside and flopping around an oversized exoskeleton cavity also tight that the user's skin is lesion from abrasion from a too-small exoskeleton cavity again this can be handled in a military environment by requiring certain degrees of muscle density and body fitness of the potential users so that exoskeletons designed for a particular limb girth will fit the majority of soldiers many people would be excluded due to incompatible thin or thick bodies even if they are within the correct height range a rigid shell exoskeleton may be able to use an adjustable suspension harness within the shell the rigid outer shell still imposes a maximum girth but may be able to accommodate many smaller girths inside a fully enclosing flexible armored exoskeleton using small overlapping sections sliding plates could dynamically expand and contract the overlap distance of its many outer plates both to adapt to the wearer's limb length and girth and as the plates move in coordination with the wearer's body in general use topic Health and Safety as of 2018 the u.s. Occupational Safety and Health Administration was not preparing any safety standards for exoskeletons the International Organization for Standardization published a safety standard in 2014 and ASTM International was working on standards to be released beginning in 2019 topic see also Berkeley lower-extremity exoskeleton Ekso bionics Future Force Warrior Hardiman list of emerging technologies list of films featuring powered exoskeletons mecha walk truck also known as the cybernetic anthropomorphise machine
