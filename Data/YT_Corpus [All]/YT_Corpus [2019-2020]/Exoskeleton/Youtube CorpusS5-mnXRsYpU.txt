 This project is back on we've secured a sponsorship from World of Tanks for the next three episodes of the Power loader Which means we also promised to have this thing moving around within those three episodes i'm gonna have a chat with Matt Oehrlein co-founder of Megabots incorporated I'm going to travel to British Columbia to meet with Jonathan Tippett We're going to use... -LEGS! -TREADS! Hey guys welcome to a new episode of our Aliens Power loader build the project that has most of you wondering Are they still working on that? I know, I know, our upload schedule for this project has been sporadic to say the least We started at christmas 2018 and worked on it for about half a year and then stopped Why? Well because we got this awesome new facility which arguably we kind of need for building a giant 10-foot mech it wouldn't really have fit in the old garage Then we started up again beginning of this year 2020 a year for the record books and obviously it got shut down again along with the whole world When the pandemic started  we had to send everyone to work from home and as you can imagine it's kind of hard to build a giant mech at home so it got put on hold again Now, the team has been back for about a month or so but we've been hesitant to start this project again as we mentioned it's one of our most expensive endeavors ever and like many businesses we did take a pretty big financial hit due to the pandemic Luckily things in canada are getting better and i'm excited to say this project is back on! And we've secured a sponsorship from World of Tanks for the next three episodes of the Power loader World of Tanks is an epic free-to-play historically accurate war game that makes you feel like a real tank commander roll out across open fields climb steep hills tear across deserts sneak through forests and pick your battles in industrial zones devise your battle plan and rally your teammates to destroy the competition in over 40 battle arenas this sponsorship means... ...we also promised to have this thing moving around within those three episodes The way I see it we have two options: We can either build it just like the movie and give it giant hydraulic legs Or we can build it like the militarized version of the Power loader  which is in both the comics and the video games Now both of these options are going to be complicated expensive  and difficult to do So before we decide I think we should talk to the experts of giant mech building So i'm going to travel to British Columbia to meet with Jonathan Tippett the founder, president and CTO of Furrion Exobionics in Vancouver Let's go! Welcome to Furrion Exobionics where we're developing giant all-terrain mech suits using our advanced exoskeletal technology to bring you the next frontier in human skill So we're here at Cheekeye ranch with the Furrion racing mech and Jonathan Tippett As you know we're building the Aliens Power loader - Yes something i'm very excited about And as the foremost leader in hydraulic mech and hydraulic leg technologies in the world I thought i'd ask you a few questions about how this thing even works and if it's even possible to build a bipedal Power loader - Yes it is possible I can tell you with our technology we could do it but it would take a while and it would take a few bucks We opted for four legs in our journey to prototype this technology because it's just vastly easier to have four legs to work with It lets you lift one to take a step without falling over It's a Power loader it's supposed to pick up and carry things like a forklift so even if you can balance on two legs What happens when you then take a load? Your center of gravity shifts and suddenly you have to walk in a completely different way One of the drills that we've evolved to after three years of training and development is trying to balance on two legs even with this simplified machine if you were to embark upon trying to make a bipedal walking machine of that scale it would be a significant R&D project there's a reason they put treads on things So anyway I'm already here Think I can uh, take it for a spin? Oh you want to get drained up in this beast Well yeah I think this would probably be my best bet at learning how to pilot a hydraulic mech Yeah absolutely man I mean this will give you the sort of initial sense of what it's like to be that high and to have command of that kind of heavy machinery at the tips of your fingers so yeah we'll strap you in here we'll strap you in here You heard it here first make sure you subscribe to Furrion exobionics I've linked it in the description below because i'm going to be learning how to pilot this thing and walk it around Thanks Jonathan - Hey good luck man, I can't wait Big thank you to our sponsor World of Tanks for bringing this project back to life in addition to being completely free to play it's also completely free to win this game relies solely on skill to win battles not money whether you're a novice or a pro you'll have a blast with the other 100 million players who share the same passion for tank warfare new players can use the code tanktastic to get a t-127 tank 500 gold and 7 days premium access Just click on my link below to get world of tanks absolutely free While James is in Vancouver interviewing Jonathan Tippett it's my turn to travel down to San Francisco and meet with Matt Oehrlein co-founder of Megabots incorporated Just kidding... ...thanks a lot pandemic looks like I'm going to be doing a zoom call instead Hey Matt, thanks for taking the time to speak with us today - Yeah my pleasure So as you may or may not know we here at Hacksmith industries are currently building an Aliens Power loader we've got the upper body built and now we're trying to figure out what to do for the lower body and as far as I understand you guys went through the same decision with your two robots Yeah I mean plain and simple we went with tracks because it's sort of a proven mode of locomotion you can buy off the shelf components and you can basically get your robot operating and moving much more quicker than spending the resources to get legs working it's very very difficult to make a walking robot that is dynamically stable we're really youtubers and we make entertainment we're not boston dynamics, right? We can't spend the next 10 years developing a custom motion system to get this robot to move What about treads? Yeah the main difficulty with treads is it doesn't look as cool which is a detriment when you're building an entertainment company they do allow an easy mode of control because really there's just two actuators and you make both actuators go forward when you want to go forward and you can apply them in opposite directions when you want the robot to pivot we did get the performance we were looking for in our track system for the robot to be able to navigate most standard environments a little bit of hills and be able to pick up and interact with cars so I would call our treads on Eagle Prime a success So in conclusion if you were building the Power loader what do you think would give us the absolute best mobility for our money I wouldn't even look at doing legs I would go straight to tracks you're going to get the most power the most simplicity and capability for your money Alright Matt well thanks for taking your time to talk with us about legs vs treads I wish you all the best What's next in line for Megabots? We're still building big crazy things on the Megabots Youtube channel and I've got some collaborations with Jörg from the slingshot channel - Hello and welcome to the slingshot channel Where we're doing some projectile launching weapons as well So what you're saying is that once the Power loader is done you're gonna give us everything we need to militarize it I think we might have something for you Awesome, all right well best of luck on that and we'll talk to you again soon! Alright thanks a bunch Bogdan Alright so I talked to Jonathan from Furrion Exobionics And I talked to Matt from Megabots And based on our research we've compiled the following pros and cons list And now we know without a doubt what we're going to use for the Power loader We're going to use: -TREADS! -LEGS! Wait- No we should be using legs we definitely need legs if we don't do legs they're going to complain okay but you know what i'd rather get the project done and actually have it moved and be really unstable and really expensive Just kidding we actually decided on tank treads a long time ago pretty much at the beginning of the project because there are just way too many caveats with using hydraulic legs and if you were paying attention So to try and help fund the build I've designed a new t-shirt that i think you guys are really really going to like Anyway the real question here is where are we going to get treads from? I'm on it I don't think these are the tracks we're looking for What a weird tank doesn't have treads Hey guys, do you guys know where treads are? Did I mention World of Tanks has a huge arsenal of tanks including artillery light tanks heavy tanks and medium tanks just like this one there's over 550 different tanks to try out use my code tanktastic to get a special bonus in-game try World of Tanks today using my link below Back to you Bogdan That's perfect! Why did I wait here? Alright, alright I got it we're gonna use the treads from a compact track loader That could work... ...but how much is that gonna cost me? About a quarter what legs would have Yeah I guess that's I guess that's good Basically we get our skid steer get rid of this we're not gonna need that bucket anymore don't need that bam we've got our track base and then we take our Power loader get rid of the legs a little bit of super glue stick that right on there and bam we've got our tracked Power loader Alright it looks like we have our work cut out for us in the next episode we're gonna have to buy a bobcat strip it down and start designing for our Power loader with tank treads plus since it's sponsored by World of Tanks we're also gonna be mounting a cannon to it and driving it around like a remote controlled tank if you guys want to help support this project and our channel check out hacksmith.store to buy our awesome t-shirt
