  We are here in Nissan Barcelona where we assemble the parts of the cars. There are some work stations where the operator needs to work with their hands in an overhead position. This can result in stress of the muscles, and we are in charge of finding solutions to improve this condition. In Spain we have the Catalunya Automotive Cluster which is composed of a group of companies working together to improve the current conditions of the industry. They have a project to introduce the exoskeletons to the automotive industry and we saw the chance to gather with them to collaborate. The exoskeletons help us to reduce the muscular efforts during certain operations. This results in less fatigue for the operator. The first time I put on the exoskeleton it was a strange sensation, but as I carried on working it felt more and more practical to have my arms supported. There are various models, but I found one that was the most practical, and in the end the most comfortable to work with. After the trials we found that with the use of the device, we can reduce up to 60% of muscular effort. At Nissan we have a lot of new technologies that are used in our cars, so we want to also use new technologies for our employees. We have been trying these new technologies with very good results.
