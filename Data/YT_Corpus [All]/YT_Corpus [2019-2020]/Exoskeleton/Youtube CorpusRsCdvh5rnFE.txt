 completing the LA Marathon is a lofty goal for anyone and an athlete paralyzed from the waist down is taking on the challenge he's setting out this weekend to finish all 26.2 miles of the race will take nearly two days for him here's CBS 2's joy Benedict with his incredible journey it is a sound synonymous with fresh starts as the city gears up for the LA Marathon there is one runner preparing a different way team Adam gorlitsky is driving the course first that's gonna be the hardest part this whole thing if I'm not careful they can really kind of started where it where where my wrists you see gorlitsky won't be running at all he is paralyzed from the waist down but this weekend he is ditching his wheelchair and trading it in for a robotic exoskeleton so it's man meets machine he's worn it before 34 times in 34 Road races over the last three years in fact we first met gorlitsky two years ago when he walked the last five miles of the surf city marathon but this time there is a new challenge this is my first full marathon all 26.2 miles beginning from the stadium to Santa Monica 26.2 miles isn't easy and it certainly isn't fast that's why Adam is actually starting his marathon on Friday night I think I can finish it 36 hours and 30 minutes a personal journey for an athlete that knows the value of every step fell asleep at the wheel for 3 to 5 seconds an accident that took so much 13 years ago what I'm standing and walking in my ReWalk robotics no skeleton I don't feel disabled but I don't feel like able-bodied I feel what I call reenable technology that forces him to use different muscles to move forward my abdominal muscles and hips initiate the actual movement and then the exoskeleton physically moves my leg for me it isn't fast about 1.2 miles an hour so he will walk throughout the night Friday and Saturday and despite being awake for more than 30 hours before the official race begins he knows when the others hit the pavement he will find new strength you have 30,000 people running past you cheering you on it's kind of uh I mean it's impossible not to feel you need to get amped up for that and for a few hours feel the freedom of new legs and then the satisfaction that only comes with the finish joy banished cbs2 news
