 My hypothesis of that is, is correct in the sense that if we do have these very, very intelligent machines that can tell us the solutions to our problems, you know, it will be better for humanity. Oh, absolutely. Yes I absolutely agree with you. I mean, a lot of the things that, go wrong with, with humans with human life is. Because of the limitations that we have. I mean, yes, we, when I say limitations, obviously it's fantastic that we have the ability to think and reason the way we do, but, you know, evolution, didn't design us as rational machines. We started off animals and, you know, it's more our rationality getting our. sort of desires to rape and pillage under control, you know, which, which is kind of where the animal kingdom really comes from. I mean, that's, you know, the reality of it. So AIs aren't going to have these inherent, you know, limitations in terms of being able to think clearly and there are a couple of categories that I think are really holding us back as in humanity. And one of them is emotional responses. You know, when something happens, we tend to respond emotionally and, you know, often use 9/11 as an example, you know, you just want to hit back at somebody, something, you know, it doesn't, it doesn't really matter whether that person or that country is to blame or whatever, but you know, you just, yeah, we've got to do something, you know, so that emotional response, so that that's something that an AI would not inherently have unless you very specifically programmed that, which you wouldn't really, it wouldn't be any point in doing that.
