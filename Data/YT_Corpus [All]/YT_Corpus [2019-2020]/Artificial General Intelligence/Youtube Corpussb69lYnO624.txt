 [Music] maybe maybe you had a little chance this morning or you were here yesterday you've probably seen some of the artwork that's around some video installations or if you were at presentations and performances last night in this very room you would have seen some of the programming that Alex Chet Burtynsky and I curated for the i/o arts program at i/o this year so we're gonna have a little conversation today and I just wanted to introduce myself and talk a little bit about the you know to set up some context for the for the program and then we'll get to some conversation with artists which I know we're all looking forward to so then as I mentioned there are some installations and performances that were curated for the i/o arts program a lot of the work has to do with program artists that use artificial intelligence and we have two of them here with us today Cedric kiefer from informative who's installation is out here on the boardwalk you may have seen it meandering river and Sue Gwen Chung whose performance was last night and whose work is hanging here so please a round of applause for both of them cédric and sting we're not gonna give some presentations on their work and then we'll get into conversation about about that right thank you guys thank you yeah I will start right away thanks for having me and it's it's a great pleasure to speak in front of such an audience and I want to talk a little bit about our work our practice and when I talk about our practice what I mean by that or if I have to describe it in one short sentence I would usually say that we are searching for new ways of creative expression and we do that by using technology and to give a little bit of a background where I'm coming from or where informative the studio I'm running is coming from about 10 years ago we co published the generative design book and for us that has always been the starting point and since then our work has always been focusing around digital art using code and using technology to create art and design and what I want to talk about today though is more what inspiration and improvisation actually means in such a set up in a technology driven set up but also in general because if you look back improvisation plays an important role in in arts in general in totally different disciplines so for example looking at graphical scores in classical music composition is a really good example of how people start to think about how they can foster improvisation by creating visually abstract graphical scores they leave a lot of room for interpretation so they started to develop tools to actually come up with something new to create moments of yeah chance and I think that's really interesting but it is not only happening in in classical music performance and dance is another case where such a thing exists for example improvisation technologies by William Forsythe developed in the 90s where he started to actually come up with an imaginary system of rules it's kinda like a toolset for him to improvise so he was thinking about lines and and boxes imaginary once and he started to interact with them by either avoiding em or or following them I think that's a really interesting thought and we have been using technology in a similar way we use it to get inspiration and to do things differently because I think that's what it's about when you want to search for new ways of visual expression you have to do things differently and as a studio we're not really focused on a specific media which means we create work that ranges from interactive art installations to kinetic sculptures but also work that is purely visual this is a project that I want to talk a little bit about more it's a collide something that we did a few years ago a digital art piece which is based on the idea of visualizing dance and motion and like we do it with a lot of projects we started with researching exploring writing software writing code and tools and trying to understand how actually energy flows through the body and during the work and time you spend with the dancers and performers that we tracked so we used motion tracking to actually detect their movement and use that as an input for the art piece and one thing that they always mentioned and brought up during their rehearsals is the fact that at one point as a performer you get lost in what you do you get lost in the performance you are in the zone everything blurs and and we we really like the idea of actually exploring how energy actually expands and flows into the space and at this point we started to interpret this greens actually as a window into that abstract world so what you see here is our interpretation of what it feels like if you get lost in a performance in a creative process and yeah you see parts of bodies coming towards the screen becoming a little bit more concrete and then also quickly disappearing again but I don't want to talk much about the visual side of this project but I want to talk the music side because for this piece we also want to create a powerful sound scape and we thought a lot about what the best way would be to do that so instead of handing like the visuals over to a sound designer and just ask him to come like do some sound on top we want to make sure that we actually stay true to the concept which is actually being immersed and being totally focused and at the same time we also wanted to actually foster this moment of yeah creativity inspiration improvisation and for that purpose we actually invited three cello players and put VR classes on their hats and put them into that virtual world so they were actually being present in that virtual world at different positions and we're actually improvising and reacting to everything that happened in front of their eyes the moment it happened and we recorded that and use that as the base for the soundscape so this is a obviously not the most or not the easiest way to actually create music but it's a way that actually leads to some new unexpected results and this is what we always try to do we try to tonight push boundaries we try to actually look for new things and this is a pretty good example how we incorporate technology to do that the last project I want to talk about a little bit more in detail is the one that Kendrick already mentioned the one that you can see outside at the bot walk and with a lot of our project it started with some inspiration in this case satellite images of of rivers so for another project I did some research and came across these beautiful River landscapes and and I was totally fascinated about how they actually leave these patterns and I wanted to need to understand how it actually works and it's really interesting because you might not know it but in reality they're really moving they're just moving really really slow so if you look at like Google Earth time-lapse of such a river over the course of like 20 or 30 years you can really see how the river carves through the landscape and this is happening because there's some sediment being taken from one side where the water pressure is higher and left on the other side and through decades the river is really kind of like moves through the landscape and these are the moments where we feel that there's something in such a system that we need to understand that we need to recreate that we need yeah we need to understand and and at that point we start again researching exploring and building software representations of such a system so this is our River simulation one of the few or yeah we did quite a lot because we also need to kind of explore these things and this is a combination of different algorithms actually simulating this behavior and the moment you have the the logic in place you can start thinking about what is the visual aesthetic that I put on top of that and in that sense you can use such a river as a digital brush on your canvas making it raw beautiful abstract images but we also felt that looking at all those satellite images as as inspiration references there's such a beauty in these images already which has a really painterly aesthetic purely on its own and we felt that we need to stay close to that aesthetic in some ways so on top of this simulation that I just showed we developed some new visual shaders and all these shaders were actually representing different aspects like vegetation or yeah erosion and so on and in the end we developed a lot of different visual aesthetics about 20 and these are just four of them that we're representing yeah abstract interpretations of rivers influencing and changing landscapes and while I talked a lot about the algorithms of the logic behind the visuals there's another story about the sound creation again because one of the biggest struggles or questions that we ask ourselves is how do you actually create a soundscape or music for an endlessly moving visual because what you see there is actually a real-time piece which is constantly moving it's a lot about change and unpredictability so you don't really know what happens next so theoretically it can run forever and we like the idea of actually having somebody improvising or interpreting what is happening but you can't do that forever so this is where actually the idea of using an AI came in so for this part we collaborated with a studio called Kling Klang Klang and great sound designers we've been working with in the past as well and we came up with the idea to actually have human piano players we had four of them interpreting all the different visual aesthetics in a lot of different styles so we're four people interpreting about eight different aesthetics in four different styles and three different tempos and we ended up with about 350 different interpretations which was our training data set for the AI and for that we used to Google magenta to create the musical score and what we did was just connect feeding all the data in there and training it over and over and over again leading to a lot of different visual a lot of different outputs in terms of music and they differ a lot in terms of complexity and you can see that depending on the training iterations like two hundred five hundred thousand six thousand was getting more and more complex and more and more I would say interesting but at one we'll also reach the point where we had some kind like overfitting it was too much but these were then actually used to create the soundscape and I really liked the idea of actually having this kind of multi view where you have the visual side of this piece interpreted by the human and the Machine learns from that and does their own interpretation based on what the Machine understands which is the raw data and this led to this beautiful combination of sound and visuals and this is the final piece the way we showed it our first time at our exhibition at funkhouser's Berlin and quite similar to how we have it exhibited here at the world walk [Music] so thank you I'm going to hand over to you good morning everyone thank you for coming by the way it's so early so I really appreciate it and it's a pleasure to be up here with everyone actually I'll I'll go back I did a performance yesterday in this room where I showcased a duet performance of some of the things I'm going to be talking about I'm gonna try to speed through it really quickly though cuz I think the heart of this is the discussion I'll do my best I make no promises so this is an interesting premise that I like to bring out when I when I speak about my work and and the question is if technology is the answer what is the question it's really cool to be able to ask that at i/o so my work I use the mark made by hand and the mark made by machine handmade and digital approaches to understanding systems I've been working on this body of work for about five years now exploring the realm of human and robot collaboration and it's sort of in many phases of generations of of features essentially but these are the three that I'm going to discuss today the first one involves mimicry the second one memory and the third multiplicity and a collaboration with a multi agent body so it started off really simply I had a background as a performer and a violinist so I've been really I've thought a lot about gesture and how that might relate to you know cognition and an improvisation and that's always been at the heart of the work it's almost like the control by which I throw a lot of different digital approaches the first generation started with mimicry where I programmed a robotic arm to mimic my gesture in real-time using a very simple computer vision software and I found it became a really interesting performative moment of human and machine co-creation that I've been exploring now with machine learning over the past few years this is a generation that's trained just the very early iterations on my own drawing style at an attempt of speculating at robotic memory this third piece is a really interesting project called omnia pro me o where I designed a multi robotic system that was linked to the flow of the city I'm I just flew in from New York and we trained the robots motions on public publicly available surveillance feeds in New York City so this all this comes from a few different you know sparks of curiosity that we're going to talk about today which is this idea of and something that I read in Kate Mets documentation of the deep mind alphago Lisa dull moments which I'm sure most people in this room know about but when deep mind an alphago beat lisa dole the top go player in the world he said that in move 33 move 33 it was it represented a really watershed moment in how he thought about his his practice and his his game which is that the the system outputted a nonhuman move that he deemed impossibly beautiful so a lot of what I do is an attempt to find that impossibly beautiful non-human move because I think there's a lot of you know this hasn't really tried and cliched binary of men and machine that ends up being really quite dystopian that I try to think we can really imagine beyond now so I can show some of the videos for it this is the first video that shows the generation 1 in the performance yesterday I performed with two robotic arms generation one generation two that showed the process of me working with these evolving machines and their behavior it was so experimental that this is just actually a really mediocre webcam feed that I just had up in my in my performance area so but I thought this this showed this interesting attention of agency and making that really really sparked a lot of ideas and me creatively I'll go through to the next one too and then shortly after I released that project I got really interested in the idea of generating new types of machine behaviors not just a simple relay of the positional data that I was inputting but something that could function a little bit more as a creative catalyst for for my own drawing style I'll just I'll just go through that and a lot of this I think we have to think a lot about how language and how the words we use to describe these systems end up shaping how we think about it and the in English the etymological origin for the word computer is that it's a system meant to produce automation and I'm Chinese and I always found it really interesting to compare it to the Chinese interpretation of computer which is Deen though which is electric brain so I think that speaks a lot to the possibilities and promises and and kind of a little bit of where we're heading in working with these systems and thinking about ways we can align I've been reading a little bit more about this idea of Cosmo technics and sort of the the origin of some of these technologies and how they can inform our way moving forward so this is actually a diagram of the eaching but it sort of doesn't it look a little bit like an ml architecture you know I thought there's some interesting parallels there and something that I'm exploring in my forthcoming works I'm gonna really run through these because I know we have a lot to talk about but you know I think this comes from this idea of hybrid seeing you know we see in our own unique spectrum but also the systems that we work with see in their own way and that presents interesting particularity 's and biases this is you could even describe an artist's artistic style through landscape painting as a type of visual bias that of course we know is quite quite a topic of discussion in a lot of how we think about the systems of data and how they're trained so you know I've always found an interesting parallel between how a human sees a landscape and how a computer might and how we might be training it to do so this is the screencap of the project anyway so the project that I'm gonna show after this is inspired by that idea thinking about how I would interpret the flow of a city versus how the the algorithms that were used interpret the flow of the city and how that might be able to combine to a human and machine agency that's performed in real time this is inspired by some of the work from of Akira Khanna Yama from the Goethe collective in 1960s Japan thinking about ways of expanding our idea of collaboration we did a short film around this project that's available online for you to see I'm gonna skip through because we don't have much time left and it's all informed by this idea that we're part of a larger creative ecosystem which I'm sure is a sentiment that many of you share here so I just guess I'll leave it at that thank you thank you so it's so exciting to see this work the group that I lead at Google that's called artisan machine intelligence and we put on the first kind of exhibition and auction of neural net based artworks at San Francisco's gray area in 2016 after a deep dream came out and I feel like these practices that you've shared with us and thank you so much for sharing them really represent a kind of maturation of the relationship of artists with machine learning and with AI and the sense that we're really looking at not just what the a I come prettiest visually but how it can be part of an actual artistic practice and in a really integrated way and like what types of how those integrations might not necessarily appear visually whether it's through music or it's through the sort of process of creation in in the gesture itself so you know one of the things that came up early on when we started doing this work with artists and machine intelligence is this question you know when people learn that AI and machine learning can be used to make art they often go straight to this question of automation and they say like you know does this mean that artists are going to be replaced is there gonna be like robots that make all the art and then you know what there's no need for human artists anymore so you know I I don't think that that's the case and I think we can clearly see that there are other I don't think we need to reiterate that but I would like to ask you know how you know having seen some what the role that automation does play in both of your practices how did you come to an interest in integrating that into your practice I mean what you just meant I think integrating that's the important part you raise the question if AI is actually replacing artists at one point or I mean it's not about artists about replacing everything right I definitely disagree specifically for art but I think it's also the question how you actually use it in in in your art in your practice and I think it's really about at least for me integrating it I I like to actually be responsible and and I like to define the starting point which in this case could be the training data um define the variables that are actually responsible but I also like to actually take over I really like to hand the end result fully to the AI or to the algorithm but I like to include it in the in the process I think that's important because it also means that I start to rethink how I do things and that helps me to actually come up with new results I know that they're artists to actually do it differently and the they hand things over to the Machine and the output is the piece that's not necessarily what I like to do because I like to have the control over what happens to a certain degree definitely but it's an interesting an important topic because that question as you said comes up quite often and it's like oh do you just come I cried a little bit of code and then press art art art more art and that's not exactly how it is oh I I I don't yet but I want to now you know I mean when I when I think of the conversation around automation automation and agency and you know how I employ my robots for me it's very much about re recontextualizing the visual metaphor of the robotic arm which is a symbol of the Industrial Revolution and of automation into something that's a little bit more collaborative I'm really incensed by this idea that AI can serve as a creative catalyst to take my practice even in its simplest form to places that I wouldn't otherwise be comfortable going I think in in that way as showing this project as a co-creation in a collaborative process I think reminds us that the human hand is always present in these systems anyway so there's no such thing as a true relinquishes idea T that sometimes I think we're tempted to to really align to but again that collaborative co-creative agent is something that I it draws me to the work and and yeah and that's that's what I want to continue to evolve so you know one kind of logical step that is often taken I think this is what you're speaking to with the word integration but also augmentation right the idea that like we might be rather than automating or replacing aspects of ourselves with machine learning and AI we could sort of augment our capabilities are produced new types of capabilities and new types of imagination so I wanted to ask have you experienced you know well first how has working with the how how is working with these systems changed your conception or imagination in the process of making work and have you experienced moments of emergence or serendipity or sort of co-creation Co thinking with these tools that might not have been possible otherwise I mean in my specific case definitely because we started with collect code based design from the very beginning and one of the things that draw my attention is just the the way that the creation process actually differs from the I would say like the classical design process where you like have a vision and you just kind of try to execute it and their guests get closer and closer step-by-step but in this case you start to actually form and define a system a rule set but there are also some parts that I actually left open and this is what you just described it's kinda like lucky accident and this can like a little bit of chance and this could and it's the same with the system that I mentioned there William foresight improvisation technologies it just leads to a point when you start to rethink what you usually do and it is some kind of a trigger to actually do things differently and I really liked you to foster these moments and and make them part of the creation process because that's when beautiful things happen I think my response to that would be you know when when well and what I'm really trying to do is I'm trying to create a behavior an artistic behavior that's really quite linked to my control which is a drawing style and I think when that happens you know it's there's it's one way to think about that automation or augmentation but it's also for me it's a different way of being able to look at my own practice it becomes a bet of not only introspection but also a way to sort of create behaviors of in like a time capsule so it's a way to engage with my different drawing behaviors over time and to see how that's evolved in a really in a really physical and an embodied way and also it's it's something that a new project that I'm working on something that I would be able to share with other people so it becomes this Polly Geographic you know artistic agent that I have a lot of control and agency and design over and it's a very consensual system but it's a way to really expand my process and bring other people into the work in a way that would not be possible if it was just me and a stick of graphite mmm so I find that really exciting yeah this is interesting that you bring up these notions the of training sets you know personalizing the training data as well as the notion of consent and who's part of the system you know along with the question of agency this is I think an important point where you know we can imagine that these practices are in some ways experiments and how to relate with technology and so you know in the past artists did work with different tool makers and their influence was felled in the work in some way but I think we can look at machine learning and say that that working with magenta or you know working with creating a creating a dataset versus using an already existing data set or trained neuron that are our true moments where artists are making choices about which which partners they're bringing into their technological practice and this is something that maybe is probably new you know or is relatively new with media art so I wanted to really you know ask the question about collaboration and and really agency so you know if this is a collaboration whether it's with a machine learning system that you describe as an independent entity or a machine learning system that's a sort of extrusion of Google or other open-source research you know where where with whom does the agency live when we're using these systems and what does it mean to you to use a tool that is you know likely not treated for an artistic purpose maybe magenta might be different but a lot of neuron that's or not how does that play into into your thinking about your practice good question a tricky one but I think it's also partly the answer to the question that you raised in the beginning are computers or AI replacing artists and as I my answer to that would be again no because there's a as you said an intention that artists have they really kind of like have the will to produce something I think that's something that machines are missing I'm not saying they will miss that forever might change for sure um but at least in the beginning it's always kind of like the artist that comes first that actually tells the Machine to create something that even creates the machine to create art so I'm until this isn't changing I think there's there's no replacement happening and it's also still as you said the artist who actually defines what the input is which could be input that you created yourself like you do in your your pieces but we also did with the music but also other artists other creatives actually taking input from totally different sources which again leads to different results but what this source is is again defined by the artist so there's still this kind of like agency missing that you mentioned I've feel I think one reason why we're so interested in talking about AI and art and it is because it's about this idea of agency an agency has been something that I think artists have historically addressed you know the the meta-narrative of that as well over time but you know when I think about that I get into my head a lot about whether you know I sort of questioned my own agency if I if I am to question the agency of a machine I question my own and like and that gets into notions of free will and all this but you know I think it it's made me think a little bit more about why you know what actually motivates an individual's decision and and is it the microbiome is it like the gut bacteria in your in your system like is that a driving force I think I think our ideas of agency have become really pluralistic and I and that alongside machines alongside our own physiology has been a really unexpected creative like aha moment in a lot of the work that I've been trying to bring in through these kinetic robotic sculptures as a way of really confusing and and making that ambiguous that's a very long-winded way of answering your question yeah if we can figure out free well then maybe we can answer that question so I wanted to address questions kind of individually for the last couple of questions and for the last part of the talk you know one and I think this address this question to use when if we imagine that cities in the future are managed in part by local intelligent systems for mundane example self-driving cars that interact with say intelligent traffic light then we can do your practice as a prototype for a co-creative relationship with our built environment what do you think designers architects and urban planners should know about working creatively with intelligent systems that's a that's a really big question actually you know I think I think it's important to you know view the intelligent system the the entity that we're collaborating with is something that's already happening actually we have these layered systems like you know uber and all those places those already exists in our architectures now I think there's ways to integrate that in a way that when I when I think about this I think about music something with a rhythm and something that a response to the broadest spectrum of human need because there's all obviously a desire for efficiency in urban flow but there's also you know moments of pause that need to be baked in and even even in even in the design of the space there's places for digital detox and places for meditation and obviously you know I'm I wouldn't be the one to speak to about you know optimization of traffic flow you know but but I think to think about it as a whole organism that represents the the best interests of the of the collective I think is a way to set goals for these intelligent systems and urban environments well thank you and Cedric your peace with informative meandering River as well as many other works at i/o arts including Anna sue tOA's film Denis a study which will be screened tonight Anna Riddler's mosaic virus which is also on the boardwalk reflect not only a co-creative relationship with machines but also a co-creative relationship with plants and animals and in the case of meandering river I think a new vision of how to see natural systems you know through technology as we collaborate with machines can we not also collaborate with plants and animals or even the earth itself what can you share with us about relating to these natural systems through the tools that you've used for example with meandering river yeah good question what we would we usually like to do in our our work is we like to look a little bit beyond what we usually do and and I find that in a lot of different disciplines could be from dance to kind of like yeah classic some music but again could also be in nature inspiration comes from everywhere and especially with the meandering river piece I think one of the interesting things that resonate with us so strongly is the fact that it's heavily about change and an unpredictability and you find that a lot in nature so if we talk about if there could be like a collaborative work with nature directly then it might be hard to answer because a collaborative process requires some kind of feedback and the feedback is a bit more indirect but not saying that nature doesn't react to what we do as humans we definitely know that's true not always for the best but I'm definitely I mean our work is not really focused on nature so I think there are different artists who can answer that better and who have much stronger focus on actually including as you said animals plans or just the world surrounding them into their art for us it's a little bit more about making the process visible making change visible and for that reason nature is always an important topic but to answer the question I think yeah that's definitely possible and a machine-learning is just one example of how such a collaborator could look like but you can find find it everywhere Wow well I want to thank you both for being contributing your work to this experience for everyone at i/o I think it's added a lot to to the experience here it has for me and for sharing with us today your practice and this conversation and thank you so much everyone a round of applause please for so thank you [Applause] [Music]
