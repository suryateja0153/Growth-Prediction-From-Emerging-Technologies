 [Music] it's intensely contemplative it is almost hypnotic it's like putting your hand on the third rail of the universe if you play go seriously there is a chance that you will get exposed to this experience that is kind of like nothing else on the planet go is putting you in a place where you're always at the very farthest reaches of your capacity there's a reason that people have been playing go for thousands and thousands of years right it's not just that they want to understand go they want to understand what understanding is and maybe that is truly what it means to be human i was a kid i loved playing games i started off with board games like chess and then i bought my first computer when i was eight with winnings from a chess tournament ever since then i felt that computers were this sort of magical device that could extend the power of your mind virtual environments and games we think they're the perfect platform for developing and testing ai algorithms games are very convenient in that a lot of them have scores so it's very easy to measure incremental progress so i'm going to show you a few videos of the agent system the ai so let's start off with breakout so here you control the baton ball and you're trying to break through this rainbow colored wall the agent system has to learn everything for itself just from the raw pixels doesn't know what it's controlling it doesn't even know what the object of the game is now the beginning after 100 games um you can see the agent is not very good it's missing the ball most of the time but it's time to get the hang of the idea that the bat should go towards the ball now after 300 games it's about as good as any human can play this and pretty much gets the ball back every time we thought well that's pretty cool but we left the system playing for another 200 games and it did this amazing thing it found the optimal strategy was to dig a tunnel around the side and put the ball around the back of the wall the researchers working on this amazing ai developers but they're not so good at breakouts and they didn't know about that strategy so they learned something from their own system which is uh you know pretty funny and quite instructive i think about the potential for general ai so for us what's the next step now go is the most complex game pretty much ever devised by man beating a professional player at go is a long-standing grand challenge of ai research [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] when i was 18 i won't change my life this is why i go to french i won't try to forget the goal but it's impossible because all the things i learned in my life is this visco it looks like a mirror i see the goal i also see myself for me gold is a real life [Music] dear mr pham my name is demyster harbis i run an artificial intelligence company based in london called deepmind as the strongest go player in europe we would like to invite you to our offices in london both to meet you in person and to share with you an exciting go project that we are working on if you would be interested in coming to visit us please let us know any thanks kind regards demis when i see this email i don't know it's true or not well i will accept about this why not for me iris is an adventure i want to go to visit deepmind to know what is this go project [Music] the first visit i think maybe i want me sit in the special room push many many wear in my hand also my body let me play to scan my spring i don't know to make some research we needed to get fan way to deep mind to see we were a serious operation and we were serious people um doing proper research and the search time is getting better and better like as we go from for example one to eight in any one of these it always go goes up we think of deep mind as kind of like an apollo program effort for ai our mission is to fundamentally understand intelligence and recreate it artificially and then once we've done that we feel that we can use that technology to help society solve all sorts of other problems if we step through the actual game we can see kind of what alphago thinks what's the most likely variation that he thinks will happen we've been working on alphago our program to play go for just under two years now all the little patterns cascade together layer after layer after layer after layer i started talking about the game of go with demis more than 20 years ago and so this has been a really long journey the game of go is the holy grail of artificial intelligence for many years people have looked at this game and they've thought wow this is just too hard everything we've ever tried in ai it just falls over when you try the game of go and so that's why it feels like a real litmus test of progress if we can crack go we know we've done something special so with fan hurry we started talking around what the real purpose of the visit was it wasn't just a go project we wanted him to help with that actually we wanted to play him and we had a very strong program oh it's okay just the program is so easy so we'll be easy to play a lot of people have thought that it was decades away some people thought it would be never because they felt that to succeed at go you needed human intuition go is the world's oldest continuously played board game and in some sense it is one of the simplest and also most abstract there's only one type of piece there's only one type of move you just place that piece on the board and then your goal is to create a linked group of your stones that surrounds some empty territory and when you surround enemy stones you capture them and remove them from the board you earn points by surrounding territory and at the end of the game the person with the most territory wins it seems really simple but then you sit down to play and you realize right away it's like well i technically know what i'm allowed to do but i have no clue what i should do go's incredibly challenging for computers to tackle because compared to say chess the number of possible moves in a position is much larger in chess it's about 20. in go it's about 200 and a number of possible configurations of the board is more than the number of atoms in the universe so even if you took all the computers in the world and ran them for a million years that wouldn't be enough compute power to calculate all the possible variations if you ask a great go player why they played a particular move sometimes they'll just tell you it felt right so we have to come up with some kind of clever algorithm to mimic what people do with their intuition nice to meet you hello so with fan hurray we agreed a best of five match and we agreed it would be filmed you know we will treat it as a serious match i play with alphago aja hwang push the stone for alphago and of course i think i will win the game with alphago because it's just a program [Music] the first game i make some mistake and i lose again in that first match i think something clicked for him that this wasn't an ordinary go program we weren't just doing the the same as everyone else that something new was happening the second game i try to change my style but the problem is also i lose the second game and also for third game first game even the last game i lose five zero alpha go win all the game after losing losing losing you can feel his pressure is getting heavier and heavier and several times after the game he said he wanted to go out for fresh air i said oh i can go with you and have a chat he said no i want to go myself i feel something very strange i lose this program and i don't understand myself anymore i worried whether he'd even come back you know he seemed very low and he spent about an hour away from the office he came back completely changed i thought maddie this is the first time in the history the human professional gold player lose with the program she tell me yes we know but for you i do i okay i told her not and yes i am not happy to lose the game but i'm very will be happy for play in the history artificial intelligence researchers has solved the game of go a decade earlier than expected the computer named alphago was able to beat the european human champion artificial intelligence researchers have made a significant breakthrough it really is a big leap forward there's a big difference between the way the ibm computer beats kasparov which was programmed by expert chess players and the way the go playing computer more or less learned itself the way we start off training alphago is by showing it a hundred thousand games that strong amateurs have played that we've downloaded from the internet and we first initially get alphago to mimic the human player and then through self-playing reinforcement learning it plays against different versions of itself many millions of times and learns from its errors these specific ideas that are driving alphago are going to drive our our future the technologies at the heart of alphago they're what are called deep neural networks which essentially mimic the web of neurons in the human brain it's a very old idea but recently due to increases in computing power these neural networks have become extremely powerful almost overnight big neural networks that operate on big data can achieve surprising things alphago found a way to learn how to play go learning is the key thing here it's machine learning the whole beauty of these types of algorithms is that because they're learning for themselves they can go beyond what we as the programmers know how to do and allow us to make new breakthroughs in areas of science and medicine so alphago is one significant step towards that ultimate goal my wife called me she told me don't see internet don't connect internet because people talk terrible thing about you much with olivago fanue is living so long time in europe it's not real professional he's just an amateur player this is so hard for me so hard the go world were skeptical about how strong really was alphago and how much further did it need to get to be the top professionals so our program is improving over time and we want to push the ai algorithm to the limit and see how far this kind of self-improving process can go so we needed to look for an even greater challenge a match like no other is about to get underway in south korea lee c dole will be long-reigning alphago and the ultimate human versus machine smackdown this is a huge moment for both the world of artificial intelligence and i think the world of go so far alphago has beaten every challenge we've given it but we won't know its true strength until we play somebody who is at the top of the world likely to don we chose lisa dole because he wanted a legendary historic player somebody who has been acknowledged as the greatest player of the last decade i will not be too arrogant but i don't think that it will be a very close match the level of the player that africa went against in october is not the same level as me so given that a couple of months was only passed i don't think that it is enough for it to be able to catch up with me my hope is that it will be either five zero for me or maybe four to one so the critical point for me is to make sure i do not lose one higher we don't know how well our system will play against someone as creative as lisa doll also he's very famous for very creative um fighting play yeah so this could be um difficult for us but we'll see maybe in some ways he's the most difficult opponent we can take there was still so much of a question about whether or not they could beat someone like lee sedol von way is a good player but he's nothing like the very top players he said all is a nine down professional nine don professional is the highest rank that you can achieve and go the ranking system fanfare who's the european champion is just a two don professional on the other hand the very top he said all is nine down professional they said all is to go what roger federer is to tennis he's playing in wimbledon to win the grand slam and it's not just this year he'll be there next year and the year after that and the year after that of course in internet and all the gold community everyone maybe not 100 maybe 99.99 think listener will win very easy [Music] [Music] go is taken seriously in korea it's so much part of the culture like breathing or you know like taking swimming lessons or something on the surface is a game but inside had a very deep philosophy goalboard reflects the individual who's playing the true gonna show itself on the board you won't be able to hide it in ancient china japan korea go is one of the four noble things like for accomplishment for literacy with music poetry and painting so people think the go players are very smart and very noble uh [Music] master guan started this school so that he could produce great prayer in korea he said when he was age of eight he came in here attending class 9 a.m till 9 p.m seven days and then he stayed with the master one already was a little boy that i remember when i was a student studying go he was very young and rural enough to think that pizza grew on trees [Music] plays things that are interesting where you felt like he's beyond winning and losing he wants to do something that's innovative or takes things to the next level so every go player started his game for sure roughly 10 years he dominates the professional gold world he win 18 world championships [Music] definitely lizard is going to win the game 5-0 yeah all game it's gonna win all game we had our evaluation match last week we won a game and we lost a game and we lost the game in a way that would have made us look extremely foolish if that happened publicly it means that we still have work to do and we need to take this really seriously it's just too much risk that actually we could we could lose overall not only that but we could lose in a way that makes us look rather silly so i guess um yeah i did you want to say anything about what you're trying i'm walking home so we're working around the clock at the moment training our algorithms further trying to incrementally keep on improving right up to the moment where we have the match we've collected together people with different skill sets onto the same team so we have researchers engineers evaluation guys that you mean what happens if they create something new which wasn't used then we don't see it okay the first thing to know is things can help the perfect solution is the leaf programmer and built the original search engine so address responsibility is quite a big one he will be the one sitting opposite lisa dole and actually playing the moves alphago makes i'm feeling excited yeah at least i know he's a great player and i feel honored to play with him many of my friends they are very excited about match they keep telling me that the whole world is watching just prepare alphago hello hello dennis can you hear us yes i can hear you guys can you hear me okay yes perfect i was curious to meet you such an amazing developer who made alphago it's very nice to meet you thank you thank you likewise um it's a real pleasure to meet you um i love the game of go i'm not very good but i don't know if you know um but we actually have something in common i actually also i'm trained at a game at a young age i used to be when i was young professional chess player i used to play for the england team and then i stopped playing when i was about 14. i was um when i was 13 i was the second highest rated player in the world after the match i would like to propose that i give you one teaching game of go and you give me one teaching game of chess that sounds very good i would be very honored to to do that i'm not sure if it's okay to ask you this question but i saw the games against fanfuy and i didn't think it was quite at the level to play with me but i heard that it's getting really stronger can i ask how much it got stronger um yeah i i i can't say too much of course but it's definitely got uh significantly stronger well with more time i think a logical approach would be to follow up on ash's local search and run that in fast alpha and generate a whole new data set and iterate for more time but we're just out of time we realized that if we wanted to prepare for a mammoth task like taking on lisa dole there would be nothing better than talking to a professional and we couldn't have picked a better person than fanway we invite him as an advisor because during the match we found he is a man of good spirit welcome back thank you very much he's very precious that we have fun with us he was crushed by avago but then he became very positive and a big help to us when them has tell me can you come back to help us make africa more stronger and feel this respect of course i accept about this i play with alphago to understand where is the strong point about alphago and where is baby the weakness i play this morning afternoon all the time and i found something i found big weakness about alphago the big one the superheroes always have a hidden vulnerability right and the same is true of alphago it's unbelievably superhuman in general but it has some particular weaknesses in some situations we can think of there being this space of all the things it knows about and it knows about most of it extremely well but then there'll be these tricky lumps of knowledge that it just understands very poorly and it's really hard for us to characterize when it's going to enter into one of these lumps but if it does it can be completely delusional thinking that it's alive on one part of the board when in fact it's dead or vice versa so there is a real risk that we could lose the match everybody in the team try to work more and more to fix the problem but i think it's difficult to fix this very quickly we've got version 18 in the pipeline haven't we well we'll only go for verse 19 if it makes it significant if it doesn't which were having to rerun all the tests because they um they went wrong unfortunately so we're sort of basically a day behind in our evaluation because of that all the confidence well maybe we just need to be realistic that we've tried a bunch of things and we've come to the point where we said we would actually start freezing the code and saying look it's not and actually not panning out these delusions are still a realistic possibility for the match we have some weaknesses that we i don't think we're going to fix fully um before the match so um that's causing us a little bit of anxiety [Music] fleecy doll is getting ready to rumble on wednesday live across the internet this professional south korean go player will take on artificial intelligence program alphago tomorrow julian and george they pack up version 18 they stick it on a laptop and they fly out to seoul [Music] [Music] when i get to the hotel i'm going to catch up with the team what we should do in the time remaining is list things that could go wrong in the solidity of the system [Applause] in a difficult situation he likes to smoke yes there is terrace and we'll have security so he'll be able to go up then be by himself when i got here i didn't expect the attention on the match it was literally front page news about eight million koreans play the game of go and even those who don't you know recognize lee sedol he's a national figure and so there's that right there's some national pride involved but it's more than that just the very thought of a machine playing a human at something like this i think is inherently intriguing to people [Music] all the world gave the pressure to listen before this he played the tournament for country for himself but this time he played for the human i just really hope we win this first game if you lose the first game you literally have to win three out of four yeah which is hard work where are you going to be i'll start in the match room and then i'm going to come in here make sure everything's here yeah you should probably be in here hello and welcome to the deepmind challenge game one round one live from the four seasons here in seoul korea i am chris garlick of the american go e-journal i'm here with michael redmond nine don professional welcome michael i want to give a shout out to all of the folks watching around the world well the excitement's pretty palpable here in the hotel i've never seen a crush of interest to reporters from around the world all right folks you're here you're gonna see history made stay with us five minutes guys five minutes i just thought we should take a moment together and just think about what's about to happen extremely excited to be there extremely proud of every one of you and what we've done and we're no loss i think it's just amazing that we're here [Music] okay [Music] so [Music] boys [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] oh thank you we had worked so hard to make sure that this would go technically smoothly we tested it and tested it and tested it and still there comes that moment when you're live all the tv cameras are broadcasting everything and now it has to do the thing you built it to do so much i was a bit nervous it's the first time that i sit in front of a world-class co-player and i actually can feel the spirit and courtesy of a great co-player like lisa because i think it is the first time he faced a strange opponent i think he's not a human has no emotion it's cold but he stays very calm and i can feel his mental strength [Music] oh [Music] here is meow on kim uh nine don pro from the korean baduk association we are here live at the four seasons hotel on the 21st floor what are we looking at how's the game going oh it's fighting no from the beginning from the very beginning yeah yeah he i forgot place very well yeah just he's like a top professional just like a top professional yeah it's very aggressive now the fight is getting really complicated um this is actually the first time i've seen alpha go playing a game that has this difficult fight foreign i just saw him looking at his opponent's face and that's that's just a kind of a habit just an instinct as a player to look at the person across it yeah it's it's sort of like um something that lisa though would do when he was wondering how his opponent was feeling right it's just a just a habit so it's not as if ajah huang is going to do any giveaway because ajahn isn't alphago right oh [Music] linda with human when you play you can have exchange by feeling i look in you i know okay maybe you won't talk with me maybe you fear about me i can feel many many things but alphago you can feel nothing so when you confirm nothing when you play you have a more than more question about yourself for beginning you think okay my move is good and really good really good oh maybe bad oh terrible why would you hear more and more it's hard to know where to be all the different rooms are like exciting a different way isn't it to be here at the heart of the operation yeah i feel safe here white's thinking of doing this huge invasion here from its thick wall yes go for it it's done it's [Music] that is not a confident face he's pretty uh horrified by that i can't believe what i see right now oh really she thought you know she's a little bit behind and she made a very aggressive move here okay make it very complicated okay i think he said oh if he doesn't know respond quickly then he can collapse i mean this one is kind of unthinkable as a human group they are what if she knows everything about what's going to happen next where are we here's our search terms 50 or 60 that's the maximum number of moves ahead that alphago is looking from the current game position it's typically over 50 it's often over 60. in the games we see often around 150 alpha go goes for the kill we're 100 move 115 now so we're getting to that point we are all astonished just in the middle of the game because although go is uh seems to be doing a much better job than we all thought it would i thought they said all would be leading the game comfortably but it turned out that he's struggling at the moment but i think eventually he will prevail i hope i was uh you know more five to zero but now i'm not sure about that there might be the first mistake kind of clear mistake that foreign [Music] [Music] why one or not at this time you check this if it's like this white has won by a lot yeah wow it's so shocking i i expected alphago to win only one game i can feel his pain like he was he couldn't believe you know he couldn't accept it it takes time for him to accept the outcome maybe alphago is very strong now but he don't won't believe heavy rules it's just the goal portion player we took we can't believe this because form for us is something very very far it's not can be coming now it's impossible but in reality it's not i think he resigned in a very polite way these are the he's black but he blew white stone i think he resigned oh my gosh oh yeah the time is stuck wow i feel really good i feel like um i i really believe in alphago of course it's natural that humans want humans to win i mean i think that's a natural response but alphago is human created and i think that's the ultimate sign of human ingenuity and cleverness everything that alphago does it does because a human has either created the data that it learns from created the learning algorithm that learns from that data creates the search algorithm all of these things have come from from humans so really this is a human endeavor in the battle between man versus machine a computer just came out the victory deep mind put its computer program to the test against one of the brightest minds in the world and one alphago beat a professional player who has 18 go world championships under his belt the victor is considered a breakthrough in artificial intelligence in research we normally work to produce an academic paper it gets published and maybe we get to talk about it in a conference if we're lucky this is not normal for research in fact i've never experienced any media attention remotely close to this so it's a special moment for us all and we're just enjoying it while it lasts [Music] in a matchup between man and machine who wins well so far it's the machine in seoul south korea the artificially intelligent computer defeated the global champion in the ancient chinese board game go lee sidol lost the first matchup but he's got four more chances it is a bit strange being the front cover and everything as a computer scientist normally you sit there in your corner you could nobody really knows about it perhaps heard the joke how can you tell that a computer scientist is an extrovert and not an introvert if he's an extrovert he looks at your shoes when he's talking to you instead of at his own like if you look at archer he avoids all the cameras like crazy he's like game is finished and he's like out the back and back in his room and i think a lot of computer scientists would be like that we were more about doing our work than standing in the spotlight hello and welcome to game two round two in the google deepmind challenge throwdown between man and machine game one the machine takes down man huge shock headlines around the world the reactions on the ground here from the folks in korea were just stunned they estimate 60 million people watch the game in china alone probably bringing up to maybe 80 million people watch this game worldwide it was just incredible and if anything today is probably even more of a bad house so he said i'll knows today he knows that this is just a really important game right he's got to win [Music] i think probably looking for a little uh a little payback my impression is that maybe he underestimated alphago and he's going to change his tactics oh well if i say anything about alphago that it's not normal it's maybe the way it handles a game when it thinks it is ahead yes we're actually going to have a visit from one of the team and we'll talk about exactly that point from the inside thanks so much for coming by thor i really appreciate it can you sort of share a bit of what is going on in alphago so alphago has these three main components there's the policy network which was trained on high-level games to imitate those players and then we have a second component we call this the value net and it can evaluate the board position and say what is the probability of winning in this particular position and then third component is the tree search where it would look through different variations of the game and try to figure out what will happen in the future so if we now take a position like this first the policy network would scan the position and come up with what would be the interesting spot to play and it builds up a tree of variations and it then employs this value net that tells it how promising is the outcome of this particular variation so alphago tries to maximize its probability of winning but it doesn't care at all about the margin by which it wins okay so when you see a slow looking move that's maybe an indication that alphago thinks it has a good chance to win yeah that is a little giveaway we're looking for a hotel [Music] foreign ooh looks like uh looks like lee is taking a little bit of a break lisa dal go to smoke and alva go just play it don't sing about the opening will be zero or not so i jab sees alphago plays the move 37 and aja puts the stone in the board that's a very that's a very surprising move i thought i thought it was i thought it was a mistake when i see this move for me it's just the big shock what normally humans will never play this one because it's bad it's just bad we don't know why it's bad but it's a little bit high yeah it's fifth line normally you don't make a shoulder here on the fifth line um so coming on top of a fourth line zone is really unusual yeah that's an exciting move i i think we've seen an original move here that's the kind of move uh that that you play go for hey interesting stuff this fifth line shoulder head is that yeah i wasn't expecting that um i don't really know if it's a good or bad move at this point the professional commentators almost unanimously said that not a single human player would have chosen move 37. so i actually had a poke around in alphago to see what alphago thought and alphago actually agreed with that assessment alphago said there was a 1 in 10 000 probability that move 37 would have been played by a human player so it knew that this was an extremely unlikely move it went beyond its human guide and it came up with something new and creative and different i am very much watching the game through these commentators that's the way it works so when they're confused i'm certainly confused at the same time i'm latching on to the fact that they are confused right that is that is an interesting moment when everyone else is confused who's not confused right besides the machine i want to see lisa dal when he sees this he's back lee is back [Music] foreign normally have seen about one two minutes no more but this time it think more than two minutes [Music] the more i see this move i feel something changed maybe for human we think it's bad but for alphago why not go is like geopolitics like something small that happens here can have a ripple effect hours down down the road in a different part of the board the game kind of turned on its axis at that moment this move is very special because with this move all the stone played before is work together it's connect it look like a network link everywhere it's very special very special points this is a tough game for lisa alphago is just not letting lisa do what he wants right black hat's almost 50 points that's a lot that's not a good sign oh he said all just slapped himself on the side of the head oh wow i think black's ahead at this point it's looking good and we're not steady steady path now i just see lucidal he lose so much normally we resent people long time ago but he won't try he played he played he played he just don't want to reason [Music] because then white oh he resigned it looks like lisa dole has just resigned there was this heavy sadness over that whole floor you could feel it during the game i felt during the game and i'm leaving the commentary room to go to the press conference and i was stopped by someone another technology reporter now at first all he wanted to talk about was the technology and how great this was but then even he kind of slipped into this moment of melancholy where he was upset as well i am quite speechless i admit that it was a very clear loss on my part from the very beginning of the game that was not a moment in time that i felt that i was leading the game you feel elated and you feel a little bit scared there is something i i think frightening to people about a machine that learns on its own for us alphago is obviously just some computer program but looking at the commentary on the internet i already saw the commentators call alphago like he and she during the games completely unconsciously which alphago is really a very very simple program it's not anywhere close to full ai and we already see that happening so i found that very interesting the tendency to anthropomorphize ai systems is one of the big obstacles in the way of actually trying to understand how ai might impact the world in the future for example the conversation is about what what could go wrong like what the risks are then in invariably you see this terminator picture every single time there are these red glowing eyes right we're really closer to a smart washing machine than terminator if you look at today's ai we are really very nascent i'm extremely excited and passionate about ai's potential but ai is still very limited in its power i think that people are right to think that there is a danger that as we continue to improve these systems that we might miss that that threshold where where we do cross over into danger but the good news is there are already people thinking about those dangers you know there's a lot of talk now we're leading the discussions on this that maybe there should be a kind of cross-industry best practices working group or something where the leaders of the research teams in those organizations the you know the big ones that are working on ai ibm microsoft so on uh come together and make sure that ai's used ethically and responsibly i think what is important is that there is this community of people who are leading uh the cutting edge of ai who are interact with academics and already are thinking about the long term and how we can ensure that innovation is responsible as the power of these machines gets even greater this is it folks day three game three lease it all go master back to the wall he's down 2-0 he's got to win today to keep hope alive to console him and to review africa console him do you think he's he's upset or i mean i mean is upset yeah in the beginning there was a fearful fight and then avago played very well so he secured a very early lead from mu 50 the win rate was very high already and it was climbing toward 100 percent oh that's a great move what's your what's your probability um uh the shape blue for white [Music] he tried to fight directly in the game but it's not half stale when we change our style to play with opponent normally it's very very bad so is the game more easy for alphago it's looking good for us locally i think the black group is huge and it's got nowhere to go and it's going to be running around [Music] i don't know how to describe the situation if i were black i will resign we should admit that we are facing the strongest existence ever ever in the gold history there's no point in playing out the end game and you're gonna you know you're gonna lose right so even if black can live there oh he resigned okay wow wow you saw history made here tonight alphago is one again three straight wins three straight wins has won the match when lisa is on the game he he looked like unhappy it's not just he lose the torment it's just especially about this game because he don't play his game i'm very hard about this very but i can do nothing you know certainly i feel a bit ambivalent about it given i'm a games player and you know go is the pinnacle of board games but i really like this statement one of the top chinese professionals said of you know if alpha go wins maybe we'll really start to get to see what this game's about i couldn't celebrate it was fantastic that we'd won but there was such a big part of me that saw this man trying so hard and being so disappointed i see internet many many people are talking about the listener maybe i don't play the best you know we are go player okay sometime in china in korean japan we see go like ah we are artists you know we play ours best right for go right so please gentle with lisa doll he's very very good players great players i am in the room i see this door he won't win i try everything we just we can't justice foreign um [Music] you could see that he was more relaxed after he had lost three games in a row that said the stakes were still high you know in the end it isn't about pride they don't feel like confidence but they feel light can lee saddam find alphago's weakness is there in fact a weakness i was thinking i just pulled a plug you just pull the plot out everyone's still cheering for this at all and then yeah it's not going very well now concerned it feels pretty good for for black at this point it feels pretty good for black guys i want eliza play his game because for the moment he tried many many things to play with alphago to understand alphago but he never tried to play himself i thought man maintained alphago look like the real mirror when you play with alphago you feel very strange look like you and all the turn naked the first time you see this you want to see because oh it's me real me and more than more you need accept oh it's a real me so how now how i can do it's developing into a very very dangerous fight this is really lisado's type of game he likes this kind of fight white has to find something inside black's territory i think he is already planning on trying something so you believe in ethereum's ability to live in the very small area right yes yes there is a little potential there and i think maybe he's going to try to do something he said all magic oh what would be the magic move lisa he's running short on time but he's going to have to use up all this time there he just burned like seven or eight minutes just on this move already i don't see anything we can't find anything what is lisa doll up to here yeah he's really concentrating he really is look at look at that lisa is very patient he wait he wait away this moment i feel something look like the wolf wheat in the forest in the winter he cold i feel very very cold but i need patience but the moment coming they go out to attack this is the hinge of the game oh look at that move that's an exciting move no basically oh he found the wedge whoa it's going to change the equation because now black cannot escape that would be so cool if that works alphago has just played something maybe unusual you know i'm not actually sure what alphago is trying to do here what's that about uh you don't really understand it well well that was a sharp drop in this could be that it actually can't find a way through i think this is far enough ahead to see that it doesn't work and now maybe it's on tilt i don't know it looks like it's like a viewer yeah it's made a mistake did anything strange happen in there no it'll look normal well there we go well we can definitely say well there's a weakness would we definitely say the mistake i felt this mixture of this sinking feeling in my stomach where i was wondering if alphago was becoming delusional in this situation where i could see that it was starting to play strangely and at the same time relief of lucidal that he was actually in with a chance now i just like trying not to look horrified i knew after moved 17 after like 10 or 20 moves i saw avago strange moves and i know abago somehow became crazy but i didn't realize why when i was playing we searched for 90. at that point okay i think there's something went wrong that's the longest research entire game business yeah i think it's like his search so i do get the impression that alphago has sort of gone off on a tangent what are you doing well maybe it has a master plan no he doesn't even think it has does it so it knows it's made because it starts it starts evaluating it the other way look look at lisa's confused i was like what is he doing that's not uh i'm scared confused that's uh what is it doing why is it going you know you asked if it was a bug i i've i've said before that if if yeah right if deepmind has figured out how to write code that doesn't have bugs that is a bigger news story than alphago oh you're kidding me hmm there's literally this next movie we're gonna play i think i think they're gonna laugh maybe he's gonna laugh oh i don't really know what alphago is trying to do here that's the understatement of the year is it love nope that's the move hong makes no misclips is very confused these are not human moves this move also um sort of inexplicable i mean those you can you can clearly call those mistakes yes of course but it's the first time in the in the four matches that we've seen moves like that right oh the value dropped even more it's weird we're like 45 [Music] lights and white white swinging come on at least at all this is unbelievable all right i was so confident that this black moya would just be consolidated by black and there's nothing there and somehow he's just erased it all like it's gone so he's found his weakness that that wedge move probably surprised him yeah right yeah alphago seemed to have such a good game and then all this whole sequence in the center uh sort of changed that he pulls off a miracle he manages to make it so complicated that the artificial intelligence doesn't evaluate it correctly i think it looks like aj huang maybe sitting there also knows that the game is over i can't i can't not stop smiling did he smile no i haven't seen him smile yet i think he is still checking he's so serious he wants to be careful yeah is he concerned a lot she really does his best i think he feels some something like you know uh responsibility or burden too much [Music] looks like alphago is resigned wow the most amazing game um i'm almost going to tear up was it was was game four where he comes back and wins right [Music] [Applause] them [Music] foreign i heard from so many people saying you know they were running out in the street they were so happy you know they were chanting they're celebrating especially after a 0-3 down at the time it seems to be hopeless that the end of the world is coming but we see the light usually i'm happy when i win not like my colleague wins but this time it felt like my window [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] my question is about number 78 move chinese taco player kuli said it was a god's play what were you thinking when you made that [Laughter] foreign does leave me a little bit in awe of the human brain's power in particular lee's amazing ability to cause alphago problems and find something seemingly out of nothing and so we really want to understand what happened so it really was lee's move that the key is the center if the center go on there's notions we were winning before but if alphago thought it's winning and he couldn't convert that win that means it wasn't actually winning otherwise it would have had the right responses would we have played it there's a steal in there what probability does it give it [Music] 0.007 is that in the position that he played that's when he played nicely so we thought this was the one yeah the value is really low so the god move was literally a god move because we believe that only one in ten thousands uh humans would have found that that's right it doesn't come to mind it's the top five in the top five moves that you would consider and i said lisa doll he said it was the only thing and he thought it was the only one yeah welcome back to the four seasons world champion lisa doll went looking for alphago's weakness in game four and he found it today last round he's looking to see if he can repeat that we'll see what happens the place is a mad house downstairs maybe as many if not more journalists here today than there were for game one we all were really excited for the fifth match to see what would happen was this going to be a 3-2 thing or was it going to be a 4-1 thing and you know there's a different message with both of those for me i don't think alphago will make the mistake again but who knows maybe it will tell me and the licital have now have more confidence about this look like maybe lizzita finds a key to open the alphago you weren't crazy about the timing on this move yeah yeah and now you don't approve of this yeah i'm sort of thinking that maybe alphago hasn't recovered from game four yet yeah so white has to do something about this one here afterwards no hope he doesn't know he needs to play though play some move is bad i feel something oh maybe this victim is come back again are we seeing another short circuit or is there something what's uh i think it could be a kind of a misreading uh and we're you're pretty comfortable with saying that you're doing good for at least good for at least no there's no reason for white to be playing that move it's a bad move and in some cases it's going to lose a point too it is exactly the same 91 certainly someone was telling me that maybe the whole game we thought that alphago was wrong about the board position we were super worried that oh i was going to play garbage is going to be like loose in a very embarrassing way and this continues for the whole game but this is a big weird time when did they play yeah as it turned out none of us know go well enough to accurately judge what alphago is doing well why is sweden now this one looks like white is winning ah we all say some of our pago moves are so weird and strange and baby mistakes but after a game is finished we have to doubt ourselves our judgement alphago making another kind of nonsensical throw-in we're not really sure what that's about this is what 10 or maybe 11. play looks like it looks weird and we don't quite understand it i think it is important to study more about hypogo's mistake like moves then maybe we can adjust our knowledge about go to me the most amazing thing to come out of my understanding of go as a result of watching alphago play are the the infamous slack moves well there's something strange about the way it's playing because it's playing some moves that are not really necessary right a slack move is a move that looks lazy you can see these other better moves and alvago is rejecting them but what i think alphago is teaching us is that we've been using score as a proxy for chance of winning so the bigger my margin of territory the more confident i am that i'm gonna win and alphago saying no no it shouldn't matter how much you win by you only need to win by a single point why should i be seizing all this extra territory when i don't need it the lessons that alphago is teaching us are going to influence how go is played for the next thousand years am i counting why won this game how by how much are we talking two points [Music] go is just a game but we can learn important lessons from our computer be so successful at go machines will have the capability not only to crunch through huge amount of data but also to analyze it intelligently just as in the case of the go games the machine made moves that surprised even the experts and eventually the machines will gain our confidence because we will see that very very often they make a better guess than we could have made as humans i think white might have a slight advantage here that's what she said is um [Applause] i mean i think it's just really is uh once in a lifetime thing i would say it's the it's the most amazing thing yeah i've experienced you know for us it's the culmination of 20-year dream it started as a pure research endeavor we just wanted to understand can neural networks play the game of go and from there it went on to a level that i never expected and i'm unbelievably proud of the team when i started doing artificial intelligence it was four or five years ago and i was really interested in that but like many people would discourage me and they would say okay there is no future so actually seeing that within five years we are at this stage right now it's amazing by itself there are so many possible application domains where creativity in a different dimension to what humans could do could be immensely valuable to us and i'd just love to have more of those moments where we look back and say yeah that was just like move 37 something beautiful occurred there at least in a broad sense move 37 begat move 78 begat a new attitude at least a new way of seeing the game he improved through this machine his humanness was expanded after playing this inanimate creation and the hope is that that machine and in particular the technologies behind it can have the same effect with all of us i remember hearing a talk by kasparov who says that a good human plus a machine is the best combination this is a unique experience nobody can have this experience play with alphago fight games like this so i hope lisador can find something in this five game maybe some change in his game i see today i fight fight fight it's very good big master real big master even though i [Music] me is done but for all the story maybe it's just the beginning we don't know it's just when i play with alphago he showed me something i feel beautiful just it i see the world different before everything begins what is real thing inside the go game with this thing i will change something with my game maybe he just can show humans something we never discovered maybe it's beautiful [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] you
