 [Music] machine learning works of course by taking a data set and studying it looking for patterns in it patterns which may be used to predict future occurrences it certainly begs the question of whether or not humans have abilities that could not be duplicated using that methodology is our ability to walk just inferred from all of our data of all of our attempts in the past is human creativity just an extrapolation from the prior data set of experiences if the answer is yes then it suggests that an artificial general intelligence is something we're on the verge of creating as we make advances in AI but if the answer is now that humans have abilities that cannot be duplicated by studying for our data then that either means that an artificial general intelligence is much further off which will require additional techniques or may not be possible at all if you're interested in artificial intelligence visit GigaOM comm or check out my new book the fourth age smart robots conscious computers in the future of humanity
