 ai is a hot topic these days but have you ever been confused about what is just ai hype versus the reality of ai if you have then stick around because that's what we're going to discuss in this video [Music] all right if you haven't subscribed to this channel be sure to do so so you can stay up to date with all things data and analytics okay ai is mired in hype especially marketing hype and we're hearing about the promise of ai more and more every day and expectations have never been higher some people are also under the impression that ai may have already achieved human level intelligence something we talked about in a previous video where we talked about different categories of ai one of which is called artificial general intelligence or agi and this is partly due to what we see in you know tv series and movies and comic books around science fiction type stuff right like the ex machina the west world the terminator series and so on in that previous video in addition to talking about artificial general intelligence or agi we also talked about artificial narrow intelligence or ani which is kind of what we have today all ai today is really just that and we talked about how in asi you know it's this idea of machines having better than human level intelligence in such a way that they're autonomous self-learning self-improving self-directed and even multitasking now despite any of the hype or impressions otherwise all of ai today can be considered weak ai or ani that just means that ai for the most part is sort of a one-trick pony uh and is used to solve highly specialized problems so when you're creating you know these machine learning models or ai models um to do things like make predictions or you know optimize something you're really working on one thing at a time and creating one model at a time for a certain highly specialized task now you can combine these models to make something a bit more complex that does different things and gives the oppression of multitasking great example of that would be something like an autonomous vehicle for example so what that means is that ai is not all about killer robots and being a total job killer at least not today anyways and hopefully never now ai will make some jobs obsolete but a lot of studies and research also show that ai will create many new jobs largely in the area of what they call human augmented intelligence and that will be a topic of a future video now all that being said we definitely need to keep our eye on the potential impacts of you know ai on society and on the workplace and the workforce and also the environment and it's really important that we keep in mind as we move forward and things progress this idea of ethical and responsible ai so when i talk about ai hype as a concept basically i'm describing that perception that you know ai may be at human level intelligence like agi or even beyond it like asi and also in combination with some of the marketing hype out there that kind of improperly sets expectations sometimes and impressions it sort of generally over promises uh on ai also there's this tendency for some people in companies to call things ai that really aren't ai in a previous video we defined ai as intelligence exhibited by machines so that's what i would call real ai intelligence exhibited by machines and that means that machines somehow learn usually from data using machine learning algorithms and then understand what they've learned in the form typically of models ai or machine learning models that we create and then use that understanding and learning to do things like make predictions recommendations optimize things automate things and so on so unless that's what's happening that's really not ai in addition to some of the hype we come across when it comes to ai there are also some misconceptions that i come across as well that i want to talk about now you know one of them is that ai is sort of easy and nowadays you know there's solutions just right off the shelf you can grab and plug in and bam you're off and running and that you know you can expect to get big roi and returns quickly in reality planning for and building ai solutions is often very difficult and there's quite a talent shortage right now as well so usually companies are best off sort of starting small and picking you know individual smaller tasks that they can start demonstrating and building proficiency in ai and building out their competencies and capabilities and then sort of work from there additionally while adoption rates are certainly increasing with ai especially in the enterprise there's still quite a few barriers to entry a big part of that is again lack of talent but also lack of understanding training funding um priorities prioritization executive level buy-in and so on um that's something i talk about in my book ai for people in business i created a model i call the ai readiness model and a lot of these considerations on you know sort of this idea of being ready uh and being you know developing ai maturity as well i talk about length well we've certainly talked a lot about ai hype and many of the misconceptions around ai uh in this video and definitely let us know in the comments of any hype or misconceptions that you've come across out there in the real world all right well there's plenty of ai hype out there to navigate but there's also a lot of promise as well hopefully ai will have a significant and beneficial impact on both people and society the key is to understand the difference between the hype of ai and the reality of ai as things progress and also to make sure that we use ai in an ethical and responsible way if you'd like to learn more about ai be sure to subscribe to my
