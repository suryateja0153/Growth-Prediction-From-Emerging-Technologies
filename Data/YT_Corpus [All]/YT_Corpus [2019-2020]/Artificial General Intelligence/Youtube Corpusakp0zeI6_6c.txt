 hi everyone welcome to the document ai session i'm siddhirawanguri and i lead the document ai product suite at google cloud a quick run-through of the agenda today i'll be starting with the challenges and market opportunities we're seeing in document processing and dive into a product overview of document ai i'll also be sharing some customer use cases and some exciting new announcements in document ai solutions following that my colleague obviously will unbundle some of the technologies we use under the let's dive right in nearly all business processes today begin include or end with a document most companies are sitting on a document goldmine think pdfs emails customer feedback patents contracts technical documents sensitive documents hr files and the list goes on and these documents are only going to grow with time if you're already trying to make sense of your documents it's likely you're only scratching the surface a lot of these documents are unstructured which can be very time consuming to process now what do we mean by structured and unstructured twenty percent of enterprise data is structured now by structured data this can be human generated or machine generated data that is highly organized and formatted to be searchable a lot of data analytics tools out there can be used to process structured data however 80 of enterprise data today is still unstructured this unstructured data is in the form of freeform text such as written documents emails comments and the data analytics tools out there to process this unstructured data are still very nascent document processing has become increasingly complex with time processes that involve large volumes of unstructured content are increasing day by day for instance top tier logistic firms process over 50 000 bills of ladings per day the diversity of incoming data spans a variety of doctypes and formats for instance the average mortgage application today exceeds over 350 pages and over 60 major document types why is the diversity increasing this diversity can be increasing because of government regulations and as the types of business relationships and entity linkages across various old documents increase with time a lot of external knowledge can also be associated with a document in its evaluation process for instance looking at a document you may need to know if this driver's license is the official nebraska driver's license format or not cross-linking entities within various incoming data streams generates major new value and analyzing the semantic depth of documents can unlock various insights within businesses however processing these documents is quite challenging because of the various document formats the manual processes the costs of error a lot of bad data and long processing times and delays businesses are faced with high costs lost revenue and missed opportunities that's where document ai comes in in a nutshell document ai extracts structured data from unstructured content document ai enables businesses to unlock insights from your documents with machine learning this can enable businesses to make better decisions such as analyzing customer feedback processing invoices or reduce mortgage processing lines document ai can both extract as well as classify informations from unstructured documents now document ai within google cloud builds on top of our computer vision natural language and knowledge graph technologies we have a variety of products within google cloud ai to make customers where they are within document ai building blocks we have a suite of products under general document ai custom document ai and specialized document by general document ai i'm referring to ju google's general ocr models applied to your content custom document ai enables you to train custom models on your content to identify domain specific content tuned to your own specific training data with specialized document ai you can use google's turnkey models to get out of the box extraction and classification for some of the most common document types in the world let me unbundle that for you a little bit more with general document ai we have we have our print ocr and handwriting ocr apis that are already in ga and they support over 200 languages with our print ocr and over 50 languages with a handwriting ocr these are already available under the vision api today recently we've also introduced the form burster api in beta and this enables you to identify spatial content such as key value pairs tabular content within highly structured forms with custom document ai last year we went out ga with automl dock classification and automl dock extraction invoice these tools enable you to provide your own training data and tune domain specific content extraction and classification applied to your own business documents we're also introducing custom form parser apis in alpha that can enable you to extract content provided a single blank form template with our specialized document ai suite our goal is to catalog and build dedicated models for some of the world's most common document types these document models are highly accurate enabling you to classify and identify specific document types such as invoices and receipts and various other document types that i will be talking about shortly you can also provide data validation and knowledge graph validation against dates addresses and various entity types that you find within these documents and with this turnkey capability you can apply these models to do classification and extraction against your own documents a high volume documents that you find within your business processes some examples of our specialized document ai models are the invoice parser apis and the receive parser apis which are now available in private beta across various industries such as retail financial services healthcare media and entertainment and industrial we are seeing customers use document ais in ways we couldn't have imagined for instance in retail document ai is being applied by our customers to analyze customer feedback and process store manager feedback to optimize the supply chain and build better products for customers our financial services customers are using document ai to cut mortgage processing types and analyze volumes of different document types that are typical to a loan origination process within healthcare claims document ai is applied to cut critical timelines and analyze claims much faster media and entertainment companies are using document ai to build recommendation engines and analyze comments and build various feedback systems within industrial use cases document ai is used to analyze highly technical manuals and site assessment documents and in some cases analyze archives of documents that are over 100 years old one company that has reimagined their document strategy by leveraging document ai is the industry leading market services provider mr cooper they are challenged to manage many domain specific mortgage document types and have classified over 100 million pages they have trained over 130 mortgage document labels and achieved over 92 accuracy in classifications using document ai they trust that their content can be accurately classified another company that has leveraged document ai specifically a custom document ai suite for classification and extraction is docusign docusign has strained millions of document types using our document custom document ai models and have been able to build an accurate auto tagging system that can enable their customers to autofill some of the key fields that are highlighted in in yellow on the screen here's an example of a tagged w9 form that has been prototyped using document ai document ai can also be applied to various insurance claims use cases a large us-based insurance provider has been able to leverage document ai to achieve over 74 reduction in claim processing and insurance settlement time the accuracy of our models has been over 81 another large us-based financial services company has been able to achieve over 97.8 accuracy using document ai to analyze over 350 documents per minute with that we are very excited to release some new updates to document ai today mortgage packages have historically been a very complex and document intensive workflow in our economy now these packages packages can be an ideal use case for document ai why mortgage packages are of very high volume they're a mix of structured semi-structured and unstructured content there's a lot of content validation requirements on these mortgage packages and the same mortgage package is analyzed over and over again within origination securitization and servicing and sometimes multiple business units within the same financial institution process income and asset documents multiple times leading to a lot of inefficiencies once the mortgage packet is converted into structured data it can be fed into multiple downstream analytical and operational workflows we at google have identified with our partners and customers various mortgage document types that fit into a typical origination workflow and bucketed into various high-value use cases one of our first focus areas is the income and asset document bucket i'm excited to introduce the lending document ai solution this is a bundle of specialized models focused on document types used in mortgage lending in a nutshell using lending document ai a loan package can be converted into structured data by applying a specialized dock ai models built for various income and asset document types such as w2s tax forms bank statements and pay stubs i am also excited to introduce a second document ai solution called procure to pay document ai document ai for procured a helps enterprises automate one of their highest volume and highest value business processes the procurement cycle we provide a group of ai powered parsers starting with invoices and receipts that take documents in a variety of formats and return cleanly structured data earlier this year we used the power of document ai to help in response to proven 19. we developed the ppp lending ai solution to help lenders accelerate and automate processing loan applications for the paycheck protection program the document aipbb parser api made it possible for lenders to handle the large intake volumes of ppp loan requests by using ai to extract information from their loan documents submitted by applicants here are some of the key document types supported by our ppb commercial lending document ai document ai is also used to bring normalization to id and password documents with that i'd love to hand over to my colleague lewis slew to talk about some technologies we use under the hood thank you sujra now let's see document ai in action with a demo first we will try to parse it inways the image you saw on the left there are a lot of content in it you could see multiple addresses different dates and many other details in the tabular format then we will make this even harder it is a camera capture image of a w-2 form and it's wine stained and image slightly screwed and a lot of paper folds first we upload this invoice to the invoice password within seconds you can see the extracted entity nicely mapped to a well-defined schema this is very powerful because you don't have to maintain any rule-based mapping layer or any post-processing scripts and this also make value normalization to be possible within the same ui you could also inspect and review the key value pair and table extraction results these outputs are handy and useful if you need to apply additional processing or data mining having seen this on the ui now let's run our w-2 form through the command line this is how production systems integrate with document ai this is a the highly distorted w2 form we saw earlier what we're going to do is we send this image through our landing dock ai endpoint and load the output into a bigquery table as a data sync with speed query you could perform more advanced data analytics or just like us simply look at the data in a tabular format if we compare the result side by side we actually extract values from the form with high accuracy and confidence let's take a look at few of them ssn social security number all nine digits match the document even though hyphens are in the original field employer identification number is also correct and the more challenging case the employer name and address on row number six the entire cell also extracted 100 correct getting data extracted from these two documents is no easy task let me show you one of the state of arts model we have built at google unlike classic nlp tasks document like invoices do not contain natural language as you might found in regular sentences and paragraphs data here is often represented in tables in addition many documents have multiple pages varying numbers of sections and have a variety of layouts and formatting clues to organize those informations an understanding of two-dimensional layout of the text on the page is the key to understanding such documents earlier this year we published a new state of arts research paper on extracting data from templatic documents this technique is combined with many things we learned and used from building optimal natural language entity extraction models to better understand receipts bills insurance quotes and etc if you're interested in learning more on this topic i encourage you to take a look at this paper many of our customers asked about what's coming for doc ai let me now give you a sneak peek into the new document ai portal it's a one stop shop where you can create view and manage everything needed to solve your own business document challenges this also includes a new processor library a gallery of specialized passwords such as invoice passer 941 form password or www passer apart from the specialized ones the library will also host other tools like ocr and forum password to help you better understand your documents introducing another new feature in document ai human review an integrated experience to give you full confidence on accuracy and accountability of the model helping you meet your regulatory and compliance requirements as well taking a deeper look at the human review configuration panel you will be able to choose different validation methods and labeler options if you already have an in-house workforce or are using an existing bpo or are completely new to human review in your ai ml workflow we have an option for you we are very excited to see what you will be building with our new doc ai interface and with that i'm handing this back to cedira thank you lewis to wrap up if you think you have a great use case for document ai i'd like to encourage you to identify and prioritize workflows that will benefit the most here are here are a few key resources you can find out more on our website or reach out to our partners who are familiar with our technologies to such a custom solution for your needs we hope you are as excited as we are to apply document ai to your business today thank you
