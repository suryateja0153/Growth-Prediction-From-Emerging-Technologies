 everyone welcome to the great learning master class with dr. Robin on the cell car my name is Nathan Varma I am a senior brand manager at great learning and I will be hosting the session for him it was a couple of minutes till more people join and then we'll start the session if we have about 250 to 30 people now we'll wait for a few moments people are still joining in people from all over the world everyone please keep during the session I'll be taking the questions from the chat part on the right side chat box on the right side so keep posting all your questions and queries we will stop in the middle one time and then right at the end and I'll be routing the questions to dr. cert card so keep sending your questions meanwhile we'll try to answer as many as possible how about 350 people now I will start I think so let me just quickly give an introduction so welcome again that the people who just joined this is great learning master class a live session series and today we will be discussing with dr. Robin on this earth guard on artificial intelligence for leaders so we will cover in this one-hour session we will cover how business leaders can leverage AI machine learning data science to make better decisions and deliver superior business outcomes the speaker dr. Sarkar as many of you might already know is an academic director and Academy Director for data science and machine learning programs in great learning he has quite an illustrious background he has a PhD from Stanford University and a teaching experience of over 28 years at prestigious colleges like MIT Indian Institute of Science and I am Bangalore dr. Shekhar also has industry experience at organizations like GE and IBM and today as I mentioned he'll be talking about AI for leaders from both a theoretical as well as more industry point of view not a satire without further ado let's start the session I think we have a lot of people now okay yeah so what I'm going to do is I'm going to try sharing my screen let's see can you see my screen yeah it's visible now okay good morning the good afternoon good evening as the case may be in your part of the world it's always a pleasure to be in these forums and while I can't see you I hope you are doing well I hope you are safe where you are if you are in isolation welcome to the community many of us are I'm here right now at home my daughter is in the next next room and one of the opportunities that we have even in these difficult times is to come together on forums such as this to talk about technology to talk about opportunities to talk about business and where technology might get business to talk about data to talk about different kinds of applications of data and related things which is what mostly my career and my professional expertise has been about but I also hope you are taking this opportunity to learn about whatever interests you and irrespective of great learning learning is always a case that we want to go to when the opportunity arises and paradoxical as it may sound this seems like a good opportunity to learn more about ourselves and about the world around us that being said what we'll talk about today is I want to talk about artificial intelligence artificial intelligence has lots of connotations for lots of people it may mean robots to you it may mean something that Arnold Schwarzenegger started doing many years ago it may mean neural networks to you it may mean the new business buzzword to you in which case this is a session for you because what we will be doing is will try to understand what artificial intelligence means for leadership in particular business leadership leadership can be of various types it could be political leadership it could be either shape of community leadership is defined in many ways including personal leadership but leadership for me today I'm going to think in terms of business leadership and what business leaders can do to advance their individual roles as far as also they committed a business success I'm also going to take the view that most of you are interested in business itself and as it stands some of you may be running businesses some of you may be intimately involved in business decisions and the point is to be able to say how does all this help in the business process for those of you are on this column are necessarily in the business side of things maybe this will give you some insight as to how the management community or the management of for-profit organizations and corporations are thinking in terms of where technology might take you next now technology has been going in a number of places and it's been added for quite some time till about a few years ago we were speaking in terms of business intelligence or bi and business intelligence had a major role to play in business development and how business is thought about using computers in Vida to do their work so what I'm going to do is I'm going to begin with the flow I'm going to begin with the flow of how businesses tend to think about things in the middle nothing really to do with AI or data or anything like that but just normal businesses you know just think of a shot you know think of you know a bus service think of trains think of a restaurant think of what is the business that you might be or might be a customer of and what this slide is is that it's something like a workflow there are many versions of this many interpretations on how businesses work this particular one was a little bit of reference to a book called applied artificial intelligence it's a wonderful book that you might take an opportunity to look at there's a lot of literature out there a lot of very interesting books please take your time reading about this as well in addition to of course participating in these sessions and going ahead with us in the Atlantic so just a very brief snapshot of how businesses might be doing this into this number one business is operate by taking actions a business action an action of selling something an action of buying something and these actions are typically informed by a set of information and judgment so for example think that you are running a profit and loss oh you are the CEO of a small company or a large company how do you decisions how does this work for you what part of the decision-making ability for any decision be that annual strategy be that approaching an individual customer whatever we the objective is essentially involving numbers numbers about markets about sales how much are you selling what are your revenues how much are things costing what are the things that are going into labor how much money have you borrowed how much you're having to pay for it any infrastructure that you are using etc talk about revenue sales prop about your annual numbers talk about your quarterly numbers and talk about meeting targets very often businesses operate by essentially passing targets from top to the bottom and then figuring out how those targets are mixed from bottom to the top from the CEO to business units or to shop close and then back up again accounting for example is done that way where people keep their books they keep it in terms of numbers I am talking about that kind of information just the movement of money and resources in a typical business the other thing that businesses also do is businesses use judgment judgments about strategy about where the business is going what it is trying to accomplish what the competitive scenario is like what might what other companies might be coming in what are the kinds of products might be coming in what do their past experiences say about situations some situations such as a situation that we are in now don't necessarily involve any past experience some of us may have been through crisises of this time maybe financial crisis is it sitcom bust of a couple of decades of the word cetera but they may have been nothing like this kind of a pandemic that's running through the world and shaking up businesses everywhere so experiences of various kinds come together strategies of various kinds come together together with the numbers that business generates this is two actions now where is data and where does intelligence fit into all of this based on the information in the judgment of business leaders businesses take actions those actions can also be informed by predictions these predictions can be made by simple guesswork by saying that I'm going to guess that so many customers are going to come in oh he can be based from data he can be based on some kind of analysis that can be done and this kind of analysis can be very straightforward statistical analysis a change chart just an Excel spreadsheet showing you where your business is going hmm a statistical model may be built on it which is a dashboard will talk more about dashboards as we go along dashboards can be structured around this but you're simply making a prediction a guess as to where you things might might be going and based on that you are informing your action as to what you want to do do you want to sell more do you want to reduce your prices do you want to go after costs do you want to have a new product coming into the market things of that sort do you want to hire more people you want to let people go you want to borrow more money do you want to use it in different ways now these predictions can also come through more sophisticated mechanisms involving different kinds of inputs inputs that involve clever learning from the world around us information that is coming not just from this friend of statistical tables but information that's coming from other kinds of feedback some of it may be associated with AI artificial intelligence some of it may be associated with things like for example IOT or the Internet of Things basically sensors that you have on machines that may tell you this is how machines are working and that may inform what you think is going to happen in the future or how your computer network is working so various kinds of data and various kinds of models from very simple statistical models to very sophisticated predictive machine learning models may be used so we'll talk a little bit about machine learning as we go into the next part of this talk now what about the actions that the business might be taking now analytics does business intelligence as artificial intelligence have a role to play in that yes actions can be anticipated cheese can be simulated actions can be shall we say scenario analyzed often you see people coming up with scenarios what is my best-case scenario but those if you have gone to for example investors they would ask you this what is the biskits scenario what might happen what is the upper side the upside of the story they may also ask for what is a downside of the story and he was a leader would want to say what would happen if things really go wrong this kind of scenario analysis is also being done now as we see people are unable to forecast where this disease will go and people are saying what is the upper end of this and what is the lower end of this but in a typical business you would say what would happen with things for my weight and things do not follow my mean and you can do that with simulations and those simulations can be very informal can be based on beta can be based on random distributions can incorporate uncertainty and things like that around that the other thing that actions need to do is think about optimality what does it mean to take a good action in other words the question that you're asking and this is sifted to the notion of intelligence is to say what is intelligence and in a business context what is intelligence what should you be intelligent about should you for example be intelligent about identifying customers should you be intelligent about anticipating competitors should you be intelligent about controlling costs should you be intelligent about identifying talent what should you be intelligent about and once you've identified what you can be intelligent about you can think about what constitutes an optimal decision once I've identified this is what I need to be intelligent about in other words who are my best customers what is my optimal set of employees the right set of employees have give my entire talent base with the right composition what is the optimal optimal cost that I can accomplish based on what I need to deliver to the customer and based on what my supply chain and what my vendors are telling me so the idea of optimization is central to the business decision process and so any intelligence that you want to make into it has to adapt to what you mean by optimal and therefore being the AI solution that you build has to incorporate that kind of intelligence so optimization is a central piece to machine learning and a lot of AI technology today is essentially a clever combination of machine learning and optimization the right thing is being optimized using the recs leader so this is what I want you to think about little bit is to see what actions are actions that I think can be improved and by improved I mean you mean what what is the intelligent statement of that improvement and therefore what needs to be optimized this will help frame the AI problem much clearer not only in your head but also in the head of your applications engineers and those who might be you import in building of the solution for you of course at the end of your business what we care about is not just the action but the outcome what happened what happened I once remember early on in my area one of my bosses hear this feedback to us when we were giving a presentation don't give me actions give me outcomes don't tell me what you're going to do tell me what will happen at the end of whatever it is that you will do tell me the outcomes being a good outcomes B they're bad outcomes what are the outcomes what was the revenue what were the sales what were the profits what were the number of customers what were the costs would have my interest rates how much money am I left owing how much money do I have in the bank and this can be done at any level in the business this can be done at the lowest level at the individual manager level at the individual contributor level to the small business unit leader to the vice president to the CEO to whoever might be involved in incorporating an outcome everyone has an outcome business is almost entirely about outcomes and their measurements so therefore these actions are going to lead to certain outcomes how do we track them maybe through - sports with some of the metrics of course there are formal ways of tracking it in the accounting business you have to generate balance sheets have to generate income statements cash flow statements registers whatever it is that you need to do that means to be generated and that may be digitized that will be given to you on an in a nice graphic that will be given to you in dynamic forms and that outcome will now need to be analysed and here comes the part where AI becomes crucial again which is to say what do I do with this outcome what is the feedback mechanism of this outcome where does this outcome results who in improving my business now most business leaders naturally do this they don't need any business intelligence they don't need artificial intelligence human intelligence is typically good enough to take an outcome and inform it back into future action maybe even improve your judgement and you do this you realize oh maybe this was not that good of business to be in maybe they recycle a different business I should be in or maybe I should go out for slightly different classes of customers maybe I should change my entire product line maybe I should buy from different people maybe I should hire a different people so it could be tactical changes like actions it could be strategy changes where the change in the judgment over the course of the lifetime of the business itself so what happens is that this feedback gets incorporated into the business enemy what role does a I'm playing this way what AI can do and does actually quite win is it does a form of aerion analysis now in analysis something the statisticians also know statistics statistical models are built on the idea that make the errors smaller and so therefore a statistical model that is tracking error will also continue on a steep track itself to make that error less am i identifying the right customers who are defaulting on my am i identifying the right customers who may be churning on my neck on my computer network and so therefore when I make those mistakes those mistakes can be fed back into my model in order to be able to reduce its error classical statistical models and therefore classical API does that machine learning and its descendant artificial intelligence also do that through the idea of reinforcement and we will talk about reinforcement more as we go along the idea of reinforcement is very clever it essentially is the idea that says that run a computer programmer run an algorithm in such a way that it tracks the performance and if that performance is good then give it a reward and if that performance is not good then give it a punishment and shrapp the metric that way that every time something good happens the metric jumps up and every time something bad happens the metric jumps down and so the computer algorithm now tries to optimize but the optimization is continually changing because it is being reinforced by the outcomes this kind of reinforcement learning when fed into a machine learning algorithm gives a real sense to intelligence and so a lot of artificial intelligence algorithms are coming into being because they are using something some form of reinforcement in being something that says I am getting clever as I go along one of my managers again of years ago would describe a neural network in the following way it is like a child that is learning so similarly a Chinese brain the neurons keep getting information sensory inputs experiences and the neurons keep getting built up and this mechanism is what is is what makes the child learn and grow human intelligence is clever in that the child's brain physically grows more neurons keep getting added my daughter is seven years old I am obviously older and have more neurons not because smarter I think she has more human intelligence than I do the city because I have had more time to grow more neurons Computers till now do not do that but they do have a counterpart an energy of that which is the dead and what atoms get smarter by reinforcement so I've talked a lot what I want you to do at this point is take a look at this picture or something similar I'm not saying that this is a standard picture for you this is a template for me to go you have a similar workflow wherever you are and think about where you think this intelligence data outcomes AI is role and we you would want to focus on future success in here depends on identifying where e I can be used think about where it can be used in your business at this point is it an import visit and making predictions is it in deciding on actions is real measuring outcomes is it and finding out what the feedback should be or anything like that I hope to hear from you give your thoughts on this give your thoughts on watch which part of this is most exciting and which part of it you think is trivial and doesn't need any any computer interventions and we can go from there which are asking how do you calculate the ROI of artificial intelligence if you implement a solution how do you really calculate the our way ok so how do I return on investment so another one there is an ROI method that is currently present in the business in the run time business as is there's a set of investments that's need and there's a return calculation that can be made on it you know this is return on the investment and you can do that with with various kinds of calculations respect justice value whatever it is that you want to want to do so now the question becomes what role will I play in changing that ROI calculation so there are two sides freeze one side of course is a return SEC to measure that how much has been the he's in something let's say that you're running a marketing campaign now this marketing campaign has now been designed by an algorithm that has four people by sport people it means that it is said that here is your best customer here is your second here is a third here is your fourth etc and using that you have now identified the right customers to which to target your offerings to and you have done that once you have done that you now see hopefully and in most cases almost certainly a change and you here lift a game in your output in other words you're getting more uplift scores more conversions more sales more hits what I was however you are measuring how we are measuring success in your marketing campaign so now you've got a before and after story and you know that without using this technology what kind of conversion rates were you getting and afterwards what kind of conversion rates you're getting so you can measure that difference this is the change shall we say the change in the return and now the simplest way to do this is to say that in order to get that kind of benefit what was the addition investment that I need for the original investment that can be made is maybe a little hard to calculate because if we involve lots of things one investment in computing which may come from other resources that you are also using in your company to investment in software developers or in consultants whoever you're using to develop that architecture that is going into being able to do this so that would probably be the simplest way of doing it just do it before after now sometimes what happens is that that's not good enough so what is done particularly in the example that I have that I just said is a specific test is done with a champion Challenger kind of format you know is something that is not used using the traditional methods and then using the new methods sometimes on the same population base and you see what the difference is and because you've done this in this control way let pretty much simultaneously two things are running you can attribute that be able to the new methodology that we are using some businesses insist on an operation like that in order to be able to say what is the return on investment on the on the I infrastructure the last form become this is the following that very often a arm is used to justify an investment in digital exercise or in a digitization of a company certainly many companies are doing that now in that case it's harder to measure what the return investment on a itself would be but one outcome of such a use of it he said more digitized business so just like the web was used in order to digitize businesses earlier AI and this kind of data-driven technologies is using use to upgrade the digital digital existence of the company in which case the outcome could be a lot more than just what he is giving it could help in payroll it could help in your web servers it could help in your e-commerce site it could help in your busy websites itself it could help in your accounting all of that nothing L you through in the end when you order to do the AI you have to have the computing and the data transfer infrastructure now that you have that is so much else that you can do and that becomes an interesting offer so take your time to figure this out what it means for your business very tactically using things like champion challenger tests and campaign management and attributing differences or strategical saying how will that overall investment way into the into this into the positioning of my business and into my long-term resources capabilities in profitability it's a longer calculation that's actually much more interesting good question thank you there are couple of other questions I will just ask one more before we proceed further so it seems like the quite a few people from manufacturing background from the mentoring industry in our session and they are curious to know that while it has many applications like you talked about in the traditionally digital means in manufacturing are there enough applications and if yes can you give some examples okay so let me take let me take this let's say manufacturing organization have spent some of my career in manufacturing organizations GE in example and so for example let's say you're manufacturing the specifics of some there pick an example let's say a wind turbine so if a manufacturing you winter the the action that you are going to make for example is to say that what kind of wind turbine should I manufacture now what is that going to be informed by that is going to be informed primarily by two things one the energy demand and number two the kind of wind that is going to be present in the sides if you have so this one kind of analysis that is very easily influenced by AI your data side of things which is to try and understand the energy data to try and figure out how much will be the demand from this wind turbine side and how much therefore we need to be put up and similarly on the website to see how much wind can be generated so that will inform the the nature of the wind form that you are going to say now on the manufacturing side so if you are going to manufacture now you're going to have to manufacture to certain specifications so for example let's say you're setting up a plant and you want to say that here is a wind turbine blade that I want to make and it has to be to beast and respects to these kinds of this kind thickness very precise curvatures because it's got to cut through the air in a certain way can I make it to this kind of specification can I build a manufacturing floor that can do it this precisely this would then fit into other things that you might be doing in manufacturing such as for example mean and you can set up an automated floor flow shop to do this to say that therefore if I am going to let us say build it from some kind of wood parts etc then how much should I shave it if I'm going to weather this out of metal then how much weathering am i how much weathering am I going to tolerate on this and therefore how much tempering of the metal am I going to do so therefore you are going to have various requirements on the material and this can be put into a robot to see how can I control it now suppose something is going wrong if something is going wrong and not necessarily going up to spec let's see what a different lot of material let's say wear a different batch of paint and this field is taking more layers to fit on and so therefore as for example your manufacturing shop is doing this some kind of Tamara some kind of inspection device can say and say your product isn't coming out very well you need to reconfigure it you to reconfigure how many layers of paint you're putting on top of this and that may be a simple reset on a robot whereas if you are doing this in tiling manually without any feedback on the data then the entire line will have to be shut down and reconfigured and that's going to take you a day or a week or whatever as the case may be so people are figuring out different ways of doing this either from the point of view input damage finding or from the point of view of running a production line and also from the point of view or shall we say sourcing or buying material what kind of quality chicks can I do on this how do I set up an experiment to say that if I inspect this and this is this part that is coming in I gave the paint example I cannot test if we can clean it up painless coming in which one should I test and what tolerances how do I do what control we can quality control people often talk what is gauge R&R a lot more efficiently using a lot more parameters that's a sophisticated form of statistics but it goes very well into hey I if what it is that you're looking at for example is an image so you're looking at the box and instead of doing some kind of breakdown analysis on if you are taking a little picture of it which is going to lead me to the next part of my presentation what is this about vision and the kinds of things why is it that a is become so popular today because you can do spectacular things with images and the kids and imagine what what you can do with good cameras in a manufacturing setup in terms of monitoring things in terms of inspecting things in terms of speeding things up so there are various dimensions to this arising manufacturing will find very very useful and many kinds of interesting factories are being put up manufacturing is becoming a lot more agile things like additive manufacturing which is basically putting layers onto this grown up versions of 3d printing essentially I'm making this very very interesting supply chains are becoming much more adaptable manufacturers like this online bidding systems for ordering and things of that sort the price of oil is suddenly changed way should I now get my oil from well if you've got a good well-designed option system so good I can keep going on and on about manufacturing actually some part cement fracturing you know quite well better than this and I think we've correct Jordan Magnus is sure we talk more about it in the end of the session I think you see okay so what I'm going to do is I'm going to continue on and talk a little bit more about certain specific angles to machine learning artificial intelligence and we and want to leave you with a particular shall we say dimensional analysis of this but before I do that let me talk a little bit about what is media very exciting today and this is the discovery of something called deep learning now deep learning is it's a simple word and like words like big data simple words catch on so deep learning is something that's actually referring to a certain set of techniques that allow you to take information from unstructured input what is unstructured input and image for example is an unstructured input so here is what a deep learning exercise can do what it can do is it can be get image like I am seeing on the left hand side here and at the end of a certain a I algorithm a set of algorithms it can come up with a short description of it a group of people shopping in an outdoor market there are many vegetables at the fruit stand that's two sentences that describes what is in this image this particular nothing that you're seeing is from a paper from laocoon internal been here in Nature Reviews these three pioneers of deep learning who got the Turing award the Nobel equivalent in computer science last year and their work has really changed what the what the mythology has been about and what the applications are so in order to do this let's understand what needs to happen number one an image needs to be understood you need to break down an image have the ability to look at an image break it down into it various constituents and that is done using for example things called convolutional neural networks that's just a word it doesn't matter if you don't understand it if you do then know that this is where one important application of it so what a convolutional neural network does is it has the to take an image like this tear it apart it was different as called features and then identified with several things that have been said before for example things like vegetable is what gets people the second part of this is the following the second part is to identify those concepts that have taken from the image into a language phrase into an English language of any language statement that you wanted what does it mean and how do i as a human being understand this concept how do I talk in terms of being able to do this in a way that other human beings can understand it in other words there has to be a way of linking a concept to language and that is what other forms of deep learning like recurrent neural networks of ordinance are very good at doing recurring neural networks take sequences in this case sequences or sentences etc or texts and so I don't want to go into the details of deep learning the recession's for that I'm sure but what I want to leave you with is the idea that artificial intelligence now is at a level that it can work effectively with things like images videos texts speech etc so that beat the state of affairs what does that mean for businesses now what that means for businesses is that machine learning has now gone into different modes but in order to do that I need a much cleverer understanding of what means to happen to do this and this is ongoing research this is also from the same paper and just I want to point out a little interesting tidbit on this here's a sentence a woman is throwing a frisbee in a park and there's an algorithm that is identifying the woman and is identified the frisbee and there is also somewhere here a little girl is sitting on a bed with a teddy bear now the interesting part is if they are going to miss being able to identify a woman and identify a far and has been able to identify a little girl and has been able to identify a teddy bear but when the language parts of it come on the woman is showing a frisbee in a park a little girl is sitting on a bed now why is it that the woman is in the park and the girl is on the bed similarly the tree is you know the forest the tree is in the background the giraffe is in the forest but the stop sign is on the road the group of people is on the board we understand this you may think I'm asking a stupid question but think of how hard it is for a computer to do this to understand that conceptually humans think of some things has been on and some things as being in so which is why so much energy has gone into doing this well and what deep learning has done has done it well enough so this can be done and therefore therefore it has meant that the human interface to AI has become much clearer now and therefore things like businesses people had given me probably who may not hear about the details of a computer program and whether it is C or C++ or what the operating languages can now understand the output in a way that makes sense to them even to the level of reading in the non scale so therefore where is all this stickiness where is all this cleverness kickings so here's a diagram and I want to talk about machine learning versus deep learning and machine learning you can think off as shall we say grown-up business intelligence and deep learning you can think of as this form of specialized air it's still specialized is still specialized it an object that can understand and image his different from an object that can understand a text these programs are still separate one day we'll get to a situation with the same computer and the same program can understand whether it see something or hear something that's close to something on that called artificial general intelligence not there yet the other cut is on what I'm calling static and dynamic static means it's done once it can be done again where it is done once and as until it is done again and the instruction of an individual it will stay as is dynamic means it is continually evolving without the humans interference without a manual says so the program is continually changing doing different things based on what it is seen so on the static machine learning side we've been building models for a long time for example various lines of scoring models saying that can eyes for customers based on data that I've seen in the past can I give them propensity who is that key to purchase who is actually to charge who's likely to default so what happens is that a customer base is analyzed a certain metric is assigned to customers and beasts on that metric I design a campaign and design targeting I design certain strategies and I can do this again three months later with a refreshed customer base but I have to refresh the customer base I can do this just for vendors for those of you are manufacturing I can do this to figure out whether my shipments have coming in correctly or not etc etc now what is the dynamic version of doing this the dynamic version of doing this is that it is done in such a way so that it is clever enough to realize that newer things can be incorporated for example new services new things that I might be offering or new occurrences of something that hasn't been seen before sick disease or fraud fraud is an interesting application because what fraud refers to is the idea that someone is out to breach the rules now how does machine learning typically work the way machine learning typically works you say that learns the rules it says that here is an input and here is an output tell me what is the relationship between them tell me if says if this is the input this is the output if this is what the customer is doing this is the output if this is the transaction happening in my credit card this is the information this is correct or this is fraud if this is the qualification of my vendor this product is good or not however imagine someone who's actively out to break this imagine someone who's actively saying I will wreak this pattern I mean I know you're looking for me and I will do something different I will create fraud using a pattern you have not seen before this is nasty from the machine learnings perspective or from a guy's perspective because it now is dealing with an adversary who's deliberately breaking its rules so things are near networks for example can be structured in order to do this it says that if a new pattern emerges as the data is coming in and the new patterns are coming in can you adapt your rules to understand what this new pattern is you may not be able to explain it but can you at least predicted do you know that yes suddenly I have a hot spot here suddenly here is where the fraud is coming from subtly I have an emergence of disease from here I have built a hospital morning I know where my patients are coming from and suddenly I am seeing a lot more patients that are coming with a particular kind of dry cuff what does that mean for my model what is it indicating that this disease can be has it seen this disease before some version of this disease before is it clever enough to know that it is this kind of disease or this kind of fraud whatever it is if I have introduced a new kind of service if I have picked my sales were not operating differently with different kinds of priced physicians these algorithms are certainly possible what they do is they effectively mean taking the data and working on it in order to feed it through into a system that runs continuously and is capable of dealing with typically large amounts of data so things like big data for example play a role here things like MapReduce and operating and computers and cloud infrastructures play a role here in order will the processes data repeatedly things like software as a service we're all here because you're doing something continually and not offline and once so you have a son recently this is almost like a I as a service so on the machine learning side is this now where is all this advancing as we go deeper and deeper into here on the static side the same kinds of storing models can be built but the kind of data that they can use can be a lot more sophisticated and now not looking at just banking information I am NOT looking at account information for credit card info and now I'm not looking at vendor qualification information for figuring out quality of sourcing I am now looking at social media feedback I'm looking at Twitter feeds I'm looking at what's happening at what people are seeing in social media and chat rooms and any of that and now I have the ability to process that together with all the language constructs that they may give with all the emoticons and all the happy smiley faces and I have be able to analyze that and say are people happy with my product what are people not happy with my job so therefore the way the older algorithm said that here is an account statement and here is a positive or negative reflection of that account statement could have that customer who saying here is what social media activity is and here is positive or negative so you can do that with videos as well you can do that by saying that I am seeing video feeds of something I am seeing something that is that I have images for for example I'm going to be doing inspection I'm going to be looking at parts and I'm taking pictures of them saying this contributes for good part of this this is a bad word and I'm going to that without even knowing or opening the part up and saying that this is what a good part looks like from the outside in this what a bad part looks like from the other side maybe I can have interesting scanning interfaces something that says that okay I do not need to look at just the surface I can go below it and see as well so the whole idea of inspection so to speak changes video fields I can look at security I can look at say they don't care who is coming into my factory and I can do that intelligently by saying okay I don't need to watch every single video feed I'm just got a camera on as soon as it changes now analyze it and say what the change was and if someone is coming who has come in he says I recognize this is this someone who's in my database can I do something about that do I close the door do it alert someone so this kind of algorithm by the way in the sentence right I'm only giving examples there are many many more of this made it clear that these are examples so this kind of classification can of course be done from many kinds of applications and it doesn't need to be classification can be prediction it can be segmentation can be various kinds of things but what deep learning is done what he is done is that it has made the input into these algorithms like the input of the way we understand things you and I are understanding things why you are understanding me and I hope you are I'm not sure you are but I'm optimistic I hope you are but what you're doing is you're seeing my slides and you're listening to my voice there's language in this vision involved that's human intelligence that's how this is being created that has become close to what a computer and do therefore this is a good time for air and businesses be human constructs use that same idea of human intelligence in order to improve their understanding of things what would be a corresponding dynamic version of this a corresponding dynamic version of this would say the same thing but keep taking feedback keep changing keep adapting keep changing your rules don't just think positive and negative or the same thing people may like different kinds of books the recommendation system may change its flavor what is a recommendation system what kind of books were you running online robotic manufacturing is the robot arm doing the right thing and if it isn't doing the right thing and the bots are slowly moving in a different way maybe doesn't think of a conveyor belt in which robot is assembling a part and think of us very very small misalignment in the speed of the rotating moving part and in the speed at which the robot moves very very slowly the robot will go out of sync but if you have a reinforcement learning algorithm there the robot will keep moving a little bit as it realizes that his input is also moving if the error in its work is also increasing its getting that feedback and he's saying how can I reduce that error should I move on in similarly through things like chatbots anything that gives a feedback that feedback can be incorporated in order to give better versions of this and deep reinforcement learning is one of the most active research areas and therefore one of the most active areas of business deployment as well or speculative business deployment as well so therefore there is a generation of applications that you can see here from the from shall we say extended versions of what classical VI is from what I would call static machine learning - dynamic deep learning which is still largely experimental but it's getting into business quickly and businesses that are deploying this as seeing large benefits they're also seeing low ROI at this point in time but things I'm sure are getting better most flavor AI applications that we think of as AI in business today are on the top right and bottom left of this in other words we're traditional scoring models of traditional business analytics models but becoming dynamic because big data can be dealt with as a service on things like clouds itself etc and where these kinds of models are involving deep learning at AI based applications because these applications now can deal with unstructured information like text and voyages voice and images and emails and and fingerprints and all of that so there are two different directions and which is going both quite successfully and you may want to think about where your business opportunity is not so this she was more in terms of shall we say technical sophistication and dieter density what is it what is the movement from left to right better algorithms better port but this is available also to you there are many software's that are routinely doing this many vendors and making clever AI applications available online requiring relatively less sophistication on coding still means cleverness you still need machine learning experts and you still need to learn that is this and on this side it's static to dynamic it's about increasing in data data rate velocity of data and also being able to process data and process information rapidly so compute power and data volume are playing a role in this movement here so based on where you are in your business where your investments might be where your applications might be either a manufacturing be there in services B they need to be like businesses be they'd be to see like businesses being a local businesses we think global businesses I think building applications for example like a smart website two very big applications like a global ordering system whatever it is that you can think of there's a place for this please do not get confused by the terms around this if someone says that the AI application could be something fairly concrete and fairly simple conversely you can also do something fairly complete and fairly simple and then think of it as the first step in your region and if you're already there welcome to bravely worlds like that they don't give them I'm going to stop here a little bit you got a little bit of time left maybe you have some thoughts around this I'd love to hear where you think the opportunities are and where you think things might be so there were quite a few interesting applications that you covered there there's a section of people in on the column who are from L&D which is Learning and Development and some HR folks so they are asking how important is knowledge of AI in succession planning it should this be like a very important competency that we should cover or leadership role on the learning side yeah so they're from the learning side but they're asking in in in terms of selecting leaders for succession planning how important is the knowledge of AI and machine learning okay leadership within this context yes yes yes leadership within this project some people analytics is hard even analytics has been hard in general understanding the motivations of people has typically been a difficult thing to do but interesting applications are coming up I think from different communities from the public leadership community business schools are doing a lot of research in trying to understand how motivation can be better understood how shall we see emotions build up how emotional intelligence can be casted into artificial intelligence like processes I personally am NOT an expert in that but I think the jury is still out in being able to identify leadership potential based on this raw numbers of course are always there what do we mean by raw numbers what I mean is saying that let's look at the business performances look at the business output of someone and let's just analyze that many companies have been doing that many companies that have good meritocratic progression systems have looked at data and have come up with very good scoring systems and so similarly just like you can score customers you can score leaders or score managers to see how they are doing and so the same kind of argument can I think interestingly there are quite a few people who are also asking about AI and agriculture so they're saying that we know that this should be the way forward but you know they're not very sure of the applications and where to start where to start collecting data how do okay so that's a deep field I'll give a few quick ideas of where you can go about doing it and one is for example disease identification of crops so for example one traditional applications have to be for music virus which is identifying certain patterns of virus but now applications are there across many diseases which means what you can do is you can take pictures of a crop and you can figure out what the health of that crop is by identifying what diseases may strike the crop and what those diseases look like in early stages that's one particular stage of applications using computer vision as early identify a substrate of crop the second thing for example is entangling of fertilizers and timing of watering so for example we know one of the difficult things is to try and figure out when should I water and how much should I water it so for example you can track moisture you can track whether you can track humidity you can track soil and figure out now is the right time based on my data to say that I should be watering because if you over water or do it too soon not good if you under water that isn't too good so the timing of an irrigation system for example a sprinkler system and something a lot more sophisticated would also probably be be useful in order to do that so I think there are lots of applications there are supply chain applications in India for example there are companies that are using clever applications in the emoney world so to speak which essentially says that how can I get the supply chain working it's digitization but they're also clever algorithms in being able to do that fertilizer construction what is the Reg NPK composition to be used in PK nitrogen phosphorus potassium composition to be used in order for a particular effect particularly fertilizer mix that's a design problem best solved by again taking data and saying which one works best for which crop under what conditions to dynamically not the same composition every year what do you want to plant this year what seeds have you gotten and therefore how does that match to the best fertilizer composition oh it's a fun world it's a fun world if you are in that world welcome to exciting times I think also sir there's a lot of people asking you know while they are interested to learn they are not very sure if like a coding experience is mandatory and if if yes or if no they they're not very sure on to what extent should they learn the I as a bit you know what extent they should be knowing you said not about AI you should know what it means to the business but I would say that knowing about knowing AI is somewhere between knowing Excel which you need to know reasonably in order to write a spec sheet and do your accounting on one extreme and the other extreme is knowing say C++ or Java which you don't need to know in order to run a business knowing AI think is somewhere in the middle in the sense that you do not need to know the coding absolutely not there is specialist in coding who can do that for you but the application problem the return on investment the figuring out is to wait you want to do this where in this picture are you much more importantly let's say within this picture are you that is not a technology question that's a business question that's where your expertise comes in so if I were you and you wanted to stay on the business side of things don't get hung up on knowing how to quote get hung up if you want to on knowing waving this picture and picture like it should I do a there's a story of an engineer who once went and knocked on a turbine and build $1,000 and was asked where is this thousand dollars why this thousand dollars you didn't come and do anything and give me an itemization I put business give me an itemization don't charge me money so give an itemization one dollar for knocking on the turbine 999 dollars for knowing way to knock on the turbine Rick we want to apply AI is probably 999 dollars once you know that actually doing the AI correctly is maybe one dollar maybe I'm oversimplifying but that problem the problem of solving the technology stack once you have the data in place is relatively easy knowing to do it well and cleverly and generating business value out of it that's where you come in friends and that's that's where I think you can make a difference we're looking the business world is looking for great leadership around this the technology is in place more or less it's looking for the right human intelligence but thanks oh there's this one more industry-specific question so there are a few people from the oil and gas industry and I'm not sure how well versed you are but they're still asking from like basics perspective what are the applications of AI and machine learning in their industry in the oil and gas industry clearance in oil and and making things up on the fly as you can figure out equal opportunity ignorant in these things but for example ordering crude let's say you're trying to figure out whether I should orders sweet crude or sour crude if you order sweet food for example you'll get more in the business born in the market if you orders on the other hand it's going to cost you a lot more if you order sour crude then it's going to cost you a lot less however is going to damage your refinery so therefore you need to make an optimal decision based on saying that based on the cost of the crude based on the price that I will get at the end of it and based on the damage that I'm seeing with sulfur deposits it says saturated that I'm seeing on the refinery what should be my optimal position on crude choices good optimization is something that I'd worked on years ago etc so that kind of optimal decision respect to crew then for example if you are looking at oil pipelines itself by pipeline inspection gauges and as they pull Peaks this is not an animal this is a device so for example what is pickable so if you have a pig that's going through your gauge what kind of information is that pig gathering if you're going through for example an elbow joint on a pipeline this is where this is where the oil is going to hit the pipeline is going to see a lot motion should you reinforce that when should you reinforce that when should you send in a peak in order to be able to see this if you have a very good AI algorithm that pig is going to get you better images at higher resolution going fewer times down that pipeline at the end of the day a well-designed pig is going to save you a lot of money in order to be able to understand therefore how to maintain oil flow so that one damage is minimizing so the joint management can be done better at your service this is a very the applications because these my friends are in difficult places as you know and so the service engineer cannot be sent to waste his time and so they put it out they have to be sent in tactically and strategically and when the failure is imminent and not after it has happened so anything that can see that from the inside is very good so in addition to food optimization and sort of clever pigs there of course many other applications are out there that again is an industry where I think lots of sparkling applications are image I definitely see this is very the domain is so vast it's industry agnostic and right from farming to oil and gas and services ecommerce you covered a lot of the different sectors I just include with one last question this is a very interesting one where someone has asked you know how do you give you know weight edge to human judgement versus say what if there is like a difference in prediction or outcome how do you you know decide okay so there's many many ways to do that let me give one technical and an example of this the wave feedback is incorporated through air analysis or through reinforcement essentially what happens is that that the algorithm the algorithm is needs to be told as to what is a good outcome and what is not a good outcome and that to some extent is where human judgment comes in so the human essentially needs to tell the computer that this is good and this is not good for example let's say self-driving car if you having a self driven car and the car needs to be told that this is a safe distance not just from the gas perspective but from the human's perspective as well if you leave the car the car would say oh I can stop within 10 meters this guy will not be hurt so think of the cars perspective if I am sending here in the car stops here one meter in front of me I am NOT God if it's ten meters in front of me I'm not hurt so the car will stay I'm going to stop one meter in front of you my brakes will then break down a lot less you will not be hurt either way please don't do that please stop a lot faster that's in judgment so the car will allow me to use your judgment please use my judgment human judgment and stop at least 10 meters before the car before the human despite the fact that those extra 9 meters is just buffer as far as you're concerned they won't kill anyone so they've baked into the rules the human judgments is baked into the definition of the error and into the reinforcement rule success this how it's going but in time he I systems will develop their own notion of what is intelligent and what is not and people are very excited about that and people are very worried about that as well in other words will the AI replace your judgment with his own judgment and then decide that you are going to die anyway and I'm going to stop the car 1 meter in front of him so that's a scary proposition but right now we are in a position to include our judgement in the quality of the optimization rule but still be very careful in framing that simple statistics doesn't do that very well and there's a danger to that that is where alright I think we're past the hour so yeah actually there are quite a few questions but I have passed 5 o'clock mark paucity of time we'll have to end the session thank you so much sir I think the session was very very insightful and there were lots of people participation participating and I'm sorry we couldn't answer all the questions but we I think we'll organize more sessions going forward to you know address some of those lines of thought thank you everyone for attending for more such sessions we are going to post on great learning corporate academy every every second day we'll be doing a session going forward you can log on to great learning corporate academy for details in those sessions all right thank you very much take care stay safe
