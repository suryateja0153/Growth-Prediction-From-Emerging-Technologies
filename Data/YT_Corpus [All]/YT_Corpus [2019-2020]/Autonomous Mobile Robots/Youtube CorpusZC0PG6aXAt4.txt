 hey everyone my name is kajal and today i'm  answering the question can you enter the field   of robotics engineering from other engineering  disciplines in today's video i'll talk about six   different subfields within robotics engineering  and talk about which fields are good if you're   coming from a background of mechanical electronics  mechatronics or computer science i've included all   of the timings here and in the description below  and this is your gentle reminder to hit the bell   notification when you hit subscribe so you're  notified every time i come up with a new video   so without further ado let's get into it number  one designing a robot given a task you need to   decide what type of a robot are you going to use  you need to think about is it going to be a field   or a legged robot if you're going for wheeled are  you going to go for a differential drive try cycle   or a four wheeled robot essentially you'll be  deciding on the actuators and sensors to use to   build your robot so that it solves the problem at  hand now remember you also want to build a robot   that is lightweight efficient and cheap you're  also going to have to think about the battery   how long will the robot run and how much weight  it will add to your actual robot this field has   a higher focus on mechanics and electronics and  that is why it's also often known as mechatronics   the second subfield is robot modeling now that  you've decided on your actuators and sensors   and built a robot you actually need to create a  transformation tree on how these different things   are connected how is your robot's body connected  to each of the wheels or sensors that you've   added to your robot this involves thinking about  forward kinematics inward kinematics jacobian and   creating a transformation matrix while it might  seem like you'll be working with the mechanical   parts you'll also be working with software like  solidworks to create cad models these are great   for creating proof of concept and figuring out  the sensor coverage this aspect of robotics has   a higher focus on mechanical engineering and  a bit of your imagination trust me you'll be   flying around with your fingers to figure out  the jacobian the next subfield is controls the   simplest use case of control is ensuring the robot  drives straight you use controls to adjust the   robot trajectory due to wheel slippage actuators  or even sensor errors another controls project   you might have heard of is an inverted pendulum  keeping it upright using a combination of a cart   and a pid controller this should tell you that  controls is about a combination of mechanics and   software engineering you need to design a system  of actuators and sensors to create a feedback   loop and you need a code to send in the control  trajectory our next subfield is the popular   computer vision and image processing subfield  cameras are becoming more and more popular as a   sensor choice image processing is about extracting  useful information from the data you received from   your cameras maybe you're looking for a specific  object or you're using this information to create   a map around you so the robot knows where it can  drive this aspect of robotic engineering is more   focused on software engineering you need to know  how to code and you need to know a few algorithms   to be able to do computer vision our next subfield  in robotics engineering is perception cameras are   not the only sensors a robot uses you also  have light and sound based sensors such as   time-of-flight cameras lidars and sonars you  also have haptic sensors for a sense of touch   working with all these sensors comes under the  umbrella of perception your goal here is to   understand the world around the robot to make  decisions such as where the robot can thrive   or where the robot can pick or place an object  so in that sense image processing and computer   vision does come under the umbrella of perception  again this aspect of robotics engineering is more   focused towards software engineering our next  subfield in robotics engineering is navigation   and path planning this subfield comprises  of localization mapping and path planning   localization is about identifying where your  robot is and mapping is about creating a map   of the environment around the robot in this  sense mapping is a combination of perception   and navigation now localization and mapping can  be done separately or they can be done together   which is called slam simultaneous localization and  mapping next path planning is about creating the   path for the robot to go from point a to point b  versus motion planning is about how the robot will   actually drive from point a to point b  motion planning is more about computing   the actual motor commands for the robot to  drive and the same applies for manipulators   how will the robot go from point a to point  b and how the different joints will rotate   to achieve the second location generally people  specialize in either mobile robots or manipulators   when it comes to path planning again this area of  robotics engineering is more focused on software   engineering where you need to know how to code  and you need to know few algorithms so depending   on your area of interest you can enter robotics  engineering through a background in mechanics   electronics mechatronics or computer science if  you're someone who's looking to enter the field   of robotics engineering you might enjoy this  other video from my channel where i talk about   ignore robotic projects before you go if you  enjoyed this video make sure to give it a like and   if you haven't already don't forget to subscribe  also
