 Cafe X is a robotic coffee bar that employs assembly line-style robots to build your coffee orders for you. This robot barista can make two drinks in under a minute and will get your order right every time. Customers use on-site kiosks to place their orders. The menu includes the usual coffee varieties. The robotic arm does a little dance and goes about its business to brew your coffee once an order is placed. Once the coffee is made, just plug in your code to pick up your coffee. A tiny hatch opens and voilà! Cafe X specialists are available to advice customers on any confusing parts of the menu or process.
