 ROS, or Robot Operating System, has been  applied in many robotics applications.   But did you know: ROS has gone underground? The DARPA Subterranean Challenge  drives robots to explore the dark,   unknown, and challenging environments  deep below where robots typically operate. The SubT Virtual Testbed provides  community resources to spark innovation   in the underground domain. It's all open  source, from the cloud-hosted SubT Simulator   to the robot models and over 50 sensor  configurations interfaced with ROS and   Ignition Gazebo. Some are based on real  robots designed throughout the SubT challenge.   A "Hello World" software set is also available  as a starting point, using eight open source   ROS packages for mapping, obstacle avoidance,  multi-robot communication ,and object detection.   For more information, check out the SubT  virtual portal at SubTChallenge.world.   If you're interested to see how robotics  developers have approached underground operation,   watch teams compete in the Cave Circuit  Virtual Competition on November 17th.
