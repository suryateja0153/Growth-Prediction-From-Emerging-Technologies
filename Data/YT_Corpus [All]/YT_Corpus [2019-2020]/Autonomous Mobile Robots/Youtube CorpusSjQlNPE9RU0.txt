 [Music] welcome to the last topic of 2rk for me for the future autonomous fractures and ever count for robots farming is the backbone of economy and is the foundation that supports a growing population we all know that we will need to feed close to ten billion people by the year 2050 however there are a lot of challenges we have to face in agriculture for example the decreased agricultural and extreme weathers and diseases and labor shortage one of the solutions is developing smart farming systems we also call it precision agriculture or smart agriculture smart phone can help improve farming efficiency through site-specific management it can reduce environmental factor in act and boost the quality and quantity of agricultural production you may wonder why exactly be smart for me we don't have time to explain it in details here but keep it simple small farming consists of three aspects they are smart sensing and monitoring smart analysis and planning and the last one is smart control among those three aspects two are closely related to autonomous tractors and agriculture robots they are smart sensing and monitoring and smart control as shown here now what autonomous tractors are also considered as agriculture robots of course all of the autonomous are functions for the autonomy tractors are designed to accommodate the general characteristics of a tractor in general and autonomous tractor work in two steps the first step is is to generate a work plan using collective data for example using GIS to generate prescription maps for various operations this may include plan and plan the path and speed of the tractor rate all various operations at each location the second step is to operate in in an autonomous way now during operation one common task for all autonomous structures is navigation so now we will talk about different navigation methods one of the earliest technologies for tractor navigation is an operation support system it uses GPS and the directional sensors for example compass to assist with navigation it will show the work history and the current position and direction in this case the driver can do multiple tasks if a target path has been defined such a system will show the driver if the tractor is on the right path and how much if it's not so basically it will show the deviation of the tractor from the right path now navigation for tractors can be fully autonomous when operating in many types of agriculture lanes as long as there are not many tall trees or tall buildings close by the GPS is still the primary technology used for navigation country however there are risks of losing connections to GPS satellites in various situations therefore researchers developed ways to integrate GPS with other sensors such such as inertial measurement unit compass and world encoders to enhance its accuracy and reliability for navigation for more challenging environments such as altered computer vision methods are used to assist navigation for example cameras can be used to detect the location of trees and use that information as a reference to guide the tractor you here I'm showing another type of navigation method it's called automatic following system the position of the wagon is based on position of the harvester this is also a very useful navigation method because it requires only one person to operate in multiple vehicles although navigation is the foundation for autonomous tractors it is useless without performing certain tasks some tasks can be as easy as doing tillage here and showing a rotary tillage it simply uses the power from the tractors PTO power take-off to perform the tillage in the field I say it is simple because the operation is performed uniformly on entire field a similar robot can be this window bot the tractor provides autonomous navigation while the weeding machine uses fire to kill the weed it relies on the fact that the weeds are smaller than crop in this field and the fire will only kill the smaller weeds again the operation Wars also perform the uniformly on the entire field so that's why I say it is really simple now weeding is a relatively difficult task because in most cases the robot needs to recognize the weeds first and then kill them so now I'm going to show a more advanced within robot here so this is the robot that is fully self-propelled and it uses solar panel to power itself and this robot has a vision systems to detect winds and after detect the winds it will use hints and effectors to kill the winds it uses two method one is mechanical and the other one is using herbicides to kill the weeds okay next I'm showing you some greenhouse robots greenhouse robots are really have very complex and advanced the mechanical and vision systems because a fully autonomous robot in greenhouse will need to perform fruit or vegetable pigeon tasks in mechanical arm with pick.you mechanisms and regional systems are typically required for such tasks because operating in greenhouses this robot must be come back and be able to turn with small turning radius on top of those requirements the most difficult part of developing these robots is to ensure the operation speak which is what limits their usage currently next I'm going to show a state of the art greenhouse robot for picking sweet peppers it is developed by warning and University in Netherland the robot uses a robot robotic arm computer vision systems and especially designed end effector to fulfill the harvesting tasks now let's take a look at the video to build the first sweet pepper harvesting robot that was the goal of the sweeper project increasing the efficiency and reducing labour dependence will ensure Europe's high-tech greenhouse food production yields and competitiveness the robot is an assembly of an autonomous mobile platform with a robotic arm holding an end effector for fruit harvesting the robotic arm with the end effector scans the crop for Mature a papist the camera operates completely independently from surrounding light conditions it gives color images and the distance map this information is used for pepper detection localization and the maturity classification peppers are scammed by looking slightly upwards by observing the bottom part of the pepper maturity can easily be detected the robot was trained to find obstacles like leaves and stems in the images to speed up the training work a simulated artificial pepper crop model and a deep learning network was used after detection the pepper location is used to perform a path planning for the robotic arm this can be a complex trajectory since the space in which the robot arm may move is very limited the robotic arm employs visual servo control to reach the peduncle of the peppers on targets for this it takes images from several sides the arm approaches the pepper in such a direction that the stem is always to the back side of the pepper the small cutting tool is positioned just above the pepper and cuts the peduncle while the cutting tool is moved downwards after cutting the pepper falls downwards into the fingers of the pepper catching device and is moved towards the pepper bin by the robotic arm the conveyor belt will be added to the robot in order to convey harvested peppers to a standard pepper trolley multiple robots and trolleys will be part of a fully automated post-harvest logistics management system now fruit or vegetable picking is not limited to greenhouse robot but outdoor fruit or vegetable peaking is even more difficult because of added difficulties in navigation here I'm showing you a strawberry picking robot it uses a high accuracy GPS called RTK GPS for navigation and then it uses high-speed cameras for fruit identification and of course here the end effector is also specially designed to pick the strawberries you okay agriculture robots are not limited to ground-based robots drones can also be considered as robotic systems most drones are only used for sensing purposes by carrying cameras they are not often used for agricultural operations due to concerns of power consumption there are three types of drums the first one is fixed-wing drone it is the fastest and can cover the largest areas with the least power consumption and the second type is mom here older type girl it consumes the most power however its ability to hover Egypt in La Habra advantages for example it can take clothes high quality images of West Pacific AtTask and the third type is the newest type is called hybrid drum that combines the fix terrains with the rotors this type of drum will allow the drum to do vertical takeoff and landing like a monkey or a drum and fly efficiently to cover large areas like a fix the windrow now for conclusion of this presentation today we talked about smarter culture which includes three aspects smart sensing and monitoring smart analysis and planning and the last one is smart control autonomous tractors and agricultural robots are typically used for smart sensing and control now navigation is the foundation for autonomous tractors most navigation can be based on GPS and computer vision which are the most often used sensors and sometimes we also integrate multiple sensors to assist with the GPS and the vision to improve the accuracy and the reliability now our cover wasn't not limited just to ground-based robot drones are also considered agricultural robots and there are three types of drones used for agriculture we are fixed-wing multi rotor and hybrid types so I hope this presentation gives you some useful insights of the current state-of-the-art agriculture robots and thank you for your attention you
