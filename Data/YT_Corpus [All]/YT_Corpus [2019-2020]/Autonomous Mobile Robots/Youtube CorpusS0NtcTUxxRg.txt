 we're on the verge of a farming robot revolution investors poured seven hundred million dollars into agricultural technology in 2017 alone but our farm bots are ready to deliver we came to lick for the state in the South of England to see how one startup is working to change the face of farming so this is Tom are monitoring robot at the moment we're in a trial space tom is looking at the the wheat crop that we have here and and governments are analyzing whether where the weeds are looking at the the health status of that plants are looking at any disease issues nutrient issues where he's just taking high-quality digital images top-down at the moment and that goes into Wilma who's our AI Wilmers artificial intelligence matches the images to precise GPS data generating a map that's accurate to within two centimeters the farmer can then zoom right in on specific plants potentially isolating problems before they can spread for Andrew hoed the head of lake for the state it's a game-changer late for the state is a four thousand acre estate that's about eighteen hundred hectares with such a large area we can't realistically cover every part of the estate so having a bit of machinery that is in a field able to tell us in real time what is going on enables us to be much more responsive and be more precise about what we are doing the technology still has a way to go the Tom prototype struggles to cover some of the farms more rugged terrain and in its current form it can't even go out in the rain but for Andrew exploiting the data from Tom and Wilma could mean lower costs and a kinda impact on the environment like any farm we are facing into higher energy costs conventional farming also relies heavily or on inputs and the ability to be added have very targeted interventions that will reduce the amount of physical things that need to go into the crop because you've got that visibility of that single plant will mean that actually there's potentially the opportunity I think from the research this small robot company have done to take out about six the percent of the input cost now that's not just a cost thing that's a really good thing for the environment that kind of payoff will only be possible if farmers replace their tractors and combines with a new breed of technology smart BOTS light and nimble enough to seed weed and feed individual plants without damaging others in the same field for small robot company this is the next phase looking at hairy here you will notice that hairy has the capacity not just to carry a boom for planting but also another boom underneath for electric weeding or another boom underneath for some clever way of being able to kill pests which doesn't need chemicals you know we are a starting point to allow all sorts of clever technologies to be applied for arable farmers moving past this starting point will take innovation and funding both of which may be hard to come by given the low unit value of the staple crops like wheat and soy that this bot is designed for where we're going to really drive the the large increases in food production at a sustainable level it's going to happen is in arable and there unfortunately there is much less interest because from a start-up perspective the value is less which means we've got a much longer journey to be able to get there small robot company may still be years from delivering on the full potential of farm BOTS but if their BOTS can replace the heavy machinery of today's large-scale farming they could change the industry and the landscape beyond recognition you [Music]
