 with my hand look at this had at AI another company that those lighter devices and how the trajectory of the ball is tracked by the sensors and showcasing whether or not you're going on trajectory to score or not actually it didn't score and II thought it was going to score as you can see that that's what happens so it's a predictor swish motion forecasting pretty cool technology here at the Consumer Electronics Show at the AI pool that's a cool name ai here we learn dawn for autonomous drivers and this is so cool look soft very interesting company and as we see here Mitsubishi Electric is here as well and then we have the Toyota artificial intelligence ventures where everybody's being pretty much doing the same thing Leiter is a big thing all right so in summary everybody's going into the autonomous driving mode everyone is inserting lidar systems into vehicles is automation artificial intelligence machine learning to appropriately handle the decisions that are being made by humans instead of being made by they're not replaced by computers so we see here there is a little concept cars from Toyota autonomous vehicles like that that could basically its power a community they can bring you a hamburger they can bring you miss cooter peple thing all right wasn't one of the finalists I guess we have a bands as well with another lighter detector we have another one that's here another lighter cleaning robot so we have here lighter sensors for crime detection predict and prevent crime the lidar means that this device which contains with a camera of what I can see here and another lighter detector on top it's capable of autonomously moving around we see pictures again and videos with the lighter capturing again blackberry is big in vehicles now a big change we see here a cleaning machine goodbye to the cleaning people so as a vac lighter sensor and is a robotic cleaning device interesting our washing tech at TV so you want to chopping the Willetton partner somebody that can carry your luggage we have it right here completely automated electrical and this is the future of Transportation and the guy is waving and I think we're kicking out they're getting everybody out of here and thanks for thanks for tuning in to take a TV we're going to come back tomorrow with more of the Consumer Electronics Show right here with your best friend the present Hernandez you're watching the decade
