 it makes me a great pleasure to introduce Matt Matt Mason yeah let's see I I'm gonna run through his highlight the highlights of his career so he graduated from MIT AI lab in 1982 and then he did some other stuff you left that before I know it's it's it's a product of MIT also so we should be we should feel proud of that but after that he went to a CMU where in 1992 what you started right now in 82 was pretty close to the origin the the beginnings of the robotics Institute at CMU so in some way matt has had a very strong influence in in its trajectory as long as well as its culture which is think that if you've been there is something that you can clearly see including 10 years as director Matt works in robotic manipulation or manipulation in general and it just it doesn't need to be robotic it has received many important awards from I Triple E technical field the word this is why you need to bring I truly researched an automation pioneer word and more recently in 2014 as we see a trend in many of these talks he decided again that that wasn't enough who see so he started decided to join a startup company Berkshire gray which spent about five or six years in stealth mode while almost everyone knew what they were working on but they didn't want to say you just thought you knew you turned out to be right a company that works local company based in Boston that works in reporting material handling and I'm hoping that you will talk somewhere in between that connection or maybe not anyway it's an honor to have you here thank you very much for coming yes thank you thank you for the generous introduction it's great to have you all here I just you know these talks are great opportunities because not only do I like to hear myself talk but the pressure to think to say something worthy of your interest is is really awesome and so I've been thinking about what I'm going to say here for weeks and who knows we'll see we'll see how it goes the question it occurred to me as I was going through this process that the question I was really struggling with for this talk is the question how do we learn about manipulation so in robotics I think it's a lot of times assumed that the question is how do we build robots you know what cool technology can we build and transition into industry or whatever but here I want to it ends up being about how do we learn about manipulation and there are many ways but one but by observation and specifically you can look at humans you can look at robots you can look at telly robots so I'm going to go back over this little book carefully later and you can look at the robot building process and so building robots turns out to be intimately connected with how do you learn about manipulation because it's a really good way to learn and also because the you know the more you learn the better a job you can do with building them so they're intimately connected but not real the same problem but let's see so somehow I just skipped right past that so that's a thread that's running through the whole thing you might say I have this outline which kind of describes the sequence I'm planning to talk in and the first thing actually gets back to we were talking about you know when I was here in AI lab now known as csail or now known as part of csail and basically how I got started on specifically on being interested in the modeling the physics of grasping and and then I'm going to talk a little bit about how did I get interested outta get how did I get involved how did I get traction in dynamic models of manipulation and then talk about the relation of academia to industry including what looks suspiciously like a plug for Berkshire gray my finger seems to be bouncing on this button that's interesting okay so how did I first get traction in physics based manipulation let me tell you where things were in 1976 or the state of the art at 76 actually I'm gonna go back all the way to 61 so this is a Heinrich Ernst and I think five minutes ago we might have walked right past the room where this project was happening this is a teleoperated arm now that's something you don't see these days very often in videos about robotics it's a video of him smoking a pipe drinking coffee reading a newspaper okay there was a point to it right he's he's communicating to us that look you know we can relax we can be lazy and other machines do the work so this is in some sense the real point and this is like the first PhD in robotics so you know maybe that point needs to be made his supervisors were men skee and I forget who anyway is ceasing obviously you can find his thesis in the MIT archive it's interesting this is a little this is a little bit later this is the copy demo so this was going on when I was an undergrad here I got involved kind of towards the tail end of this now these people are all moving blocks around and so the blocks world turns out to be a TAS domain that a lot of different groups converged on take a bunch of toy block to see if you can move them around no real commercial application I guess but nonetheless an interesting application and a task domain you know if if you can solve this task domain if you can solve blocks world manipulation surely you will have learned something useful more generally this is what was going on at Stanford this is the instant insanity demonstration this guy Richard Paul I did a PhD thesis on it and more box world's stuff my thinker keeps oh I know what the problem is no I don't that's just a photo it's not gonna start moving okay don't hold your breath that was at Edinburgh here's a project well this is really the most impressive of all of them this is shakey the robot which I imagine a lot of you know it was automatically deriving a sequence of actions in a very principled way from statements of goals and world models and axioms that describe the actions that it can do and but it's inbox world - it just has really really big blocks and it doesn't have a gripper so in fact a lot of people forget that it was a mobile manipulator in fact I yeah not too long ago I ran into one of the guys who did this paper and I said to him I said to him like hey you know a lot of people haven't noticed that shakey was a manipulator and he said you I didn't have a manipulator so drives me a little crazy but and in Japan too so this is at the electro technical lab so you know really it was an amazing convergence of opinion in these groups that the blocks world would be an interesting place to work and a lot of stuff going on now well actually not a lot of stuff you know compared to now it's a I've probably shown you maybe even half of the groups that we're doing this kind of stuff and a lot of it was focused more on vision really than on manipulation I think people were more excited thinker bounce is just gonna drive me crazy this whole talk when I got here this is what we had in the lab this was called the MIT arm it was designed by the same guy that built the Stanford arms that we were looking at a second ago Victor Shimon it's got this nice gripper and you know we were using it a new box world stuff okay and now so here's where the story begins like I'm a new grad student I have no idea really what research even is ok I can remember going into the physics reading room thinking okay I'm supposed to go read journals and pull out a journal and if like I cannot make any sense out of this at all right we go to a talk and the AI lab maybe somebody's talking about linguistics you know and I just don't have you know or you can go in and stare at your monitor and think ok I'm doing research now I'm writing code you know nothing's happening so how do you get traction right how do you first you know what what I think this means is how do you first learn something new not you know no not just new to you but new to anybody right how does that first happen and for me it was with this arm I decided I would try to move a queen around on a chess board ok and so we just pick up the Queen and put it down and pick it up and put it down and pick it up and put it down pick it up and put it down and oddly after about five or six moves the Queen would fall over okay seems simple enough why should it happen if it's going to happen watch happen on the first move it never happened on the first move it was always after several moves okay now what I think was happening was this in in time in real time the process seems stable but if you look at it as an iterative process it wasn't so let's say there's initial error where the Queen is a little bit to the left of where it's supposed to be when the grippers squeezed that it would tilt it a little bit and then it would move it somewhere else and place it down and let go of it and when it lets go of it there's a little bit of potential energy in that tilt and it would rock back and forth or maybe it would scoot a little bit when it so I made a video I did an experiment you can see there's a recent experiment because CSS BG up there so it started at this line and I'm going to consistently nudge it to the right and you can see that perversely it's moving to the left and it may not be quite obvious to you yet but pretty soon it actually covers up that line it's not you know it's not it's not deterministic you know it doesn't always move to the left but it tends to and I did I tried a few different scenarios and this happens pretty often you take a pop bottle and tilt it on it put on a table and tilt it let go and it'll slide so maybe that explains what went on now there's an interesting thing you can do let's suppose that instead of grasping at the top you just thought you're going to grasp it at the bottom oops finger bounce damn I gotta push it again no problem right there it's not gonna it's not going to go back to the left you know it it's it's this mechanically robust thing that happens with pushing you're not putting energy into the system that could end up biting you instead you're you're the energy is getting sucked out instantly by the friction okay so it turns out that grasping squeezing things at the bottom can be sometimes or mechanically more robust okay so now remember I'm just a newbie I don't know what's going on this is interesting I don't know is it important I don't know here's another thing that I did I was you know we were all very excited by what the people at SR Ayad did with shakey the robot so I'm thinking okay I'm going to do some formal stuff I'm going to like make up some axioms and I'm going to take this program I'm not going to try and derive the program from the goals that's too complicated I just want to prove that this program works so you know what could be easier right this is like the simplest blocks world program squeeze the block move it to where you want it and unscrew that this program works now I knew that I wanted to worry a little bit about error maybe because of that thing with the Queen so let's say we're not going to assume that the position of the object is perfectly known and in that case the problem is this is where I got stuck right assuming this is the initial condition and you close the gripper how can you provably end up in that state you know what are the axioms - right what's the reasoning process and I could not solve that years later years later I realized that you can set up the that you can choose a coefficient of friction such that that actually will not work so in retrospect it's really good that I couldn't improve than it would work this is the one that actually caught my attention this is what I worked on for the next like 30 or 40 years okay but but most most notably and it does what I did for my PhD thesis is show that even if this thing is cocked a little bit when you squeeze it between these two plates it'll straighten out and be centered okay and at the end of my PhD I actually did have a proof of that based on Newtonian mechanics based on you need to know where the center of friction is at least within some bounds you need to know the coefficients of friction at least within some bounds there's some assumptions that the friction is uniform in space and subject to a bunch of assumptions like that you can actually prove that that works now still think back you know to when I was a newbie right is this really a good problem to work on is this really going to get us anywhere nobody seems to be talking about it and then I heard this video you're it's amazing the third segment demonstrates the mounting of a hinge using two arms the arms cooperate but in one of the simplest way that is only one arm moves at a time two blue arms first pushes and then centers to locate the hinge [Music] he said the blue arm first pushes and then centers the hinge so now to me that's like that was the world right that's that's the the evidence that it actually matters because you know ernst's program did this it squeezed the block the block got centered and aligned my guess I don't remember it not being aligned okay did earn snow that did he use that to do the planning does it really matter seems like it didn't you know the instant insanity guys they weren't worrying about it did it matter it seems like it did it maybe it's one of those things that's just kind of an interesting quirk of nature that helps us out we're all happy and everything but does it really matter you know and could you get a PhD for spending a couple of year studying it you know here's the evidence that you really could that it might be worthwhile that finger bounce is amazing it's so consistent I'd swear I never had that problem with this computer it's something about this audience you all know about site ons oh there's a stupid question isn't it how many of you know about site ons there's a theory that I learned at MIT it's interesting that it doesn't get around very much but the idea is that that you know demos work until the audience shows up and looks at it and you know what is the cause of that effect it's because visitors omit site ons from their eyes which interfere with your experiments and the bigger shots they are and the more bigger wallets they have of course the the more site ons they admit anyway this was a IL ab culture okay back in the day so I mean this is a little goofy but you can look at this as a kind of experimental thing right Ernst didn't think it mattered I guess I would guess the people that did the instant insanity the people did the copy demo none of them thought it mattered but I did the unstable Queen and it seemed like it mattered there the hinge assembly that was Bob Bowles by the way doing the narration the same guy that invented ransack Bob Bowles it mattered for the hinge assembly Russ Taylor he had a PhD thesis where he squeezed a lid in a box together like this two times to get them nicely aligned with each other okay so you know so there's a kind of experimental evidence now this gets us to the question that I first asked which is that finger bounce again and okay yeah forget you saw that you know what do we learn from well you can learn from watching humans for sure you can learn from watching a robot okay there's a robot telly robotics is a nice way to learn stuff right because one thing is that if you want to learn from a human there are limits you're not allowed to take them apart okay but you can take a telly robot apart right you can put a scope on the signals and you can play games you can put fuzz on the on the picture that the guys getting in order to you know see how much sensor noise he can stand and so there's a lot of things you can do with telly robotics that's very nice that way but all of these are you know I'll call it well all of these are manipulation systems where let's say intermittently you can push some desired behaviors through and then immediately you can see whether you're getting those behaviors out of the system now there's a fourth system I just need to do that I need to learn a new somebody somebody's over to was the guy's name a French guy who worked in Telugu buttocks and he said you know if you if you have a person that programs a computer you can look at that as being remote in space like teller robotics and time okay and so let's say we give the desired behaviors to this system and then there's a robot in this system but then there's a wrapper so this is like this term still current and software engineering if you have a function and you don't like the the face you wrap another function around it right to change the interface so here you have an autonomous robot which has some scope some capabilities right and what you want is larger let's say scope or difference goes out of capabilities and the rapper is this programmer right who's going to write some code to make up the difference and then when you're actually running the behaviors the programmers out of the picture I would have had them smoking a pipe and drinking coffee like Ernst but my artistic skills aren't up to it so you just taken a nap okay well the robot does all the work so that's a you know space-time tele robot I'm calling it I don't know if others have come up with a better name for it no bounce so okay well I'm coming back to that at the same time so let's see there's an interesting thing happening I was trying to write a book I thought oh I'm gonna use a book to organize my life organize my career I did this work on grasping that used quasi static models what you know how do we organize all of manipulation and it occurred to me then that if you then you could view earlier work let's say on path planning collision avoidance by people like Tomas lisanna Perez who developed the configuration space technique and and many others you could view that as kinematic manipulation the model that's in your head when you're developing an autonomous robot that's just doing past planning and collision avoidance is entirely kinematic right your model is that it's either attached firmly attached to the gripper or firmly attached to the ground and you're avoiding collisions because those would be kinematic constraints that you don't want to violate so you could call that canoe Matic manipulation now if you want to worry about the stability of a grasp or when you're stacking up blocks you want to worry about this ability of an assembly you could call that static manipulation because you need to make sure that you have a static equilibrium in those cases the stuff the kind of stuff that I have been doing was quasi static manipulation and then that suggests you know so here you have a kind of progression there are many different ways of looking at manipulation give me I'm not saying this is the way to look at manipulation but it's it's a way to classify skills in terms of these mechanical models now it's a little tricky because every manipulator you can't build any manipulator at all without having some dynamic models right so I think in terms of the rapper the the space-time tele robot if you have a robot that can control that can follow a specified trajectory and then ask yourself what model does the programmer need in order to add these other capabilities to that okay that's I think the right way to look at this so it kind of stipulates that programmers have these models in their head and I've tried and tried and I cannot figure out a compelling argument that humans beings have models like us and their heads but but that's okay we don't have to prove that we're all engineers we're all from MIT we love models right engineering models classical mechanics models I think I'm not sure I'm saying universal agreement with this gonzo okay well okay what can we do with dynamic manipulation so you know for me I've been doing this get static and kinematic was kind of looking back and the question is what can we do with dynamic manipulation now dynamic manipulation turns out to be interesting for a few few reasons first off it's hard it's really hard I mean if you're looking at it especially from a planning point of view okay I had actually I'm it's hard to believe it I've actually become kind of comfortable with a six dimensional state space okay the configuration of a rigid body or of a gripper in in space would be you know X Y Z uh pitch roll six degrees of freedom actually let me take that back I wasn't comfortable with that at all we almost always did planar problems I'm really fairly comfortable with three-dimensional state spaces okay XY theta but when you throw in dynamics now you have twice as many state variables right because now momentum counts so you need X dot y dot and theta dot as well but dynamic manipulation is also powerful for the same reason okay because if you're not doing dynamic manipulation if you're doing quasi static or whatever okay the only action you get is when there's contact and that means the objects workspace can't be any greater than it can't be significantly greater than the manipulators workspace whereas if you have dynamics you can use your limited workspace to pump up is some momentum right and then that momentum is integrated to give you a motion outside of the robots workspace so okay very very fancy way of saying now we can throw things but that's it's good stuff right and it it's I couldn't resist okay it is beautiful I don't know why I think if you ask why I think it's because we're at that evolution selected us to favor people who can throw well because perhaps because that's good in hunting or in warfare or just the other day it occurred to me it might be you know one of the great things about being a human is that we have these these dogs that that that seem to like us and hang out and they're really great companions and everything and they love to play to play fetch and I can't help wondering if maybe they and we are evolutionarily programmed to play fetch together so it could be that in any case the people that are good at this you know we give the millions of dollars and you know you should go online and do a search on Drew Storen d-r-e WSTO re and we don't have time to look at all this kind of stuff today but there's a thousand frames per second video of Drew Storen baseball pitch and it is amazing and if you do the math in that baseball pitch over the acceleration phase of the baseball that baseball is getting an acceleration of about a hundred and forty gravities okay it's astonishing now that's a professional I am going to show you a video of what I'll just say ordinary people do maybe they're not ordinary I think it probably they also are highly skilled and spent a lifetime and so much going on here it's really hard to fathom obviously yeah a lot of throwing a lot more throwing probably than you expected and some very interesting kind of throwing to like like whipping that dough around to stretch it out right is interesting and this video goes on for like another five minutes with many other equally fascinating things so for that you should google awesome skills or awesome cooking skills I think and you will find this video and many others like it great stuff but this is not what actually inspired me so the thing that I learned from when I was first doing dynamic manipulation was this human being Michael Kass some of you would know Michael he was a vision researcher and a computer graphics researcher and then he went to Apple and I don't know where he is now this is world-class juggling ok this is not easy stuff by any means but that that's the money move right there well not money he was any amateur but in if there there isn't really a national championship of juggling but it there's a the International juggling Association has an annual convention and they give a prize and he won he won the prize one year basically because he could juggle with his feet better than anybody else so being able to toss a club up with your foot is fairly common because you got like you know six people throwing thirty clubs around and then you drop one what do you do you don't want to stop and restart instead the whole group kind of moves rigidly and scoots around until one of you can get your your foot under the club and then and and the whole time they're juggling this pattern and then when the whole in the pattern comes around that kicked the club back up into that hole and keep juggling that's pretty amazing but but this was you know he was the only one that was really working it into his anyway okay so juggling he's very good this is a sort of strobe you know tracing from the video and to acetate and then I built a model of Michael Kass okay did I mention that I like plain erstes faces so this is this is the planer Michael Kass it's there aren't there's no power there's no electricity there's only gravity power so I was trying to figure out how can I be confident that I'm getting a very constant and repeatable torque for this system and with some help from Ben Brown who has so many of you have seen his work because he worked on some of the early raybert hoppers some of the early Boston Dynamics stuff anyway he helped me with this so this wire goes around that pulley there's counterweight there to balance the the leg and the club and there's some pegboard here and you can move the pegs around between those peg boards to vary the grasp and then the question is can you design a grasp that will do a clean release of this club so what you want is that you're going to have during the acceleration phase there's going to be no slip it's going to stay in contact with the club and then you can't really see it but there's a cable go in the opposite direction about that pulley and when that cable goes taut suddenly the lag decelerates okay and now what you want is a very clean release with no slip cleanly letting go both fingers and if you do that you get a nice throw but that constrains the design of the grasp so the game here was to figure out exactly where you could put those fingers and get the right thing to happen and look that's another strobe okay anyway not a lot of time to look at this you know there's a paper out there which has like scatter plots and it did give you a nice reliable throw and we went on to do some work but I'm also not going to show you but Kevin Lynch did his PhD thesis in this area and did some very nice work that some of you I know are familiar with but that's where it started okay this is how I first got traction this is how you know this is kind of the first time I felt like I learned something new about dynamic manipulation now I did not appreciate at that time the applications of it the significance of it that came quite a bit late a quite a long time later so let's think about what it means to throw something usually the idea that you throw something means that you let go of it so you give it them you give it some momentum and then you release and so it's flying out there on its own but suppose we play with that a little bit so suppose that you don't entirely let go suppose that you have constrained all of its freedoms but one so one thing is that humans we seem to be really good at modulating our contact force here so that I can turn that into a pin joint it's it's it's amazing that you can do that because you would think if you're if it's enough to slip it would do that which would be bad but you can hit this middle ground where you have pretty good pivoting without the translational slip and so now you can view this as a nun actuated link attached to my fingers okay and so maybe that is a kind of throwing because the way I'm controlling that last freedom is by using its momentum right I'm pumping some momentum in and letting the momentum integrate to give me some motion and you could do some other things to it so I'm not going to try it with my phone but you should try with your phones but you know there's cuz there's there's six possible degrees of freedom how many different partial constraints are there this actually ends up being an interesting problem but not for today partial closure grasping is something that's kind of been out there I know Antonio beaky has published something on it I'm not sure he knows anybody else published on partial closure grasps anyway so let's say we have a partial closure grasp and then we're going to use dynamic manipulation to control the other freedom and then the question is what can you do with it now I'm kind of going to take a jump here to show you this okay now this is work that was a collaboration with Alberto and Nikhil shovin docile and this I think is like this is the killer app of dynamic manipulation maybe throwing baseballs this is the killer app of dynamic interpolation but anyway this is pretty good this is so this is a very simple gripper it's only got three fingers the and those fingers are attached to a single motor so when that motor runs the fingers only do this or that or there Springs so that if they contact something they can conform to the show of the something okay but they can't move independently and what's more every finger has a single degree of freedom so it's one motor it's three freedoms okay it's a relatively simple gripper now if you consult the literature if you kind of survey the literature on how do you control an object in the grasp of the hand the most prominent idea which people sometimes called a dexterous hand or dexterous grasping is to have three point contacts okay that are not collinear and in which case you now if you could move those points you can control the attitude of the object and so if I can control the motion of those three point contacts each of them in x y&z I can this object will be controllable okay there was a lot of very interesting work that went on along those lines and which relaxed some of the assumptions is actually a great body of work there that's really interesting but notice that these it's a rather complicated thing right you've got to have three fingers each finger has to have three controllable freedoms so you end up with four hands with at least nine motors and what's more of the control of it's tricky and honestly most of the demos you see don't work very well maybe there's people in the room that I'm accidentally dissing with that statement but I know if you go back for example to some of the dexterous grippers that were built many years ago there are videos showing them working and even then though even in their videos if you watch closely you will see fingers losing contact you'll see the object slipping and if you talk to people that programmed with these things the usual they'll it's not hard to get them to start griping about how difficult it was so it's a challenging thing to do now so the question is can you take an incredibly simple gripper and still get changes of grass and so that's what this graph is about so we've got sort of different grasp types our nodes in the graph and then there are these behaviors that you would like to have now the behaviors that are dashed are just ones we dreamt of doing and the ones that are solid are the ones that we actually did and so and you can see there are some loops in here so for example you could you couldn't throw the object up to the fingertips and then you could drop it back to the palm and you could do that over and over again so I'm going to show you a video and this video is this is a clip I took out I just can't get this right can I so there's the gripper that's just running that motor back and forth so you can see what the finger motions are there's this triangular block and you can see we're using this this classification so these are quasi static there's no dynamics going on there and we're using external contact this is called passive dynamics why is rolling to the fingertip okay yeah and and then active dynamic one's throwing and flipping one thing I like about showing this video to this group is that you know this is so this was a collaboration with Alberto Nikhil also Robbie Pelle Nene some people at ABB anybody else I should be mentioning my Goodman ok I forgot but the reason I like showing it here is because like you know it's like twin goals for any talk right is number one you want to brag about your own stuff and number two you want to pander to the audience so I've got them both both covered with one video also it's great because any questions you have just ask away I can answer any question you've got we'll just ask Nikhil okay how do these things work now some people look at this and they say well you know what it's not that interesting because it's all scripted we were cognizant to that and you know if you listen to the video if you read the paper you know it we're open about that nonetheless you get that complaint a lot but I think that you know we learned from it you know this is the point okay we learned from this and and so I'm back to this this extrinsic dexterity is the name of the video is extrinsic dexterity is an example of the space-time tele robot I mean this is the best one I ever did that I was ever involved in when I say to it I mean watched and my apologies to Nikhil okay I I never saw him taking a nap although somebody promised to send me a picture of him napping so I could did you send it to me I'm sorry I didn't get trying to get it in the talk anyway so he doesn't have it turns out but the point is you know that we can learn from this system and and I think that's happening there are people in my lab that have gone on to ask the question of how could you plan these things autonomously how can you generalize from one object other objects and there's a similar excellent we're going on here and including a Nikhil's what's the name for you have a different name for it's prehensile pushing is that it yeah one of those operations that we're doing a Nikhil's done some interesting work on since then prehensile pushing okay am i leaving anything out is this sufficiently fair because really I mean if I wanted to draw this more accurately there were three people in there in that wrapper okay besides Nikhil pounding away at the keyboard where's Alberto and me twisting his arm okay but that doesn't help with the story of this so okay that's about all I have to say about that I want to talk about Berkshire gray but I think it ties in to everything that I've been talking about that is the question of how do you learn about manipulation because in the old days way I hate to hear those words coming out of my mouth well when I was a kid building 26 wasn't what you see Billy 26 was a wooden barracks you have no idea how lucky you were there was a wooden barracks right here but you already know that right yeah anyway yeah lost my train of thought manufacturing okay it's sad to say somehow started about 10 years ago ever all of a sudden people in robotics research started saying oh manufacturing automation is a solve problem where it's not interesting or there's no uncertainty and it's very unfortunate because manufacturing is still a really awesome problem domain to work on but you know now you know how does this interaction work so this is what they have in theory I think the technology transition office at MIT is is it still called the industrial liaison office so that's that is a great title we used to call those offices technology transfer office which is kind of you know kind of arrogant it's like yeah yeah we're gonna transfer our technology to industry my experience is that it works the other way around this is this is the theory right this is what the people in the the ILO they probably still believe this you know that idea is a technology you're going industry and then industry should supply dollars to us my experience is kind of the opposite I steal ideas and and they give us technology and then what do I give them it's not nothing but it's a lot less than our technology transition office believes I'll say that so I I think our I think we have an amazing opportunity when we work with them and and I've always been looking for and wondering like what's the next killer app of robotic something that's going to be commercial that's going to kind of feed this process and I've been very skeptical of everything that comes up so you know people say Oh domestic service robots and you look at all the visions and all these visions are really stupid oh sorry again I'm not sure if it's something let me rephrase that I just did not see them I did not see them as as possible I am I overly skeptical guy I think and I was wrong about that okay the Roomba actually was a huge success and it's a domestic service robot people like to put it down but I think that's wrong edit it's a very successful foray into domestic service robots now what's the next one you know it's like okay okay you're right about that one what's the next one Butler's they're gonna cook in our kitchen all these things you know someday and it's interesting to work on and I don't doubt that I just don't think that we're gonna have an industry there in the next two or three years or even five or ten probably so I'm very skeptical about these things eldercare you know it's a beautiful application domain whatever we can do there is is awesome do I think that we're gonna have a huge industry there in the next five to ten years doing the you know throwing up the kind of problems I'm interested in I guess you know I'm skeptical about that surgery obviously there's been a lot of penetration okay but it's not autonomous right it's tele robotic mostly again I do think you can learn a lot from it domestic service I said oh I'm writing down my list which you can't see see I had a teacher okay materials handling okay maybe maybe this is the next great driving application and the reason I think that is it shares two characteristics with manufacturing what you see in manufacturing is hundreds thousands of engineers building robots that do stuff okay and it's the space-time tele robot right they're taking the same systems that we have in the lab and programming them to do new stuff and they're learning things okay and we can learn from that you know that's why I have the ideas flowing from them to us and we did learn a lot about manufacturing and about robotics generally from looking at factory automation and we still are is still going on I think materials handling has that same characteristic it's not as big yet but it's going to be and why is it so big it's crazy when you start thinking about it I mean everything you have started somewhere else right everything has to flow and you know and it gets packed and then that gets pay you know a screw starts in a box and then that box gets in a case and then that case goes on a pallet and then that palette goes in a truck and then maybe even that truck goes on to a flatbed railroad car or maybe it goes on a ship and you know and then then it gets it you know then it gives you unpack it then you repack it you sort it you know everything you see it's not just traveled some distance which is relatively uninteresting but every time it's being unloaded and unpacked and repack and sorted and everything is there are these handling operations many of which are manual and so it's a really really huge industry there's another thing which is that oops that was just my fault there's another thing about materials handling in common with manufacturing which is that robots have significant penetration there so you know if I wanted to see something deployed in in eldercare right we have to cross a threshold that we haven't really crossed yet okay if I want to see something deployed in factory automation I just need to help them a little bit because the hardware is already they're you know doing its thing and they're they're desperate for things and and I think the same is true materials handling so you know that's my that's my pitch for materials handling I this is my this is the moment I was thinking about this and I thought I realized that I can tell you exactly when I switched from being a skeptic about killer apps of robotics to being totally convinced and it was when Tom Wagner so he was the CTO at iRobot for a few years and before that he was a DARPA program manager and the now he's the CEO of Berkshire gray and I was this was when I was the director of robotics Institute and I was kind of desperately worried about what I would do next and and the timing was perfect Tom Wagner shows up and you know at 10:00 a.m. I'm this hardened skeptic that doesn't believe anything's gonna have any impact outside of manufacturing and then two hours later I'm like I'm all in okay and so he kind of just kicked me out of the ivory tower and I guess this is a little bit blasphemous this is you know this is me and the role of st. Peter on the road to Damascus and let's see sorry I'm borrowing from Catholic teachings which probably many of you are and that's God Tom Wagner cast is God you know Thunderbolt anyway this is Berkshire gray I'm going to show you a video this is everything that you see here except for people there's a couple of people almost so this is our little fleet of robots flex bots they're called they carry bins around this is a shuttle that we also built that moves things back and forth and drops things into bins it's a reciprocating shuttle most ones you see in industry go around these long loops reciprocating thing has some advantages that are associated with the with the specific problem here you can see the boxes beginning inducted they call it into the system so it's really big and and we're selling these systems it's a it is a going concern the heart of the system sometimes we say I'm never sure whether I believe this or not but I've heard Wagner say it so I'll repeat it the heart of the system is picking and I know some of you are sick of watching videos of robots picking stuff out of bins nonetheless here's another one you really need to be careful and view these things with a skeptical eye right because you know everybody's video that shows them picking out of a bin works ok you'll see an impressive variety of stuff and their system will pick all of them out ok but nonetheless I think one thing to note here is that we are using suction but we're not but we're picking things that can't ordinarily be picked with suction so that that bath sponge that gauzy thing there or pick something where there's not a good seal or there's like a huge seam in it okay so we're doing a good job with that stuff so my thesis is that well okay yeah and I want to say one more thing about that so I've said that logistics materials handling is big but let me point something out so people I think look at what's been going on has sort of in the research community with respect to materials handling and they see a lot of bin picking and the thing is that materials handling right I was talking about this before right there's this whole workflow when Tom Wagner showed up at CMU my opinion was the materials handling was kind of a solved problem because Kiva systems which is now part of Amazon robotics had done this cool system that would bring shelves of inventory to workers that would pick from those shelves into bins and it's very cool and have these huge warehouses full of these shelves moving around and it's like wow that's a cool problem they've really nailed that one didn't they I guess I'll look somewhere else right but that's just one thin slice of the workflow okay what you have to ask yourselves is wait a second okay so well first off it's obvious humans are still doing the picking with that system or at least they were then as far as I know they still are but there's a lot more how does this stuff get on the shelf okay how does this stuff get off the trucks it has to be unpacked for the trucks it has to be inspected you've got all kinds of goopy stuff going on if you go to if you search on Amazon or robotics how do we handle your inventory I think it is you'll find a very nice video that shows all of this sort of inbound processing of the stuff coming off the trucks and there's people everywhere okay you're doing all kinds of stuff so that's the nature of materials handling there's an enormous amount of work still left and I think it's going to be a good problem for a long time for us so anyway that's all I have to say except I wanted to have to mention acknowledgments back in the good old days of the AI lab we we used our user names that's Tommaso Zanna Perez mark raybert John holler back Bert old horn and Gerry Sussman were my advisors at some point there's a funny thing that happened check time 52 minutes oh I better hurry yeah yeah there's a lot of people here that did a lot of the work that I was talking about so that's it for me thank you very much [Applause] and any questions suction what's better than he said that you're doing a good job in the suction yeah it's still just suction yeah you know Wagner's biggest problem when you recruited me there's there's a joke in the company to say it's a battery of proprietary technologies and somewhere on somebody's shelf there is a battery that's the you know the mythical battery of proprietary technologies none section related oh there's a question in the back so what do you think is the connection between your work and the very early work on industrial engineering that's an interesting question so I don't know enough so you know a few years ago I got interested in watching humans and I was vaguely aware and I started kind of poking around and found some work on what people call motion time studies are you talking about that yes yeah it's a really fascinating thing there was some interesting videos so one thing that happened was that people would put lights on limbs and they would the guys name was as a Galbreath is that right there are several - Frank and somebody who people might know because there was a movie made about them called Cheaper by the Dozen okay which is a bizarre cultural tangent but but then yeah that's not really the most famous one I forgotten now I have it's interesting it's very interesting and I know there are is a connection there are some people in robotics that have taken the systems of work movement methods I forget what the names of these things are so you know I'm not the right guy to describe this but I think it is very interesting and in fact I have a book say in my dining room table right now that's like the Bible of engineered work measurement I think is the title of the book and it's very interesting and they were there before us and you can look at their methods as and you can ask like to what extent is that is there descriptions of human workers motion related to robot programming that's all that's all I know what to say about that are you interested are you doing something related to that oh yeah cool send me an email I'd love to know more all right somebody should ask me what did I learn so far because I I keep saying that you can learn a lot from there what have you there so far was that really your question not really but we guys you guys are data view one thing I can I smell regression one thing that's interesting is that we you know the well that's too long-winded I don't know what's your other question if we look at other fields like let's say like a negative emotion you know flying robots era you see that there are canonical problems they say flying through our obstacles trying to win see us walking through fat terrain like in through rough terrain do you think this is there something similar in robot manipulation aside from been picking yeah I mean the Box world was was kind of that alright I guess we got tired of the blocks world been picking was kind of that and I think where people are kind of beginning to get sick of been picking what would be a good substitute you know Wesley cowling was reminding me today that you know she thinks the kitchens are interesting I think kitchens are interesting too I'd like to kind of narrow it down I don't know it's an interesting problem because when you start narrowing things down you get into the realm where a dedicated group of engineers can do it and a couple of years without necessarily learning a lot so it's really hard to kind of hit that middle ground of something that's going to sustain interest for a while mmm I don't know you got an idea no competition the Monsanto Paris said you told me your day there are none so maybe said what they are none so maybe you can beat him oh there are none I don't know I think I think controlling a grasp enough of an object is is an interesting one you know that's why we worked on that changing the grasp there's a lot of them manipulation is really really big you know I mean if you ask yourself like how do you define it how big it's like compasses it seems to encompass just about everything yeah oh sorry okay let's see what can we do for them I'll tell you what one thing is it's you know we're obsessed with grippers with hands our cinema presents a we're obsessed with hands why is that you know we just like to build machines that look like us right so we're obsessed with these hands and even if you're not so crazy that you're trying to build an anthropomorphic hand you're still building something that's fairly like a hand like you know fingers you know including me if you go on industry and look at what they're using as we're morphic hands are non-existent grippers even as complicated as the Barrett hand or the pen hand or also I think as far as I know non-existent even even the Industrial grippers that are pneumatically driven and just snap open and closed even those are actually not as common as you think vacuum totally dominates and after vacuum there's other things you know that are more kind of specific to the task man attic magnets and things like that so now you can look at that and say well but you know suction cups are boring and I guess that's kind of what everybody has done I actually you know one of my students oh man I should be saying this because he's working hard on it right now so I'll keep it vague but I think I think actually looking at what you can do with suction cups is a great idea one little thing I'm sure there many more I have another question yeah and this is not my question because of the connection with Tomas Lozano I I told him that if he were to record himself in video asking a question I will put it here and the challenge was that he had to ask the question before seeing your talk so he didn't record himself but he sent me the question and the question was why didn't you solve it with that deep reinforcement learning and I'm gonna hold you to an answer first off I don't really know how to do deep reinforcement learning I have actually been working and learning for a long time but but my students actually do all the work and many of them do know how to do that so that's not the answer why not do it all with deep reinforcement learning you can't remove the deep under reinforcement if you want I mean to some extent so for instance that gripper that simple gripper that we built that was designed to support machine learning the initial design of that was such that if it grasped an irregular shape the number of stable poses would be subject to certain assumptions a small finite number and then so then if you could train with an object for a little while you could learn the algorithm that would map from the finger encoder values to the object pose so the idea was machine learning of of haptic I'm telling you you you did actually did this right you're the one that did it yeah yes sorry that I described that correctly you know so I don't know I'm a believer in learning I'm not a believer that learning is everything I think I think that's probably it's probably not I also don't worry about it a lot so you know there's some people that think that oh this is all going to be you're gonna be overwhelmed by machine learning you don't need models we'll just learn everything and I mean first off that doesn't address the question of how do we learn about manipulation except that it could help right so that would be nice I'm don't worry about being made obsolete I don't know why not I think there's another question another way of looking at it which is the people who worry about this I wonder why more people don't worry about I mean why are the people that are doing algorithms for let's say you're developing a proof system for Python certification programs certification or something like that are you worried about being overwhelmed time machine learning is everybody worried about this I think the reason roboticists are worried about it is because robots moving looks so cool for the machine learning people pick machine pick robotics as a good demonstration medium because they'll get a lot of views and and a lot of interest and so you know it's a good thing that we attract all that interests but it could also cause anxiety I suppose I don't know because I guess I think that it never occurred to me that that was the way to learn about manipulation except maybe that one time you know questions question is do you think the first truly generally useful robot in a home will have a suction cup or no or do you think it's do you think it's mostly a like in the warehouse suck the thing drop the thing type of a thing yes well so first off if you look in your kitchen what do you find okay I will bet you have at least a hundred maybe a thousand tools in your kitchen okay so when we talk about a human that's doing manipulation you know we think about the hands and we think about how amazing the the hand is okay well it is amazing and not arguing against that but in an applications context okay you are going to have an amazing assortment of tools right now the the thing that the hands are you know like look at the hand is being great for two reasons one is that it is even naked very capable but not so capable that you don't need a thousand tools in your kitchen right so you know it has its limitations in scope - the other thing about it is that it's really really good at changing tools okay and so I you know I we didn't go down this path but you know I have some video of Julia Child cooking and one thing you notice is that her knife is flipping back and forth from the you sit position to the stoic position in a fraction of a second very very quickly okay and you know when you're getting ready to do a job right you're gonna set things out in such a way that you can switch tools very very quickly so now what does this have to do with the question about suction cups I have a suction cup in my kitchen now so that's so my answer to your question was easy depending on how you define a robot a human is a robot and I so I'm a robot and I do have a suction cup in my kitchen so you know question answered I think the more interesting question is this with robots you one thing that's going to change tools a lot people who are into anthropomorphic as a Remora 'fuck systems humanoids and hands and so forth they like to say well we don't want to have a whole new set of tools for a robot so our robots are gonna have to hit use our tools and therefore they're gonna have to have our hands okay I don't know that I believe that I think when the time comes you will say no I'm willing for my robot to have its own spatula that it can interface with more effectively and what's more my robot could have a spatula that interface is not just mechanically but with power and signal and so my robot actually can have better tools than and it can also have anyway so I'm sorry I'm kind of you know here's your question you know yes [Applause]
