 [Music] The lab we've been working at has been doing localization, multiple-agent SLAM for a long time, and this is really a big chance to field-test that and switch on a lot of the real nitty-gritty details and really start to work with that, sort of fleet of robots as opposed to going from one robot to many. [Music] We are now creating a big global map and using that for global navigation. And on top of that, we're computing 3D frontiers, so any places in that map we don't have information or we think there might be an opening, the robots will be attracted to it and exploring these frontiers autonomously. [Music] We've started primarily strong multi-agent frameworks with a spinning LIDAR suite built to common perception backpack. And then around that we've really built this multi-agent exploration. So the drone's able to explore by itself, the robots, with these global maps, can determine these frontier points and autonomously explore. But really we send in this large Titan robot, big tracked robot, that deploys comms nodes and every other robot fans out from that and reports back into our comm backbone after it's finished exploring. So if you have this sort of multi-agent autonomy, it's really going to let people interact with those agents in a really effective way and enable the sort of remote operations that we're after.
