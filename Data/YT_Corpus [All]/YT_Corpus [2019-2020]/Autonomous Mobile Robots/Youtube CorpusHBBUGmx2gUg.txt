 I'm Chris Heckman, I'm in the department of computer science and I'm an assistant professor. My research is about robotic autonomy and so that focuses on how we give robots the ability to perceive their environment and act within it. And we do this from a theoretical level being able to build the algorithms that can do this, but also from an experimental level. Fielding robots, ground vehicles, different kinds of sensor modalities, different kinds of capabilities to be able to do things that people thought never would be possible with robotic platforms. Well CU Boulder is first of all one of the most interdisciplinary places I've ever worked. It is truly interesting how I can go and talk to folks from aerospace or electrical engineering, mechanical engineering and we all have our different ways of solving problems but even especially in some of these more recent robotic competitions that we've been participating in that we can still have the same conversation and have our individual goals but also a shared goal. We have a very strong open-source contribution and community that supports that both given that within the lab and outside of it so visual inertial calibration tools for cameras and IMUs, different kinds of autonomy tasks so for being able to do stochastic model predictive control has been a type of software that we've operated in for a long time, and finally, visual inertial slam or simultaneous localization and mapping. The ability for us to just slap some sensors onto a device and then say build a map and where are you within that map as you're walking around or as you're moving a robot around, those are tools that we've developed and take a lot of pride in. Just seeing the ecosystem of robotics and perception grow here at Boulder over the three years that I've been here, to me that's been like it's been awesome to have new collaborators that came from my lab so we have a shared language but also to see the field evolve as it has and mature as it has into transferring what we're doing here and bringing it out into the industry.
