 [Music] hi everyone welcome to 5-minute science you never knew today we are talking to researcher mr milan groschev whose work is focused on the network of robots i say it again networks of robots so milan tell us about your work hi zoe i'd be delighted to in the recent years we are witnessing the growth of cloud for storing and accessing data and applications over the internet this presents an opportunity to put robot applications in the cloud and access them over the internet the google self-driving car is an example of this it uses maps camera vision and driving trajectory collected in the cloud to know the precise location of the car and therefore navigate it on its own we've been along able to control robots remotely in order to perform different types of tasks such as movement flying a drone video surveillance inspection deep underwater or even space missions but now using coordinated sensors embedded computers and even people a new generation of network robot is being born together they can perform tasks that are very well beyond the abilities of a single robot or multiple uncoordinated robots robotics is expanding in several directions today and the applications that are envisioned are very numerous and diverse we expect robotics to be more persuasive in the near future it will be present in our homes for cooking cleaning and also as companions in our offices hospitals streets even maybe conducting an orchestra that sounds really powerful milan so what is this piece of your work as a researcher at the university carlos tarcero in madrid i am exploring the use of intelligent 5g solutions that integrate edge computing to understand how we can improve today's robotic systems edge computing provides computing capabilities close to the end user ideal for mobile robots because it offers ultra low latency environment in the range of 10 milliseconds with high bandwidth and real-time access to radio and network analytics this what we call intelligent edge computing can be applied to dynamic environmental changes where fast reaction from the robot is required and all the algorithms that control the robot can now be placed in the intelligent edge my research is funded with 5g dive one of the european horizon 2020 projects in which we are implementing and testing applications such as digital twin or zero defect manufacturing applications that can help humans in a day-to-day operation and help us implement the idea of smart factory so if there is one more message that you want the audience to take away what would it be it is in the future it will be the robot who are going to need the help of humans not the other way around imagine a scenario where errors and exceptions are detected by robots which then contact humans that are in a remote call center in this way it's the robots that are calling to the human skills experience and intuition to help solving problems and that is what we call people helping robots helping people that's fascinating let's all help each other including the robots thank you so much for our time milan i hope to see you again soon bye thank you very much for having me bye
