 [Music] thank you for being here today we're here to talk to you about how G suite can help improve your business processes my name is ado Xia Ezra and I am a product manager on G Suite and I'm here with my colleague Christian today from AppMakr so thank you again for joining us so it's Thursday at next and by now I'm sure we've all heard a lot of great things about how G suite can help improve our business processes so yes we know G suite causes a cultural shift in the way companies work and it's loaded with a lot of technical capabilities to bring your company to the next level and help you get more dynamic and innovative but that's a lot of words what does this actually mean practically for your employees who are using these tools every day so the answer to this lies in what we're here to talk about today and we've identified three groups of processes or business processes that most companies like yours engage in and we're gonna talk through each each of these so the first is a group of simple everyday processes that a lot of your employees might engage in on a day-to-day basis so this could be getting data from the right database or creating simple sheets and slides for daily reports now a second smaller group involves some processes that become more formulated so they get done enough times that your employees decide to make them standardized over time so examples of these include you know filling out HR information or filing customer feedback to the right database and finally there's that there are those few but very critical processes that might involve a lot of customization and we're going to talk about these as well and how app maker can help you get some of these processes done and an example of that could be say a proprietary supply chain management system and we're going to talk through each of these and give you examples of how G suite and the GSP tools available today can help you streamline and simplify all these processes so first we'll take a look at how Docs sheets and slides can help you with those simple everyday processes and we'll talk about forms and how they help you fulfill those more formulated standardized processes that your company might have and then finally we'll talk about how app maker can help you build out those more customized powerful processes so we start with the first section so if you're familiar with Docs sheets and slides and I'm sure a lot of people in this room are you probably know that these products are loaded with a myriad of features that help you improve the day you were the way you work daily at your company so we're going to go through a common enterprise user flow to see how this works in real life a common process that a lot of companies can identify with is around budgeting and financial planning and this is something that we're going to explore and we'll take a look at how dark a Google Docs Google sheets and Google slides can help you complete a complete financial budgeting process and to do this I would like to introduce you to NECA soneca is the CFO of solar Mora Corp and she's leading the financial planning process for this year and she's going to do all this using Google sheets to build out the numbers and then use the numbers from sheets to power her final reports and Docs and final presentation and slides so let's get started so lekha needs to get estimates from her regions ten different plants for production volume and material costs along with a lot of other of her company's data that lives in that live in various different external surfaces with all this input with all these inputs you get an aggregated summary and like I mentioned before she used the charts from the summary to power a final document that she shares with upper management as well as the final presentation that goes with that so luckily for NECA this is not the first time that her company has done this financial planning process so she visits her companies ten Sheetz template gallery district customers have their own internal template galleries in Google Docs sheets and slides and forms and these galleries allow users to upload templates that they feel should be shared with the entire company but in addition to this there are also admin settings in case you want to restrict who needs to share who can share templates to this gallery or what kinds of templates they can share for example we've seen customers with slides template templates to enforce company branding Docs templates for budgeting sheets templates for all sorry Docs templates for purchase orders and sheets templates for budget and amongst other things and these are just a few examples of the many that exists today so solemn aura has a rich template for their annual planning and sheets and soneca uses this template for the for this year's process and she chooses to do this in sheets because of all the powerful features that exist in that product that will make that will help her complete the task at hand so first like I mentioned before NECA needs to get the numbers from the reps from each of a company's ten different plans which sheets NECA and all her collaborators can always keep working on the same file the one a one canonical version of a file which is shared vary an accessible link so what this does is it eliminates the need for users or collaborators to have to check in and out of file while they're working on it and in addition to this there's a version history that appears on the file so you can go in there for example and see who made any changes and when those changes were made and something that we're really excited about it next this year we actually announced yesterday was the ability to go into individual cells and see the version history in those cells themselves so in addition to the collaboration and the version history there are also various features that allow for data protection so for example in this case NECA wants all the plant managers to be able to see all the information in the attack entire spreadsheet but she also doesn't want the wrong manager changing a tab that doesn't belong to them so she sets a set of a range of cells and assigned those to each manager so that they can update what be essentially what belongs to them without tampering with other people's work and she can also set in a sharing settings to ensure that the document or the sheets the spreadsheet doesn't get shared out to the wrong people within or outside the company so after Necker shares the file the plant managers start coming in to present or to enter all that requested information multiple plant managers can update the same spreadsheet at the same time with no latency so that means everything they enter in the document or in the spreadsheet appears in real time which is a huge advantage that we have over a lot of our competitors the plant managers in addition to entering their numbers in the spreadsheet can also leave comments and assign action items and each other within the same document so what this essentially does is it changes this document into a conversation a true living document if you will where people can collaborate at the same time well regardless of where they might be located geographically from each other so in addition to the inputs that NECA gets from her plant managers she also needs to import some data from her companies or the systems like the CRM and the ERP systems so we're going to walk through a couple of these extra super powers that make sheets even more valuable for your company so first of all we talk about si P we've heard from a lot of different companies that si P contains the bulk of their company data so it's essentially the lifeblood of their business sheets now allows you to seamlessly export your data from si P into sheets and once you do that it allows you to now use those spreadsheet actions or simple spreadsheet actions or tools that you might be familiar with you know such as asking insights or getting insights by asking questions in plain English or conducting analysis using those familiar spreadsheet tools that you use all the time so something that we're really excited and from the feedback we've gotten a lot of people a lot of our customers and users are really excited about that we announced this year at next is connected sheets so connected sheets lets you connect connect and access your data from bigquery directly through Google sheets and here's why this is amazing this means that you can now import like tons of data massive amounts of data directly from bigquery we're talking potentially billions of rows of data directly into Google sheets and perform the same actions that you perform on any other spreadsheet simple spreadsheet as you would if you created it on sheet so for example you could take imagine taking a billion rows of data and bringing them into Google sheets and creating a pivot table or a chart and that's really powerful so it used to be much of this power was only something it's something that a select few had so the trend data analysts who the companies now the businesses had to rely on to be able to get that those data insights when they needed to make business data different driven decisions but with this integration between sheets and bigquery anyone who can use a spreadsheet now has that power of the data analysts on this at their fingertips and finally we have Google Google sheets add-on which is a data connector for Salesforce so this allows you similar to what we talked about in bigquery it allows you bring or export all your data from Salesforce directly into the sheets to be able to perform those kinds of analysis on them as well and in addition to that you can make changes to the data and then send it back to Salesforce so it becomes an essentially a round trip of data that you're making so Google and Salesforce is a key strategic partner of G suite and we're working to continually bring you more and more of these kinds of features in the future so now stay tuned for that so Google is a is about democratizing data it's says as much in our vision statement and these kinds of integrations allows sheets to more seamlessly interact with their company's data wherever it might be and we all know that your company's data is only as valuable as what you can do with it so we want to be able to allow you to do more with that so please after this and after this talk feel free to when you go back to you into your companies or to your businesses feel free to try out these integrations and try out these tools and see what kind of benefits they can bring to you and your business so let's check back in with NECA Google sheets is even more powerful when you factor in a tool like macros which helps which helps users skip repetitive work since NECA is often working with numbers reported from individual plants she's developed a set of macros for actions that she commonly takes on this kind of data for example one of her macros helps clean up the data from plans to standardize everything and make the data that already for dashboarding and sheets today you can combine the macros with all the other benefits or you can run macros online and this is just another benefit of Google sheets being a cloud native platform so now that NECA has gathered all the data the templates or the spreadsheets dashboard tab is now ready for use so the whole time when the plant managers were entering all their data and all the respective tabs the dashboards were automatically get an updated so at the end of basically at the end of the day when all the data entered necklace can sleepy simply go into the dashboard the dashboard tab and see all the various different options for the dashboards that she wants to be able to use to either present like I said in the final document or the final slides presentation but you know what happens next is even more powerful I'm going to talk about that so in the past whenever you would copy a dashboard from a spreadsheet onto a document or whatever other external surface you'd have to manually keep track of whatever data would change on the spreadsheet today in Google sheets what you can do is simply copy that data from sheets into your Docs or slides and when you change that underlying data in sheets you don't have to manually keep up with anything you simply click on an update button that automatically appears in all those charts wherever they might live so what this does is it helps save a lot of time and it helps eliminate the the or reduce the risk of having errors or compromising data integrity when you copy data from one place to another so now that Necker has finished creating the final budget report she needs to get it approved by a few colleagues before adopting gee suite she would have to download these reports or these documents onto a PDF and then use an external or a third-party tool to have them approved by the right people but today with document-centric workflows we have integrated in Docs and G suite she can do all of this within G suite so in addition to so I was talking about how she would have to download this to a PDF so imagine having a document downloaded approved and then you find out later or she finds that it finds out later that something needed to change so that means she would have to go back make that make those changes redownload them and have them re-- approved but today in G Suites you can do all of that within G suite without having to rely on any other third-party tools again this saves time and ensures that everything she's working on lives in the same workspace so now after the file is approved it stays locked and everyone who sees the file now knows that it's been approved and it can be changed unless they get the approval to change that file again and with this the annual budgeting process for Necker and her team at sole AmeriCorps is complete so this was just this was an example of how a finance process which happens in companies of all sizes and across all industries are able to benefit from the tools that we have in G suite but this financed flow is actually not hypothetical I mean this is based on real-life stories that we hear from a lot from a lot of our customers all around the world and we have an example here Gordan food services one of the largest major food service delivery distributors and supply they note that G suite is now basically part of the a of everyday lives and they've actually adopted sheets as the default spreadsheet too so real life companies and including top companies and across all industries are benefiting every day from switching over to G suite so again with all these powerful collaboration features we want you to be able to go back to your companies try out some of the things that we've talked about today and see all the benefits that G suite she go Google Docs sheets and slides can bring to your business so we'll move on to the second category which is those more stronger processes and those processes that require more repetitiveness and now that we've seen an example of what Jesus we can do in finance I would like to use the opportunity to focus on another vertical that all companies can relate to and that's human resources I mean we all want to hire people and we all want the right people working for us so Google Forms is an example of one of those other tools that allows you to do this better so to illustrate how forms can help streamline processes at your company like I said we take a look at human resources and I'll start with using Google human Google's human resources department is an example so we have a mantra which is find them keep them or find them keep them and grow them so essentially what this means is we want to find the right talent we want to be able to keep onto that right that talent when we find them and we also want to grow them in their role because as they grow they have to help the company grow as well and I'm sure a lot of companies can relate to this however whatever size you are or whatever industry you're in so your HR department probably has several multiple processes including you know recruitment selecting hiring training in duct induction and evaluation amongst other things so these are some of the things that forms is able to help you accomplish and we'll take a look at an example of that today so we'll start with one of the earlier steps in the process which is finding Talent so we see a lot of companies today you create in simple google forms to manage applications or job applications to their companies so now you can create a form to gather to collect information from prospective job applicants as well as prospective clients and customers as well in addition to this it also gives you the ability to attach or to have attachments in that Guha in that Google Form so for example for a job application for instance you can have someone attach a document which can be their resume or cover letter or if say you're the director and you're casting for the next Avengers movie you can have people upload their audition videos today a Google Form so far upload is one of those things that was a result of direct user feedback so this is something that we often tried to do with with Google or g3 products is listen to our customers and learn from that feedback feedback we're getting from them to it to attempt to improve that or continue improving the products that we provide to our customers so another thing or another feature that came about as a direct result of customer feedback was themes so inform Google Forms today your company can customize the theme of their form to match company branding and this could be in the colors or the fonts or whatever else or the background image that you want to have and again this is something that a lot of a company lot of our customers requested but because they wanted this to look like not just an external product but something that's part of their company Brandon as well so once companies have found the right candidate we see we often see HR teams use Google Forms to prepare a great onboarding experience so you can use it for instance for everything - maybe manage everything from equipment requests to training requests to also managing desk set up processes as well so Google Forms allows teams to quickly collect the data provide and they showed that new employees can hit the ground running when they start and at this point I'm going to demonstrate something that we we prioritize on a lot of our products and forms included and that's using machine learning to predict user entries so I'm going to switch over to my demo machine alright so here we have a form that I've created called new high orientation and this is actually a form that we're going to send out to candidates that have successfully gone through the interview process and they're about to start so some of the questions that we might want to ask things like what they will you be joining us for the orientation it's alright let me just add another question here I think I already used that one we let's see there we go what they will you be joining us for the orientation so as you can see forms correctly predicts what the answer options will be based on the kind of questions that you answered and I'll just take a look at another example say Oh what is the best way to to contact you so as you can see it provides the answer options for that as well and again these are just a few example or a few examples of all the kinds of things that were able to do using machine learning and forms and something else I'd like to show you at this point because I know we talked about going through the hiring process and the onboarding but also another thing or another capability that Google Forms can give you today is the ability to manage the ongoing growth of your employee so things like certifications and training so there's actually also a quiz functionality in here so for example I can turn this into a quiz by simply clicking this and I have all the options there of you know what kind of results I want if if they can see missed questions correct answers point values so basically you can customize this to whatever way you want depending on what your cost what your company needs are so we can switch back to the presentation now all right so I just talked about certifications and assessments and again this is yet another way that forms can provide value to your company another thing that you can use Google Forms for is collecting feedback from your employees and one something that a lot of g3 customers today take advantage of is the chrome kiosk mode in Google Forms and this allows you to have a basically feedback collection portal in public areas so that employees can go in there and provide feedback on anything from say what kind of food or how they think the food in the cafe is or any improvements they might want to make around the water cooler amongst a host of other things and in addition to that you can also use Google Forms to collect feedback from your customers so this is not something that's just valuable for processes within your company but also something that you can use to get input from your from your customers and other third parties as well so G suite and Google add-ons help also are another powerful aspect of G suite that help provide even more value to you so we have a lot of host of add-ons that provide additional capabilities beyond what's actually built into the product themselves so at this point I'd like to highlight one of those its called higher for G suite which essentially helps you manage your hiring process more so if you're a company that's growing significantly and you do a lot of hiring you may want to consider this it's a full applicant tracking solution that's natively built into G suite so what this means is that it gives you the best of both worlds on the one hand you can continue using all the G suite tools that you're already familiar with that your company is using for your hiring process today but higher by G suite also gives you the ability to manage all the all the hiring related data and information on in the same surface so basically all the different stakeholders or all the contributors to that hiring process will have one central place available where they can manage everything that goes into that and this is just one example of many add-ons that exist on G Street today and as you can see on the screen we have a few more examples specific to forms but if you click on the hamburger menu on forms you can see a host of others and again there's no limit to you know what you can do with G's we today we're always continuing to build ways that enterprises can use forms and other G suite products to streamline their processes better so we recently launched a pilot program that'll help include their help create a multi-step workflow and improve approval processes inside of forms so if you're if you're interested interested in learning about this pilot feel free to make a note of the URL that you see on the screen and you know go ahead and sign up let us know what you think and we always value customer feedback and we're always looking for ways to to improve and it also gives it gives you the ability to see how you can benefit from yet another cool feature of our products so at this point I'm going to end and I will invite Christian my colleague to talk about app maker yeah this is where the last part of the talk where I'm going to talk about essentially how to customize your processes also just to introduce myself I'm going to be spending a fair amount of time talking about Google app maker and that's been kind of my passion for the last few years as I was its first p.m. and help transition it from a 20% project back to actually into a product so I'll have some fun with that stuff as well and then we actually have even one of our customers come up and talk about NAB maker so in general you've seen what it does provided a lot of really powerful technology where it's just out of the box it gives you great functionality so what I'm gonna focus on today at least just for this part is to kind of touch that last part where if you want to essentially customize your applications your your whatever you're building and you always have the ability of utilizing tool call that maker so what does that Maker it's a low code application development environment that empowers a wider audience a broader set of folks to be able to build their own business applications and so we typically talk about knowledge workers or people who have some amount of technical understanding not doesn't necessarily need to be a lot but they have some understanding of how to work maybe with some databases or there you know centrally good with data or there also have a hand in a little bit of more modern technologies HTML Javascript essentially web technologies so people who have that kind of background and essentially have a day job where they're trying to work with data and they're working also with in G suite they'll find essentially a very powerful tool at their fingertips with that banker so tap maker I would say the three main things the the main value proposition that I think ur provides is that first off it focuses on the data it gives you the ability to structure tailor the setup the data that you need to work with so it has a built in declarative data modeling editor so you don't have to write a lot of code and you're not writing like a lot of like schema development things like that you essentially can tap into existing data sources and have that generate the structure of your data secondly the user interface is very key for a lot of the business apps that people are looking for and they don't want to have to dive in to just really get down deep HTML and CSS and things like that so what ethnic it provides it's like a nice visual design environment where you can drag and drop UI artifacts or widgets and essentially data bind them back to your to your back-end databases so that's all worked out pretty nicely and so people really enjoy that nice elevated way to build apps without having to dig deep in the code but on the third part if you do want to have precisely you know coded logic you do have that ability so you can do either a customized logic that will work within the browser so essentially if you want to have specific UI manipulations occur you can do that you can also even tap in third-party JavaScript libraries so jQuery or d3 or really whatever app javascript libraries you want you can easily integrate those into an app make your application and then on the server so when you build your app it's actually sending the the application bundle up to the Apps Script runtime server and then that code itself can execute and interact with any Apps Script service so this is very common where if you want to build an application that might say create documents on the fly generate calendar events or send emails that's all at your fingertips with the server-side logic that you have available within app maker so how do you go about using app maker well first off as I mentioned you can define your data models so I'll show a demo in a second where you can just point to a spreadsheet and have that generate for you secondly you go through and design the UI just drag and drop and data binding and maybe some final customizations and then when you're ready to press that well you can preview it to get your own working version ready and then you can publish it and send it out to your your you know in your department folks you can actually go through and pick and choose who can access your application you can define the roles such as admins or basic users or what have you you can even associate those roles to Google Groups so that way people who join certain groups can be part of those roles that are accessing your application so pretty pretty straightforward so let me just jump right into giving you how many people have not seen at maker before ok good so this will be a first first demo for you guys so if you switch over to the demo machine basically what we're looking at is the environment on the left side we have our three main components data so this is what we start with and then we have our UI so we have a set of pages and this is actually a template that I start off with where I utilize one of these application templates in this case I chose the starter app template which is just give me kind of like the the little menu or the header and then a little menu bar on the left and then if I want to I could do some scripts so that's where I can you customize further but for this simple one I'm going to create a simple task database so I'll click Next I'll type in what's the name of the the actual data model yeah select a Google spreadsheet so I pop open the drive picker I select the sheet it scans it it looks good I'll go ahead and click Next and then at this point it's assigning the data types based off of what type of data is in the spreadsheet so it says oh this looks like a boolean this looks like you know data dates and numbers and so forth so I'll go ahead and click create and so now I'm just taking the structure of the spreadsheet and transforming it into a data model and there's also a cloud sequel back-end so before before this was set up our admin had actually set up a default cloud sequel instance that all ethnic are apps can then work with so it's a very convenient feature if I wanted to I could go back and define my own cloud sequel instance and then this application would talk to that particular instance so I can go in and maybe do some customizations like maybe I want priority to be only a set of 4 values 1 2 3 4 I'll click done and that's basically it my data model is good to go I can now start to build out the UI so in this case I'll pop open the widget palette and I'll say let's put a form and this form will be an insert form and I can just pick and choose what fields I want to show in the insert form so I turn off the ones I don't need and I'll click finish and about a being there's my form and let's drag another item on here let's just drag a table and the table will reside below and maybe I want to make the fields editable click Next and then I'll have the other options for pagination sorting etc click finish and there we have a table and maybe if I want to I can even set the spacing above the table to give myself a little bit of separation and so yeah that's basically it so it's pretty straightforward I could do one other customization but kind of makes the the app a little easier to use we have this widget called a user picker this user picker taps into the directory model which is set up what with your local LDAP or directory service and so I'll click create to actually create this directory model specifically for this purpose so now I have access read access to all of these different fields here so if I want to make it like in a simple HR lookup I could do that actually we have a template for that which some people are using for across their entire organizations so anyway I built this out I go back to my page that I'm editing I'm gonna replace the the original owner with this new one so let me just data bind it so I quickly set this to owner and now I can just grab this other one and toss it away and now my app is good to go I click preview what it's doing is taking the application sending it off to the runtime environment which is the Apps Script server and now I can say oh let's go ahead and type in a few characters I just grabbed my name get myself like a task to do and set a priority I'll select a date I'll click Submit and then the edit record is inserted in there so this is just a real quick simple snapshot of what you could do I'm just previewing also so I just have like this little preview console once I publish it you'll see the actual application without the little page chooser and the little log window at the bottom so that's it for that demo let me go ahead and switch back to the slides and it'll come back and I'll I'll do one final demo at the end of the talk as well so I'd like to shift gears just slightly and talk about some of our customers out there so has actually been out in the public for about two years or so two and half years where we had like an early trusted tester program and then we had an early adopter program and we've learned a lot we've had a lot of customers come and they participate with us we've had hackathons workshops and they gave us their feedback and then we continue to evolve the product based on their feedback and then they've gotten to the point where they've actually built out some pretty cool successful solutions and so I'd like to take just a few minutes to kind of step into some of these success stories so first off Nielsen is one of our early adopters and they've been really great in providing feedback they actually built a really cool directory lookup application it's not even this one but it's like this application that was based off of some of the stuff I just showed you but more importantly more recently I guess they've had this efj wrap I'm sorry this is a fields manual application where they essentially support a lot of folks out in the field who are doing a lot of assessments and stuff and then they can put that data back into the central database so it basically gave like what was originally a very manual process the ability to have like a much better sophisticated UI and it gave them a way to tap in to a lot of their other G suite products so they can like create you know calendar sheets entries and things like that with this centralized system that they set up so overall they're they're their IT folks the marina has been very happy with us and she likes the fact that they were able to replace this cumbersome process with a nice mobile-friendly app that they were able to do work with state of Colorado this is another very cool customer they this is the governor's office of IT they've been with us in the early days and they started off by starting to replace some of their manual processes they literally had like old Excel spreadsheets or even paper-based processes and so once their director of IT started to work with that maker and he was involved in my trusted tester he started to digitize a lot of these processes and so they were able to create the application and use that application for handling things like the funding requests and bonuses and such to the point where it was you know relatively straightforward and a lot more smooth processes so the UI is not you know super fancy but it got it needed to be done and he was able to build it with rather quickly so they had their whole team there they're actually very engaged I just did a workshop with them two weeks ago and they had their he had about 50 people join up and just starting to get their hands more involved in at maker so they can capitalize on their G suite investment so lilo Santos he was kind of our first guy he was able to essentially jump on and start building some really cool stuff and so he had some some nice things to say about us there hollando this is the more recent customer that we had in Germany they had a more sophisticated UI that's some pretty cool things that they were able to use at maker for essentially workforce management so they managed to build out a nice UI that handled their working hours their vacation sick leaves providing reporting so the overall users like 200 people were able to access this and their managers and group leads as well find it very valuable and so the overall investment on their side was pretty trivial I mean they they had some folks that are more technically astute and they'd capitalize on what AppMakr was able to provide them so they didn't really have to spend too much time building out the UI they just focused on the key you know logic behind the scenes there and they were able to get this put together relatively quickly and so yeah Ryan lot has been our main guy that we've been in touch with you know so they were able to build a really cool flexible and scalable solution that that was able to give them like a lot of savings and time and cost and that finally we have Seagate and for this I'd like to invite John Sousa and he's gonna just give us a real quick overview of what they've been able to do with AppMakr at sea right thanks Christian so welcome everybody I wanted to review our employee profile application now this application is our one-stop shop for all employee information it's used by 22,000 employees and has about 3,000 to 5,000 hits per day we are a workday shop and I don't know about you but workday isn't the most user-friendly environment out there to both find users update your own records and so what we ended up doing several years ago was build this app and we originally built it on with a ton of servers to try to keep it scalable devtest prod environments and early last year or probably December 2017 we were told hey all those servers that you're using we're gonna get rid of them and so go figure out where to put the where to put this application and so we we quickly looked around an app maker was really the the one location to put this application in now what you'll see here is from a employee perspective for the end user perspective it's a really simple app UI we're on the right you can see the user hierarchy you can basically navigate through it there's hover cards you can find information fairly quickly about end users now from my record perspective I can go in there really quickly and update my phone number my just basically my mail stop office number now that would have taken forever back in workday because I never do it over there and I it's I'm always fumbling around so very straightforward in here this application was written in about a month by one of my developers who really had no app maker experience before he had a very little Apps Script experience but really none over on the app maker side it replaced an application that yeah believe it or not with 17 servers was costing probably about ten thousand dollars per year to run and now basically it's costing pretty much zero I think about forty dollars if we really start to nitpick at the at the cost for the default database and it leverages AP is built on App Engine which actually connects back in the workday connects on to on-premise systems that leverages cloud sequel over on the GCP side and and leverages the Google directory API so for example that my picture up there on the on the Left is it was pulled directly from from the G suite side so that's that's pretty much the the application that we were able to build cool very cool and so finally we were able to move to app maker we're able to eliminate the dependence on on pretty expensive on-premise servers regardless that they were VMs or or actual physical Hardware we were able to simplify the environment development and deployment processes couldn't be any simpler you can basically start to developing you can actually push out a pre development pre deployment aversion and test that out hit publish immediately publish out to the end users and the the improvement in application availability has been phenomenal this hasn't gone down in a year-and-a-half and whereas the old system regardless of the number of servers we had was constantly going down for one reason or another well thank you very much all right thank you so I'd like to wrap it up pretty quickly with a little demo I don't know if you caught my earlier talk yesterday but I like to do a little bit of similar stuff but actually show you visually what we do so I built this demo just to kind of demonstrate a little bit of the art of the possible so it's an app maker app that I built that's mobile friendly so you basically use it on your phone and the idea is that it allows you to digitize like your business cards or really any paper documents that you want so you can pull it up with your phone someone shows your business card you take a snapshot it goes against the cloud vision API calls the essentially the the text conversion sends back a JSON stream to your to the app maker app and then it gives you a preview and then you have the option of creating a doc and then once you create the doc you have that text saved in the Google Doc it also does other things it logs the the information so it builds up your own registry of contacts and things like that so it's pretty pretty cool and this is just scratching the surface so I'll switch over to this demo machine and I'll show you more or less what you're gonna see here so this is the app I built notice that I actually have I'm utilizing one of the the new features where I can kind of give like a nice viewport for the application and I'll talk about how it works in a second but let me just do a quick run-through of the app so once the app pops up in the preview window you'll be able to see that it's you know it's using a camera hello everyone so then I can snap a photo this is Kobe's kind of funny because like when I snapped the photo you got to make sure I did my fingers not covering it yeah that's good enough there we go so that's good enough so grab the text I was moving it so it may not be a hundred perfect but I'll create the doc and once it creates a doc I have the stuff ready to go right there all right so so pretty pretty straightforward stuff actually let me just briefly show you how it works or how it was put together so what I did was I essentially used some html5 video canvas tags I have a little bit of code here actually this is probably the most complex part of it to operate in an html5 camera to grab an image so when the button is clicked it actually goes through and snaps a shot there I take it I convert it to base64 it just makes it easier to send upstream to cloud vision API I could also save that image in Google storage if I wanted to that's a pretty common technique so then there's a vision API call here and actually actually resides over here or I get ready to call to the server to call my my actual make the actual call to the cloud API so and that is where I have this a bit of code here and I'm not I'm not going live to the line but you probably get the idea I'm setting up I'm building a request I'm I'm sending up the image I'm specifying in the the options that I want it to be a document text detection and then once the data comes back I process it and I update the UI so the show response right here comes back I say oh okay here's the text that came back from the API and then also if you recall I had this dialog here where I could click on this and actually create the doc and when I click on that a little bit of code here that creates the document for me it also sends an email out so pretty straightforward stuff and I thought for just a final demo what I'm going to do is oh by the way it sends off the email so that was my last email let me clear that up just to kind of wrap this up one thing that I'd like to do is run it in the mobile mode so if I take this is actually an old business card when I first joined Google and I was in Japan for a bit and I actually have a Japanese version of a business card on the backside so I'll take a picture of my Japanese side of the business card so once I fire up the app here so now I have the app running right there let's go through too much shadow I think that's good enough so I'll click create dock and then if we look over here on the demo machine Dada I have a new dock ready I click on that and just for fun I was kind of shaking it but if you can read it you can see what it says but I'll translate it for you so it's pretty close shark not quite exact but anyway that's my last name and my title and stuff like that so just for fun I just wanted to show you a bit of the art of the possible with integrations with GCP with vision API this is literally just scratching the surface I have other examples where your sentiment analysis and whatever but I figured it might be kind of fun to show this just to wrap it up so next slide please how about go back to slides here so what's coming so what we're doing without maker in general the next few quarters just to simplify the development so making it more approachable to our knowledge worker base so people we have a lot of different customers and companies out there that are now looking to engage their knowledge workers and so they're running their hackathons their workshops and we're working to make app maker more approachable to them so offering more tutorials more samples more videos more just fun stuff to kind of get people engaged we also are changing the product so that it will assist you in building the apps so notice when I drag and drop a form and a table it generated that stuff we want to take a few steps further and make it such that when you're in sheets for example it can say hey this looks like it could be an app you want to create an app from this and then boom you will have an app generated for you so that's our stated goal for some of these more fun assistive creation features we also have you know better mobile responsive web app development I showed you a little bit but we want to make that a lot easier streamlining the migrations from sheets and legacy tech as well as just you know touching into better access to cloud api's and then finally we want to put out our story for G suite marketplace published so if you want to take your apps and publish it to your domain or even to the external world we want to make that all set up so it's very easy to do so that's our direction and if you want to try it out feel free to check out the main
