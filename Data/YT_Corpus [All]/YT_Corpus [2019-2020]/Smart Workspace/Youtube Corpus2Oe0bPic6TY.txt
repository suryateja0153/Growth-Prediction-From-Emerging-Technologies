 [Music] I'm Erica Troutman I am senior product manager for Google Drive and hopefully you're here for new workforce features in Google Drive plus an air bus case study I will be joined on stage today by Andrew Plunkett from Airbus Jerome levy dough from DocuSign Anthony Petro and Jason Trent from k2 and Brad auralic from Nintendo seats why do companies care about enterprise content management what why do we invest here I think it's because we have this dream that through the magic of technology we're going to be able to unlock all of our company's data which is really the aggregate knowledge of all of your employees that everyone in the organization knows exactly what they need to know when they need to know it and that you enable and facilitate productivity and innovation it's really actually a pretty inspiring dream and enterprise content management systems have invested a lot of features in chasing that dream and the reality is they do a lot poorly here's the problem they're just way too complicated enterprise content management systems are so difficult to use that they never succeed in becoming that neural hub for your company's data and your employees knowledge you can take sharing as an example sharing is so difficult that employees look for shadow IT solutions just to circumvent the friction we know this because drive is often the solution that they choose or you can think about workflows the workflow systems that come with ECMs don't really meet the needs of most enterprise so business leads are forced to find alternative solutions they create duplicate copies upload those into their preferred workflow providers and aren't able to leverage what the ECM has to offer how about search well search only works within the ECM repository and since you've got this problem of not every document makes it to the ECM and you've got duplicates all over the place you know people do they make local copies that they store on their devices just so that they can get their work done which further exacerbates the problem okay well how about metadata if you want to apply metadata to your documents to help with organization and categorization you can do that if the documents made it to the ECM but you have to apply all of that metadata manually and that becomes really onerous and overwhelming and the data quickly becomes stale so you wind up with customization that takes more work than it's worth metadata that doesn't organize search that doesn't find and loads of features that go and used so what started is this really nice dream to centralize and streamline all of your company's information becomes just another technology hurdle your employees have to overcome to get their jobs done Drive works hard to be different we want to be simple and delightful to use so that your employees succeed in uploading their content to drive collaborating sharing creating workflows and finding what they're looking for hopefully that all sounds nice but we know that if you've got content on a legacy ECM it can seem pretty daunting to think about how you go from that tangled world to a more simple world which is why I'm incredibly excited to invite Andrew Plunkett VP of digital workplace to the stage from Airbus he's going to talk to us about how Airbus is leveraging this opportunity I'm gonna like awkwardly walk in front of you here thank you very much Erica so yeah my name is Andrew Plunkett I'm the head of digital workplace today beside joins just about last May and I was actually reflecting on the on the way here there's actually been a year since we we actually made a decision to go with G Suites so the decision with Airbus at us I mean most people in this room probably know our products probably been on one of our products but as a company you know we've been pushing the boundary in terms of digital transformation for a number of years and and I think we've had a number of really good successes but what really has become you know what became very obvious is that for us to truly differentiate and truly be successful as we go forward we really needed to think about what made us successful in the past and a lot of that was around collaboration how we share ideas how we share in innovation and work together across our supply chain so there's a really top down decision and we were looking very much for the tools the technology that was gonna gonna take us forward as an organization so we we set really four objectives for our organization which of which G suite was a key key element in the end in terms of our choice so the first of these was really the tool sets and our catalyst driving our catalyst for change challenging our processes challenging the way we work with tools today and actually looking at how do we reinvent ourselves using new tools and new technologies the second was around simplifying and strengthening our data security and being much smarter about how we managed our information and you know really getting on top of how do we manage protect and secure our most vital assets as well and then really the the key drivers for us were around how do we connect our work force how do we connect our people how do we share information between say one of our plants that builds aircraft in Hamburg and also one of our plants that builds aircraft in Toulouse what if they were having the same challenges how do we find that information how do we surface that information and you know these are these are the things that really drove us towards our choice 4G suite and we started the program sort of round around about the beginning of May last year and we've just sort of been working through and working quite fast on this but what have been the challenges so if we think about Airbus as an organisation you know we're not just commercial aircraft we've also got a big helicopters division and we also a work in defense and space it's a very broad product set all all our parts of our organisation have different requirements different needs for data and also different sort of ways that we need to manage the data the second sort of key challenge for us is a complex supply chain we have anywhere between at any one time between 5,000 and 7,000 partners that we work with in our supply chain if you also think that a number of our aircraft you know the parts run into the millions and some of those are all been affected by different companies so you know how do we trade information how do we work with this these suppliers and actually find the data and share the data and the information with all these suppliers a third challenge particularly for sort of defense and space and defence regulated defense pieces are we work in a very highly regulated industry I mean we we are absolutely at the top on safety security but we also work with governments who have very strict rules about our data how we manage the data things like export control but also how we manage our no data and our responsibilities to people within the within the European Union under legislation such as GDP are and then one of our biggest challenges has been the fact that we actually have a lot of existing data today anywhere between about 1 billion and 2 billion documents sitting that we now need to move and actually look at how we're going to move those into the cloud but doing that in a very safe secure manageable way and actually using that as the catalyst for how we're going to manage and then build further information going forward so if I think about our requirements so the first of these is really about metadata so you know today we have parts of our organization such as engineering who probably use to the extreme certain things of metadata and SharePoint there are other parts of our organization that probably don't use metadata at all but for us what we actually need is to get to a point where we're all using standardized simplified metadata that allows us to manage and surface information in in a much better way than we're probably doing today there's a huge amount of data sitting in our in our data stores and data banks you know how do we surface that how do we bring that forward how do we get it into the hands of the people who are designing our aircraft who are building our supply chains building our building and manufacturing are in our plants the second key thing for us is interoperability with Microsoft I mean a large part of our information today is contained within Microsoft documents you know we were obviously moving from office into into Google and there's a there's a key challenge there about how do we maintain and use that information but now use it with the G suite tools but the second piece for us is about our supply chain so you know while while it is a strong desire for us that everyone is going to collaborate within G suite tools there is still a need to maintain a certain operability with Microsoft and in areas like our defense in space where we have to maintain an on-premise you know on-premise solution we are still having to use Microsoft so there's a very key piece about how do we make sure that we've got that full interoperable interoperability going forward the third is the search and organization you know again I say we've got billions of documents but how do we surface those in a much more effective way how do we organize that and how do we find things in it in a in a much better way than we do today the fourth is really about classification so I mentioned before about the regulation how we manage our documents how we protect our documents and actually we don't want to leave it to the individual within our organized to actually make the decisions about whether this is a classified document whether this needs to be specifically filed because it contains PII type information we want to actually use smart things to automate and drive this classification so we're taking the risk away from the individual and then the last thing is you know obviously with the number of documents the number of workflows we have a very broad organization of around 150,000 people a huge number of workflows that we have today but you know going forward we want to simplify streamline and really drive that simplification of our workflows going forward all right thank you Andrew okay so I'm gonna go through I think you did a great job of outlining some key requirements what our expectations should be for a modern content platform and I'm gonna go through each of these but the first thing I want to touch on is the migration process because that's the first step that company's contemplating moving from a legacy system to something like drive need to consider if you were at this conference two years ago you may have heard that we we made an announcement that we acquired a company called app bridge which was the leading provider for migration services well we're excited to introduce you to the new incarnation of app bridge which is now available in beta G suite migrate so this is a self-serve migration tool that helps you plan for your migrations understand what some of the watchpoints might need to be it's fully supported by G suite global support and it just it comes with G suite business and up and drive enterprise so if you need more information about that you can come find us alright so cleaner metadata I was really struck as Andrew and I were preparing for this this session how much thought Airbus is actually putting into the process of migration and how they're going to use that as an opportunity to get a handle on this 1 to 2 billion documents some of those will be archived others will be living breathing documents that their employees will use every day and to do that they need to be organized which brings us to our first requirement cleaner metadata the metadata beta is now live I challenge you to say that ten times fast super excited it's rolling out now so if you want to get in there and test it out you can take down this URL and try out the metadata yourself airbus has been a great partner for us in developing this feature and we would like to show you how it works so I'd like to introduce Kody Myers product manager to the stage the lowercase H is intentional just so you know Thank You Erica as Andrew said method is amazing at organizing and classifying files but for it to be really effective and powerful you have to have unified taxonomies and it has to be easy to apply metadata to files so let me show you how we do it in Drive how we achieve this and drive can we switch to the demo as you know it new what's new is that now in your files you have a new section here called properties where you can apply metadata material in Drive is organized into categories that describe the content of a file and then each category has type properties that are relevant for this kind of category for this kind of file so for example here you have meeting notes they have a point of contact and ever project that's related to it if you have a file for example here of a budget that just it's not categories yet you can apply category let's say budget and as you can see these fields are typed so it's not just a string yeah they're strongly typed fields so if I search one person it's actually a person or not a email address or a string and we have a pre-selected list of projects here now let's take a look this file this is an invoice and we don't have invoice category yet this user Susan she's actually a team birth manager for this team drive so she can select which categories to use in this team drive she can either create new categories or she can select from existing ones so here we see all the categories that she is currently available budget and contract were created by admins and the admins decide that they should be available in all files to all users in this domain and someone has already created invoice category that's a lucky coincidence with these properties so Susan can now say she wants have invoice available in this team drive and now when you click on this invoice you can in fact apply this new invoice category to this file she can say what the amount is and especially what the due date is I was actually yesterday and will behind on this and what type this all this gets saved automatically and instantly so if you go away and do something else if you click on another file or you get distracted you never have to worry about saving any of this information all get safety instantly and the real power of metadata of course is in then searching over this so with our new advanced search I can say search for for example all invoices and because these invoices are or the categories I manage for Team drive but share between team drives by searching for invoice let's say all invoices invoices that are due this month I can search across steamed rice so if I search this you can see the results are from different team drives so I've won from the tuner I just worked on so far just made a fine but I also get results from other team drives that use the same category and simple and intuitive switch back to the slides please great Thank You hoody alright so this brings us to interoperability with Microsoft interoperability it's just a really big word that means designed to work together and we work really hard to make drive work seamlessly with Microsoft because the whole point is to empower people to collaborate regardless of the productivity suite that they're using we know that this matters because as Andrew described customers have these internal coexistence needs and these external coexistence needs you know thinking about the migration process you might not want to migrate all of your employees all at once in huge high stakes nothing migration you might want to stage it so maybe your marketing department is already using drive but your legal department not quite yet but those teams still need to be able to work together and when you have five to seven thousand partners at any given time some of them will always be using Microsoft so so interoperability really matters the cool thing is that we can provide interoperability while also solving some of those legacy ECM headaches so who remembers this problem okay I've got my Word document I'm emailing to my boss a quarterly report he's like great it's final we're done good go home I'm like whoops mmm there's a mistake I've got final v2 with traditional ECMs the final file struggle is real and this happens because sharing is difficult so people revert to sending emails back and forth to each other and it can create a real organizational nightmare with Drive this doesn't happen because you have a single canonical version of that word document that lives in the cloud that's accessible on any device and if you're using Office as your primary productivity suite it's easy to edit and collaborate on office files using Drive file streams so drive file stream for those of you who don't know is our native desktop syncing client it's at home on the desktop so you can see in this example it's mounting right there at Jay : so maybe you left work on Friday and Shea : was referencing your file server your admin does a migration you come in on Monday your files are right there at Jay : except now they're pointing to Google Drive another cool thing about Drive file stream is it doesn't download all of your data natively onto your computer you just browse your file structure when you need a document it's downloaded on demand which saves tons of desk disk space but we know that sometimes you're gonna need to have documents that are offline by default we make it really easy to make those available offline for example if you're on an airplane I'm sure that Airbus always has flawless Wi-Fi but if not there's a backup and it's not just Word documents generally available later this month you can edit Google Docs sheets and slides offline in your Chrome browser I was playing around with this on the flight out this is really really fun if you like if you like the editors now for those of you who are security conscious this section might make you a little bit nervous because what happens when you have a whole lot of data downloaded onto your machines those machines can be lost or stolen that can create a security risk not one that you have to worry about generally available now drive file stream is available in the Google device management console so what this means is that admins can log into the Google device management console see who's got what data downloaded on what devices what version they're running and a whole lot more and if you see something that's a little fishy or that laptop has been lost or stolen you can block that device with a single click and the data is wiped in seconds it's really really fast so hopefully that lowers your blood pressure a little bit if you're very security-conscious but of course all the security and the all the security features in the world don't make a difference if people just circumvent the system right that gets us back to the shadow IT problem so we want to make it very easy for users to get documents to drive which is why you can add documents directly from Gmail or Outlook to drive or insert from Drive into Gmail or outlook complete with the permission checks to make sure whoever you're emailing has access to the document so this saves you from that old you know that old dance you have to use to have to do where you get the email download the document upload to the repository need to attach something download from the repository upload to your email you don't have to do that anymore so this should make it easier to use but of course Google is all about collaboration this is one of our huge value propositions we want to bring the magic of Google collaboration to Microsoft files if you were in the collaboration session yesterday you heard my colleagues say we want to make Microsoft better on Google than Microsoft on Microsoft this is that effort and I'm gonna walk you through a couple of examples of features that get us there so the first is real time presence and this launched last year so what this does if you're using Drive file stream for for office for Word PowerPoint Excel etc and someone else seho D is in that document and I open it I don't want to create a version conflict so one one answer might be to lock you out that's not what we do instead we notify you we say you should wait to edit hodes in the document that way you can collaborate with hodie without having to be locked out of the file version conflict does occur there's a really easy dialogue to resolve the conflict also launched last year is commenting on office files and PDFs so in the drive preview so if you open a Word file in Drive on your phone you can select a section of text and add comments those comments are then natively integrated into Microsoft or the PDF if your Microsoft user opens word adds a new comment that will appear in Drive preview so that makes a nice complete round-trip and announced at this conference native editing in Google Docs for office files generally available I think like next week rolling out now so watch this this looks like Google Doc but it's not it is a Word file you can see up in the upper left there the file extension this is a word file but we're treating it exactly like a Google Doc you've got real-time collaboration going on all of the power behind the editors the machine learning the grammar all of that's accessible and all changes are saved automatically and visible to your office users so this really is true Google collaboration for Microsoft files all right but what about collaborating with someone who doesn't have a Google account at all like lawyer at law firm comm or key partner at outlook.com we're making it easy to share with anyone with pin verified visitor sharing so here you can see we've got Andrew at outlook comm we want to invite him to collaborate on a document we're gonna share with him when he receives the invite Google's gonna send him a quick check hey Andrew want to make sure it's you please verify your email address go grab that verification code and before you know it he's in the document collaborating with all the other Google users just like a full team member he can edit he can comment and all of his activity is logged all right so you can expect us to continue to invest in interoperability with Microsoft we know that it's a really important feature for our customers so this brings us to our next requirement which is better search and organization and when we think about search and organization this is really about making sure that the right people have the right access to the right content at the right time and there's there's sort of three different tools we can use to enable that the first is traditional search right so search by creator search by file type search by keyword the second are organizational tools to help you visually organize your files so think file folder structures and that sort of thing and then the third we're Google can you guess what it might be machine learning of course how many times has that been said at this conference yesterday we announced the priority page this is really cool it's a new homepage in Google Drive which uses artificial intelligence to surface the most relevant content that needs your attention that's that top bar so it's it's it figures things out like you've got a meeting coming up and this was the attachment you probably need to see it all of your colleagues are collaborating on this document and you might want to comment here this one's waiting for your approval and there's a deadline so this is like the immediate stuff you need to attend to and then it curates recommended workspaces that provide quick access to important documents along the bottom there we know that the average worker uses like 10 to 20 documents in a given week and those are sort of temporary clusters of files well we can help suggest curated workspaces for you and get those documents right in front of you so that you can stay both informed and focused and where Google it's machine learning you bet we will keep investing in machine learning but let's not shortchange human organization which is why we're also investing in team drives organizational features to refresh your guys's memory team drives is our enterprise solution for sharing and storage and launching now you can hide team drive so if you've got a long list of team drives you can select a subset of those drives and hide them super easily you can still search for the content within those drives and if you need to unhide them that's very easy to do as well in development targeted for 2019 our shortcuts so you'll be able to add pointers to file and files and folders which can really help create those associations between team drives and finally we know it's been a long time coming in development sub folder sharing is directional for 2019 I'm sure some of you in this room are thinking oh for God's sake why have you not just launched this feature already uh I want to tell you why we are in the midst of developing the new infrastructure for Drive which will make drive faster more reliable and provide benefits like greater visibility into the kind of activity that's going on in Drive it's really the next generation it's gonna be good for all of us it's a big project and it has to be completed before we can launch sub-folder sharing I want to assure you that it's a top priority we have scores of engineers who are working on that and as soon as that is done we'll be rolling out subfolders sharing so stay tuned for us for more information on subfolder sharing it's coming promise it's coming so all of those features to me are about making sure Drive actually succeeds in becoming that neural hub for all of your content so that then you can start to deploy some really transformative features and functionalities and I think automated document classification is one of those Airbus has this problem it's scale and you know how much Google likes a scaled problem I would like to invite Andrew back to the stage to talk to us about how they're tackling this problem thanks again so so as I mentioned before you know we we have a lot of regulation a lot of concern you know internally we need to actually be very careful with the type of documents we've got we deal with everything from personal data through to export control data through to military data and you know we operate in a number of countries where a lot of those countries have different rules regulations about what we can do what we can't do with data so one of the things we have to do is we start thinking about cloud is be very much in line with all the legislation or the regulation and all the external concerns pressures that we get in terms of how we manage our data so today we've you know had that had that problem has been resolved by the fact that we've had on premise storage we have all the documents stored inside our own data center but as we start looking to cloud we introduce potential challenges around how do we control the data how do we make sure that we're not putting anything into the cloud that we shouldn't be and that anything that goes into cloud is protected in the way that we need to do that so one of the solutions we progressing very much with with Google at the moment is around the use of artificial intelligence to actually help us both with the migration of the data and also with the ongoing classification so if I think about migration you know we've talked about a lot of that data we have a lot of you know different levels of metadata information about those we know who the people are that have been working on the data the type of information is contained within the documents but as we start moving things to cloud we need to sift through you know one anything between one and two billion documents to make sure that we're not putting anything in that potentially causes a breach an issue for for Airbus or any kind of sort of an abling thing on terms of the documents we also want to be able to as we bring things across be very careful about how we store things so that we can find them again search capable you know we want to be able to surface those documents so we don't want to just take whole bunch of documents and bring them in but we actually want to start classifying managing those applying metadata so this is where we feel that artificial intelligence and the training around that is going to be absolutely invaluable to us and we've started already looking at options to that and is looking very promising the second for us is then classification so as I mentioned before you know as we then create a document we want to be able to classify it but we don't want the dependency to be on the individual within our organization because you know we all know that people make mistakes or people can do things or there's bad intentions or good intentions around different things around documents so we also see the use of machine learning the use of artificial intelligence tools as being absolutely key embedded into G Suites so as we look to create a document or send an email we then tag we can then run that through artificial intelligence to them either prompt the user that this was potentially misclassified maybe that she we can see that the documents an engineering document and then it prompts for certain types of metadata so this to us is going to be the absolute key for how do we manage this volume of data in the future so it's a key thing we're progressing now and we're very excited about you know where we've been going so far with with Google on this and using tools to just tend to flow it's you know I mentioned machine learnings been mentioned a few times so I'm just mentioning it again but it's a great thing thank you great thank you Andrew so we're down to streamline just just all we've to do now is streamline thousands of workflows it should be no problem after we've moved a billion documents this is easy when we think about workflows we think they should have the same principles that drive has in general which stage it should be simple and delightful to use they should be tailored to the unique needs of your organization and they should be smart surfacing only those moments that are really valuable for human interaction and like let's keep the rest under the hood and do that in an automated fashion we've invested here we're building an approvals feature which will be available in beta in June this is our quick intuitive super light workflow within drive we know that approvals is the foundation of so many business processes so we wanted to make sure that that was just really easy for all drive users but that's just the beginning because they're they're complex unique workflow needs and to meet those we announced last week that our partners our best-in-class workflow partners support new workflows in the right-hand panel and drive so DocuSign k2 and Nintendo's in the Drake in the right-hand panel and drive and I'm going to invite them up to stage to show you what they can do first we've got jerome labid ovp of products and experience from DocuSign thank you give me a second to plug in here great so doukasen was started about 15 years ago with one purpose which is to simplify a very complex process that is very tedious for many companies which is to get documents signed it's a process that talking about becoming digital has been paper-based for you know and is today largely stopped paper base in many companies well if I want somebody else to sign a document I first send it and send them the document sometimes it's paper or sometimes I email it to them they don't have to print it sign it scan it back or maybe send it to the next signer and this process can be very tedious and take a long long time so DocuSign was created with the purpose of turning that into a digital process that can complete in minutes instead of days or sometimes weeks and doukasen is now the global leader in each signature we're about half a million paying customers and hundreds of millions of premium customers globally now as we work with our customers were also realized that actually signature sits in the middle of a very complex workflow that starts when people have to prepare a document typically they need to edit a document they may need to get it approved by a few people maybe sometimes they redline the document then they send it for signature and after signing they need to get the document back oftentimes they read the document and they do some data processing and typing into another system and ultimately need to sign that document of a long period of time this whole process is what we call system of agreements right and every company is developed complex system of agreements for different processes in HR sales procurement legal etc so our vision is that in the future DocuSign can be at the center of the system of agreement to help to digitize the entire process and address the signature now one thing that's important obviously is that not the entire process happens in DocuSign so if I take here the example of a HR professional trying to onboard an employee typically they may start in Google Drive or Google Docs they are editing an offer letter and once they are done editing the offer letter they need to get this letter reviewed maybe by legal or approved by the hiring manager and once that's approved then they sign it via DocuSign for signature right so as you can see these process starts in we'll drive and then you know goes to doukasen and then ultimately when the document comes back you want it back in your Google Drive where the HR professional works and so there's a back-and-forth between the two so that's why we developed integration with with Google Drive several years ago now the benefits of this obvious are just taking the HR example here it's a much faster process typically you know when you send a document in the traditional way can take days to sign it with DocuSign many documents are signed within minutes actually 50% of the doc document that are DocuSign or the dog sign with less than an hour and 80% out DocuSign less than a day so if you are you know HR person trying to hire employees it's very valuable services so energy and cost and obviously you know you have an hour complete process which is trackable and obviously this is true for HR it's true for many other functions that that use DocuSign as well so let's switch to a quick demo to see how this works so here I'm now a salesperson and I am in my Google Drive I've prepared a purchase agreement that I want to send to my customer so with our integration is very easy I need to select the purchase agreement and with our sidebar integration I can just click on the little DocuSign logo and now log into my DocuSign account and now appears on the right-hand side the DocuSign add-on to the sidebar and so I can here select who needs to sign in this case I will sign as the center and other people need to sign outside my organization I cannot configure my document and review the document before I send it now one thing you'll notice here is that we have placed automatically some tags a signature tag and a date sign in the right location and the document and that's done to our partnership with Google we also have a partnership with Google in terms of machine learning and in Google's vision API where we basically automatically scan the document and were able to identify where the right interaction fields are present and so we are able to automatically digitize the document into an interactive interactive document so we have single click now I have sent the document once the document is signed it will basically be written back into my Google Drive so the completed version of the agreement will be saved there so let's go back to the slides okay so this is only one of many integrations we had with we have with google we've been a partner with will for many years we have a ward winning Android app so if you don't have it on your phone make sure you download it it allows you to sign from anywhere and scan documents and sign them and we have integration with Google Chrome Google Docs drive and an Gmail thank you all right we're gonna get the next demo up while I do a quick introduction we've got Anthony Petro and Jason Trent here who are going to walk us through how they can use Google machine learning to automate loan approval we appreciate that thanks very much guys so we're Katie we're gonna talk a little bit about some extended workflow capabilities that are gonna be shipping in Google Drive very shortly and as Eric and remand both mentioned you know the need for process automation across the ECM but specifically in G suite is real weavers that have that need today and we believe that k2 is a great platform to help kind of satisfy a lot of those particular needs we've got a lot of customers in our space where they rely upon k2 to provide the ability to automate millions of processes within their their instances every single day now if you're not familiar with us k2 is a leader in the business process app space where we focus on providing tooling for both technical and less technical users users that we call citizen developers so that they can design business apps and automate their business processes that span a human interaction and integration with AI and m/l systems as well as various different systems that they have within their organization so let's go ahead and jump over into the demo and I'll give you guys a sense of kind of one of the things we're gonna start looking at today what you can see here is our process design canvas and so this is a rich interactive process to Camus that allows these citizen developers the ability to go and drag-and-drop and configure activities to model out their process and not only are they modeling the process here but they're also running it on top of our platform allowing them to go and integrate as I mentioned earlier into various different line of business systems regardless that those are on Prem or in the cloud tying in to advanced AI and m/l capabilities on top of the Google cloud platform and integrating into other systems that they may have in this particular example today we're actually looking at a loan pre-approval process and so the situation here is that we have Laura who happens to be a customer um and she needs to go and figure out if she can be approved to go ahead and make a fairly big purchase which is a new home for her and her family before she goes to that process though she wants to make sure that she can get funding from her lender and so in the process we're about to see will actually go and have her submit a form which will kick off the workflow process and one of the first thing that's gonna happen is we're gonna go and actually take this wealth of information that's provided by Laura and match that up with a historical loan information and pass that into machine learning in Google to help us make decisions and outcomes and figure out if we actually need to go and route this this task to a human or if we can action it automatically and help reduce some of the load that denials Bank which is our company has within their their human capital today after we make that decision with an ml we'll actually go and route that task to a user if the model tells us that that's something that we should do and within that task we're gonna act as Erica who is the opportunity to go and interact with that in multiple different experiences so that could be on a mobile device that could be in in mail or that could actually be a via the Google suite add-on that we have that services up task information directly within drive after after Eliza has taken that a decision the last thing we can do is we need to go and get this document sign because it is a pre-approval letter we're actually gonna integrate with our friends over at DocuSign we'll be routing that to Laura for her signature and then returning that back into Google Drive so with that let's actually just jump over in the demo and get started now what you're seeing here is Laura filling out a Google Form the great thing about Ketu is we have a very flexible forms integration strategy so we have our own forms technology that allows you to build rich and dynamic and interactive forms that look great on any type of device be it you know big tablet or desktop or even mobile device but if we work with an organization that has their own formed strategy we're happy to integrate it in that as well but we're spelling out a lot of different information here and all of this information is gonna be utilized within the process we're actually after the form is saved it's gonna be writing that back to Google sheets and because of our native integration with Google we can use that information again to pass that over to the model to figure out you know without having to involve a human what should we do with this particular process the last thing that Laura's gonna do is she's gonna go and upload driver's license I believe from her Google Drive and attach that so that the loan approval can actually look at that and validate that's who she is as we move through the process so with that she's gonna go ahead and submit it and we'll jump actually over into a different experience what you're seeing here is looks very similar to what I just showed you in that design canvas but we actually call this key to view flow this is a visualization of the process and it gives users insight to do exactly where they're at with in the execution this process you can see that we've kicked the form off we've passed over the data that we collected from Loris the middle form into the model and the models made a decision and we actually do need to go and involve a loan originator or a loan approver rather to review this so we're gonna jump over now we're actually running as a different user by the name of Eliza and as I mentioned earlier Eliza can get this task anywhere she happens to be getting it in in her email system and you'll notice there that within the customized email we're surfacing up a couple different pieces of information first of all you see that we give all the information that was collected in that form so any piece of information that's related to the process or even exists in different systems we can integrate and pull right in to the process we're also going and giving her a sense of you know why does she have this task so you can see the very last column is that focus around the m/l scoring right it's a very high degree score that tells us that the outcome that we should take is assign it to her and the last thing that she can do she clicks on that link is actually going open up the task directly now she could have action this an email she could have action this on a mobile device but she wanted to go and validate the the content or the assets that were uploaded his process as part of this process in this particular case she jumps right into Google Drive opens up Laura's driver's license there she can validate yep that actually looks like that's who it is and then she goes in she oops opens up the K to add on for G sweet what that does is that goes and figures out who she is and pulls over the task information that's relevant to this particular process that's tied to that particular driver's license in this case she says she can see all the information as I mentioned earlier where again we're surfacing that all up into the add-on as well so she goes to one single spot to get all of her work done she doesn't have to jump around from system to system the system in this case she's gonna go ahead and I think she already went ahead invalidated that and said yep that's exactly who we want to and with that we've gone and we've really quickly kind of showed you how we can go in and you know with the help of Google and Kate udûn Alex Bank was able to go and build out this pre-approval loan process very very quickly a tying into multiple different systems for credit scoring tying into advanced AI and Amell capabilities on top of Google cloud to make decisions and then routing tasks to the right people at the right time with that that's all we've got time for today thanks very much thanks guys it's great all right can we go back to the slides please all right we did the demo so last but certainly not least we have Brad Orlick strategic alliances manager from Nantucket contract lifecycle management Thank You Erica all right well since we're in a theater in a world of pure chaos and workflow madness prepare to be dazzled what I'd really like to talk to you about today is what an index brings to the cloud and what it really does is it makes things like human centric workflow process something that's accessible to both developers but it's easy enough for even line of business users to work with as well we really covered the entire process stack if you will inside of organizations because we cover everything from process management and mapping to automation with powerful advanced workflow and our PA BOTS and we also do things like process optimization on the back end so again really covering the process spectrum and we've been working closely with the with the Google cloud team to bring our capabilities to Google and drive so what I'm gonna take you through briefly is a nondisclosure agreement type of process so what what essentially happen here is I'm gonna play the role of two different individuals someone inside of my fictitious to follow real estate organization who's gonna fill out a responsive form we're gonna generate that document from a template that's stored inside of drive then we're gonna send it out for an e-signature using in text sign which is powered by Adobe and then behind the scenes we're gonna then store that back into Drive and then put you know data into Salesforce spin up some things in slack so lots of different moving parts but I'm gonna take you through all of that so time for the demo so what you alright so what you're seeing here is my fictitious real estate organization and as one Richard Rowe who works for us to follow I could go through and fill out a form to capture my customer data to create this non-disclosure agreement now again we're pretty agnostic when it comes to you know forms capability you can certainly take data from anywhere you can call our workflows as rust endpoints so very flexible in this case though I chose to build out a form using in text responsive forms and it's all well and good that I could do this inside of a browser but let's be honest how do most people like to work nowadays with these things right so what I did was using our framework for building out custom mobile applications and again this is all-inclusive inside the product alright so what you're seeing here is a custom mobile application that I built out just for the demonstration so Richard can go in here view all of his tasks on the go do all those great things I can't even look at that template that's stored inside a drive right outside the mobile device on that lunch with my client but in this case again I'm sitting with a client in the field I'm gonna go and fill out that form so in this case again leveraging whether you know we're on an iOS device or an Android device we can consume these either way these custom mobile applications and I'm just gonna go ahead and fill out some cursory information for the sake of the demo I'm also not populating all of my fields or I've already pre-populated them to save us a little bit of time so again just some information about my customer and notice I'm doing things like sequentially filling this out right here this is gonna be so follow and then again all the other information about me is stored inside the form it next the reason you'll say top secret Google cloud stuff naturally right so we'll hit next last thing length of the agreement looks great oops and I'll simply hit submit now I want to call your attention to something real quickly about our application here is this outbox concept so you could actually use us completely offline zero code again so it just naturally knows whether you're online or offline so your tasks and forms are cached on the device so we have a lot of fortune 500s you use this in the form in the field to revolutionize how they go to market now behind the scenes what's happening is we're capturing that data from the form we're actually instantiating a workflow behind the scenes we're generating that non-disclosure agreement we're doing things like capturing all of that data and into variables and able to route that to whatever we need so all those things can just magically happen in the background now outside of actually taking you through the entire process you know where we go through and we sign the document and all those things it's all well and good pretty straightforward but how did we do it how do we build this this is the Nintendo DS and canvas so this is the workflow process if I were to go in here again as a developer or as a line of business owner I can go in simply open this up and say you know what I've decided that I need to have something like a signature control inside of here and I can easily just grab it and drop it into my form and then quickly go up to a preview and again all instantaneous and it's automatic we again just like Google like to delight our customers so just throw something in and again done that's simple to make a change inside of my my form design I'll go back to my workflow now if I also you know have occasion to use something like my friends over at at da key science capability we can certainly do that as well so I can say you know what I'm gonna store some documents or get a signature with DocuSign and this is as simple as it is to go ahead and adjust my workflow and start changing things and notice again simple drag-and-drop experience making it all nice and easy and just simply configuration dialogues and it makes things like cognitive services something that average human beings inside of your organization could take advantage of because maybe Google Translate is something that I want to use before I send that NDA out because I'm working with Japanese clients I can easily drag and drop in action and you can build these using our extensions framework that's all open API under the covers so again inside outside the firewall again process that's what it takes to us thanks everybody thanks Brad all right back to the slides I hope everyone appreciates that that was a lot of points of failure for live demos and I think everybody did great I am relieved okay we're gonna wrap with some security announcements because we know that keeping your data safe really really matters and this is just a taste of some of what we have cooking and what we have already launched so again find us if you need more information we're developing advanced data loss protection rules for Drive this is targeting targeted for launch in 2019 so if you're familiar with our data loss protection what this does is lets you assign rules that say if a document says privileged and confidential treat it one way if it has social security numbers don't let it go outside the organization and that kind of stuff we're deepening that so you can block download copy and print capabilities as well based on those DLP rules we're also developing data exfiltration protection for iOS devices so what this does is help prevent the leakage of corporate data to personal accounts on iPhone devices so just a taste of the stuff that we've gotten in the works we're working hard to untangle the problems of ECM and deliver on the promise of a modern content platform by really paying attention to the key requirements that major enterprise major enterprises like Airbus have cleaner metadata interoperability with Microsoft better search and organization automated document classification and streamlining thousands of workflows one last quick comment making sure that everyone in this room is aware that you can now purchase drive for enterprise independent of the rest of the G suite so if you're thinking about transitioning to Google products but you're you know not ready to give up Outlook not ready to give up you're you don't want to move to calendar there's a there's a way to start moving into a modern content platform using just drive plus Docs plus all of those top-tier enterprise security features identity features an admin fun in a letís so more information there [Music]
