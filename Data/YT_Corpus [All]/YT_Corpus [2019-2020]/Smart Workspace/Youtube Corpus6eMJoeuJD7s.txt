 In previous videos, we created a category and set up a classification in OpenText™ Extended ECM. Now discover how to create a workspace template to provide a folder structure for business workspaces and define the relevant category. A template defines how all workspaces that are created based on this template should look. In the template, you can also define user access to the business workspaces. This will be explained in a separate video. In the global menu, click Enterprise then Document Templates. Open the Add Item menu and click Business Workspace. Enter a name in the Business Workspace dialog box. Select the workspace type “Request for Quotation” and the classification that matches the classification of the folder where the workspaces should be created. Add a category. The category groups attributes where information from a business application or other relevant content can be saved. Now, configure the template and add folders. Open the workspace template Request for Quotation. Add all folders that are required in the template. You can also add other items, like related business workspace folders and shortcuts to the template. The business properties belong to the workspace level. Therefore, you can add the category at the template level and disable the category inheritance.
