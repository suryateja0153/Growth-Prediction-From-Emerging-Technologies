 [Music] all right so where do we begin well today employee engagement is at an all-time low by some estimates eighty-seven percent of employees worldwide are unengaged the business press tends to define it employed engaged employees as those who feel passionate about their jobs are committed to the organization and put in discretionary work in doing their in their jobs and in today's knowledge driven economy keeping employees engaged is important now more than ever for getting the most done and getting the most out of your workforce but deepening this employee engagement is actually really hard to do but we think it's a really important problem we're solving you know you see that companies with engage employees versus not and have a two and a half times earning per share difference and there's very high correlation between engaging employees and retention of employees so I think most people know the cost of employee attrition so it's really a problem we're solving and a key part to that solution is your communications tools many employees many sorry organizations today have employees distributed across the globe across time zones but they all need to work together on a shared mission and increasingly connected desk lists and frontline workers we've got mobile phones in their pockets they're part of this experience but they don't have the time to manage an email inbox or they can't be getting interrupted with a beeping phone while they're in front of customers for example but it's still absolutely critical to keep them engaged in the in the company mission and then when you talk to leaders a couple of really clear things come through first of all they want to lead they want to get their word out but they also want feedback they want to understand the impact they're having they want to understand how people are responding what the sentiments are but they struggle with the right tools to do this you know they all send out the big blanket emails but are frustrated that nobody replies to them that's what one thing we hear from leaders and then the other just generally is they want people to work as productively as possible they want best practices shared they want information to get out of the traditional silos at Forman organizations behind access control lists or in people's inboxes and so they're they're looking for ways to solve that so enter currents I think most of you probably heard about it yesterday we were pleased to announce currents as the newest member of the G suite family it's going to be included with the basic SKU and hire of G suite you can request to be in the beta by email now I'll show the address at the end and it will be in general availability by the end of the year Curren is the new name for the reimagined and redesigned enterprise version of google plus as we've now shut down the consumer version Curren is focused squarely on solving the problems that I've been talking about and it's all about enabling organizations to connect knowledge ideas and people at scale I'm going to take the next few minutes to walk you through the key benefits for currents and the with different types of users in today's organizations and after that we'll have the team come up into a demo and then we'll talk to some customers all right so if you're a leader at a ten person company you don't really worry about employee engagement you're probably sitting in the same room there's a lot of tools that can work for that and the same when you're at a hundred person organization but when you get to a certain size and a certain level of distribution you just need better tools Curren aims to engage leaders and employees by giving leaders the tools to do a bunch of things one is to just create great and compelling content and as you'll see we're doing that with subject lines for posts rich text drive attachments so that they can put their best foot forward in their communications it's also important to be able to highlight content to drive alignment in the organization and there's two ways you're gonna see to do that one we call leader spotlight and another called custom streams generally it's just important to foster open discussion across the enterprise regardless of hierarchy and to create quality discussions and evergreen content one of the key things you're going to hear about is how we're doing routing based on tagging users are able to use hash tags and the way they do in products today like you know Twitter and Instagram etc and then people can follow those hashtags in their organization for specific topical areas that are relevant to the organization and then ultimately we know leaders want tools to be able to gauge that sentiment that I talked about before and you'll see some of that as well and ultimately with all these things leaders are able to drive a shared understanding on the important topics and initiatives across the organization we're gonna have marina appear shortly but I wanted to share this quotation I'll let you read it yourself but they've been using current since November deploy deploy to the entire organization in January of this year and they found value in how currents facilitates meaningful discussion and allows your employees to exchange ideas she's not shaking her head so that's good but leaders are not the only beneficiary when an organization deploys currents currents also employ enables rank-and-file employees not in full-time leadership positions first of all it's a an organizational Commons for ideas and discussions across geography time zones and information silos and it gives people in an ideal way to interact informally including with leaders about company topics and if they don't think the right folks are included they can extend the reach of the discussion say by adding a hashtag in a comment which then sort of routes it to anybody following that discussion we think this is really powerful and specifically when they're stepping up in their role and they need to actively campaign for some promotion or initiative or something they're doing internally it gives them a way to promote their work related content to people beyond their immediate work team we've got lots of tools to work with your immediate work team but if you actually want to reach in one of these larger companies to people say in your same role but in a different place just or people with shared interests that you have at before it's very powerful and then finally it gives them a fun it gives them a way to share fun and insightful and inspirational parts of their work lives which I think builds a sense of belonging which is important to a lot of companies cultures and it does all of this with a post and comment model with an ordered home stream it can be sorted chronologically and you know they see the things they're interested in that they follow so they can make the most out of the time they spend using currents we're not trying to trap people there and show them ads we want them to get in get values learn something and get on with their job and be better at their job and so ultimately when you do this ideas can be exchanged broadly and efficiently in a way not really possible with existing tools today oops there it is I'm another quote from from a TV they've been using it's in September of last year and deployed to the entire company in October they've loved how currents has allowed them to connect ideas and employees making it easier to engage in discussion across the company so we'll have people from these companies up here in a moment the last thing I really wanted to talk to about talk to you about though is this critical area of content management today's work environments are increasingly complex as companies manage global workforces and these lines between your personal and your work life really blur leaders in human resource departments want collaboration but also want to keep the conversation that respectful and professional every company is going to solve this in their own way based on their culture their environment etc so incurrence what we've done is we've built tools for them to implement their workplace policies and steer their organization's behavior and discussion in a way that works for them we call this new role that of a Content administrator and these content administrators are catalysts to shape the discussion drive engagement and ultimately shape the desire Norm's and so while they can do things like take down posts if there's something offensive there's lots of ways to handle that but you can just take it down incurrence there are also management tools for some of the features I've talked about around tags you see it there tags leaders and streams so these are sort of the people out in the field steering in the organization steering the discussion and shaping it and so ultimately this lets them build a respectful space to shape their culture so before we go to the demo I just wanted to recap that currents enables organizations to connect knowledge ideas and people at scale and we've talked about how leaders can drive alignment and get the pulse from constructive discussions across the organization how employees can interact informally but efficiently with people outside their teams and leaders and just people they may have never met before to get better at their jobs and then the importance of this this content manager role to catalyze and shape shape the tone at the company and so with that I'm gonna invite my team up and if we could switch to the direct input for the demo here that would be great well you can clap all right so this is Pam Alex and Rahul and they're going to walk us through a demo everyone thanks David I'd like to introduce you to Pam Pam is the CEO of cro corp a international retailer that has stores worldwide pam has just returned from a trip to Singapore where Gro Corp has opened its first store in the country and she'd like to share an update with the entire organization about her trip so she clicks on share an update types in a post title and then puts in her message as Pam types a message she sees suggested tags hashtag kudos and hashtag customer love which he decides to put as a part of her post but then she also puts in another hashtag as she typed the keyword hashtag she sees suggested tags and suggested tags and Curren is a great way to reduce tax a contagion in the system so she goes ahead and she puts in the hashtag hashtag wins then she goes over to drive and clicks on the icon and then she attaches a presentation for the entire organization to see grow corpse plans to expand in Asia and then she goes over to the top right hand side and clicks the spotlight button the spotlight button allows leaders such as Pam to further highlight their content in currants she goes ahead and makes her post let's switch over to Shane and let me introduce you to Shane who is the store manager of the new Singapore store that Pam just posted about so sometime after she'd made that post after a long day at the store floor Shane goes back to his office and he comes to Curren and this is where he tries to catch up with the latest with what's been going around agro Corp so from his home feed as David mentioned earlier this is where he can find the latest relevant posts from the people and tags that has been following as well as polls from the communities that he is part of in addition this is where he gets to find out what are the latest popular posts that people are talking about throughout girl core as well as recommended posts from leaders such as the one that Pam just posted right here now Shane decides to take the chance to respond to Pam by acknowledging the great work that Tanner has done together with his marketing organization in the recent launch now by providing signals such as the marketing hashtag this ensures that current will give the visibility of this post to the entire marketing organization now this is a simple yet lightweight and remarkably powerful action that enables Shane to give a loud shout out across the entire organization in a non-disruptive way in addition to being able to engage in a two-way conversation with leaders like Pam and really fostering that type of employee engagement that David was referring to earlier so switching back to Pam a few hours later Pam goes back to her feet and she notices Shane's comment on her post she Scrolls further down her feet and she sees a post that she made a week ago is getting quite some traction in the organization curious as to where that traction is coming from she clicks on the overflow menu and then selects view post analytics over here she is able to see the number of views comments likes and reshares on this post but what currents also gives is further a way to get deeper insights for a post otter to see where the engagement is coming from so over here you see the names of senior leadership from Gro core and next to their names is the percentage of the amount of engagement that has come on that particular post from that leaders organization so this way the author is able to get deeper insight into where engagement is coming from and then they can decide how to change the communication strategy going forward Pam Scrolls further down in her feed and she sees responses to a poll that she had put out to the company a week ago and she sees that 401k matching is top of mind for most employees and polls are a quick way to get feedback on things that leaders would want so that they can take action for things that are important in the organization now switching back to Shayne for another moment I would like to take this opportunity to show you a couple more ways the current connects people and ideas at scale while also shrinking the distance between employees as one of our customers aptly described in so as chain goes back to his home feed on the upper left he sees the trending tags this is like the digital version of the water cooler where you're walking down the hallway and you see what are people talking about and in this particular case something the cache has changed attention is the hash tag vitamins trending tag this is a topic that his own customers in his Singapore story been talking about so he's curious about it so he goes ahead and clicks on there to drill down to see what are these latest conversations that people are talking about before going further here I should take this opportunity to follow this particular tag and in doing so now going forward whenever he comes back to his home feed he's gonna get the latest on hashtag vitamins as he Scrolls down one of the things that he notices is actually a recent post by Cassie teller Cassie's a purchasing manager from across the world in London and she's talking about a vitamin line that his own customers have been talking about so he was really excited about it and he takes this opportunity to actually respond to Cassie saying hey this is really this is really interesting for my for my store now the simple action connects these two individuals together from across the world now going forward whenever Cassie stinking with what's going on in Asia she now knows that hey Shane's the person was interesting this particular topic and vice versa Shane going forward knows that cast is the go-to person for this particular product line now before going forward Shane also stars this particular post so he can refer to it later by simply going to the left menu and a start menu and this is very similar to how it works in our other GC products like Gmail and drive while I have you here your attention the left menu I also wanted to call your attention to the lower right to the custom streams out-of-the-box current supports some of these custom streams like spotlight this is where Shane can come and see what are the latest posts from leaders but in addition to them there are additional custom streams that the content administrator broke or between set up to highlight posts on topics that they want to be front and center in people's mind so in this example the administrators set up a display ideas custom stream so Shane can quickly drill down to see hey what's the latest great ideas that people are exchanging about displaying products throughout grow Corp so this is a simply announced a powerful way that companies that grow Corp can actually scale their culture son I introduced you to Peter Peter is an internal communications manager at grow car so Peters role is to help senior leadership at grow Corp send a message out to the rest of the organization and also ensure that the organization has a shared understanding of where grow Corp is going as David mentioned earlier we are introducing a new role called the content admin with currents and the G suite admin for grow Corp has designated Peter as the content had been for currents so when Peter logs into currents he sees the new management tool link in the left hand side panel goes ahead and clicks on it and then over here Peter is able to manage tags leaders and streams and currents with tags Peter can upload new tags to the system and what this does is allows Peter to shape the conversation and also reduce tag fragmentation if there are certain tags that Peter wants to exclude from recommended streams he can do so or he can enable them again moving on to the leaders panel over here Peter can designate certain users as leaders in the organization and what this does is gives these leaders access to features such as the spotlight feature which they can use to further highlight their content within the organization then moving to streams streams as Alex mentioned are a great way to yet further highlight content within the organization so over here Peter notices he's been the announcement stream is not yet activated he's been working on it it's ready to go alive so he selects the announcement stream and then he clicks on the activate button as you can see here Peter has chosen to make this stream available to all of grow Corp but if he so chose he could make it available to a subset of the organization using Google Groups and only those users would see that stream so he goes as as and clicks activate and the stream shows up in the left hand side panel ready for use so that's what we had for the demo back to you David people hear me here you go thanks so much team that was great all right so let's talk to some real customers now I guess I'd use can we go back to the slides please we are on them all right so I'd like to introduce marina and Michelle from Nielsen and ATV financial respectively as I mentioned earlier they both been using the product for for many months I was wondering if we could just go one at a time and have you guys say a little bit about yourself your company and and your journey so far sure so hi everyone I'm marina at Nielson we have over 40,000 employees in 100-plus countries and current has really allowed us to break down those not just geographical barriers but also organizational barriers so regardless of what your title is or what your zip code is you have the opportunity to engage with leaders in the company share your ideas and form communities around something that you're passionate about and this has really created a culture that is open and engaging and it's really important for us especially right now as a company we're going through a lot of change we just got a new CEO and he has been very dedicated to the platform which has been so important for us so it helps associates feel more connected with what's going on in the company but also adds a personal aspect to it our CEO has been traveling around the globe he's been posting two currents pictures of where he's visited what he's learned and it really you know makes for a more personal experience for our associates we've used currents as a primary form of communication at Neilson kind of trying in an effort to reduce the amount of email that everybody is getting and the new features around streams have been a game changer for us really one of the challenges we had in the past is how do we ensure we're reaching the right people if we're gonna use this as a primary tool for communication and so we find ourselves post posting in different communities trying to ensure that we got to the right audience and streams has just completely eliminated the need for that and you know with the post analytics we actually now have some feedback as to the engagement that we're getting so we've been super pleased with the new features and I'm sure we'll get into some more details great thanks yeah and maybe before you go to Michelle I'll just say we didn't really talk about communities today it still exists in the product it's something our customers have loved and used in enterprise Google+ over many years it's not going anywhere it's not absolutely not going anywhere but and they're still very useful for when you want more contained conversations but so I'll just set that context but maybe just rewinding a little bit Michelle can you tell us about yourself and your company and maybe an interesting anecdote from your side sure thank you Dave um hi everybody my name is Michelle McCarthy I am the technical advancement leader at ATP financial an ATV financial is a financial institution in Canada Alberta specifically and we serve about while we serve all customers throughout the province of Alberta we have about 50 hi 500 employees and something specific about the team that I work with is that we're responsible for the G suite proficiency of the organization as well as adoption and we're also responsible in partnership with other teams within IT of removing or decommissioning or Microsoft products so we are the team that is really in front of team members understanding how they're using the products and how they're adopting the products and in turn how we're removing the products that we know don't longer use in the organization so with current specifically we adopted G suite in July of 2017 and what was really important to us was that we we were using these tools and so quickly we adopted currents and g+ communities in the past and we're at the point where we have 90% of our employees who actually use currents about once a month and then about 65 percent of employees who are going in at least once a week so it is a really popular avenue for us to share information throughout the organization and it's quickly becoming one of our primary methods alongside others to ensure that we're distributing information to all of our team members so it's something that we can't even imagine not having today and I would say that specifically what the changes that had been made is that absolutely in the past it was very siloed information that were provided within the communities where as a focus for us is to ensure that we're getting the right information to the right people at the right time and so this the the tag specifically ensure that it allows us to provide the information that team members may not choose to go to and get themselves so in the past we allowed team members to select the communities that they wanted to be involved in whereas now we can ensure that we're doing it from both perspectives they have the option to select the information that's relevant to them and they also now have the option through tagging getting the information out to everybody that's important to us as an enterprise as well as what may be important to the division or the department so absolutely hands down it allows a much broader distribution of information across the organization great thanks I'm wondering if in whoever wants to take it first you could talk a little bit about your deployment experience how you rolled it out and and specifically how it changed the balance and now you have a story Michelle about you know sort of de-emphasizing communities and moving more to tags you're still holding the mic do you wanna maybe talk about your deployment experience and then we can go to an arena on that sure so something that stands out in my mind in particular is now with the new look and feel is that it's very modernized so our team members are comfortable with the look and feel absolutely going from seeing about four different articles to going to one at first the question was why can't I customize it why is it only just one and that conversations stopped like we didn't hear that for very long over the course of two weeks people just simply got used to it and so something that was easy to adopt is the tagging because that is something that you do if you are a social media user all the time so people just naturally started doing it you you didn't you just had to say tagging is now available and that was the something that was just naturally adopted by team members so now I would say everyone is doing it for even people who weren't used to doing it that's just something that they see being done and they're like well I want my information that I'm sharing and posting to get out to a broader audience so I'm gonna start tagging as well and you want an implementation I know you had this story that I loved about how you had almost too many communities before and basically decided to retire some of them and and replacing them tags there's still a role right for a community sometimes where people want more privacy but yeah so we have a lot of communities because what we wanted to achieve was adoption out of the gate and we certainly did do that because of the fact that it's been less than two years we have had G suite and in our organization so we had a lot of communities so it was it and we still do so it was very open to all employees to be able to leverage that tool to use it as a social tool alongside using it as an interactive tool to get to know fellow employees from a work perspective as well as to get the information that they needed to know so I lost my train of thought that's terrible well you were just talking about you know tagging in communities no I lost my job I was too busy looking at the beautiful Pam in the first no it's great we'll come back to you if you like yeah okay I wouldn't hurry Marina do you want to talk a little bit about your deployment experience sure so when we first heard about currents wasn't called currents at the time but basically what it was is new enterprise features coming to G+ we were super excited we partnered with some of our key stakeholders in our adoption of the platform our communications teams they've always been really passionate about G+ they're the ones that really helped us get the buy-in from the leadership and make sure that you know they understand how to post and when to posts and things like that so the first thing we did was engage them and we had a few sessions with Google where they shared you know what what are the features that are coming and we thought okay how do we want to position this to the organization initially we rolled out to a small group of users what we call our Google gurus these are users who enjoy testing new features you know pre-production features from Google so we put it out there and honestly not a lot of training was required which I think just speaks to the usability of the the product but we explain you know here our streams and our communications teams helped us identify you know what are the streams that we want to start off with we use current a lot for enterprise-wide campaigns and initiatives and so at the time I think we were having an initiative going on it's called my weekend and it was basically hey let you know tell us what you're doing on the weekend let's let's get to know each other a little bit better and so we we use that hashtag and I have to say that the feedback that you get from the system the validation around the hash tags I'm terrible at creating hash tags so for me it's really nice that something gets suggested to me or at least I see I have some level validation that says hey yeah you know a thousand other people have used the same hash tag you're probably on the right track so we kicked it off with a few you know predefined streams some hash tags to get the campaign going and really right off the bat we're like this is really great we need to expand this out to the rest of the organization and so that's what we did and our our communications team have really done a great job of working together to understand okay these are the streams we want to put in place and and because these dreams now cover you know what these five other communities used to do we can retire some of these other communities that were more siloed like you said so that was kind of how we rolled it out and going strong great it was like the perfect segue to my next question about campaigns are there specific campaigns you can you talk about how you've set up streams and the type of campaigns you've done it at eighty be financial so we in our streams have set it up so that we're sharing the most important information and topics and specifically what's really important to ATB is wellness so that is one of the streams specifically that we have really zoned in on to ensure that we're showcasing and sharing any topic around wellness so that's a so anything that is broad to the enterprise is how we have set up our streams so we don't have very many because it's not about inundating the team with information it's about being very specific as to what focus you want to draw people's attention to so when I was listening to Dave's speak about how it changes the culture of your organization it really does because of the fact that you really want to hone in on what is most important that you want to ensure that all team members are going to be talking about because it's not just one way communication so I'd say it's absolutely hands-down it has everything to do with ensuring or sharing your most important information that you want people talking about across the entire enterprise right thank you I thought we could maybe pivot a little pivot a little bit to some of the softer stuff around culture and innovation and things like that and if you've noticed a change from sort of before you were using this product to now in terms of how people interact sure you know for us I I really believe that Curren has created this like safe place where people can share their ideas and for us it's really about making connections across the organization because we are so spread out all over the globe somebody that has an idea or wants to you know share something can now go to currents you know put it out there add a couple hashtags that you know maybe will connect them with the right audience and that's something if you think about trying to do that in more traditional forms of communication through email or asking this person if they know that person it's just a much more efficient way to connect people across the organization and you know occasionally it there's a healthy level of debate that happens around certain topics that's also great for innovation but certainly we have seen teams connecting and it's a lot of times it's things that you know aren't related to necessarily their day to day job right it's something that they're passionate about or something they've read out in the industry that you know they have opinions on and what's great about it is because we do have leaders in the organization that engaged with these types of posts you know I feel like associates really feel there they're being heard so that's one example okay great I would have to echo everything that marina was saying it absolutely does allow for people to hear from their leaders a lot more than what they had in the past and have interactions with them because your leaders may not all be in the same place and you interact with leaders that are not necessarily within your department or your division so I can't say it any better than what Marina has great yeah I think I remember an anecdote from ETV about tell me if I miss characterizing this but basically it's a place to be yourself sort of separate from the hierarchy and I think the guy said just don't be a dork I forget who it was but so we have tools to take down posts if someone is being a dork but and in fact one thing we learned on the product side from working with a TV is there were times when leaders wanted to be leaders and have their stuff highlighted and there were times when they just wanted to be like a regular person and that's actually we took that feedback and that's why we've added this spotlight feature that makes it optional for the person because sometimes leaders want to be kind of regular people too and not have their weekend barbecue posts be at the top of every day everybody's stream yeah it absolutely humanizes everyone yeah so I feel as though I'm really fortunate because it has certainly it it fits in well with our culture so it is a way of ensuring that everyone really feels connected to each other because that's one of the things that we really focus on and of course this type of culture doesn't occur overnight so team members are becoming more and more comfortable just simply being themselves in their posts and not being afraid to post and it is because of the fact that leaders are leading by example within it got it I would just add that you know for us we did do a little bit of training upfront for those that sought it out I think it's important to remember sometimes that not everybody grew up using social media or if they did it was a lot of times in their personal lives and so sometimes there's some anxiety around well how do I do this in a corporate environment what's appropriate what's not appropriate and first it was it was really simple it was you know putting out a few examples of hey here are some things that you can post about and you know helping them to feel more comfortable in doing that but I think you're right like so much of that just happens by leaders leading by example and people seeing that and then kind of learning the landscape but I do think it's important to remember that not everybody is gonna feel ready to jump right in and you know what are the things that you can do to kind of help it use them into it right um one more question and then we can go to some some Q&A from the audience I've got a bunch of Dory questions here I wanted to ask specifically about the knowledge that people take away from it in doing their jobs and if there's examples of sort of you know specific actionable things I mean I there's one customer that comes to mind at a at a at a retailer this isn't either of you guys but just as an example of where they actually were able to do a product recall on some damaged food item pretty quickly because I'm gonna took a picture of it posted it and it just got handled like much quicker than it would have in the old way are there other examples of places where you know this this method of connection and communication made a difference in the business in a more day-to-day way one that I can think of offhand is we have today it's a community I think it actually probably needs to transition to a stream but we have a place for people that are interested in using actually Google app maker and app scripts and you know my team were pretty small team that manages the adoption of GC and we can't always like help everybody you know create these apps that they want to so there's a group of people have kind of raised their hand and said hey I'm interested in in doing this and we've been able to make connections between somebody that needs help developing an app script or an app maker with these other volunteers and you know in those cases we have seen actually that these teams are able to develop those products because they made that connection through the community we also use currents I can't remember if I keep referring to it as G+ but okay it takes some time but we do have all of our like features that we release through Jesus we are communicated through currents and we kind of capture feedback from associates that way that we can bring back either to adjust our change management plans or actually bring back to Google as something you know that we're hearing from the enterprise so a couple examples of how currents has helped us actually get projects done and also you know where we are able to capture feedback that then we can share with the vendors or whoever it might be to improve I would say that our journey has been exactly the same we absolutely use it for day-to-day support so we have the different communities set up for day-to-day support and one of the most important communities that I would love to brag about a little bit is the G suite update community as well as asking for feedback as well as any questions you have so that is one of the forms that we use to be able to provide insights about any changes going on with with Google and then allow team members to ask questions back whether it's about the update or anything else we have one of our larger teens actually that uses it as a supplement so as a supplement to their primary source of sharing communication or their primary Channel and it's quickly becoming very very popular so it our retail financial services team which are all the branches they use that for any questions that I've seen Miam team member may have so it's they they just expect that the timing in which they'll get a response back may be longer than what they get it back in chat so it it is used every single day and that is why you see our adoption rate so high and so many people going into it regularly okay I'm gonna go to Q&A now if you guys would stay up that would be great just in case there's you know a way you address it but please give a please give a hand to our panel [Applause] [Music]
