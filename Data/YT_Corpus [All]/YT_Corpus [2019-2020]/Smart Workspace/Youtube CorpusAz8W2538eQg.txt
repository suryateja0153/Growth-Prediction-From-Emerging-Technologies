 [Music] overview of just how we think about fleet management and what it means to build a modern scalable device management solution Marcus is going to talk about Chromebook applications and I think we have a really unique applications platform on Chromebooks where we try to bring the best of a few different worlds together from the web obviously to Chrome extensions and applications as well as Android apps and a few other things that Marcus is going to give a preview of and then Derek will close us out by talking about how SoulCycle has grown its business and it's technology together over time and the lessons learned along the way like most sessions here at next we do have a Dory Q&A available so if you'd like to ask any questions please just go into the app and you can tap on our session and tap on Dory QA we'll take some questions at the end and we have microphones here as well for live questions all right so let's get started so one of the things that we really believe in is that organizations need cloud native tools and endpoints and we think this because we've talked to many different organizations of all shapes and sizes that are rapidly moving to the cloud and so their employees experience now is really centered on apps and devices we see a Forrester study that showed that employees are now using on average 22 cloud-based apps and three devices so these are mission-critical tools for these employees to do their jobs and we have a real opportunity to make them better what we found though as we've talked to a lot of organizations is that managing and scaling and deploying these platforms is actually quite tedious today and it doesn't scale all that well and it's not because people are making things over complicated and I think when we dig into the processes that organizations are using all of them makes sense all of them have genuine business reasons behind them and nobody is trying to cut out any step of this process but I think the important part is that it's not very easy and it's not very scalable and we can do a lot better the other thing is it's only getting harder so where is at one point maybe you were just taking a device and imaging it and making sure the operating system and the software was up-to-date and then you just kind of send it out into the field and maybe you see that device again in a few months or a few years you know now we're doing everything through the cloud and so we're thinking about not just devices and users but also applications also peripherals like printers networks security monitoring reporting etc and so there are so many new layers to the IT puzzle now that we have to pit fit together and fit together in a way that feels cohesive and that presents an understandable IT policy to our employees now of course we're adding all of these layers at the same time that we're adding just an unprecedented number of devices into the mix so we're making it both more complicated and scaling it in a way that we haven't seen before and so I think at Google we feel that we have the opportunity to help improve this situation by focusing on reshaping enterprise computing and the reason I say computing is that on the chrome OS team you know we build the chrome operating system and when I say cloud native what I mean is that the Chrome operating system really came out of the Chrome browser project which is of course people's first sort of introduction to the cloud that's your viewport into the cloud but if you expand the Chrome browser and all of its principles like simplicity and speed and security and you turn that into an operating system all of a sudden you have a device that's not just cloud ready not just cloud was added on top of something existing but actually cloud native meaning it was built for that purpose it was built with the opportunity to do OS updates in a cloud native way for instance to do policy is in the cloud native way to do management in the cloud way to cloud native way as well as applications so in addition to the operating system the product that we have for realizing this vision of cloud native computing and and endpoints and tools is the Google admin console and so if you're using G suite or you're using mobile device management this is the same console that you're already accustomed to and this is where you can go to manage every single layer that we talked about in that previous slide and this is also where you can go to manage your chrome devices and chrome browsers and so when we talk about Chrome Enterprise that's sort of the umbrella product that encompasses all of these different things we have fleet management we've got tools we've got the application experiences and all of that together is what allows you to bring chrome into your enterprise in a cloud native way so I'm going to talk real quick about fleet management and so I'll cover a few principles that we've learned over the years from talking to many different organizations all shapes and sizes all industries verticals etc the first is that fleet management should be simple and so what I like everybody to picture here is put yourself in the seat of an airplane cockpit and you're looking around and you see all of these hundreds or thousands of different controls and buttons and surfaces and imagine you don't know what most of them do right would you look at one and say hmm I wonder what that one does you know we hope that people don't fly planes that way but of course that's how a lot of us learn technology is we just kind of experiment and see what all of these things do but hopefully not so much in an enterprise context where these things can have real consequences for our employees so I want to point out the airplane analogy because I think you know you also won't want to fly a plane that didn't have those controls either so simplicity is not about taking things away but it's about making sure that you don't actually need to be modern or monitoring and modifying each of those things every time you know I think the realization that we had was that we can kind of do things better we can raise the baseline of what organizations have as their baseline level of security and policy and management just because there are a lot of commonalities across all types of organizations and then you can spend the time customizing things to your exact needs of course simplicity is also only getting harder so with the cloud native device we can now add so many more policies than we've ever had before and so whereas we started with just an full of policies we now have hundreds and hundreds of different ones this includes things even down to the level of hardware so things like two-factor authentication things like TPM firmware updates things like processor threading and so I actually hope that nobody in this crowd has ever thought about those things because they're probably not poor drivers to what your organization does but at the same time it's helpful to have all of those things have all of those controls ready and that's the type of area where we can make a big impact by making it simple the other principle that we've heard is that device management needs to be scalable so with respect to this beautiful animating gear here that actually means more than just the raw scale of the number of devices you have of course we're familiar with all sorts of scales of devices from just a few to a few hundred thousand but scalability also means adapting the fleet management tool to your type of organization so we work with organizations that have one admin who does things part time every few Fridays because that's what the organization needs and we work with organizations that have multiple admins with tiers of access different privileges between them specialized knowledge in devices or networks or security needs around auditing and compliance and making sure all those processes work well and those two organizations don't necessarily need the same management experience in fact they probably need different management experiences and so scalability is not just about making sure that it goes no matter how many devices you have but that it adapts to the actual needs of your organization and lastly our goal is for device management to be insightful so we really want to kind of turn the table so that you're not just thinking I want to manage my devices but actually my devices can provide something back to me my devices can provide some kind of information so imagine that you have a device that is checking in all the time and then suddenly it just falls off the map you know was that because that device got lost or stolen or maybe the employees on vacation right it's not necessarily a bad thing but it's something that might be worth your time to investigate and so insightfulness is about providing that kind of proactive information so that you can pay attention to the right things because even at the scale of a few dozen devices it's just impossible to keep track all the time of every single thing that's happening in your organization so we need to have a tool that will actually work with you to help make a lot of that easier so let's get down to the brass tacks of the things that we're actually working on the the first one is speedier administration next is OS update controls you know we could probably have a whole session just on OS update controls we hear a lot from folks that this is really important and it's also a big opportunity we're having a cloud native device allows us to do a lot more things it's not just about customizing the version but it's also about how do you scale and deploy and rollout and apply updates even OS rollback is something that we've heard a lot about and that we're working on now so OS update controls are a big area of focus for us reporting obviously is something we talked about with the point about insightful and then browser management is one I really want to draw your attention to we just announced on Tuesday the full availability of Chrome browser cloud management and so if you're using Chrome browser in your organization which if I were a betting man I would say you probably are this is a way for you to bring Chrome browser into the cloud and actually manage it through the same admin console where you're managing all of your devices and so you can do things like set policies deploy apps and extensions manage extensions by permission if you want to and even get some information back about what types of extensions your users in your organization are using so if you're not yet on fully cloud native devices we understand that that takes some time but browser management is a great way to get started today with having some of the magic of the cloud management in your organization so I'm gonna go through a couple of real quick demos here one thing I want to point out is that if you are familiar with our Google admin console you'll notice that these look a little bit different and that's because we're working on a full visual refresh and adding a few new features and making it a lot faster so this stuff may look a little bit new that's intentional and we have a number of trusted tester and beta programs if you're interested in trying it out so for the first quick demo we're gonna do a device search and disable so imagine that you have a fictional organization and we've got an employee named Sandra and she's leaving the organization so what we can do is just go ahead and search for Sandra's name and we're gonna find all of her devices in the device list she has 15 of them so she must have been productive we're gonna just go ahead and disable them and what you might catch at the end there is that we're actually putting a message on the device itself that says you know property of organization please return to this address that kind of thing and so this is a great example we're having a cloud native tool on a cloud native device really worked together well because we have this just built into every single Chromebook that you're managing and when you think about things like information security and data lockdown and whatnot this is a really really easy and integrated way to do all of that stuff you don't need a third party software you don't need to buy anything else it's just part of the Chrome enterprise product next is log capture so we understand sometimes people need to capture logs about their devices for any reason and with chrome kiosk devices you can do just that so I'm going to go ahead and capture logs here this is actually gonna run in the background so if you want to go to somewhere else in the admin console and do another thing while it's running you can do that of course once it's done you can go ahead and just download the file so we'll give you a zip file with a bunch of different logs from the device we can open up the event log and a text editor find anything we need and again this is not the only log capture system out there but it shows the power of having things that are really fully integrated having a cloud native device with the cloud native management working together really well the last thing I'll mention about fleet management is again that we are running trusted tester programs on these things all the time and so if you like anything you're seeing so far or you'd like to try them out and give us some feedback we'd love to have you do that please just come see us right outside the door or after this and we'll be happy to take it out down your information and get you set up with that I also want to mention if you're using the trusted tester program and you send feedback to us and you're wondering where that feedback goes it goes to my inbox so we are really truly reading every single word that you send us we care a lot about building a tool that is is actually simple and scalable and insightful and we can only do that with your help so thank you very much for that next I'm going to invite Marcus up onto the stage to talk about application management so Franks makes for a great first overview of the admin console and also thanks for everybody in the audience for having me especially after the big event yesterday evening so I'm Marcus another give a short overview of the Chrome OS app ecosystem in the next minutes and thereby especially focus on the questions how can we manage these apps basically the Chrome OS app ecosystem is driven by one core idea that's very inherent to Google we want the open web to succeed so imagine a world where basically all your apps on the cloud so all the apps you are using for your business or your entertainment our web apps in this world you could basically work everywhere use every device login to your favorite web app and you are done you could just be productive or entertained wherever you like and this being driven by this idea we have basically these advanced technologies of Chrome OS in the center of our app ecosystem however we are very aware that basically editors of today is it is not possible to realize every application as a bad application because not every system capability is actually available as a bad capability so that's the reason why we have these native apps on the left side namely Chrome apps and Android apps um I'm sure some of you know that Chrome apps are already deprecated on Windows and Mac and that we invest more and more basically into the integration of Android apps into the Chrome OS operating system however both of these native apps have the advantages that you basically can use also some capabilities on Chrome OS device and on the right side you see the Linux apps here so we are better aware that not every developer and not every user for Chrome OS device will use Linux so basically Linux apps are great way to support developers and Chrome OS devices so to conclude with Chrome OS we don't want to build another gated ecosystem but we want the reps to succeed and we do this by native apps at once web technologies and Linux apps on our devices I want to walk food is free pillars now step by step and especially start with the Android apps here so when I was at booth the last two days basically a lot of people were coming and talking to me and they were surprised that actually Android apps are running on a chrome OS device so yes it's possible you can push me basically just go into the Play Store on a Chrome OS device and install nearly every Android app you like there are some restrictions and some of them require camera at the back of your device so these ones don't work but nearly every everything works basically and if you look at basically the app ecosystem that enables this for you you can for example use every communication app you like so if you don't like hangouts for whatever reason you can for example use Cisco jabber on these devices you can use cisco webex you can use Skype and basically to connect to your colleagues you can also use for example Ray's system close and networking apps like VPN to go to login basically into the corporate network of your company and for example the ones of our colleagues at f5 and you can also use VDI apps so for example you can use Citrix VMware Microsoft RDP all these apps are basically part of the Play Store as of today and fifty CI ups you can use for example applications that are very computed computation intensive so if you want to for example design 3d things on your device like using a Katia software it probably doesn't make sense to carry this big notebook that is needed to execute CATIA all the time around with you you can't just run this in the cloud and stream it why are we di it really was and actually the cool thing is that for all these Android apps they are coming out of the Play Store that means that basically the Play Store already filters for harmful apps which helps to increase the security of your device and it's an admin you can even go one step further and write the specific apps for your users so basically you prepare a set of apps that your users should install and you can even go one step further and say okay I want to install this and this app by default for a certain user so that's called force install in our admin console and this allows basically the user to use these apps at the moment where he locks in into his Chromebooks these apps I'll install instantly and you can use them just by default we will see this later on okay but let's move to the core what is basically the web apps here can we do everything without web apps as of today norm if you walk around and you see basically Gmail Google Drive G speed you can have the impression that it's already possible but it sure answers actually it's not possible as of today because some capabilities are still missing and to basically close the gap between today's web apps and the native apps that we have on the system as of today you have free clear initiatives that are described on this slide for example we have one initiative that has the target to basically provide all api's and capabilities to support applications in the web so this includes for example system notifications basically every app should be possible to erase this and notifications every app should be able to create sockets or an app should be able to access the file system so we are adding these capabilities step by step not only on Chrome OS but in general 50 Chrome browser and of platforms out there and the second service that we have progressive web apps especially desktop progressive web apps which allow to install apps offline web apps off line on any device that you like and the first step is that you can basically use webassembly to execute your C++ code which helps only wanting to microwave apps from one platform to another but on the other hand and speeds up a lot so we have the example of figma here so figma is quite a nice app basically to design Android apps and you can run it completely in the browser it's using web assembly based on C++ if you want to know more about these progressive web technologies I invite you to visit this session later on today from my colleague Thomas MD to a free I'm developing on Chrome and it's at 11:40 and the last but not least we have Linux running on Chrome OS so as I said it's targeted to s4 for developers if adi p/n running there you can basically execute your Linux apps and they up quite sandbox from the other apps on the Chrome OS device and February's been set up that we have running here where we see a lot of Corrections for example that you run Android studio and a chrome OS device and then you can basically test the developed Android apps also directly on this device that's actually very used however to be honest like the Linux and equation so crostini is still at an early stage so it runs on nearly offer all of the interface Chromebooks our the admin console management here at the moment the state really can only turn it off on so we are planning to add these capabilities later on this year to conclude the app section I want to highlight that basically all of the apps are kept separated wire sent boxes so you notice probably very well from your Chrome browser so if one tab crashes not the whole browser's crash but only the step is basically shut down and basically every tap is absolutely isolated from the other tabs in your browser the same holds true for your web apps for Chrome extensions for Chrome apps and Android apps on your Chrome OS device let's now move on basically to the management and if you look at management we basically have three main ways to manage Chrome or as apps and let's start with the first one this is basically a new allowed user to do what you like so basically you trust the user to execute apps you don't influence it a lot and this set up is probably very favorable if you have like administrators in your user base and who you don't want to restrict a lot because you you think okay they know what you do I grant them all provisions second way to manage apps is why a black listing and white listing so black listing and white listing works quite nicely for web apps it works for Chrome X apps extensions and also Android apps so the ideas that you either like exclude specific apps from being installed on the user's devices or your whitelist and so you basically say okay the user has the right to install this or desert app and therefore you can basically create a fairly good set of apps and basically restrict the user to what he can do on this device and third step I already mentioned it as to force install apps on a device so you can basically say this app should run on the user user's device and every time he locks in immediately you can like combine these like you can wipe with certain apps and force and some other apps and what's actually pretty cool and what I like about the admin console here is that basically the admin console has quite smart defaults so for example if you are an enterprise and you start the admin console with its defaults you will see that Android is activated by default with all apps available to users so basically if you do don't do anything users and the position to decide which Android apps they want to install which makes quite a lot of sense if you look at an enterprise user however if you are like a school so you have basically in education license the default setting for schools that Android is first shut down and even if you activate it it's activated in a managed mode which means that you basically whitelist the apps that are available for these students and the reasoning behind this is quite clear and we don't want to play students games during the lessons and because nobody would listen to the teacher any longer so basically the admin console helps you quite a lot to have the right defaults here and not to do the wrong thing by any chance okay let's maybe have a look at some examples here that we brought from the admin console so the first one is the integrated atlas so all the apps that you have an Android on Chrome OS are basically listed in this integrated atlas so you have two chrome apps chrome extensions and Android apps in this list and you can easily see what apps are installed on your device and you can easily search for them so we will see that we basically filter first for all Android apps and then we look for the Google Drive app in this example so we go into this list we click and type click on Android and then we have the Android lists apps or if you just type Drive they're usually basically the drive apps that are available for your user base and the second example actually as this one so here we basically want to add a new Play app on the users devices and we don't want to just edit we want to force it solid and pin it pinning means that basically the icon is shown at the lower bar on the user's devices so that he can easily access it and if you want to do that basically you go to the same list you click on the plus button down there then you go to the Play Store and then you search search for the sheets apps inside this Play Store click on it and click select and from this time on you will have to play at the sheet set in your app list and now you can basically select what you want to do it you can allow install it but you can also force and solid block it pin it or force install and pin it and that's what we do here all right this already concludes my part and now I want to hand over to Derek who gives us basically yeah a true use case yeah explains this example and yeah that's morning everyone good to see you all so bright and early on Thursday morning thanks Max and Marcus and Google for having me here today so like all the stuff that you saw in the slides previous I'm really excited to talk to you about how SoulCycle use basically a lot of the technology that you saw in transforming all of our Studios to pixel books I want to give you a little bit of history first so SoulCycle opened in 2006 we had one studio 30 bike and in the 13 years that we've been open we've now renounce 92 studios during times of rapid growth that could mean 12 to 14 to use per year and super excited to say that we'll be opening our first either in London in I want to say June each studio has seven to eight classes per day and that makes about 600 rides I'll leave you guys to do some napkin math on what that looks like and then to make all that work from a tech side we're looking at 2500 staff across the United States and Canada and 500 computers across the fleet so when we started to look at replacing our existing technology for new technology we came up with a few rules and a challenge we wanted our new technology to prepare for innovation in the future so basically that means for point-of-sale running transactions day to day for retail transactions and also whatever is in the looking glass of technology we also wanted to be able to allow our studio staff to interact with our riders in a new way so for any of you that have ridden a SoulCycle before we've got a front desk with our studio staff behind it and we wanted to be able to look at what technologies could we use that we could send our studio staff into new areas of our studio and start to look at different types of interaction with our riders this is the interesting one what we wanted to do what to try and find a single tool that looks after the management of our Hardware of our applications our users without a lot of like the traditional glue that comes with running an enterprise suite of hardware and end-users specifically we want to look at modern identity platform security features like two-factor authentication we wanted to look at an easy way for application administration and also to tie that in together with a single Hardware management platform and of course we had a good mix of aging computers out there so we decided how do we can replace that in a quick and simple way that doesn't end up with a mix of hardware in our Studios over time thankfully we've been PCI compliant for several years now and in choosing our hardware and we wanted be able to make sure that we could maintain our PCI compliance but also to see if we could reduce what that foot problem would look like over time as with any challenge comes a couple of rules one each studio must be upgraded within two to three hours we have a nice little gap in between our morning classes or even classes we wanted to make sure that we could rip out the old technology get new technology in there but more importantly prepare the studio staff for that new tech so that when the next ride check in comes along they already feel comfortable with the operations that they need they always feel comfortable with what a device may look like both from logging into the device using our software and primarily focusing on the right interaction as opposed to how do I use this thing this is probably the most important part making sure that our studio staff feel good about what they're about to do changing technology can be really really intimidating for people don't live with it every day this was one of the things that I thought about the most okay taking all of the the challenge and the rules into consideration we started to look around at a mixture of tablets laptops devices do we look at replacing our existing technology with the best and breed in in that line we've been a gmail customer since I want to say 2006 or wasn't there we decided that the best the best move forward was to leverage what we are already used what I use is already using with Gmail we've got we decided to look for Chrome enterprise and for deploying pixel books at all of our Studios with chrome enterprise as you saw in the previous slides we're able to take a lot of the organizational units and the policies that we could associate with those organizational units to identify applications to associate applications to those specific users so that we could tailor their environment of their desktop to precisely what they needed to do to do their job the dust with pixel books we decided to go for pixel books because of ultimately their form factor and their aesthetic I don't know if you for those who have books of books right now they're pretty slick looking devices but and also they you can use them in laptop mode tablet mode and I'll show an example later of how we're using them in all their different forms in moving to a chrome enterprise and full pixel books in all of our studios we decided to also move a lot of our traditional file servers over to Google Drive and team drive this meant that we would be able to unify we'll be able to get some of our enterprise can uses that were on more traditional devices and increase the communicate the collaborative function productivity of of Google sheets Google and notes and Docs and share that with our studio staff for printing this was an interesting salt so we decided to go for we looked at some hard web based devices that basically use Google Cloud Print which was pretty good we ended up using a mixture of Google Cloud Print devices Google Cloud Print printers but also there's a the Windows cloud connector that we all that we ran on we ran on our traditional print servers thankfully we were able to maintain our peace our compliance pretty stressful thing to actually get done but what I wanted to share with you is just a couple of things that made that happen for us trusted apps via the Play Store with trusted apps we were able to essentially prove the integrity of those applications with Google asset management auditors like to know that you know where your stuff is so so a lot of the reporting tools that we were able to use helped in our in our compliance finding there G suite IDP using two-factor authentication for as part of the users security orders it also really liked and a couple of other things so if any of you had to deal with PCI compliance before for your internal security scans were there footprinting the devices themselves and doing security scans very nice to know that there were not many open ports on a pixel book unlike a traditional computer where there's usually a fairly a myriad of open ports most important that together we sent our guys on a studio tour so we have a fairly small lean team broke them out into smaller into regions so we took California a Central East Coast were able to send one one person to each studio and easily go through the upgrade from our traditional computer pixel books this is Las Vegas to do as we want to walk you through what you're seeing right here so on this is a front desk here where we've got pixel books that we use for point of sale and for booking and then you'll see on the right-hand side they say this is a pixel books running in tablet mode that we use for digital signature right a waiver application so when a rider enters the studio if they're brand new we can get them checked in at the front and they can just walk around the side and then go sign a digital waiver and go and ride but also because of the way that pixel book was now that we're looking at books are books in different iterations we can send them out to the front of the studio run retail you know kind of use them for any kind of application that we see fit there's a few things we learned from all of this that I wanted to share with you listen to your users I think everybody when you're looking at replacing new tech or putting in new tech you you think you know what your users need we spent a lot of time sitting without with people in corporate office and in our studios asking them questions about what their workflows look like what are they doing from day to day what problems do they have with what they have what they have right now and how do we go about fixing those in finding those souls be creative sometimes I know I've been and I've been working in tech now for 20 years sometimes there's an expectation on how to go about doing something right I need this application that does that I can fix this by doing that this is an opportunity or what I learned was let's rethink it again from and looking at some of the five familiar on things like is there an Android app that could actually solve this problem a little better do I look at reaching out do I look at replacing this happen tirely where they web app all of those things and lastly reach out to Google talk to your reps I don't think that we would have been anywhere near a successful or admit as quick as we could have been had we not spoken to all of our reps about how do I make team drive work with pixel books how do I make how do I do this thing with a policy that makes that thing work I would have scratched my head for an awful lot longer had I not been for the help of Google and one hand it back to max and Marcus to Q&A thank you so much [Applause] [Music]
