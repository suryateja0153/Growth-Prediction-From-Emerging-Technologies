 [Music] good afternoon and welcome I want to thank everybody who's joined us this afternoon it's great to see just a full crowd also to welcome everybody on the livestream or those who are going to be watching the recording I thank everybody for your time and for your attention I'm super excited to be here I'm Charles and I'm Eric and together we're both part of the Google cloud developer relations team and we focus on G suite and one of the neat things about the work that we do is we get to see all the interesting ways people try to use G suite to build applications and our kind of favorite specialty both because we find it really useful but also it excites us a lot is the way people use spreadsheets in their organizations and so the idea behind this session was let's talk about how do we take applications sorry take spreadsheets and make them into applications now real quick a little bit about this talk we're really not here to talk about all the deep feature functionality of spreadsheets a lot of folks know that we're really here to talk about the journey and the lifecycle of an evolving an idea from innovation and creation right through its lifecycle and beyond as well too so we'll talk about the different progress and the journey that a spreadsheet can take and so I'll step back for a second starting off the first thing that's really super cool to note is nobody here really needs a definition of a spreadsheet obviously everybody knows what a spreadsheet is and that's one of the great things about targeting spreadsheets as an application platform it's because obviously you know how to use it and other users know how to use it however one of the interesting things if I asked every single person in this room to give me your definition of a spreadsheet and what are the use cases you use to build a spreadsheet I'd hear a lot of the same things I'd also hear an awful lot of different things and that's really the magic behind a spreadsheet the versatility of them really kind of makes them magical which is why I prefer this definition of a spreadsheet now a little history flashback Bob Frankston when he was co-founder of visicalc said the definition of a spreadsheet is a magic sheet of paper that can perform calculations and recalculations and it truly is magic first of all I want to make a shout out to visit calc it's now 40 years old founded in 1979 which by the way is probably older than a lot of folks in this room I know it's older than you right but I actually used it when it was a brand-new application and it was the first time I really saw the power and the beauty and the magic of what a spreadsheet can do and a couple things about a spreadsheet at that time was it was the first computer program that really wasn't just a top-down sequential way of doing processing right didn't write instructions and the computers execute them off in order it allows you to put content anywhere within the spreadsheet and it updated it automatically and that was kind of neat right he didn't have to be a programmer to learn how to write those instructions which was the other really super cool thing about it it really kind of democratized the way people could build solutions using a spreadsheet now I remember and again I literally did use these on the Apple 2e that you see sitting here which does kind of date myself but I remember the first time I saw this I was like well what do I am I gonna do with this thing and I remember I'm a super huge baseball fan if anybody who knows me and I used to keep all the statistics of all the different baseball stats and every single game I would lock this on a piece of paper and do the hand calculations and erase the old calculations and then I discovered visicalc and the rest was history for me I was able to go in and automatically make that work and so that was my very first application a very long time ago and as you can say obviously the rest is history so since then we've had past visit cup we've had super calc and symphony and Quattro Pro and Excel and Lotus 1-2-3 and now today obviously with sheets and sheets as a service this makes us one of the most ubiquitously widely available platforms for building applications in the world and that's the spreadsheet using something like sheets so obviously it became a much better calculator that we had in years past and that was really the prime use for at the beginning was how do we make a better calculator but since then as people do when they build solutions is they find new ideas and new ways of using things and I always say a spreadsheet has become kind of the Swiss Army knife of building applications you can build a lot of different things with it commonly you see people build database based solutions in a spreadsheet sometimes we think it's a good idea sometimes we're get very afraid of what people try to do with it we kind of say misusing yeah spreadsheet is an application but again there's a lot of great features and functionalities in there of course people do other things like you know analysis and ad hoc modeling and all kinds of different things probably the most common thing you see people do is they use a spreadsheet for list management all right you come in you got this nice 2d grid of data you start typing things in there with you kick off a project you do something else we do it all the time here oh yeah you can see the history of my thought process by looking at the history of my spreadsheets right it's like a reflection of how I've approached work at work absolutely and so obviously a ton of other things you can do with it and so that's why our argument today is spreadsheets make really good applications and so you're like what what application so it's kind of a broad word I think apps I think in a smartphone app or something whatever but really when you think about what is an application it's simply a piece of software designed for specific use for a specific user or set of users right so it's simply to make it work and so by that I say a spreadsheet is a really good application platform and again if you're looking on from a development standpoint anyone traditional Multi three-tiered development you've got the UI layer you've got the logic layer you got the database layer this spreadsheet gives you all those things right I've got that 2d grid where I can quickly put in data by rows and columns and I can sort and filter and make it pretty which is kind of my UI layer then of course I've had a full logic layer where I can use not just the built in functionality but actually extend it and customize on my own using things like Apps Script which we'll talk a little bit about today so it really is a great application platform and that's why our argument today is that spreadsheets make a really good application right really fast easy to get started I can go up to the formula bar and go sheets dot new and I'm already creating an application an idea how many times a day to use something like that I can I lose count absolutely it's - the other thing to decide being fast and easy and accessible is the fact that it's so feature-rich a lot of folks like I want to build my own application my way and my answer is always if you think of all the built-in functionality of spreadsheet if you were to create the ability to store data clearly to analyze data and format it you believe the things like pivot tables and charts if you were to build all that plumbing and infrastructure yourself you'd still be working on it with a spreadsheet you can be done with an application way often way faster than anything else he can build on and so for that reason I think it makes a super great application I think the other thing that I find very kind of special about spreadsheets is unlike a lot of development paradigms where you know you have to go out and gather requirements and then go back and build the solution as a developer then go back to the user and see if it works spreadsheets can be built using teamwork you know it's easy as I can share a spreadsheet right just like I share a file I can go out and I can bring others involved in the process and whether they're technical or not and they can actually help me build my application which again is very unique and so it's very iterative very trial very bring the end user in who knows the business process likely as good as you do or maybe better and you can have come up with a better solution yeah and this is something we see at Google all the time I mean we've only just been speakers here next we haven't organized the whole thing the number of spreadsheets I've seen that power this event is dizzying right like it was the right choice for building out a whole bunch of mini applications that make this come to life and I feel like as especially as a coming from a developer background sometimes you get a bit of spreadsheet shaming right you send out a spreadsheet feel like really another spreadsheet it is the right choice for a large amount of problems and I think you know of the points you highlighted here exactly double down on why that's the case however we don't want to overemphasize and say you should build every type of spreadsheet application in the world you can because there are some times where it doesn't make sense now one of things that we were talking about earlier before we came on was how great it is use a spreadsheet where you can kind of use trial and error and see if the solution fits right you can know pretty quickly whether or not it's a good place to put a spreadsheet to build a solution right there's certain kind of tells that there is also one of the neat things about it is you can use it for awhile and actually kind of outgrow the boundaries of a spreadsheet but get a lot of use out of it and maybe not waste all that development time on an application that could stay right inside of a spreadsheet right so it's a great place to fit that in which i think is kind of neat so when does a spreadsheet not make a good application well there's some kind of you know obvious things that you may see for example if you have a very extensive you know logic layer where there's a lot of complex functionality and you may need extensive UI's or a lot of hand-holding of the user or protection of the data then that may not be a good place to put in a spread right you've probably seen this I reckon let me ask the folks in the room how many people have ever seen a spreadsheet that just grew out of control it went from mission critical to mission impossible so nearly everybody in the room hey keep your hands off if you're the person that built that spreadsheet now now also keep your hands up if you're sorry right I mean you see this quite a bit I mean the phrase I saw you have once in our notes spreadsheets happen right like it just happened and I think it's not Anna the fact that you got to that point means that your idea was right it was the right thing to build the fact that everyone started using it it grew out of control meant that it had value so I think it's it's in a way it's a sign of its popularity and its success then it grew to that point absolutely but don't overdo it don't create an application in a spreadsheet just because you can for example there's a lot of great third-party tools out there that I see people see people try to recreate in a spreadsheet just because you can create an expense reporting tool in a spreadsheet doesn't mean you should do it you want to make a CRM in a spreadsheet yeah good is that the best thing to do maybe not right so you have to figure out that buy versus build and do it but the great thing again if spreadsheets let you evolve it's really about their journey and the process of using how the tool allows you to it early create the best working prototype you can before you go somewhere else yeah and this screenshot here is an example of one of the many spreadsheets that I've managed over time it's the case that within Google we have many many teams working on many things simultaneously it's just difficult to keep track who owns what where is it in the life cycle where are the different resources associated with it and as a part of developer relations for me it's API so what are all our API seems at what's the latest release where are the docs I built a spreadsheet for first my own purposes than my team's purpose is before I know it actual product teams pm's they were coming to me looking for this information I used this spreadsheet and it was this why and by the way for the folks not in the room it was really wide you went way out past Z yeah if you go past compare Z you've gone too far it is a little bit too far it was it was a time to hand it over and luckily you know I had proved out the concept I proved that this was data that need to be captured people found it valuable but it was better maybe to move it to another platform so there was a new team that was looking to kind of help organize all this information so they took that my spreadsheet as material and they turned around and built it out maker app which is the second screenshot I had nothing to do with it a few weeks later it was live running we've used it ever since it's a way better at kind of providing cross-linked data obviously you don't have to worry about people stamping over each other's information the scrolling problem is gone so this was a case where you know I don't think I could have skipped the spreadsheet step that step of proving the idea getting the raw material was required to get to this destination and that that part of the journey is really what we're here to talk about today also let's do it yeah so we're gonna jump over now to a little bit of a live demo and Charles I do need you to sign in briefly so we're gonna talk about the life cycle of a spreadsheet right now this is a not every spreadsheet goes through this exact path but I'm hoping this is a little emblematic emblematic of how things are going to run so you're starting a project first thing you want to do open your browser and what I do and what Charles mentioned is sheets dot new if you don't use that entry point so what you can actually with just typing in your browser create a brand new Google sheet so like I said anytime I start a project Here I am in Google sheets so the hypothetical world we're gonna be in here is one where you're approving requests from your team to travel for various reasons so I have been doing it by email and I'm getting tired of that so I'm gonna create a travel requests spreadsheet and I'm gonna have a little helper on my side here leading us through this journey but this stage of the lifecycle I'm calling the infancy right I have some kids of my own and I've been thinking a lot of how children develop so I see this as infants where infants come out and they don't even know they have hands they end up scratching their face because they don't even know the own boundaries of their ideas and that's kind of what I see this is like you write you have a blank slate and you're trying to figure out what is in my head what are the pieces of data that matter to me how do I organize them how do I think about the problem right and so in this case I'm just throwing some initial data in here I dump it into a sheet this is like my v-0 movie minus 1 right you know this is great but not that great the next thing is I'm calling toddler right this is where they're kind of still about confirming I got a toddler right now as I Drive him to daycare every morning it's all about car truck sign tree he repeats every single word because that's how he gets validation that he understands and is speaking the same common language as I am and at this stage this is where you're using the share button as Charles mentioned earlier to bring others into your development process right so you share it with others and collaboratively you help figure out you know you missed some edge cases you missed some boundaries when you were thinking about this problem so in this case I share it with some other managers who are doing a similar approval process and they're you know what we've got to capture what state it's in there are different cities with the same name we got to have a start and end date to figure out how long they're traveling and we got to break out the flight and hotel costs so we can get a better idea of is they are they spending the money and the right things right so you know Google sheets is obviously has a long track record of collaboration commenting sharing this is where that comes into play but you know there's more spaces to progress the next I'm calling grade school right this is where your child learns how to sit up straight follow directions hold a pen it's like about kind of playing the part of being an adult even before you're all the way there and for me this is about putting on that kind of external face so for me formatting I am a big spreadsheet formatting a hardcore person I do not like spreadsheets I'd even have extra columns I'm not using and I actually wrote an add-on that does just that and you know so this is for me is about you know use your bold use your frozen rows and headers conditional formatting I love doing the one where you highlight the whole row based upon just the yes or no here at the end that gives me a really clear validation as I'm looking at the content and then data about data validation where you can add a drop-down so that helps give users signals about how to use this application right this UI isn't just surface-level it's not just because you like the looks of it it is giving hints to users about what the data means and how to use the application and those hints are important I can't agree more when you see that you know that just black and white spreadsheet with all these numbers on it it really doesn't help the user understand what the meaning of the data is and using some subtle color I don't mean bright red yellow and green which blares at you and blinks and does those crazy things but making it look so I can draw that users eye to something like you've got here I think really helps a spreadsheet kind of pop totally at this point I mean this is where a lot of my spreadsheets top right part of this lifecycle idea is that you don't have to move all the way to the end all the time right this could be a very good spreadsheet for doing your job this is what that earlier spreadsheet I had looked like a lot just with a lot more in it but there is more room to kind of progress through this lifecycle so the next phase I'm calling middle school here you know in middle school it's a little bit about realizing maybe your parents need to have some distance between you and your personal life right maybe you start kind of keeping a private diary right it's about you know not everyone needs access to all the same information and so in this phase it's really about thinking about access right so before the nice thing about a spreadsheet is you can find anyone in the kind of bad side it's very democratize everyone can see and modify everything and that's not always the right way to go so what we do here is we actually apply some data protection to our ranges saying you know that approved column you shouldn't be able to enter a request and approve it at the same time let's send so that only the travel approvers group at our corporation can actually make that change you know a simple thing but one that kind of now takes this application and adds a richness around separating data the other thing you can do is kind of use a private spreadsheet right so maybe you use this main spreadsheet for entering the requests and keeping track of what's going on but if you've used an import range you can kind of suck in a copy of it and then maybe here in the notes I'll list out why I denied a certain piece of travel just so that I can kind of have it for a record without maybe exposing every piece of my under thoughts to the people doing the requests so one thing we're still saying in the world of spreadsheets we haven't broken out yet we're already adding complex things like access control into our application the next phase I call high school this is where you know you get your first job you learn about how to check in and check out on time how to work the register it's about process it's like all building out the process right you know having everyone in a spreadsheet just kind of start adding rows and being on top of each other maybe going back and modifying something they shouldn't before that process is a little chaotic and there's a lot of times where you really want to have a more streamlined process so that people are channeled into the right destination so what we've done here is upgraded this spreadsheet to use Google Forms Google Forms has long been a part of spreadsheets that's built right in and it makes it so that we can now maybe unshare this spreadsheet with the whole organization and just the manager group and then direct everyone who needs to make a request to the form so I've got a little link here so the same information we're capturing before why are you going where is all captured in the in the form and they just get this one view into the process they don't have to see where everyone else on their team is traveling who's been approved and who hasn't further kind of separating out the the different parties responsible and you can see we even get time stamps it's a bit of a nicer flow for users and it just helps kind of once again narrow who can access what at what time kind of the last phase of this the sheets lifecycle I'm calling the college student right this is where you you're really learning the bringing in the professional aspects but you know you still go home for a break and like sleep in your old bed so you're still in the comfort of sheets you have it left but you really want to start bringing in app like functionality that people come to expect and this is where we turn to Apps Script as Charles mentioned before Apps Script is our cloud JavaScript scripting language baked deeply into G suite including Google sheets that allows you to add a whole lot of extra functionality that's not built into sheets with relatively simple amount of programming so what we're doing right now behind the scenes is creating a new app script attached to this spreadsheet that's going to add a whole bunch of extra functionality so you can get to Apps Script by going to tools script editor it was there the whole time if you never tried it and you know there's a lot going on in this Apps Script and we're not going to dig through every line of code what I'm gonna do is just run it to show you what the end result is in total here there's a little over a hundred lines of code and so you can actually accomplish a lot without a lot of coding we use the same ooofff that you would use in any sort of fully built application to access your g suite data it's going through the exact same channels admins have the exact same visibility into data access so as I head back to the spreadsheet now you'll see there's a brand new menu item up there called travel request that is definitely not built into sheets with only a little code I can add in my own custom UI elements and if we're talking about guiding users to the right part of your application there's nothing like custom UI to really put them in the right direction in this case I'm just showing a simple dialog with some calculations this is not interesting but you can imagine all of the different extra companion functionality you could build in with dialogues and with sidebars and menu items now that's interesting but I think what's more interesting is doing things automatically right having someone click the menu item is nice I think the real savings come from when you take away a manual so what we're gonna do is submit another request this time we're headed off to Google i/o and I submit that request and it shows up here in the sheet now before maybe if I was the manager I'd have to remember to come in and open the sheet every once in a while but with Apps Script I can actually make it so that every time a new form entry is submitted it takes an action in this case I'm having it send me an email with every time a new request has been sent I can open it up and in this case I've created just a simple summary of what's been requested as well as I can link right back into the sheet so I can easily take action on it there's way more ways you can get advanced here but this is a you know a simple way to get started so listen 100 lines of code users don't do anything yeah and you create a workflow application yeah we're definitely getting into the realm of workflow right here and not only that once I am in that spreadsheet and I say you know what Google i/o Eric you are approved I can also react to that change so I just changed a cell from from blank to yes and in this case the person making the request and approving it is the same it's me but the the requester can also get an email saying that their travel arrest was approved this is like very the kind of what this unlocks in your organization can be huge right the ability to kind of take all of that manual work remembering just takes it all off the table and builds it directly into Apps Script and then I'll just give one last app script demo here which is that so you can extend the Google sheets in other ways as well so let's say I wanted to figure out you know if they were gonna drive to this this location like could they do it do they really need to fly and so what I've added in here is a new custom function called driving distance this is one that automatically knows where our office is located and then calculates how far it would take to drive there and miles it's just like every other formula you can copy and paste you can drag down and all of a sudden now I'm getting a whole bunch of contextual information that's built into this sheet and adds a lot more richness to the data so we're gonna cut back to the slides now you know that's kind of the life cycle up to here but when you've reached that point you've got a very functional application in a spreadsheet but as Charles said there's times when you'll even outgrow those bounds yeah absolutely so you saw that application did feel like a full application and I think it was a great job in the effort was pretty limited but what happens if maybe you realize that you know folks are in there trampling over the data or the UI isn't into it enough or you just simply want a streamlined application that is very specific to that solution so the user doesn't get lost you never the right you know any documentation or worry about support you want to make it just seem like it's a full-blown solution without the spreadsheet kind of in the way so it's a valve to a point where you've got the business requirements down you know it works well then people like it the app is still needed why not build a full-blown app on top of it now of course you could go up and you can create a full stack application alright you go out start you know spin in Java code or Python code or whatever build your own UI's and do all that stuff but before you do all that wouldn't be nice we had an interim step where you don't have to go out and do all that full work and maybe a lot of folks don't even have the ability as a developer to do that well G suite has an alternative and it's a tool that's called at maker real just quick show of hands for folks in the room how many folks have seen app maker already or no one understand that maker so a good amount of folks have so that's awesome for those you know more than half which is really good news for those that don't at Maker is a Google family member it's a product that's available with Google Business Edition and Enterprise Edition which allows you to quickly build a rapid application and right so the beauty of that is with a limit amount of code which by the way it's all basic pong app script that Eric was talking about a second ago you can go off you can create that point solution using app maker and so a couple things about it to make it real simple and easy instead of spending a lot of time going out and creating your own UI you'll really come and drag-and-drop this this user interface and not waste time fixing it all up you can do it pretty quickly and uniquely so I think that's one of the big things about it you know enough of me talking about its it's a lot of folks have already seen it I'm gonna flip over back to the the thing it and give you a quick show of how we take this application and we make it into an app maker app all right so when it gets up there okay so picture the spreadsheet again it's got a little more colorful we've got some more data in anything it gets large but you want to take into at maker one of the good things about this journey in the way these products work super well together is I can use this spreadsheet both of the logic of the data within it and the data itself to build my first application so let's do that so to get started I can come in and getting started as real super easy I can say new and if you come under here you'll notice next to appscript in between sites I can see at maker so it's really to get started it's built right into my environment of course as long as it's been turned on inside of your environment by your administrator if it has you can come here real fast and simply say you know app maker google.com if you want to do even a faster way to get there and create a new project before you do again if you're new to the product you'll notice a lot of ways to get started on there's some tutorials code labs even some great samples to actually use and you can even put them into production or use them as a learning tool to get started so let's create a brand new app from scratch you'll notice there's a lot of templates out of the box so you can see here a bunch of different templates that are available there's even a neat one called Trouville and I'm sorry the travel app approval already where I'm going to show you at the end what it looks like if you use the template on the box but we're gonna build our from scratch and have a brand new application okay so here comes it'll go off in a creative brand-new solution for us we see you've got the blank design surface let's come in here name this thing travel request and we'll keep the same theme going and the first thing I need to do is go out and bring my data in or create my data model so I'm gonna come in here and say add data model and you'll notice there's a few different ways I can do that for example I can bring in a cloud sequel database or create one which we'll do here in a second but also I could use a calculated one where I could bring data in from other places and actually create it in memory and work with it there as well as I also could bring in directory information so if I want to work with my user profile data stuff like that I could do that as well too which is great in a request application like this but let us take the dinero a generic cloud sequel version a we'll name it travel requests and instead of building it from scratch we're gonna say import fields or I can go out and I can take that Google spreadsheet and select it from Drive you can see here's that colorful spreadsheet pull it in and notice it'll go out and look at the different sheets within there and offer me to build off of that model so I can come in here and say let's say next it'll bring in all the fields it'll bring in the column names for me and even the data types this is super neat I don't have to go out and define my data in grave detail I come in and see the different data types so when I actually do data validation or I use some of the controls and widgets available inside of that maker they'll automatically come out based upon that data type as a preference so I'll say create here and I'll go off and I'll create that first data model and it's that simple to get started now I notice I can do a bunch of other things with the data for example I can create views on it or relationships I have a more complex data model and I you know it's kind of similar back in a spreadsheet where I would do their V look sorry if you look ups or use some you know validation handling on it but again I can build it all in here to my data model I they believe had a defense as well as security this is kind of one of the things I think at maker does really really well we were talking about a spreadsheet how people can trample over your code or or your formulas or your data here I can make the models based upon user permissions and profiles so like for example in this case I can have approvers only see certain data that obviously my users couldn't inside the model so I can do that as well too but other than that my data model is done that quickly and that fast in this case okay so the next thing I need is the user interface to take a look at it so I can come in here and I can create a new page oh there's one already stub than here for me which I'll just say rename this will say Edie request I say okay and now I've got a blank design canvas up here where I can come in and just start adding widgets on top of it so again if you see all these different widgets in the panel here I can put things like you know date boxes and star ratings and text controls and all these types of things in here but one of the neat things is I can come in real quickly and add one without having to do a lot of work I can create a form based one and add it to my design surface and just like this I can choose my data source say next pick the type in this case insert and pick the fields I want out of that data model I don't want the approved item on there obviously again I don't want people to proving them either like you didn't and it's a finish and there you go that's how fast I can come up and I can build my first UI screen and again so far to date I've written 0 lines of code getting this done which is kind of neat now one thing you'll notice it's kind of a large design surface here so what I'd like to do is also make this mobile ready so it's really a good tool for building mobile based applications as well and I can have a little guidance up here I could say you know what let's make this for larger phones since most folks that I want to build this for have a large phone and let's make it porch it so they hold it this way when they're walking down the hall of creating travel requests I can just manage it like that way and snap it to the grid so you can see how the responsive design makes it kind of neat there where again I haven't done any work but now I've got them the beginnings of a mobile app okay other things I can do I've got a property window over here which I can change any of these controls do things like change the look and feel change the names etc in this case I want to make these buttons look a little more mobile-friendly and use our material design so I'm gonna take this submit button and the Clear button multi select that and apply those styles so for example I'm gonna come in here find something that looks a little better a little more intuitive come down here oh but these are good I'll use these fab ones and also I need to come in here and change that text on this one button because there's no submit material design name but there is an ad one I'll put that in there and real quickly see again no code but just one change and I've got my form ready to go so let's take a look at how this thing runs real fast I can preview this so again another thing about app makers it's really good for iterative design I can come in here see how the app works I've got a preview mode once I go through my kind of required approvals here which I only have to do the first time as the developer of this you'll see I can come through and pick these quick get the off for the K Shane and here in a second I'll have a preview of my application ok so this is the preview window where we've got a little debug tool available here it kind of makes a smaller but notice again out of the box I can come in here say you know what let's put in a request for Charles he's going to next next which is in London and that start date I believe it's sometime out in October you see we've got nice rich tools and again I haven't done anything to model these it already matically pick the right type of ones based upon the format that I read when you build that data model so again next is gonna end there and flight cost of London so from the east from here on the west coast to London kind of expensive so I'm gonna say that flight is a lot and notice how it new again because I'm looking for a number it's automatically validated the data so again without even doing anything I can make sure I get the right in my application which I get into spreadsheets kind of hard people can put the wrong thing in and unless you wrote a lot of code or did some validation rules around that it's kind of hard so this case I can just come up and say you know what flies gonna cost about two thousand dollars and it's Rob about twenty five hundred for the hotel in London and I add the record so that's how fast you can start collecting data and building an app maker app let's quickly create a form that allows you to now do the approval process so let's go back to the design surface and I'm just gonna create a new page and again a couple of different types I can create the first is kind of a full page but I was look into a page fragment so we can reuse that across my entire application as well as create some modal dialog boxes that pop up which is kind of neat this case I just want a full page and I'll just call this approve request and let's pick our data source again again so we don't do a lot of work and be all that binding will be done automatically behind the scenes I say create I'll come back to over to my widgets I'll pick that table and I'll put it out there again just take the default I'll make it editable but only for the approval because I only want people to be able to prove this there you go and I've got a few other options about sorting or deleting and adding records in here which I'll just accept all the defaults and you'll notice I'm still on the big phone portrait this is a little wide like either shrink it or go back to custom we're in this case I just want to make it wider and bring that over get a little design surface issue here on this row me you're developing this on a larger screen which makes it easier I'm a little bit out of real estate or if I can grab the thumb and pull it over let's previous and see what it looks like up wait before I do that I want to bring my data in and you'll notice the data comes in separately on this thing and you know I have a good idea here before I even bring the data in let's make this so people can see the location of this user request remember I said earlier about making data very visual anything here is I can come through and there's a lot of other widgets I can add for example if I wanted to add a location map so I could see without having to read where someone going so if I see it somewhere far luxurious like Hawaii or something I would know and I could you know make a decision pretty quickly so this case I want to come in and what I need to do is simply bind up that map by saying you know what let's take the address and change its binding to the location of that data model so as I scroll through those I can see real quickly all of those it's a little copy and paste of my API key so we'll actually run and I can use that model now that I didn't bring the data in again let's try that one more time I keep jumping the page so you recognize when you brig the data model in it doesn't actually bring the data as well it just helps you build the model so you have to specifically come out here into the data settings and say you know what I want to import that data as well - yeah I think it's often the case actually that you'll have even more than one spreadsheet like you know copies and copies of spreadsheets use the different departments you can actually now unify all those spreadsheets together into your data model kind of bringing those separate processes into this one application absolutely so I can come in here and I can say select that and bring it in choose my model it'll go out look through drive again it'll take a second there it is we say select we say import okay so they're perfect oh man we've got our 30 rows in here now if I go back and I run this and preview it and pick that import form you'll notice as I go through all the data is in there as I pick different ones I can quickly see how the map updates so again I've got live bound data in my application and did very little once I realized I got the right sheet to bring into the data so pretty cool and again you saw how just from a few drag and drops and a couple clicks I was able to bring a mini application in if I was the fast forward and for example start working with a template this is the built-in template of what it looks like and you can see either starting with a template or with a little more effort you come in and you could build quite a bit of an application with very little effort now people always say you know that maker a low code or no code or a lot of code or what is it really if you look at this application you can see I've got a few data models you can see how the date is normalized like lodging and transportation is out but again pretty straightforward you can see I've got a bunch of different pages for example that manage things like the requests and the dashboards but to be honest if you look at the code you can see there's a little bit of code behind it so for example our some client items that you know and a page request or you know prove the page but it's not an awful lot of code so I was kind of say it's kind of an in-between some middle code yeah no it's kind of I think in the code in this case is just it's letting you customize right because what you built right there worked right out of the box but like sometimes you need to continue really customize optimize that's where the code comes in I feel like it's more like an additive layer absolutely they're welcome cool so that's our maker let's go back to the slides sure you know looking at app maker if I want to go back to my lifecycle analogy I kind of think of it a little bit like renting an apartment right like you can paint the walls you can decorate but the end of the day if the boiler breaks that's not your problem right like there's it we're taking a lot of the hard part's around managing data building models building you eyes making sure they work on multiple browsers Google is taking that kind of off your plate allowing you to have a customized existence but still a simple one I think the last stage here is the home owner right this is where you know I want to buy the whole thing if I want to tear out every wall that's up to me but also if something goes wrong it's also on me too all right and that's when you really want to go beyond gee suite to build out your own top-to-bottom custom application you know it's a great when you get to this point not every application gets to this point very many exists as spreadsheets or as that make it wraps but there are times when it's so mission-critical you want to have deeper integrations into internal systems that you need to kind of hand it over to IT or work in coordination to build out something completely custom and this is where we the legacy right this is building something that lasts for a long time you know the nice thing is if you've gone through that AppMakr stage app maker is backed by cloud sequel so you know you can right away start working on that data there's no important get into another system or figuring out how to move it around I think you could actually even have both applications the app maker and maybe the new one you're working on at the same time operate on the same data model right because it's cloud sequel it's very easy to kind of share that data layer between where you came from and where you're going the other thing I just kind of put out there is that you know users still like sheets right even if you've kind of our evolving beyond a sheet you're kind of making this thing production-ready you know users still like working in sheets you don't have to actually give up on sheets I think what you can do is say sheets is gonna be a view into our application it's gonna be a subset it's gonna be a window into the data and process and so you know one of the tools that's in the toolbox here is the Google sheets API it allows you to from your professional application from no java.net you name it take data and move it into and out of sheets behind the scenes for users this these screenshots here come from one of our code labs we have up that say like we view that you have a custom system push data into sheets for reporting right as Charles was saying there are so many things you don't want to rebuild it's not fun to rebuild sharding it's not fun to rebuild pivoting right don't do that don't waste your time building out those sheets features instead think of sheets as a reporting tool that you could instantly use for whatever application you've built right so take subsets of your data of use of your data push it to sheets and then give it users in a form that they're familiar with that they'd like to work with that they know how to mash up and kind of start that cycle all over again you know in if you want to get really advanced you could even start using sheets in the sheets API as a bulk editing platform right as nice says your custom UI is it's probably always designed of where they edit save edit save right and a lot of times in certain use cases people want to do bulk editing sheets is a great tool for that as well another way you can kind of stay relevant in sheets is with an add-on that sidebar that guided us through the lifecycle was a custom add-on I built in this demo domain called lifecycle of a spreadsheet and you can do the exact same thing you can have an internal application and you can build a companion add-on that it kind of starts adding that relevant contextual information into sheets bringing in data kicking off process is kind of bridging the gap between that other URL that your users might forget and the sheets that they are working in day in and day out yeah I think it's a big one thing a lot of folks don't understand and their lifecycle is you know I've written a great application for my spreadsheet how do I use it for other spreadsheets and that's what the add-on comes in yeah the nice thing about an add-on is that although you can build one and distribute it to the whole world which we have a large library of them you can also just keep it within your organization so you can make it that some custom functionality is now available instantaneously to anyone in your organization who opens up sheets and that can be a really powerful way to kind of not have to have a whole nother discovery process for this capability I'd also be remiss if I didn't give a shout out to data studio kind of a close cousin of the G suite family one you've probably heard about here already a bit at next you know it's yet another very powerful way to take data that's in sheets or in cloud sequel build visualizations build charting I've created some really nice dashboards in it that my whole team uses in it's another way you can kind of take what is a process that's moved out of G suite but still kind of make it relevant using the tools that G suite has and then one more thing is just the G Street marketplace I wanted to call this add that you know although we talked about some tactics here today that you can use to turn grow spreadsheets into applications we have a lot of great partners who are also building solutions in this space the tree-sweet marketplace is a great place to go to develop to both find those kind of custom solutions for turning spreadsheets and applications as well as some point solutions that Charles mentioned there are a lot of times in which you you may reach that point where your spreadsheets grown too large and maybe it's time to think about that by versus bill decision and the G screen marketplace is a good place to discover apps that instantly work with G suite that connect up to users identity and their data in a way that's pretty seamless so let's recap a little bit of where we've been today spreadsheets we think are a great place to start they're great for prototyping incubating validating kind of showing that this idea that I have is worthy and right and it has a purpose and a need within the organization absolutely and also you saw how we can do things like add forms and use Apps Script to guide the user through a better experience by adding custom logic functionality that we can use for getting input from them and then taking workflow processes on top of that yeah and then I think app maker is a kind of a great pit stop on the road to kind of building your own fully custom application it allows you to focus on the functionality and not so much the piping and the architecture you get to add value you immediately and then kind of not have to worry about some of those harder bits yeah and then finally we recognize that you know even though your solution may not be centered in sheets sheets are definitely a good component within your larger solution so if you want to use that data without ad hoc functionality or like Eric mentioned you don't want to recreate pivot tables and charts build your solution somewhere else but dump your data where your users really want it back inside of sheets and let them work with it there and you can use anything else in the GCP family talk with your sheets that's right so for learning more a great place to start is our G suite developer site at developers.google.com slash G suite we have linked up there how to find more information about Apps Script add-ons at maker the marketplace as well as we have a lot of getting started materials code labs quick starts reference documentation you name it so yah remembers developers.google.com slash G suite and you get started that's it so we want to thank everyone for coming we would love and crave your feedback so please if you can leave us a star rating tell us what you think and thank you so much for coming [Music]
