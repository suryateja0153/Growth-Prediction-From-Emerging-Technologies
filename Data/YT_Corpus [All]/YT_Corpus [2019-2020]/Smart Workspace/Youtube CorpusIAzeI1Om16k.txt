 hi my name is Ashley Malone and I'm the lead product marketing manager for Gmail and I'm joined by my teammates Deanna Carrie lead UX researcher and Kylee pappan lead designer in this demo we'll show you how Gmail brings together the core elements of work like email chat voice and video calling to make them even more helpful to do that we'll walk through a scenario in which an entirely remote team is preparing for a customer meeting I'll be acting as an account manager at a creative agency and as with many projects things kick off in email when I get a note from Jacob a client I've worked with before he's interested in doing another project together and has attached a creative brief he wants to know if we can talk this Thursday and if I can pull together a project plan beforehand I'm psyched and quickly check my availability in calendar before sending an invite to let him know we're on then I create a room to bring the right people for this project together in one place I add Kylee our faux agencies lead copywriter as well as Samir our principle strategist and Deanna the creative director who worked on the last project with this client I tell the team the good news share the brief and ask everyone to take a look luckily we have a team meeting in a few minutes so I tell everyone we'll talk more live and then I open an ongoing chat with my manager Erica to let her know we've got more revenue coming our way this quarter I can see she's in a meeting but decide to message her anyway so she'll get the news as soon as she's done now it's time for our team meeting so I tab over to me and jump on the call right in Gmail meanwhile I'm outside with my kids and I see the activity come through on my thumb I'm not gonna make it to the meeting so I open the app to let the group know a suggestion and chat makes it easy to message the meeting group directly so I send a quick note and ask Ashley to add Matt our favorite freelance illustrator to the room back on the team call work Oh editing the project plan doc I started live I see Diana's request come through chat and go to invite Matt which adds an external tag to the room looking back at the dock I see Samir and Kylie are finalizing what they can but the dock still needs a few details from Deana so I go into our rooms tasks tab and add one for her a little later I see the task that Ashley assigned to me i chat Kylee to see if she's free to catch me up while I'm walking my dog and when she says yes I call her directly right from chat I see the call come through on my laptop and answer as we're talking I realize - Lee and everyone else could probably use the context from the previous project plan so I do a quick search and then add it to our room for Thursday's meeting finally back up my desk I find the project plan doc and our shared files tab and now the finishing touches Ashley requested and mark the task as done and tag at all to let the team know that we are good to go sure enough when I opened the doc I see that the project plan looks ready for the meeting with Jacob on Thursday and with this group using this Gmail I feel ready to
