 all right good morning everyone thank you so much for being here today and we've got a lot to cover so I'm gonna jump right in as many of you know last March Dropbox went public and we've had a great first year as a public company and our business has been growing so we recently crossed 13 million paying users and 400,000 teams on Dropbox business a few months ago we made our first acquisition as a public company welcoming hellosign which is a key signature and document workflow company and we've been busy on the product front including deep integrations with great companies like Salesforce Google Zoom and many others so we've had some exciting developments recently but there's a lot more in the works including what we're gonna talk about today our company mission is to design a more enlightened way of working because the way we're working could be so much better there's so many ways we can improve that experience and that's what we're gonna talk about today so we've got millions of people around the world in millions of organizations using Dropbox in all kinds of different ways we love hearing their stories and I want to introduce all of you to one Dropbox customer in particular so her name is Beth and it turns out that Beth is a probation officer of all things and when we heard that we were curious like how does a probation officer use Dropbox and one thing that we like to do is we take in our research as we take a blank sheet of paper we hand it to a customer and we say show us how you get work done tell us what your day is like and this is what Beth shared with us this is Beth's life at work and as you can see it's a little bit of a mess here's a version that's a little easier to read but it's not much better so what's wrong with this picture well first her stuffs all over the place she's got files in Dropbox but she's also got stuff in Google Docs and she's got stuff an email attachments in a lot of other places her tools don't work together so she's constantly switching back and forth between if apps and she's working across different ecosystems and some of the friction there is actually kind of by design because some of these companies want to lock you into their world lock their competitors out and so some of that pain is on purpose and finally she's got to work with a lot of different people and a lot of different teams so if you think about her day she so we're going to lawyers and please the courthouse her clients and every group she's working with has different systems and different habits that she's got to figure out so this is best working life she is literally caught in the middle all of this spending her days is like human duct tape trying to cut and paste and stitch all this together and that's not alone I'm sure many of your drawings would be similar mine certainly would be we're all living this problem every day it's basically death by a thousand paper cuts and a few years back McKenzie did a time study of where knowledge workers spend their time at work and what they found was these paper cuts really add up so take something like finding information according to the study we spend 19% of our time searching for and gathering information and the first time I heard that I'm like okay yeah makes sense sounds about right but if you step back and really think about that what that's really saying is on average we spend a full day every working week basically functioning as human search engines and think about what that day is like you know you're typing into a search box I try to remember what you're calling that thing just when you find it and halfway through you realize I was this old version then you think about who's got the new ones and a meme and all this brain damage just to get a basic handle on the information we need to do our jobs it's such a waste finding information isn't even the biggest defender when you add in things like email or coordinating people all these tasks that I collectively like to call work about work when you add them all up we spend more than 60% of our time on these things which means that we only spend 40% of our time on the jobs we were actually hired to do and to me this is insane and one of the things we want to do as a company is eliminate as much of that busy work as possible and drive that number down and if you think about it it wasn't always like this if Beth were to draw that picture 20 years ago things would have looked a lot different if you need to find something she just searched her computer and if it wasn't on her hard drive it didn't exist back then her biggest distraction was probably minesweeper and she got 5 emails a day not 500 now I'm not saying we should literally go back to Windows 95 but a lot of things were simpler and then if this is what work looks like today what's it gonna look like 10 years from now it's gonna be totally out of control and so why is this happening how did we get here well in many ways our in our industries unintentionally making this horse because we keep adding all this new stuff all these new productivity and collaboration apps but the old stuff doesn't go away and it feels like all our industry knows how to do is just throw more tools onto that pile without making the existing stuff work well together so now on average most of us are switching between an average of 35 apps per day which is ridiculous and as a result that's become really hard to keep track of everything so just take something like search somehow we now live in a world where it's easier to search all of human knowledge than my company's knowledge if you think about it because at home I have one search box I can Google something but at work I've got 10 and it feels like I'm adding another one every year and it's not just search boxes all of these new apps have their own inboxes they've no messages notifications all these new places to check on top of that we're working in a much more interconnected way than we have in the past so instead of just being on one team many of us are on many teams simultaneously and so there's a lot of good things about this new more fluid and collaborative way of working but it's not all good because if you're working with half a dozen teams many times they're in different companies different time zones and all these teams have different tools and ways of working so you have to you you have to adapt yourself to all of them which creates a lot of headaches so working life has changed a lot in the last couple decades but a lot of tools were using haven't take something like the finder this is a place where a lot of us go to work it's where a lot of our important information lives certainly where our files live and for the last 10 years it's where Dropbox has lived on the desktop and it's served us really well but that experience hasn't changed a lot in the last 30 years and if you look at the finder like maybe there's more buttons and it's in color instead of black and white but the finder we have today isn't that different from the finder that launched with the original Mac back in 1984 if you think about it it's the single player static view of your files and folders and it was a huge innovation it made a ton of sense back in the 80s and remember this was before the not only before the internet before computers were even networked this is when your whole life fit on a couple floppy disks and then since then things like Dropbox have helped bring that experience into the cloud but otherwise there hasn't been a lot happening here and this is how all operating systems works is how Dropbox works and some of you might be thinking well wait a minute you know I'm I'm not using a lot of files I'm living in the browser these days and that's true so maybe you have 50 tabs open and 50 Google Docs open but even there the experience everything is using the same metaphor right it's all this giant sprawling lists of disorganized stuff this is how Google Drive works this is how onedrive works it's how everything works so it's probably time for a little imagination here and it's interesting because so many of the core experiences that we have on the desktop actually started out in the finder but they've moved out a long time ago right because we're not downloading mp3s anymore and playing them out of folders we got Spotify for that we've got iPhoto for all our pictures and for TV and movies who got Netflix and so on just about all the other core experiences on the desktop have been completely reimagined for the better and we've never looked back except for our work stuff why are we still stuck in this little time capsule there are so many ways that this experience can be better and it's bizarre to me that no one's done this yet and other people are trying but no one's really done this natively going back to bed Beth's little rat's nest here what if we were able to clean this up what if we were able to fix this what would that look like what if her content were organized what if instead of living on different planets her files and her cloud stuff could live together what if ro tools were organized what if all the content and would have all our content amount of conversations and contexts around it could live together instead of having to switch between all these different apps maybe we could take an even bigger step back and evolve this whole experience from this passive folder of files to a living team workspace that has all your content how would we do that well we're gonna give this a shot so let's take the start with a finder and give it a little makeover for the way that we're working today but that's a little easier said than done because we may want to have all our stuff together on in one place but our files and all our cloud Doc's have completely different technical foundations and so trying to support both of them is like trying to design a car that also goes on train tracks and so we're gonna need to take a bigger step back here and totally re-engineer the file system so that your figma Doc's can sit next to your powerpoints alright next all these tools have their different have their own little clouds over many of the cloud tools are using have their own storage and so we got to figure out how do we break down all the silos index all these different kinds of content give people one search box not ten then you look at this in your face and you're like wait a minute I spend all day interacting with people why are there no peace here so let's bring them in let's bring in activity let's bring in comments all the basic stuff you'd expect in 2019 all right what's next let's also allow people to use the tools all the tools they use that they want to use right and make it so that you can slack people and start a zoom meeting and send something out for signature and see your calendar all without leaving leaving the app let's bring all the different teams you're part of all the different projects you're working on let's make it into a workspace to see who's working on what tasks organize this so that all this is more coherent experience in short let's bring this experience under the 24 into the 21st century from a folder full of files into a living team workspace with all of your content that was a challenge we gave ourselves but to do that we need to go back to the drawing board and fundamentally reimagine how Dropbox works we had to design an entirely new foreground experience and we had to create a new desktop app from the ground up and that's what we did I'm so excited to introduce the new Dropbox it's this biggest change we've ever made to our product let's take a look you're hard at work you've got great tools here awesome apps there and stuff everywhere there's so much going on even the neatest of the neat freaks can feel disorganized it's time to tidy your workflow say thank you to your old way of working and let it go introducing the new Dropbox it helps you organize your work life in three easy steps let's start with those messy pihl's so thank you and bye-bye 20 open tabs of cloud Docs in Dropbox all your files are organized in one tidy place and notifications are streamlined so you can stay on top of things even on the go next let's tackle your tools you don't have to waste your time hopping from app to app when you work in a tidy space if g suite brings you joy keep it where it's easy to reach you can slack your teammates or start a meeting all without leaving dropbox finally get everyone on the same page in your team space everyone knows what to do folder descriptions add context where you need it most you can create or complete to do's pin important documents and share your thoughts right there tidying up can change your work life and spark a pretty good feeling now all of your content tools and team work live together in one tidy space it's not magic it's the new Dropbox [Music] good morning I'm Quinton Clark I'm CTO at Dropbox and I'm really excited to be able to unveil this set of brand new experiences to everybody today we're gonna be excited about what that's gonna mean for our users we're operating a different world today we're in a new best-of-breed ecosystem one where people bring the tools they love to the workplace tools like Dropbox and slack and zoom in trouble and more and for us it's this massive opportunity because as Drew mentioned this causes some fragmentation not just across those tools but across the content that they're working with and across their teams and so we've made updates across Dropbox comm and our mobile applications and new desktop experiences to build an integrated workspace designed to bring all the content all the tools and your teams all together we're doing this by evolving from a shared folder into the team workspace let me show you how we're gonna do this we'll start with Google Google is a platform that between Google and Dropbox we share literally hundreds of millions of users and in April we announced deep partnerships we were building that was available to our two in beta for our cusp our enterprise customers and for the first time those users were able to start to weave together the information in Google Docs sheets and slides into Dropbox they could create edit organize share all the content in the Google suite right out of Dropbox we know that more than half of Dropbox users are also users of the G suite so this has a potential it save a lot of friction for a lot of users we're really excited that today we're releasing this capability to all users into general availability we're good they're excited it was no small feat al-adel here we're taking that cloud file functionality a step further by reducing new capabilities we are calling shortcuts in dropbox shortcuts are gonna make it easy to take any content from the web a news article and other content coming from other SAS products and put them and organize them right next to the other files and other information you have right inside Dropbox and starting today just a couple of clicks out of our desktop experiences will allow you to create those shortcuts and keep them organized around all your other stuff that's in Dropbox by doing this we're unifying your content this also is going to be available now starting today now let's talk about how we're bringing tools together a tool that we know a lot of our users love including us at Dropbox is slack we're thrilled to have Brad Armstrong where's Brad there it is Brad so I have Brad Armstrong VP business corporate development from slack here joining us thanks for being here before today our joint users would have files in one place in Dropbox and the conversations around the work they're doing in an earth place in slack this can break our users flow as they switch back and forth not just necessarily wasting time but also losing context today for the first time we're announcing a deep partnership with slack and we're releasing the integrations that we've built into general availability that's all releasing as part of the work we're doing today big news with slack [Applause] you might have also seen late last year we announced a partnership resumed and announced plans to build integrations across our two products zoom is another tool that we use a lot of Dropbox it's part of our day-to-day floats it's in every one of our conference rooms we're often working on our work and Dropbox closing our laptops and then going into a meeting opening the laptops and switching tools to get into the meeting to get back and find the content that was working with how do I get that back to the meeting there's got to be a better way and there is a better way Laura Padilla business development and channel executive from zoom Laura thank you for joining us it's also here we've been working really closely with Laura and and the whole team there to bring these new deep integrations and user flows between our two products and we're happy announced that all that work is also coming to fruition and is available today as part of what we're releasing oh yeah all clap for that too yeah that's good okay finally let's talk about how we're bringing teams together you can see that we're working to make content collaboration and seamless by integrating cloud Doc's and slack and zooming to Dropbox and we're limiting friction around the coordination of your work as well Atlassian is a company we've long admired for project coordination Bryant Lee global headed parachutes from Atlassian also here somewhere there is thank you right we work with Bryant and his team to build and announced new partnerships that we're gonna start releasing over the coming months so watch the space but it is a big deal that we've agreed to do deep partnerships now with it last as well on key coordination activities all of this and more comes together in the new Dropbox desktop app native to both windows and to Mac operating system it's what our users during today as Drew said will experience as the Biggles biggest single change in their Dropbox experience the desktop app provides convenient new access points into the new Dropbox workspace where the content the tool and the teams all come together with these and other desktop improvements but you'll see more of in demos in just another minute or so here you're gonna see that a lot of friction that's involved in in using the tools that you love everyday is being eliminated this new desktop app is available through our early access program starting today both for individual users and for users that are on our team products in summary you can see that we're building an entirely new way of navigating your work life with these tools the new Dropbox is a centralized workspace that makes it easier to navigate your workday and focus on the work that you care about focus on the thing you're trying to get done while getting the best out of the tools that you love to use every day at work I can tell you how game Jing this all is but be much easier to show you at this point so I'm going to by Adam Nash VP of product at Dropbox up with some members of his team to show you these great demos thank you thank you it's it's really exciting to be here my name is Adam Nash and I lead product and growth at Dropbox I'm gonna give you a brief overview of the features the actual application that Drew and Quentin have shared with you and I'm going to invite some members of my team to walk through in more detail each of the features that will be available today but before I get there I'd like to talk a little bit about our customers because one of the things that we believe at Dropbox is that great products come from having great customers one of those customers is built construction so if you don't know built it's a company founded in Sydney Australia has over 800 people and has been in business for over 20 years and when you think about how built works today versus 20 years ago a lot of the problems that we see in our common customers go across all of these different companies and it very much looks like this right this might not be Beth's diagram but it's familiar right companies like Bilt have issues coordinating their tools coordinating their people coordinating their content and because they take on new customers all the time this problem repeats every time they have to form a team to do a new engagement this is the type of customer that we designed the new Dropbox for and when we talk to Built about the new Dropbox we heard really positive things about the direction we're moving in it resonated with them just like it resonates with everyone who deals with these problems at work and so if you think about Bilt if you think about these problems it'll give you a better perspective the features I'm about to walk through let's go to the application all right so if you look at this application right now you see what Dropbox has been for the last 10 years a magic folder in the cloud a safe place where you can put all of your content get it from any device and share it in an easy fashion and people love this capability they use it across platforms Mac Windows on your mobile device they love this magic folder but there's limits to what you can do with this interface there's limits to how much you can solve the problems that Drew and Quentin we're talk about by just being silent in the background and so now starting today when people open up the new drop box they'll see this and so here you see the new drop box you see these rich features you see these different capabilities if you go into a folder like the customer proposal you see a rich folder overview that gives context so a new team member joining knows immediately what's going on they can see action items they can see dates they can easily tag people all the content is there whether it's a traditional file like a PowerPoint file or clearly someone on the team likes to use Google Docs whatever tools the team wants to use can be used and it all comes together here on the right you can see that rich context people are not just tags or names there's a richness to them you can see whether they're active right now whether they're highlighted in color or whether than the background because they're part of the team but not active in here if you ever want to go to one of these people and reach it you see through calendar integration what meetings you have coming up and whether you want to jump into a zoom meeting with them or send them a slack message you can all do that as part of the flow you have around the work you're trying to get done now there's a lot of detail and capability here and I'd love to walk you through it but I think even better than having me go through it would be to have members of the team who helped work on these features show you in detail how this functions so I'm going to invite up now John Herve Auden who leads the team that actually worked on this rich new Dropbox desktop application John [Applause] good morning everyone the situation at bill construction is a problem that matters because it prevents us from doing our best work precisely at the time when we're trying to help one another that's what motivated us to build the new Dropbox and include several key capabilities designed to bring teams together the first capability I'll show you is folder descriptions at the top of every folder is an open customizable space where you can write anything you need to to describe what that folder is for in this case the team is working on a customer proposal together so they created a folder and the description includes information about how they're gonna work on that project together they'll have the date of the pitch they'll have key roles on the team instead of just writing the name of a person here I can include an app mention now I know that that person is going to receive a notification inviting them into this workspace we can even go one step better than that we can create it to do when I create it to do and use another app mention to assign it to someone now they'll get that notification and they'll have the clarity about what's expected of them when they join this workspace and when they're done with their task they simply check the box and the whole team knows how progress is moving forward the last folder description capability I'll show you hit set a problem I think many of us tackle in a sea of files and folders where do I start which files are the most important ones to look at in the past you would have been searching email or chat looking for the link someone gave you in the new Dropbox I select the file and I click pin now that file is highlighted as part of this folder description in this shared context that the whole team has let's take a moment to acknowledge what just happened we took a normal folder any folder like we all use all day and with a few simple actions we created this shared customized workspace that has all the information the team needs to stay coordinated with one another we talked about folders let's talk a little bit about files when I select a file the right-hand side of the app which we call the detail pane has everything I need to know about what's happening with that particular file at the top of course is a thumbnail preview but below that is presents information this shows me who's active in that file right now who's viewed it in the past and when and who has access but maybe has never seen it before and below that is an activity feed this is a timeline view of everything that's happened with that file think back to the times you've had a conversation with a colleague and you weren't quite sure you were talking about the same version of that file that's the problem we're solving with the activity and the file viewer information Dropbox also lets the team provide input and feedback via comments as I select these files I can read the comments in the detail pane and follow the conversation that's going on across the team related to these files and of course right here from the desktop I can jump into that conversation I can reply to an existing comment or I can create a new comment thread and once again I can use it out mention so I have confidence that this person will see the comment because they'll get a notification on Dropbox mobile on Dropbox comm and of course here in the desktop the last capability I want to show you is up in the menu bar on the Mac or down in the system tray on Windows for a while Dropbox has included a list of all of my activity in Dropbox and while this is incredibly helpful we can do better than that so we've added the team Activity Feed that shows me everything that's going on across my team so I can stay up to date and we put this same feed in the Dropbox mobile app all of these capabilities are part of the new Dropbox and designed to make sure that we can all do our best work together thank you thank you John it's really exciting to see the new application come together now I know there's a lot of fans out there of Dropbox and of the finder and Windows Explorer and I want to reassure you that we've got your back everything that the old Dropbox did the new Dropbox does better but it's fantastic to see the new Dropbox desktop application bring content and people together so they can get their work done and speaking of which I'd like to actually invite Genevieve Chien up she's going to show you how the new Dropbox brings native files together with cloud content geneviève cloud content and traditional files we expect these to work together seamlessly and that's what people like you and me needs and what customers like built construction expect so let's take a look back of these files and see how Dropbox has made this even better we now have Google Docs sheets and slides living right inside Dropbox so here you see a Google Doc energy slide alongside other content that you expect like an image or a Microsoft Office file and because these are inside your Dropbox folder automatically everything put here is shared with everyone on the team no more worrying about which app is this in or do I remember or did you get it it's all right here inside Dropbox so let's take a look at what happens when you open that up as you would expect opening a Google file opens right into the Google editor and as soon as it comes up you can start making real-time edits multiple people from your team can be in here making their changes and those all get reflected back but there's something new all changes are saved in Dropbox so you can trust it everything is safe access to all of the version history and other features that you trust Dropbox for while using the editor that you're most familiar with and using different types of files altogether and because it's in Dropbox when you share you also see the same sharing interface as you do for anything in Dropbox your Dropbox contacts Dropbox groups when you share it out to anybody else your can you note it's all the way that you would expect for any of your content all the same way and now that that's shared we did make a couple of edits let's go back to the main app we see that right there it's modified immediately 18 seconds ago everything is up to date in Dropbox just for you would expect but it doesn't just show up on the Dropbox desktop app as great as this is and we encourage you to use it all the time Google Docs sheets and slides show up in any Dropbox surface so you can work in any way and always get back to them let's take a look if you were to use Dropbox on the web so we open it right up in Dropbox comm see the same folder with all that same content and scrolling back down we can see that Google slide right there in the same way but the power of Google slides Docs and sheets integrations goes beyond just this there's a PowerPoint file right there that someone else might want to share with me and now you can open Microsoft Office Word and Excel files inside the Google editor too so when you open that up what you see is that inside the Google editor you have a PowerPoint file and you're reminded that it's staying a PowerPoint file right at the top with a PowerPoint button and again all of the changes you make are saved right back to Dropbox so this is bringing content together you don't have to worry about which application or what you're using you've got to file the saved in Dropbox it's a Microsoft Office file it's opening inside a Google editor that's easy to use so you don't have to worry that someone you shared to might not have the office app installed or maybe they don't even have an office license you know that they can always get back to work on the same content together and this is for files that we've already set up in this account but it's even easier than ever to create these files too if we hit the create button we see that Dropbox has now natively integrated with the productivity apps that we use the most Microsoft Word office and Excel or Word PowerPoint and Excel and Google Docs sheets and slides when I create from there it's created right inside the folder I was working from so you don't have to do save as or drag something from one place to another remember her you found it it's all created right in the place that your whole team can work together and as soon as it's there any of them can access it and work on it with you in real time but we also know that your work goes beyond just this small set of files let's say that your team also references web articles or other web pages or they're using other productivity apps the shortcuts app brings all of that content together so let's look at this team using a Trello board in the past you would have tried to get people to remember her that was or bookmark it or email it to them again as a reminder now you can just grab the link to this board and use the Dropbox shortcuts feature to put that in your Dropbox folder to create a shortcut and then the link to it is accessible for everybody on your team so all of your content comes together we could pin that up there so that everyone remembers to go back and check the board it lets you take any of your work all of the content and remind you that it's all in Dropbox and when everything is in Dropbox there's one more benefit that we bring you and that's the power to find it as easily as possible so if I'm looking back at that proposal draft that we had opened a couple minutes ago I can use Dropbox search look for it and the Google slides comes right up alongside all of the other files and folders in Dropbox so you don't have to switch between apps you don't have to remember her you put it you just look in Dropbox and you know it's there so Dropbox has now brought Google Docs sheets and slides and brought it right into the Dropbox folders where you do your work we've let you create shortcuts to any of the content from across the web so your whole team can access it and we've done it in a way that you can always find it where you need it that's the power of Dropbox bringing all of your content together Thank You Genevieve it's really wonderful to see how the new drop box brings all of that content together and I'm particularly excited about offering our customers a powerful unified search that cuts across both native files as well as their cloud-based content next up I'd like to invite Tina Schuchman who's going to demonstrate for you how the new Dropbox brings different tools together that teams use every day Tina Thank You Adam customers like Bill construction have to struggle with multiple applications every single day to solve this problem we're super excited with the launch of the new slot and zoom integrations today let me show you how it works the first thing I want to show you is calendar linking which supports Outlook and Google Calendar and the provides a window into your calendar as you can see here I have an upcoming meeting with Anthony at 11:00 a.m. today Calendar linking eliminates a need for our customers to switch back and forth between their work and their calendar if these incremental steps that really add up to a lot of work about work it looks like my upcoming meeting with Anthony doesn't have zoom video conferencing info oh Anthony he always forgets to add video conferencing info and the first five minutes of his meetings always spent with everybody pinging everybody how to dial in not a problem drop off screens my tools together which includes zoom now from Dropbox with one click I can add a video conferencing information right into my existing meeting with Anthony there is that easy and simple now that Miss mean iam with Anthony it's a zoom meeting I can go ahead and join all from Dropbox the Dropbox and zoom integration brings together the tools our customers use multiple times a day oh look I'm sorry he's online hi Anthony how's it going I really look forward to the pricing proposal I think we have a really good shot to win the deal awesome that was a super productive meeting [Laughter] Oliver adding and joining a zoom video conference I can also present a file right into a zoom screen share let me share an AutoCAD file Dropbox automatically opens up the built-in file viewer and I can have access to a full fidelity preview of the AutoCAD file this is incredibly helpful for customers I built construction because they use these kinds of file types a lot this works with were that without AutoCAD installed which makes sharing super easy inside and outside of a company that was our zoom integration now let me introduce to you our slack integration as I'm walking through the pricing proposal I have a quick question for Anthony let me send him a slack message real quick from a Dropbox user I can easily send a slack message right from Dropbox let me pin Anthony hi Anthony are we going to hit our sales target oh look I haven't you responded with a thumbs up this is just so amazing but I really hope Anthony's better at pricing then scheduling meetings one could hope right now that the pricing proposal is coming together I can share the file right into a slack channel let me go ahead and do that and share it right into the proposal team flat channel to show you the sharing actually worked let's switch over to slack as you can see here the fire has been successfully shared into slack the drop the new drop box brings together your tools and get your work dial across slack zoom and dropouts Oh without switching between apps it just works thank you Thank You Tina I think I have a special note to have her run all my meetings going forward though it's really fantastic to see tools like slack and zoom that our customers value so deeply and use multiple times per day integrated together into the new Dropbox experience so you've now seen demonstrations of how all our features help bring people together in the new desktop application how we can stitch together content whether it's native files or cloud-based content and of course how we can bring all those tools together to help teams get their work done so now that you see the demonstration I'm gonna invite Drew back up to wrap up drew Thank You Adam well I hope you all can see that we are super excited about the new Dropbox I'd love to thank our partners from zoom from slack and Atlassian for being with us today they'll be here afterwards for a roundtable to answer any questions you might have about the deep integrations so
