 so there's five categories of apps that I'm going to take you through in this video we've got the lubricating jelly the note-taking toolbox the four essentials for getting stuff done the productive socializing sweets and finally the content creation machine let's get into it hey friends welcome back to the channel if you new here my name is Ellie I'm a doctor working in Cambridge and on this channel we share the principles strategies and tools to help us live happier more productive lives and one of the fundamental components of my productivity Arsenal is the MacBook Pro and in this video I'm going to be talking you through lots of different apps that I've got to help supercharge my productivity be more organized get stuff done and you know create content like an absolute machine and let's start with category number one which is the lubricating jelly and there are two apps in this list by far the most important app the app that I cannot live without on my Mac is called Alfred now Alfred is basically a replacement for the spotlight search function on a Mac so what I do is I hit command space bar and this Alfred window rocks up and then I can do whatever I want using the Alfred window and this is basically how I navigate my Mac and it's a big part of why I'm so productive on my Mac because I don't bother wasting time by moving the mouse around and by clicking on things because that's a total waste of time instead I use Alfred to find everything so let's say I want to search Google I will just go command spacebar and we have search Google let's say I don't want to do that let's say I want to find a file normally the process for finding a file would be an absolute ball ache because you have to click on finder we'd have to go on like Google Drive you'd have to click link and basically every time you want to open a file you're wasting like a minute of your life and that adds up over a long period of time to just be not a very pleasant experience at all but with Alfred you can do come on spacebar type into the window you start off with a space and now you can search for any file on your computer let's say I wanted to find the video of me singing a song from two years ago I can just type in bu da and oh here we go Budapest 2018 July and this is the file that I want to open an app rather than doing this whole pinch thingy and trying to find the app or rather than on hiding the doc and clicking through the dog which again would waste valuable seconds of my life every time I just go on Alfred and I type in the first few letters of the app boom sorted it's just like an absolutely incredible invention find all of this stuff and actually if we look at my Alfred stats which again I'm opening through Alfred usage this is in the last 28 days since 21st always 2018 which was why I got this MacBook alfred has been used to 20 thousand eight hundred and thirty times on average thirty three point five times a day and like you know when it whenever this was about two weeks ago I was on my computer a lot that day I used Alfred two hundred and one times that save at least maybe ten ten minutes of my life but like if you can save ten minutes every day when you're on the computer basically the reason I love Alfred is that a big part of productivity when using a machine is trying to minimize the time between you thinking that you want to do something on the computer and then that thing being done so if I think I want Google something I want to be able to google it as quickly as possible if I think I want to open a file do some work or send an email all that stuff needs to happen as efficiently as possible otherwise I'm just wasting time and Alfred is like the key lubricating jelly which is you know it just makes the whole process of using this Mac just infinitely smoother and it is always the very first thing I ever install when I get a new computer the second component of my lubricating jelly setup is an app called moon and moon is fantastic because it basically lets you swipe windows to the sides of the screen so I open up Safari I can drag it and it goes over there if I open ocean or I've got the plan for this video I can drag it and it would go over there and if I want to I can actually do this with keyboard shortcuts so let's open them bear for example and I can hit a shortcut key and I've got keyboard shortcuts set up so that I can automatically can I snap windows to their appropriate sections without really having to click anything and this is particularly handy when I'm on my 49ers ultrawide monitor because I've got different so shortcuts setups to have like a triple window set up to have a quadruple window set up to have like a six window set up there's all kind of different ways that you can use moom and it's just one of the ways in which again it's all about minimizing the time between thought and action I don't want to have to drag a window to the side of the screen I want just be able to do a bang on bang keyboard shortcut and it just appears and I can get on with doing the thing that I want to be doing alright so the next category is the note-taking toolbox and we've got seven apps in this category now people always ask me in YouTube comments and Instagram DMS and on the streets Eileen why do you use so many note-taking apps what the hell is wrong with you surely you're making more work for yourself by having all these note-taking apps shouldn't you just be focusing on taking notes rather than all this sort of stuff but the way I think about this is that these apps are all just a toolbox apps are not useful in their own regard the useful because they're tools that let us accomplish something greater than that so when it comes to using a computer using my Mac I consider myself a professional carpenter and if you saw a professional carpenter with their toolbox you would think Oh me why do you have 18 different screwdrivers don't you just need one screwdriver and the carpenter would be like bro I'm a professional carpenter inna each screwdriver yeah find the real screwdrivers but they all serve a slightly different purpose and for me the reason I have five kind of active note-taking apps that I use is because they all do serve a different kind of purpose we have different apps for everything like why are we looking for this one ultimate Holy Grail note-taking app that does absolutely everything it's all about embracing the toolbox and so that's why I have so many note-taking apps so the first one I want to talk about is motion motion is one of my favorite apps of all time I have made five videos and about notion on my youtube channel another like seven or eight videos about notion on workflow my series on nebula more about that in a little bit so I'm not going to talk about notion too much but I basically use it for project management for various things so when it comes to video schedules when it comes to online classes when it comes to my website book reviews you know keeping track of the stuff that I enjoy keeping track of Liz Angus and Christian my team members keeping track light basically these notion for so much stuff in my life I even used to keep track of my workouts and to like you know every day you know write something I'm grateful for them I've made loads of videos about that so I'll put links to all of those down in the video description but notion is my note-taking app mostly for project management now recently I have started using well not recently about six weeks ago I started using another app now this is an app called Rome research and my friend Thomas Frank has made a lovely video about Rome again link in the video description about that Rome research is sort of a note-taking up but it's for research it's it's kind of for thinking it's the app that I use for my thinking so every day I would write a kind of daily note and there's all sorts of features in Rome so for example I can say time currently filming the what's on my Mac book video and now you saw that I put double square brackets here and now what's on my MacBook has become a link and Rome has a really interesting system of kind of linking that basically means that as you as you're writing notes you can easily link them to other notes and ultimately what that does it gives you kind of a broad kind of graph a graph overview of all of your notes basically like Rome is trying to replicate the way that knowledge is actually organized in our brains it's not really organized in terms of notebooks and dividers and notes it's more organized in terms of disparate things that are all linked to one another and so Rome is amazing for that it's way beyond the scope of this video to go in-depth into Rome but yeah you can find loads of information on Thomas Frank's video if you want to see a detailed look of how I use Rome I've got like 6 videos available on my workflow series on nebula now if you don't know a nebula is a streaming platform that's made by me and a bunch of other of my creator friends and on nebula I post exclusive videos that you won't find on YouTube usually there are a little bit more nerdy a little bit more niche like for example you know spending an hour going over Rome and why I love it that's a bit too niche for YouTube for now and so I tend to post those sorts of videos on there that are a little bit too detailed to actually be put on YouTube because YouTube I like to kind of appeal to a wider audience anyway at the moment there's about 15 ish videos in my workflow series where I take you through my workflow for using these productivity apps in various different ways and the easiest way to get access to nebula for these workflow videos along with a few other exclusives that I've got along with a load of other exclusive videos from other creators is to sign up to curiosity stream or very kindly sponsoring this video your asti stream is the world's leading documentary streaming subscription platform founded by John Hendricks who's the founder of the Discovery Channel and on curiosity stream you can find documentaries covering like health business to science technology history geography basically anything you can think of and the great thing is that if you sign up to curiosity stream for like three dollars a month or twenty dollars a year which is absolutely nothing you also get free access to nebula so you've literally mark the best deal in streaming and so if you care about how I use all these apps kind of more specifically a lot more niche you should definitely do that long details in the video description let's now move on with the video so that was Roman ocean let's now move on to Evernote which I actually still use as a note-taking app and you might be wondering why because Evernote is like old and bloated and stuff but actually Evernote is fantastic because it's there is still no app that handles everything you throw at it just as well as Evernote does so you know if I want to if it's it's it's basically like kind of the the long-term memory for my second brain so I use motion for like product management I use rome for like you know thinking and research and things but if there's ever anything I need to store for later so for example documents and letters and receipts and images and bookmarks you know I can just chuck them into Evernote so I've got this inbox there's a dot inbox that basically has everything in it and then at some point like you know every couple of months I will just organize these into the different notebooks so these are kind of notebooks various things that I'm interested in it's just nice having Evernote as sort of this layer the long-term memory layer of my second brain and for example if I'm writing notes on paper in my in my notebook it's really hard to scan those into Rome because if in rooms not very good at that or notion which is not very good at that but Evernote take a picture chuck it in automatically it just works absolutely amazingly so that's whatever that's useful fortunately we have an app called a draft no drafts it's basically a very quick capture and note-taking app and I use drafts when I need to take note of something kind of in the moment but I can't be bothered to wait for notion to load them on iOS room doesn't really have an iOS app yet Evernote is a bit slow and bloated draft is just amazing yeah I can actually dictate stuff into drafts from my Apple watch so for example if I'm listening to a podcast in the car and I've got my watch on I can just dictate some notes into it and then it will come up with drafts and then every now and then I'll look through my drafts in books and I'll chuck stuff into Evernote or chuck stuff into notion or Chuck stuff into room kind of depending on what this stuff is so drafts is my tool for quick capture it's excellent for that and then we have a notability which is actually the app that I use more often than not on the iPad because notability is the best app for Android handwritten note taking and at some point I'll be doing a comparison between notability and good notes but basically I prefer notability it's good for handwriting I don't often use the Mac version but it's nice having it on my Mac and just in case I need to bring up my my notes so for example I will often you know make notes about videos that I want to I want to do you know if I'm on a plane or if I'm just kind of figure four figuring stuff out I will take those notes handwritten using the iPad pro and Apple pencil and then they're in notability and then I can kind of do whatever I want with them sometimes I put these into notion of screenshots sometimes I put them into room it's typed up sometimes for them to Evernote it kind of depends but this is just another part of the toolbox but this is how I deal with handwritten information because Roman ocean and Evernote are not very good at the handwriting side of things finally there are two more than one talked about and that is bear and Ulysses Ulysses this is it's pretty good for as like a general writing thing and bear used to be my kind of general writing app where I would take notes on bear but drafts has sort of replaced the functionality of their for me and ever since I started using room I've kind of stopped using UCI's because there's no an easy way to link together on Ulysses so I'm still trying to figure out if I need these two apps and if there's a way for them to fit into my workflow but at the moment I don't really use bear and Ulysses that much so those were the apps in my note-taking tool box let's now move on to the four essentials that everyone needs to get things done and that is a to do list manager an email client a file system and a calendar and so let's go through those in turn so the app that I use for my to-do list is things three I've experimented with a lot of these over the years but the one that I ultimately kind of keep going back to is things three and things are just so nice it's a it's one of the most beautifully designed Mac and iOS and iPad OS apps that I've ever used in my life which is such an aptitude joy so on the side you've got these areas so I've got Life OS I've got health people have got videos I've got hustle medicine ingestion which is kind of where I keep track of content and you need to watch music hobbies and a bucket list so these are kind of areas of my life and then within these areas you can have projects so we've got a medical application go I've got Liberty medics which is this thing that I'm working on throughout the day what I do is I add stuff into my inbox so for example with a hotkey control spacebar I can type in a new to do and then that goes into my inbox or let's say I'm on my friend caiis website about productivity and I want to kind of make note of something to do with that what I can do is I can do ctrl shift spacebar and it automatically creates a new to do but it creates it with the context so it automatically links to the website that I was on or whatever app I'm in which is really handy so remember so contact okay about doing a video that would be an easy way to add stuff to things and then I don't really think about where it goes in things it just goes in my inbox and then once a day in the mornings I'll usually go through my inbox and kind of categorize stuff into the different projects so this one I can do command shift M which is a hotkey hotkeys are really important let's put that into videos fine and let's stop being a total waste mallet we can move that into life os everyone can build a twitter twitter audiences for hustle they sort of study and they interested video and chat around about articles that's this one so if I want I can use the keyboard for one I can use mouse if I can drag stuff on my iPad or my iPhone just like really nice and this is how I kind of keep track of my to do's and the way that I do this is that every day the stuff that I need to do is I Marcus today and that's only the stuff that I absolutely have to get done on a given day but if I finish those things then what I do is I've got this anytime list where stuff doesn't have a deadline because most of the stuff I do doesn't really have a deadline and so I'll dip into my anytime list to kind of do more things and then I've got a Sunday list which is stuff that I don't want to do in a particular week it doesn't really matter what to do this type to use as long as you have one I've tried out to do it over the years I haven't really tried out OmniFocus it's a bit too much I think so yeah that's my note-taking up but secondly everyone needs an email client and the one that I use is called superhuman a superhuman unfortunately is a gmail client that costs $30 a month it's worth it for me because I spend a lot of time in emails and it's so like by far the fastest email experience I've ever used in my life so superhumans great as long as you have some kind of email client it doesn't really matter what it is like you can easily get by but just using Gmail and Safari or Chrome or you using spark mail or using I don't know Outlook there's all sorts of email clients I have tried like at least ten of them over the last few years and since I discovered superhuman I've never really looked back so that is very nice thirdly everyone needs a calendar and the one that I use is fantastical or fantastical mostly because it's got nice natural language processing and I've been using fantastical for a few years now it is a bit expensive but hey I have no qualms with paying for apps they improve my life it's what I can do with fantastical is it's actually got a an alford integration so I can write help and it'll automatically recognize all the different components within that and actually I can send a Mikado a calendar invite an event present or whatever and it's a very easy way for me to add stuff to my calendar without really thinking about it and of course they've gone up for iOS and iPad OS as well and even the Apple watch so it's a nice app that integrates very nicely with the Apple ecosystem and finally everyone needs some kind of cloud storage solution that sounds very enterprising well if you're not currently using a cloud storage thing you're definitely living life completely wrong because you don't want to be one of those people that has everything important on your hard drive and then for some reason your computer breaks or gets stolen like basically for me my entire life is on Google Drive and Google Drive is when I use this so I have my Google Drive folder and within Google Drive I've got like a ton of folders and basically I think I'm using like 4 terabytes of Google Drive storage space just because of all the stuff that I've got in it and I also have a Google Drive business account for my business stuff that I share with my team members where we can upload videos and done basically like everything is organized through Google Drive that's what I recommend I've tried out Dropbox I kind of prefer Google Drive it's got nice apps it kind of works but again it doesn't really matter what specifically you use as long as you using some kind of cloud storage thingy all right let's not talk about five apps in the productive socializing suite so what does this mean so basically socializing is important relationship to the most important thing in the world but it's nice to be able to socialize in a productive fashion it is not productive replying to messages from my phone because I type at 150 words per minute on a laptop what I type it like 50 words per minute on my phone it's just you know night and day difference between how efficient I can be with chatting to people on my phone versus on my laptop so basically I want to be like anytime someone sends me a message I want to be able to reply to it from my Mac so the most important app for this is whatsapp web so again I'm opening with Alfred if someone sends me what's that message I've got like all my group chats all my chats like it just makes perfect sense to be able to reply to it from my Mac rather than having to reply to it from whatsapp and it absolutely amazes me how many people don't know that this is a feature of whatsapp like you can just quadruple the number of people that you can respond to in a given amount of time just by using whatsapp web it's it's incredible we also have iMessage or rather messages I think that's called these days and again I never replied to high messages from my phone unless I'm not at my desk and I'm always at my desk so I can always reply to our messages from my Mac and this is one of the main reasons why I love the Apple ecosystem is because stuff like this just works so seamlessly together I think Android has been trying for the last few years to create some sort of unified messaging platform that lets you reply to text messages from your computer but so far as far as I know it hasn't worked let me know in the comments if something miraculously has changed but yeah iMessage is fantastic most of my friends use iPhones so it's so much easier for us to message each other with iMessage rather than having to send an actual text or what's that message so yeah the fact that messages is available on desktop is fantastic thirdly we have slack are you slack for a load of things so I use slack to chat with my team members Angus Christian and Liz about various things and that's how we keep track of all our projects all the stuff that we're working on but I'm also part of a few different slack groups the public ones that I recommend you join of firstly for teh labs I'm not sure how public this is but you should join 40 labs this is run by my internet friend tiago forte who runs an online course called building a second brain which is very good and a one called rad reads by hey he who recently featured on this youtube channel and i think i I think these slack teams are open to everyone but let's look at right Rodriques for example I'm sure he won't mind me sharing this you know announcements books entrepreneurship and independence intros miscellaneous money newsletters productivity promote feedback like it's just like a bunch of cool people doing interesting things joining this like slack team so it sort of feels almost like a community and then the standard which is my YouTube Agency there's pretty ok youtubers which is a bunch of a youtubers and then there's the a team which is what I call my might kind of squad so I use slack many hours each day just to kind of chat to people number four I guess would be discord I don't really use discord a huge amount i tried setting up like a sort of server for my fans but it just had way too many people to keep up with and i found that i wasn't never logging into discord just because i'm not a fan of how the app works you can't really have threaded replies it feels and no offense to anyone who used discord but it feels like an app for kids whereas slack feels like an app for grown-ups like people have grown-up chats on slack people have kiddie chats on on discord and I'm not like bashing the kids or anything yeah discord is fine and you know these guys are creating this new like of the bunker group I'll put a link in video description if you want to join it so occasionally I'll chat to people on here but in general I prefer to use slack for most things because it's just a little bit more it's a bit more legit it's not like general chitchat about like I mean it can be likes like does have channels for like gaming and discussing general chitchat but it's just it's just not as spammy as discord is like firstly in terms of the user interface but also in terms of like slack was is is designed to be an app for work whereas discord is designed to be an app for gamers to just kind of chat the kind of vibe that you get on these two different apps is markedly different like people take slack more seriously than they take discord you wouldn't get people spamming on slack because it's considered unprofessional and not legit whereas you get too many people spamming on discord so I don't use discord a huge amount but you know I'm part of the server and occasionally to chat to people on it and finally I've got zoom and Skype which is an optically interesting so let's move on to the final category and that is the apps in my content creation machine I think that's what I called it at the start of the video the most important happen here is Final Cut Pro is the app that I use for editing been using Final Cut for the last three years basically I've created a class on Skillshare about how to edit in Final Cut these days I don't really do a lot of my own editing anymore but I will still dabble with Final Cut occasionally if I need to do a kind of you quick edits to something that someone else has made or if I'm making a video of myself singing for Instagram so like actually earlier today when I was procrastinating from filming this video I picked up the guitar and I filmed myself singing American Pie by Don McLean and edit it in Final Cut and now it's on Instagram and on IG TV or whatever but yeah Final Cut is amazing I'll put a link in the video description to my skill show class on it if you want to learn final cuts on top of final cut as part of the content creation machine we have Logic Pro 10 I use logic for two things firstly and most importantly it's editing my weekly podcast me and my brother if you didn't know have a weekly podcast called not overthinking that you can find an old podcast platforms blah blah and I use logic to just kind of tweak the sounds a bit and to cut out all the silences so that it feels like a more coherent video then both of us pausing a lot to kind of gather our thoughts so I use logic for that and I'm also trying to get into music productions so I've started dabbling with logic in terms of arranging covers of popular songs which is something I want to dabble with a little bit more then we have ScreenFlow which is the very app that I'm actually using to record the screencast right now ScreenFlow is the best thing that I found on the Mac for doing screencast and you can zoom into stuff nicely so I use ScreenFlow for all of my screencasts and tutorials and things we also have ECAM which is my new favorite app before live streaming so I've got a few different screens set up and things like Skype automatically connect with ECAM so for example I recently did a livestream with Noah Kagan from ok.com and that worked out really nicely because II cam is just so beautiful to use on a Mac I think it's $80 but absolutely worth every penny and finally I subscribed to the Adobe Creative Cloud the whole package the ones that I use most often are Adobe Audition I use that to extend soundtracks for videos and to do audio editing a little bit I dabble with Photoshop and illustrator I used to use Photoshop a lot more back in the day when I was super into web design and graphic design but these days I don't really do a lot of that but even so it's still nice to have Photoshop and illustrator to be able to mock up a quick logo for a project or just kind of put some ideas onto some kind of graphic design package so like I said before if you want to hear more details about how I used Rome Howie's notion how I use instapaper and breed wise and Evernote and Castro and like Imola a few different aspects of my workflow that's all available on nebula which you can sign up to with a curiosity stream trial link in the video description more details there if you like this video you might also like to check out my video on what apps I've got on my iPad because I actually use a lot of the same on my Mac as on my iPad and in that video I talked about kind of five different categories of apps that are slightly different to these ones and how that fits in with my life so thank you very much for watching and i'll see in the next video hello
