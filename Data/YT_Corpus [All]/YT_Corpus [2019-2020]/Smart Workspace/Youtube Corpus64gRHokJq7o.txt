 [Music] welcome to the session my name is Smita and I lead the product management team for Google Voice and I'm a jmi product manager in voice and we are here today to tell you more about the new Google Voice but before we do that we want to talk a little bit about the modern workforce so we know that today's workforce is changing and changing rapidly by 2020 which is next year 50% of the workforce is expected to be mobile and even if you look at what it looks like today they're already they're 2 billion frontline workers of course which are not attached to any officer desk but in the Fortune 1000 companies that the knowledge workers today spend 50% of the time away from the desk so the workforce is really mobile and the other thing which is happening is that the pace of innovation keeps accelerating it took phones 50 years to get to 50 million users it took YouTube for years and it took Angry Birds three months so so we are living in this world where the workforce is very early mobile and the pace of pace of innovation continues to accelerate which means in order to have productive workforces we really have to enable real-time communication from anywhere anytime but luckily the time of cloud has come cloud sets us free with cloud people can work from anywhere on any device at Google as you know we have always believed in the vision of cloud G suite is designed to be cloud native from day one within G suite we have been reimagining what communication looks like for this modern fast-moving work for and we have been working at it systematically so Gmail which was a product which we launched which we launched in 2004 and we redefined what email should be like at that time we have again in a way relaunched it last year with an intelligence first design we have added features like smart reply and smart compose which means on your mobile phones with one click you can send a reply we have added nudging a feature which I personally love this is the one which reminds you to respond to follow up on emails and when all of us living in these busy worlds it distributed time zones that really has saved me quite a few times we we are we launched hangouts in 2013 and in the last couple of years we have taken that original hangouts product and we have evolved it into two different products hangouts chat which is for enterprise team communications teams can go and set up virtual rooms they can use BOTS to get a lot of the work automated while they are within that virtual rooms and hangouts meet I don't know how many folks made it to the presentation pretty much before this one which Renny led talking about how we are making face-to-face a virtual meetings so much more productive and we are bringing everyone together in the same room if you will even though they are distributed across the world so so those are some of the those are the products which we have already worked on and we have talked about of course today we want to talk to you about Google Voice so phones are still really important there 8 billion phone numbers in this world more than the number of people so force is still the universal way for us to connect quickly to our colleagues to our friends to our family but if you look at the phone systems today for most organizations they are still using these on-premise PBX systems which are really really hard to manage this is an actual photo of what a phone room used to look like at Google and we did not like it we did not want to manage closets full of full of equipment so we decided to change it and we worked on it and it took us a long time it actually took us six years but we did it so we got rid of the phones and what we have right now is 85,000 Googlers around Google Voice and 97% of our on-premise infrastructure is decommissioned when we talk to our customers when we talk to a G Suite customers unsurprisingly they were having the same challenges in fact when we talk to the customers 50% of them said they're looking for a cloud telephony solution and they said they had a 3x higher preference for getting it from us because they expect Google will provide the users with a cloud native experience and will make management so much easier like G suite has done so we wanted to address that need but we also know that voice is hard voice requires global scale it requires connectivity with carriers in all markets and it has really stringent quality requirements so we took that we took that that challenge we took that seriously and we critically looked at what's what assets do we have so this is something which surprises people but I want to share with you is the today Google cloud already powers billions of calls every year and hosts millions of phone numbers and this makes sense when you think of our products when you think of our products like click-to-call ads so critical for mobile search when you think of our products like Google Phi think about calling worldwide and products such as Google Maps and Gmail so a lot of these are really mission-critical and we have been building this telephony network for 10 plus years and you can see there's some of the stats there which is 100 plus countries hundred plus carriers and peering points 18 billion minutes per year 30 billion messages per year so we have a pretty big Network and that network is high quality and then the other thing is we also wanted to think about the user experience Google Voice for consumers has been in US for quite some time and that product already has millions of users that love the product how many people in the room actually have used Google Voice with C it's always like such a pleasure to see how many people use it and they have been using it so we took those two assets so we taught about the network we taught about the user experience and those are the ones in which we brought together in order to create Google Voice for G suite but even so we tested it carefully our alpha we launched more than 18 months ago our beta which we announce that next last year has now been live for more than more than six months it has more than 650 customers G suite customers on it thousands of users and we have been using it and we have been testing it and it means a lot to us and we'll share with you later so many offer beta customers are already converting to a commercial relationship with us even before like we are launched now but they have made that decision even before the launch and we'll be sharing some of those names with you so as you heard this morning Google Voice is generally available it's generally available in 11 markets so we are excited to bring this to you and with Google Voice now within G suite another exciting thing for us is that we are able to offer you a complete set of unified communication services with with Gmail with Google with hangouts chat hangouts Mead and Google Voice now you can address all of your communication needs within G suite with that I want to quickly roll of videos it's the first time you're showing it publicly but you can we can take this one going okay thank you the new Google Voice 4G suite is smart and puts you in control it follows Google calendars working hours while powerful AI automatically transcribes voicemails and minimizes interruptions by silently blocking unwanted spam calls and it works wherever you do on desk phones smartphones and computers and voice grows with your business admins add new users and assign numbers to one person or an entire department with just a few clicks users can tailor the voice apps across personal phones and work devices so they stay connected and in control from anywhere and voice keeps things simple when you get a call from hangouts meet you can see what meeting is calling and be ready when you answer and when it's time to unwind you're still in control because sometimes disconnecting is the best way to connect okay so that was a quick look at Google Voice and will tell you more about it okay so you know so Google Voice is the cloud telephony solution 4G suite customers with Google Voice what we take did was we took the user experience with so many millions of users already love for Google Voice for consumer and we expanded it we added s phone support Pali Pali is here so you know say we added desk phone support starting with Polly phones are the first ones we added integrations as you saw with hangouts chat we added integrations with meat and calendar hangout chat we're working on a TB coming soon and then we created brand new admin capabilities so within the G suite admin console you can go and manage Enterprise telephony just like you would manage any other G suite service you can use it to provision numbers to port numbers to set up desk phones to set up auto attendance and then we also harden the service we made sure that it's fully telecom compliant we are launching in 11 markets and we are going to have support for emergency calling we will follow all the other telecom regulations in addition we have the 24 by 7 support we have the SLA s we have the ISO to seven zero zero one comply we have the HIPAA compliance so it's a fully hardened service so that's the nuts and bolts of it that's the Google Google Voice what you see it which we have launched today but one question which we often get is what is our design philosophy how have we approached voice so that we can create a differentiated unique modern experience for our customers so we actually did not set out to create a me-too PBX system that copies if the features of these PBX systems which have been in market for such a long time a design approach our goals are twofold first is we want to create a smarter voice through careful use of AI and a second is we are really focused on creating delightful simple experience for our customers whether they're administrators or whether they're users so in terms of Google AI and what we are doing with it in voice if you think about it voice is such a natural surface for text-to-speech and speech-to-text where Google has some of the best in-class AI and spam such a problem with voice over IP is handled through machine learning data models we use anonymized donated data from products such as Android Google Phi Google Voice for consumers and we use that to identify spam and keep continuously improve our machine learning models and just like Gmail we take the spam and then we silently move it to a spam filter so users are not bothered and they can be productive so I J will be telling you much more about this product about what the product is and what we are doing within users admins so with that I Jamie Hartley write you yes thank you thanks Matt though so just to give you a quick tour we're going to talk about the new admin experience which a lot of our beta customers have seen we'll talk about the user experience and hopefully we'll show you some interesting demos along the way so I submit that outlined earlier we've really tried to make the administration process for voice really really simple its consolidated in the admin console which is where you manage all of G suite so you can come here to assign users numbers port numbers configure our attendance and so on for those of you familiar with Telecom in the audience you'll know that there are a lot of variations in Telecom across countries and this is something we've worked really really hard on with Google Voice making that experience consistent so that provisioning a user with a phone number in France is the same as provisioning a user in the United States one of the most challenging aspects of switching services whether you're going on prem to the cloud or moving between cloud services is porting phone numbers and so we've built that right into google voice you come into the admin console and you can tell us which numbers you want to port we keep you updated every step of the way and we alert you if things need to be addressed one of our newest features since we announced Google Voice beta last year is our multi level auto attendant which lets you guide callers to the right place whether it's to a team or an individual or to a message our auto attendant supports working hours and holiday hours so you can make sure calls go to the right place even if the business is closed but the most exciting aspect about this is what we were talking about earlier with our approach to develop Google Voice our leading text-to-speech technology helps you set up an auto tenant and really really fast all you need to do is type out the prompts and choose the language in which to play them back and you're up and running and this is a really really big time saver because for people who have set these things up before the normal process would have been record audio potentially hire someone to do it translate it upload it which can be you know weeks or hours of time and with our auto tenant you really can get up and running in a matter of minutes and we have a demo to show you later we know that many of our customers use desk phones so we're really excited that our partner Paulie who's here today we've worked hard to bring these four models to Google Voice on wvx 150 will be coming in a few weeks but the other was work today and the nice part about setting up desk phones with Google Voice is it's really simple all you have to do is grab the MAC address of a device put it in the admin console it's set up and you're up and running paulie's actually here on the next exhibition floor so check out their booth suite they have some phones to show off and if you need to go hands-free we've also worked to with top headset manufacturers to make sure they are compatible with not only Google Voice but also hangouts mate so if you're sitting at your desk with a headset we want to make sure you have good audio quality whether you're joining a meeting or placing a phone call so that was a quick look at the admin experience and we will show that to you in a demo so let's take a look at the user experience voice works on Android iOS and web and what we've recently done is we've taken a user experience that's loved by billions tried and tested and products like drive and Gmail and brought it to Google Voice so material design which is used across Google has now been updated in Google Voice and what this means is it's really quick to get started with Google Voice we've seen our beta customers and users really love the experience and have had no difficulty getting started with using the product one of the nice things about a number in the cloud like with Google Voice is it's not attached to any specific device what this means is end users can come in and customize their calling which devices they use while managing their work calls separately they can even forward calls to different devices if they're not working from their normal location and if you're sitting at your desk using Google Voice on the web we've also added advanced audio controls so you can customize the microphone and the the speaker you use and you can also choose where your calls ring so if you're not wearing your headset you don't miss any calls Google Voice has always had best-in-class voicemail transcription and we've had it for since the very beginning what we're really excited to announce is we've expanded the set of languages from two to the full set of launched countries that we are announcing with Google Voice today and our voice mode transcription is again powered by our leading speech-to-text which means since it's machine learning and AI based it means it's constantly improving over time so you can get voicemail transcripts in the app you can also quickly toggle in settings to have your transcript sent directly to your Gmail inbox and then there's spam you saw earlier and in the video how we block spam calls some sources today state that over 50 percent of calls in the US are robo calls and this is a problem that's under increasing focus even with the FCC so our spam models are trained by anonymized data used across Google and Google Voice uses these spam models automatically friend users the experience is pretty similar to Gmail if we detect that a phone call is spam we send it directly to a special folder and your day is not interrupted by a robo call so that was a quick look at the admin and end-user experience so let's jump to a quick demo okay what are we doing this heading up Tom yes oh yes doing it yes if we have a group we have we have a group called hooli group which manages our events and managing events are next and we feel like maybe we're getting too many complaints so yes we got a new employee Tom and we are selling Tom up with a phone number and the desk for the work so we don't have to deal with that Tom deals with it so let's do it hmm so let me set up Tom with the phone number and I'll click Edit and you'll see that the experience is pretty similar for assigning him a number in any country I'm going to give him a US number though and type it in a service address which will be used for his emergency calling and you'll see that voice is automatically assigning him a number I could change it but I'm just gonna go ahead and pick the default and so Tom gets an email with this phone number and he's up and running yeah so this is what we were saying is with with Google Voice you can really manage Enterprise telephony just like this wait you literally 30 seconds to set up that number can we also show the batch functionality yeah so let me jump to a spreadsheet so this is what you're seeing here is a list of users who we an administrator would have assigned phone numbers to you can see the country drop down here and their service address and when you upload the spreadsheet they're assigned phone numbers yeah so I think this is cool when you have to assign phone numbers to a large set of users and this uses Google Spreadsheets and what's really interesting is that any errors are returned in the same spreadsheet and they are highlighted and marked as you're seeing over here so an atmospheric and just correct those errors in the same spreadsheet and submitted back so a beta customers have been really loving this functionality really streamlines the capabilities all right should we do you think tom is gonna be sitting at his desk yes I think I think he will be yes so let's give him a desk phone so I've got a MAC address of this phone up here so Tom already had the email which would have him help him set up with whatever for this iOS client android client web client but now we also giving him a desk phone which is also connected to the cloud so he can literally like use any device anywhere so actually I'm gonna use his number laters I'm gonna copy it okay so now tom is head up with this particular device with this that's his phone number which was assigned to him just a couple of minutes earlier or a minute earlier by Jack okay so let's jump into the auto attendant we've got one partially set up for today so now this is the interactive voice response which we had mentioned how we are using text-to-speech AI in order to set up to enable our customers to set up auto attendant instantly so we want someone to handle complaints of a suggestion yeah but Tom super-new should we should we really have him do that yes we should that's why we got him so what I can do is I can transfer calls to Tom yes please yes and should we give it a try let's give it a try so what you're seeing here is I'm when I click preview we actually haven't published the auto attendant yet which is really nice because a lot of times you want to make changes without them being live first so this is not published but we can still test it out so let me do that thanks for calling hooli group at cloud next merci d'avoir Hyperloop oh cloud next French to make the most of this event please listen to the following options to have hooli group set up your next product demonstration press one to get a free cocktail this evening press two for complaints about this session who doesn't want a free to get a free drink this evening here are a couple of options for a free drink press 1 press start to repeat this menu press the pound key there are two ways to get a free drink you can visit the Pali booth at South one four one nine they might invite you to an event this evening the other way is to order a drink at the hotel bar and charge it to your colleagues room number now press hash to return to the main menu Oh to make the most of this event please listen to the following options to have hooli groups set up your next product demonstration press one to get a free cocktail this evening press two for complaints about this session press three can we jump to the phone can we switch to the phone at the back there we go yes I'm telling tell me okay this was the phone which Ajay has just provisioned earlier in the in the demo so and he just provision an auto attendant and you can see how instantly and fast it all comes together to create the experience [Applause] thank you all right that's if we can switch back to the slides I think okay so Samantha talked earlier about how voice has joined hangouts chat hangouts meet and Gmail to to complete our unified communication solution and so I wanted to talk a little bit about how we're bringing voice into G suite and show you a few examples of things we're working on one of the things we're focused on with G suite is digital well being the Google Voice team is actually spread across three offices we collaborate a lot with other teams they're spread across the globe which means that teams are always working around the clock depending on the working hours and with people commuting and traveling this is even more of a problem so we want to give people ways to disconnect when they're not working so voice integrates with Google Calendar to allow you to do just that if you're not working if you're out of the office or if you're outside of your working hours you can have your phone calls sent directly to voicemail hangouts chat is our team messaging product we use it a lot at Google pretty heavily but sometimes when you're having a disagreement or you really need to jump on the phone to resolve it you can jump right from a text-based conversation to a phone base conversation' right from the top right we know a lot of our G suite users spend a lot of their day in Gmail last year we introduced a sidebar that allows you to access applications like calendar keep and tasks right from within Gmail without switching browser tabs so we're really excited to be bringing voice into this experience so you can jump right from an email to a phone call this is coming soon and we will show you this in a demo also you've heard a lot about hangouts mate including for those of you who attended the session pre right before this one calling in hangouts meat is already powered by Google Voice dial in and then that includes dial in and dial out we'll be expanding this support to additional countries using the infrastructure and the billing support that we've added with Google Voice and one of the things we're trying to do with voice is to bring context into phone calls so people have information before they pick up the phone so hangouts me integrates with Google Voice so when a meeting calls a voice user you have important information like the meeting name and meeting details on the caller ID so when someone picks up the phone they know right where to pick up so let's jump to another quick demo yes so you can see I'm talking with Tom our newly added employee and if I wanted to jump on a phone call I could just jump on a phone call I'm not going to actually call him right now this is our integration with Gmail bringing voice into the Gmail experience you can see it's optimized for this sidebar so you can see call history on the right side if I was to click a phone call I would see suggestions and I could call right Tom right from here I'm sorry sorry to bother you Tom and finally I wanted to show what we have with hangouts made so you can see this is a meeting that we had previously scheduled when you schedule a meeting it automatically comes with a dialing number and a pin and you can see that it's scheduled on calendar so I'm gonna I'm gonna go ahead and jump in and join the meeting and you can see some of our colleagues are actually in the back in the meeting so I'm just gonna grab a phone number here and so we know that sometimes you can't join over video and sometimes you need to actually call people and so let me add someone by phone and dial them in so if you switch to if we switch to the phone you can see that we know that it's a meeting calling we know the title the meeting it's on the caller ID and when I was if I were to pick up the phone I'm prepared and ready to go so that's a voice with hangouts meet and that's voice integrator which you suite [Applause] we switch back to the slides so to sum up voice is simple smart and scalable we've been adding Enterprise features to Google Voice at a pretty rapid clip and we've focused on making the experience for end-users and admins really really simple with AI we've brought context and automation to the telephony experience and we've made it super simple to provision ten users or an organization of ten thousand voice is built on a robust intelligent platform that powers all telephony at Google you heard Smitha talk earlier about how billions of calls are already running on this platform what's more is we're leveraging the the investment that Google's made in submarine fiber and our data centers to ensure that the maximum traffic traverses Google's network for the maximum amount of time and what this means is this ensures high quality for a large majority of our traffic we have built-in spam and fraud monitoring in the platform these are technologies that have been used by Google search and Google Ads for many years and have been hardened in those products were inheriting a lot of the benefits that those products have have laid out before us and this is a complete telephony platform it's got local numbers it's got a number portability we support emergency dialing shortcodes messaging in the platform so we're really built on a platform that's ready to scale when you are and finally a smoother mentioned earlier voice is a core service so that what that means is it comes with the same compliance security and service levels that you used to which you suite so you saw a lot of what's in the product today I wanted to give you brief preview of what's coming ahead so we're working on ring groups and call transfer we'll be continuing to expand our hardware support with more common area devices as well as headsets and accessories and you saw a lot of the integrations that we have with G suite more of those will be coming as well so let me hand back to Smitha to talk about a little bit about customers that have been using voice in beta as well as how to get started great thank you yeah so I hope this has piqued your interest and I hope you'll consider starting with Google Voice and if you do you'll be in great company Dow Jones there have been an alpha tester with us a beta beta tester and now they are going they want to be a launch they are a launch partner with us so they are using Google Voice now within their organization I think we saw did we see Cori and Gavin here coming yes okay hi guys thank you okay so Dow Jones and then Nielsen Nielsen is another one of our customers that's been working with us for a long time and look at what Neal some calls out reliability and call quality over existing solutions in market and they have experienced this with day one with Google Voice City of Edmonton which is of course a government here it's a government entity this is Canada they are they are taking Google Voice so they are really excited to get Google Voice but it's because it streamlines the calling experience through all of the different applications and gives them a solution which they were looking for Portland State University Education customer again they have also been working with us for some time and they they are specifically calling out how easy and simple and fast it has been to deploy and manage Google Voice also want to call out zpg which is a real state technology provider they are in UK they are actually standardizing on Google Voice for all of the new hires so as you can see all of these launch customers they span multiple markets I've mentioned us you can Canada and different verticals so we talked about government we talked about education we talked about real state so we are looking at a variety of we are really seeing interest across the board for Google Voice we see that from small customers midsize customers large customers so the so phones as we said before are universal so in terms of the launch customers beyond the ones I mentioned to you these are all of the other customers which have already signed launched contracts with us so you can again see we are we are gratified and I we believe this is the best endorsement of the product if customers choose to go forward with you I mean we can see what we want but the customers are the ones experiencing the product so in terms of the product itself as I said before voice the need for voice we see that across all sizes of customers small medium large voicemail is voice is available as of today as an add-on to G suite we are offering voice in three different tiers starter standard and premiere Saturdays for really small
