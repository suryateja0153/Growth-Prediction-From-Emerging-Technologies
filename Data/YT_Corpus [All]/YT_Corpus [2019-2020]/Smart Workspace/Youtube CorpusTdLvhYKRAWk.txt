 Hey there so today I'm actually going to give  you a tour of my YouTube studio and my home office and the reason I'm going to do that is  because if you are to have a successful business   or a successful work from home practice your environment is everything and it's something I really haven't addressed into too much detail  in regards to design on the channel yet and I haven't really shared with you how passionate  I am about design and if you are new to the  idea and you've followed me a little bit or you  just love design then I've got a link below to   my other company which is a design company it's a  landscape design company and so just give a shout   out if you're a design entrepreneur or a designer  and you are just now finding the channel or you've   been watching because I love connecting with the  designers I am one I have a design company and so   I in my opinion design is extremely important  to your ability to function as an entrepreneur   and the way that you set your home and your office  up is extraordinarily impactful as to how focused   you're going to be how productive you're going  to be and how much you're going to enjoy your   work and I actually hired my first coach because  we connected over the topic of Feng Shui   and so Feng shui is something that I had gotten little  books about and been curious about and I had just   this instinct that your space has an impact on  who you are as a person or your life and   She had been giving a talk about this when I finally  ended up chatting with her we just really hit it off and I ended up hiring her as my coach so in  our sessions we would talk a lot about how your   space really impacts you and I'll actually put a  link to her website underneath because you might   find some information about Feng Shui or spaces  or just coaching in general that you like when you go and visit her because all of these things  your inner world and your outer world  and your business and how your life functions they  are connected okay so without rambling on about   my favorite topic on earth which is how your inner  world connects with your outer world  I am going to show you the office okay so here is just a little  shot of the studio I'm holding the camera cause I   only have one easel and you're looking at it but  that's it and Ferris obviously has his perch I have my laptop next to me and I'll give you a  closer look at that and my microphone and I'm not using the microphone in this video just  because my Lavalier broke   and so for those of you out there worrying about quality of video and sound just do it so you can see I just kind  of showed you this little video spot and it's not over complicated I just put my plants back there   because they look great they're actually masking  a cat box I wasn't gonna reveal that to you but   I just did and the reason I'm sharing that is  because you might have a challenging space and   all you need is like a screen or a curtain or a  towel to just mask something that you think you   just can't have on camera so I just wanted to  share with you just in case you are in a tiny   space or you need to get creative and at the end  of the day you know you can just go on YouTube   and look at a lot of people who are talking to  the camera and notice their backdrops and some   of them are just in a hallway or something like  that so don't worry about how your backdrop needs   to be I just am able to have my plants behind  me right and sometimes my kids make a cameo   appearance so I'm just showing you how you can  set that up and I have my laptop right by me   So I can read my scripts and my microphone and it's  that simple okay so what you see right here is my office I've got some desk things over here I've got my actual desk here I've got my printer back here and I actually got my kitty things right here so I'm going  to transform it with you just so I can show   you what is important about making your office  great so I run two successful businesses out of this space and this is just an amazing little desk that I got from West Elm and it's just a   little lean-to desk and if I really needed to  sit here and be in my laptop I could but you   can see I just kind of keep it for my storage  stuff and so with having something like Google Drive or a cloud service where you can put all  of your paper stuff what I do is I actually   take a scan of all my papers and put them in  the cloud immediately so I hate having papers   I'll show you where I put my papers actually  and it's in the laundry room but I want the   things that I see every day to look clean and  decluttered so I have everything I need right here and it's just pens scissors post-it notes  the debit cards that I use for my businesses and   the credit cards I use for my businesses and  that's it and then I store my laptop in here   so you can see I've got a couple things on here  right now and it needs to be cleaned up so I'm gonna clean it up really quickly and one of the  other important things about having your office   be just so simplified is that you're able to  clean it up really quickly and you'll notice   I do have a few little tchotchkes out there and  keeping tchotchkes to the minimum is important   so you can clean up quickly and you can see  we have a little kitty food station there too so what I did with my desk was I took everything  off of the desk that actually is a to do and I only do this when I have time in my calendar to  spend a half hour or an hour going through the to dos and it might mean like for example I have a  check stub that gets filed and that is gonna get filed right now and I have a sketchbook that gets  put away and so I'm gonna put that away and so on   and these folders all have to do is related  to them so this is website stuff I'm actually   going to go to my project management software  right now and put in their website tasks that   I want to get done and then this folder can go  back into my unused folders area and so I have   taxes that are ready to be paid and then some  other things that need to be filed and paid   and Goli is jumping up on the desk that I purchase  specifically for pets to work with me and   I'm actually going to demonstrate how that works  and so if you have pets or kids sometimes   you have to get creative about how they interact with  you while you're working and sometimes you don't   really have a choice and so I knew that this was  going to happen all day long and so you can see I got a desk that was big enough for piles of paper  one of their favorite things   whenever there's a pile of paper they know that that means that I'm working on that and that should be disturbed   and for them to sit and there's still enough room  for my computer and the reason why I have this   desk out here is because it gives me a beautiful  view I can look out my window and I can see at   my front door from here and so I always like to  be facing my front door that's a Feng Shui thing I got from working with my coach so that I can be facing  my opportunities and so get creative if you have   a pet that insists on working on your lap and  sometimes it's really hard to avoid but I'll   show you my computer setup and how I avoid my  cats being absolutely on top of my productivity   and I think you know having them not on my  desk is not an option so I worked with it and I got you know a 30-36 inch desks that at least two  kitties can fit on while I'm working Hey guys I'm at my station and look it's functioning and I'm still able to be at my computer and I have my computer raised up on this little stand I got that at IKEA a long time ago and I've got my actual magic keyboard on my desk so it says ergonomic as can be and I can stand up at this desk so since I'm at my computer a lot if I want to  stand I can just you know I purposefully got   this standing height desk and I searched high and  low for an adorable one so it's a lovely one and it's round because I don't have enough space in  my apartment for a bigger rectangle desk and so that's why I got this one and I can fit two kitties  maximum and then I have a seat right over here for a third one so the reason why I showed you how  minimal and simple my office is isn't to brag   and say look how beautiful my space is even though  I think it's beautiful it's to show you that you know I can focus and be productive in here with  just the smallest amount of things and more than   that would actually take away from what I'm doing  so piles of paper and clutter and things you don't   need that leads to procrastination and you can't  afford to procrastinate in your business or when you're working from home you can't afford to  have things in your way you want to use when you're at work use your time efficiently and  so one of the reasons why I love having my   desk right here is because I have these huge huge  windows that I can look out often and so I have   a beautiful view and I don't feel cooped up and  so if you don't have that luxury in your office   get something that you love to look at and have it  near you and just start to make it your miniature   castle a place where you feel like the queen  or king of your realm because the better you   feel inside your office the more your business is  going to blossom the more you're going to enjoy   your work there will be times when you're just  working a lot and you're gonna want to enjoy the   space you're in enjoy your work and so that's  what you know I set my office up to be I find   it you know sometimes it's annoying when I have  my pets getting in my face but I love my pets   so it's fun to be able to accommodate them and  have them here with me and so since I do work from   home it is important when you do work from home  that your space is really functional and so you   saw how quickly I was able to clean my space it  took me two minutes to clean right and so the   less I have every week when my cleaning person  comes I have a bag of things to get rid of  and so I went through that habit you know for years  and years and I would get rid of bags of bags   and now there's less and less but the less you  have the more you're going to be able to focus   on what's happening right now and enjoy right now  okay and so I want to show you a few more things   before I wrap up this video because I want to tell  you a little bit more about how you can make your office work for you so I live in a loft where  space and storage actually had a premium and I like it like that because it forces me to only  have what I need and so my bookshelf is actually   in here so what you can't see is that my books  are over here and I have one shelf of books and   then over here I have all of the unattractive office  things like reference books that I like to you know come and pick up and put notes in and have  pieces of paper sticking out of but I don't access them every day I have my paper in here I have my folders you know this is my actual laundry   I didn't pre clean this for this video and then  sometimes I need big pieces of paper for printing   and I just put them here because this is like the  closet of my office and my laundry room so what I've done is thrown out and recycled absolutely  every piece of paper that I don't need to have   my hands on and any you know given time in my  business and even if there's something where I might need to print it out one time or a couple  more times I'll just scan it and put it on the   cloud and if I need to print it I just print it  you know usually I don't I label it so that I   can find it again and this means that I don't  have to pay rent to store things that I'm not   really using it's just not a useful way to have  space and then anything that's not cute you just put   it in here and I make it as easily accessible  as possible and so if you have this mentality   like you need to keep everything and hold on to  everything definitely read the Marie Kondo book   and I'll put a link to that in the notes because  she really helped me like choose which keepsakes   to keep and which important documents to keep  and it's a book that I just when I finally read it it actually really helped me get organized  to the max and I was already a pretty organized   person okay and so I just wanted to share kind of  where I put my files because when I was cleaning   my office you're probably thinking she's just  probably moving those off camera or where's she   actually putting those why I put them away I put  him in here and I just don't keep anything that I don't need because if I see it it's gonna stop me from making efficient decisions   and there's nothing more important in your business than  being able to make efficient decisions so you can keep the momentum going so that you can make  your business run as lean and mean as quickly as possible so I just wanted to share that with you  and I'm gonna show you just a couple more things   about the space that I think are important so over here you can see that I have my TV and it took me kind of a little while to figure out where the best place for the TV was because I didn't want a TV but I realized that if I didn't have a TV I was actually streaming shows on my iPad  and I tried as much as I can not to binge watch things  but my parents said hey we won a TV do you want it and they sent it to me so I said okay when I  finally got it I thought alright I should have a TV so I don't have to look at my iPad so I put  it in this corner and if you follow Feng Shui   and you like Feng Shui according to the Bagua  map this is my abundance corner and so you'll   see behind me there's a mirror and a light and so  in my apartment this corner is naturally really dark because it's next to the window and so  when the light comes in it makes that corner kind of shadowy and since it is my abundance corner I wanted to make myself feel abundant and make sure my Feng Shui was working and so I put a big  old mirror with a big gold frame and a big light   and I did this is the only one I have my TV there  but it ended up being where it needed to be and instead of having a bunch of tchotchkes and stuff  I just took all of that stuff away and have it on a skinny little table and that's all it needs  you can see it's a pretty minimalist approach   the only splurge are having here is art and plants the other thing I want to show you here is that  from my desk I actually look at my living room in my  kitchen and where I ate up my dining room table and the front door and so it's super super important  for this space to be absolutely free of clutter   or else it's going to be distracting to me I can't  fall into being nit picky about cleaning things and I never want my messy space to take away from  working and so if you can afford to have it   if you don't already I do suggest that you have a  cleaning person or a cleaning team handle most of   the cleaning in your space because it's going to  alleviate you from being tempted to go and clean   it yourself or it's going to alleviate you from  being stuck and procrastinating because it's messy   and so I value cleanliness and being clutter free  as an integral part to my business since I do work   from home and it's very important to feel good  in your space and not be able to see the dirty   dishes and be like you know what I'm not gonna  make that phone call I'm just gonna go do those   dishes right now because it's hard enough when  you're your own boss to stay focused and to stay   on task and so since I look at my kitchen I make my  kitchen as free as possible of things that I don't   need and only the things that are out there are  things that I'm using everyday or it's a plant or   a cat usually okay and then if you can see in the  background I have you know my coat rack everything is   specifically chosen because I use it and whenever  I use I try and make it as attractive as possible   and as simple as possible and most of this stuff  in here didn't cost me a lot to set it up to   make it all kind of function and I even use that  coat rack over there to hang my different shirts   that I want to try on when I do YouTube videos  and so everything has a little function in the   apartment and so I just wanted to give you that  tour because I can't stress enough how important   it is to really set up your space for success and  you might be thinking gosh well I don't have this   capability or I don't have that capability just  post your questions in the comments or join the   Facebook group I have all the links in the notes  below and ask your questions in there because  I really want you to have success in your business  I really want you to be able to function from home   I want you to be able to get through all those  confusing times when you can't figure out how to do something that's what this channel is  about so if you like this video it was kind   of a wild card video for me to make so you know  please definitely give it a like if you liked it   let me know because I'll make more of these  types of videos if you liked a concept that   I talked about in the video ask me more about it  and I will make another video if it calls for it   because I love sharing this kind of stuff and if  you love hearing about it I'll definitely share   some more and make sure you subscribe to the  channel and turn on the notifications because   I would love for you to be able to be the first  to get this information as it rolls out   because usually I get inspired by something and then I'll make the videos and then I'll roll them out  especially if it's a social media thing or whatever is  happening right now the latest and greatest in social media marketing and online business so  thanks for stopping by I hope you enjoyed the   office tour and I'm glad you were here let me know  what you think and I'll see you on the next video
