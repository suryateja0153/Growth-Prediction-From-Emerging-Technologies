 Smartsheet dashboards are a powerful way to surface the right information at the right time so you can make better decisions, faster. Dashboards are easy to create using customizable widgets. Let's look at an example of a dashboard a team uses to track customer onboarding. A title widget clearly labels the dashboard. Rich text widgets provide help text or descriptor information. Charts provide a way to visualize Smartsheet data. This column chart shows onboarding tasks by status, by pulling in data from the onboarding timeline sheet. Charts are customizable and interactive. Metric widgets highlight key information and can be used to show specific values. Shortcut widgets are great for adding links to commonly used resources, including Smartsheet items as well as cloud files and links. Use image widgets to include pictures and logos in your dashboard. Web content widgets can be used to embed, surface and interact with content that lives outside of Smartsheet. The onboarding team has embedded an onboarding video that they've uploaded to YouTube. Other options such as Smartsheet forms, Tableau reports and more can also be used. Adding a report to your dashboard lets stakeholders view information without needing access to the underlying data. For example, an at-risk task reports widget shows the items that are at risk of not being completed on time. There are two permission types available when sharing dashboards, admins and viewers. Viewers can simply consume the information in a dashboard, while admins can create and manage the content. Sharing a dashboard with someone as a viewer lets them view the dashboard and interact with the widgets. Admins can add, edit, remove, rearrange and resize widgets. They can also share dashboards with team members and stakeholders. Use Publish to share a dashboard with a broad audience without requiring a Smartsheet login. And that's a quick introduction to dashboards.
