Is there anything I can do? Actually... When? Just now. No, when's the meeting? Oh, uh, Thursday, 8 a.m. Next Thursday? Yes. No. This Thursday. What? That's impossible! We can do this, OK? Round box is back. It's just a sketch, that's all we have! Two days? We need two weeks. This is how we get off this floor. Dave, can you get some sales figures on pizza boxes? I feel sick. It's so simple. Round pizza, round box. [CAMERA SHUTTER] Perfect. Hey, who's hungry? We have to prove what's wrong with pizza boxes. They're square. Wasted space! Yeah! Do I really have to go see Mike in finance? All: Yep. Hey, Mike. I was wondering if you could send me the -- Shh. Inbox.   Music playing     We have this idea. We need some sort of 3D prototype.

Dave, can you please double-check those figures for us? Did anyone hear from Ed in warehouse? He's putting together the prototype now.   What are you guys working on? Nothing. "Nothing."   Move that over there. Make that title bigger. Guys! We're almost there. I mean, I don't even -- What are you doing, bud? Hey, can I have that back? No!   I'll email you the video. Just AirDrop it to me. [AIRDROP PING] Sweet! You guys, I just got the prototype. Woah! This is going to look so good in the presentation. Awesome! Wow!   [ALARM SOUNDS] I'm awake!
