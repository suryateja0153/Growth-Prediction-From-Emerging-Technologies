 geez sweet reimagines the way teams collaborate so your business has the tools it needs to create its best work together faster here's one example Samy forgot her pixel book on her kitchen counter this morning but luckily for her she's able to grab a loaner Chromebook and log in instantly with her two-factor authentication security key organizations like Sammy's that use these keys have reported zero account hijackings hangouts chat makes it easy for Sammy to collaborate with her team two days that's crazy Sammy's team can share Docs sheets and slides ins right in the chat room and the correct permissions are added automatically in slides it's simple for Sammy's team to collaborate in real-time and they know exactly what next steps are because comments and action items can be assigned to specific owners hmm Julie needs Sammy to look up some information with cloudsearch Sammy can use the same technology that powers Google search to quickly find the data and documents she needs the cross Jesus wheat and the tools our company uses most like Salesforce Sammy's team can work together in sheets in real-time making sure the data is always up to date no one gets a workbook as locked warning and just like Docs or slides sheets lets you make comments to other collaborators or create trackable action items with exploring sheets Sammy can find insights in her data by asking questions in plain English like what is the average revenue per region she chooses natural language processing to understand Sammy's request and give her the answer she needs instantly ah there's the number Julie was asking about some topics are best discussed face-to-face but setting up meetings takes time Sammy just doesn't have under her tight deadlines in Google Calendar smart suggestions take the headache out of scheduling calendar suggests meeting times that work for everyone it even recognizes time zones and work blocks like how roses and Madrid and Nick is in New York and when it's time to meet Sammy joins hangouts meet right from calendar her teammates can also join from a phone or outside domains plus it's easy to present materials like documents or even a jam board session while presenting Sammy can continue working in real time Sammy can even type a phrase like Julie to follow up on this and Google will leverage the power of natural language processing to create an action item it even knows which truly to assign it to and when Sammy needs to send an email Gmail smart compose can offer suggestions as she types saving valuable time gee sweet takes security seriously to manage sensitive email communications Sammy uses confidential mode in Gmail this lets her put restrictions on messages so they can't be forwarded copied downloaded or printed ok Sammy sent the email and naturally she goes back to chat where this all started finding a time that works for everyone isn't easy but with the meet bot Sammy can enter a simple command with the names of the attendees and meet will figure out who they are and when they're available whether it's an urgent exact request or an everyday project juice we can help reimagine work for enterprise companies like yours [Music]
