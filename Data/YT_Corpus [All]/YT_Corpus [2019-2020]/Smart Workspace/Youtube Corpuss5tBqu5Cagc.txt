 [Music] hello everyone thanks so much for joining me today it's great to be here right Google cloud next 5 p.m. we're excited awesome I'm excited too and that's because I'm joined with by Kristen Waters and Josh Smith we're gonna be talking new features it's exciting and specifically we're gonna be talking about collaboration all right so let's get things started here I like to get started anytime I think about a really hard problem like collaboration I like to start with some data companies that encourage collaboration are five times as likely to be high-performing that's from a study by the Institute for corporate productivity so why is that well collaborative companies have teams that work together more efficiently so they can work on big projects that involve massive teams multiple teams or multiple organizations at collaborative companies people find the right information at the right time because they know where to look who to ask and they have the right tools to get access to the information they need right now not a week from now and last at collaborative companies the work they create benefits from the collective knowledge they've created over years of experience running their business if you think about your business you've probably created expertise around the best way to operate or the fundamental problems in your field and there's nothing worse than rethinking through a problem that someone's already solved ten times over and so taking all together this collaboration is the difference between your business being a leader in its field or falling behind so on the drive team we know this is super important and we've taken the biggest problem here which is collaborating on content and taking it as our mission to solve so today working on content is too hard and we all had this problem the where's my content problem is it on my computer or your computer in the content repository that I can't quite figure out how to use or in the cloud or um pram or H : or J : you never know where to look and let's say you do find the right file do you have access because many of these legacy tools are siloed so that only the specific team can access that information and if that's the case you might be waiting weeks to get access that's no bargain so let's say you get access is it even the right version of the file because if you're collaborating with email attachments you just have to trust that you have the latest thread that has the latest message with the latest attachment that's no bargain because it could be on your computer another computer in one thread or another and then when you send that final document to the customer you could end up sending something that needs revision no bargain so these problems are pretty serious and on Drive we feel like there's a better way with Drive first and foremost we make sure you can work your way with the tools you're used to avoiding change management costs picking up a whole new set of tools we also help your teams work together more efficiently with smart simple collaboration that is built for the enterprise and finally you stand on the shoulder of giants helping we help you work smarter with Google intelligence that helps you stay both informed and focused as you focus on the work that matters most so across these three areas of focus we're gonna be talking about 15 features that's right 15 features that help you collaborate this is a smart phone moment I'm gonna give you like I'm gonna give you a few seconds take the picture awesome 15 features to help you collaborate let's get started you want to go back one more okay 15 features we'll take the we'll take the questions later thanks I know lots of questions here so let's get started with seamless interoperability all right what is working with office files look like today well I talked about this a little bit earlier but emailing attachments is a huge pain you send over the quarterly report it's in draft you send over the final version but then oops you get that last minute round of edits and it becomes final v2 final v3 final V final it's no bargain and with these disparate versions you might think file locking that's the answer my my on-prem file storage solves this but know we've all had that experience of almost walking into a meeting and realizing oh I need to change the name of the customer we're pitching to otherwise we're gonna be in trouble but if that file is locked there's no way you're gonna have to make a copy and then we're back to the where's the latest version is that your machine my machine problem this is not a bargain in contrast working with office files in Drive is amazing that same office file can be accessed in Word you can comment on it in real time with Google Drive from your phone or laptop and you can edit that same file in real time with Google Docs one seamless experience with cross any tool you want to use with a single file that's the power of Drive so when we think about interoperability with office files the first thing we think about is Drive file stream Drive file stream brings Google Drive to the desktop in a way that's really intuitive let me paint you a picture let's say before you move on to the cloud you have a file storage server that is accessed over a network and it's mounted at j.cole and backslash on friday you're accessing your files at J colon backslash maybe over the weekend something's gonna change you're gonna move to Google Drive your admin uses G Suite migrate and installs Drive file stream when you come in on Monday all that same content is still accessible at J Cole and backsplash with Drive file stream drive.file stream also uses hardly any disk space so you can hack access terabytes of files stream to your computer without filling up your hard drive now that's great but sometimes you need your content offline and that works too you can mark any file or folder available offline so you can access it on that pesky airplane or on on-site at some factory that doesn't have good connection you can always have access to your files so this is Drive file stream we announced this last year but there is one thing we heard over and over again from customers if we're gonna be storing data offline we need to make sure it's secure that's why starting today we are going to integrate Drive file stream with a Google device management console with device management you can view sync details like the last time it synced how much data is available offline you can limit Drive file stream to only work on those corporate devices that you've pre whitelisted and you can set up approval processes so that when you have a new bring-your-own-device come online you install drive file stream and you need approval before it'll work that's great and then if you lose a device its lost or stolen someone leaves the company you can block or wipe a device with a single click this happens within seconds we just did a demo earlier today and I got to see it on stage it was amazing it happens literally within seconds it's so quick I love it so this is security built in by default enabled for everyone in Drive file streams starting today yeah awesome right I love that okay last thing on Drive filestream the other big thing we heard from customers is what about server OSS well we got that too starting today Drive file stream will work on Windows Server starting 2012 and up this is supporting your desktop virtualization use case so say you have a Chromebook and you want to be able to access Windows for that one pesky application you haven't moved off of Windows yet you can run a virtual desktop run drive file stream get all your files and don't worry about those version conflicts it's great the next step is ensuring that that file locking problem is solved in a 21st century way that's why we introduced Drive file stream last year and I'm pleased to tell you that it's generally available with real-time presence instead of locking someone out of a file you can see who's editing so if I hop in that file two minutes before the meeting and I see that my coworker is in that file I can know well he's probably just making the next version of it I need to make this edit now and choose to make that edit you're not locked out it's great and if you're offline or you create a collision we're gonna help you resolve that as well so unlike any other tool we'll show you a side-by-side comparison let you save the latest version after merging the changes and get a single file so no matter what happens you can collaboratively ensure that you're editing the same office file without getting locked out that's real-time presence so on the theme of integrating with office we also integrate with Microsoft Outlook and this launched last week you can now save attachments from your emails to drive right from Outlook you can well save attachments I just showed you attaching from Drive excuse me and you can ensure that when you send an email you have the right permissions and that the person you're sending the file to always has access we're now making it so that outlook is of the same calibre as Gmail when it comes to our integration with drive because we know that integrating with Microsoft Excel PowerPoint outlook is critical for these interoperability scenarios awesome so this is again available starting today yeah OOP some Outlook fans I use Gmail but you know outlook it's great so after you get off of your legacy tools and you start to move into a mobile-first cloud-first model the first thing you'll run into is being able to work with your legacy files from anywhere so that's why in Drive we let you comment on Word Excel PowerPoint and PDFs and many more file types right from Drive this works on mobile and on the web you can anchor comments to specific text you can assign action items it works just like Google Docs and this is great but we go one step further because with Drive commenting will actually integrate that comment into the file itself and synchronize the two so you can comment in Word see that comment in Google reply in Google see the reply in word reply in word etc so all that commenting doesn't matter it's it's it doesn't care what tools you use it should just work and we announced that last year really exciting and just in case you forgot that works on hundreds of file types I just put a few up here but the four in the center are the file types that support comments natively within them and so for those file types we'll integrate the comments in for the other ones you can still anchor text on images I love this you can drag a rectangle and say hey this part of the image needs to be updated or fixed really powerful so we talked about working with office on a traditional desktop talked about commenting anywhere with Drive but now let's head into the future with real time commenting and editing with Google Docs so this might look familiar right opening an office file in Google Docs we've had this for a couple years but it's been a little hard to use it might have required an extension it might have required managing multiple files but starting this week you can now edit office files in Google Docs with a single file just like it should work yeah this is huge this is huge so as you can see here all you do is you right-click open with Google Docs and you get that dot do CX badge in the top left corner and you get all the features of Google Docs so you can see the changes from office users with history so all those changes show up in a list like you'd imagine you can also edit in real time collaboratively and access all the machine intelligence features of Doc's Explorer this is incredibly powerful we're bringing this revolutionary technology to a decade's old format and we're letting you access it it's rolling out next week I'm so excited for you to get your hands on it it's really great so hopefully you haven't heard me say interoperability too many times but the bottom line is that with Drive you get to work your way because we interoperate with all of your existing tools we make Microsoft with Google better than Microsoft with Microsoft by integrating this like real time and machine intelligence functionality that we're known for with these legacy tools awesome so I'm going to pass things off to Kristen talk about collaboration all right thanks guys nice to see you I'm Kristen waters product manager on Drive and I am gonna take you through how to work efficiently in Drive so I'm gonna focus really on our core collaboration flows including all those new features that you saw in the first slide that we have in store for you so our core experience is really all about enabling your users to work efficiently together we keep it simple for your end users and our systems ensure that each collaboration is safe and secure so let's dive in so I want to bring you guys all in and guide you and your users to work more efficiently in Drive we're going to focus on some tips and tricks and we're gonna focus on three areas of importance one organizing and cheering in team drives which is our content storage platform that is built from the ground up for the enterprise we announced that two years ago it next also how to best collaborate with users outside of your organs organ you're working with a lot of vendors contractors and we're gonna go through the best ways to do that and how to ensure that you and your end-users are sharing securely all right so I'm gonna start off with our North Star experience we have a lot of features that we're gonna go through here past present future I'm gonna tie it all together in a demo for you guys so let's do it live let's go over to demo one here okay cool so here we onon are on screen and I want to introduce you guys to Sydney Taylor she works at a company called acne it's a manufacturing company and she's focused on healthcare manufacturing so what Sydney is gonna do is she's gonna organize and clean up all of her content and then she's gonna make sure that the right people have access so let's dive in and start we're gonna focus here she's got a zero in on her new health care manufacturing launch that's coming up she's gonna go in here to her Acme manufacturing team drive and she really wants to reference a piece of content into the Acme health team drive so we'll go through here and we're gonna make a shortcut this is new functionality GA this year will dive in and some slides a little bit later ok so I've got my picker I'm gonna put it in a team drive I'd like to put it here in Acme health let's go ahead and add and you see that the shortcuts added boom there it is we've got a shortcut referenced from annua Acme manufacturing in Acme health that file alright that's shortcuts and drive and now that file lives and it's permissions are inherited from Acme manufacturing so you can reference it many different team drives this is great so here we are in Acme house and look at this long list of team drives she's got a launch coming coming up and she's really got a focus so what we're gonna do we're gonna tidy up keep away the team drives that spark joy all right and here we go we now have the option to hide these team drives this is new functionality so boom those team drives are now hidden as you can see here we can reference them in our hidden team drives pal back to team drives and look at how clean this list of team drives is now so only the team drives that are relevant to you and that you're using at this moment are in your list here and and that's going to be GA rolling out this next week we'll dive into that a little bit more on the slides and so ok we've organized we've tidied up here now let's make sure that everyone has the right permissions so we'll go in here to Acme health and I'm gonna share a file with Vijay my production manager Vijay does not have a Google account right so this is simple and easy okay we can change the permissions for Vijay everything is as normal and Vijay does not have a Google account ok we're sharing outside the org this is fine share goes through as usual what's happening on Vijay zones as he gets the share email he clicks in he goes through a lightweight pin code verification flow and he's able to comment edit view anything on that Google Doc like a typical Google user so we're gonna go through all that functionality and this is an active beta right now okay so we've shared to one of our contractors and vendors now we've got a folder here in our team drive so we want to go ahead and share the folder we can share here okay and yeah that's that's an exciting one it sure is okay so we want to share to a group here this is how we manage our healthcare acne all right we can change these permissions if we want we can add a note we'll go ahead and send great and so now our group has permissions to the team drive we didn't necessarily fall durand the team drive we didn't necessarily have to add them to the membership and lastly we are Sydney's gonna do a big presentation later on for this healthcare manufacturing launch and she wants to make sure that users in her organization have access to her comps so she's gonna share a file now we're going to click here on the link and you're gonna see some new options here so we have customized link sharing options here within the domain we have see we've had our admin recommended you can share to the sales team to the marketing team to engineering sydney actually wants these comms to to go out to all full-time employees so she's gonna go ahead and pick her admin recommended we'll go ahead and give comments access there so that's our new customized link sharing and I'm gonna dive into some details on timing with that one later and I want to call out that this sharing dialogue probably does not look very familiar to you guys we are going to be releasing a complete rehaul of our sharing dialogue complete redesign and i'll go into some more detail there but here's you're seeing it live separate it out sharing with people getting the link fantastic experience here okay so now click done we've sidney's all done she's tidied up the team drives she shared all the content and now we can switch back to the slides and dive into when you guys are gonna get these things which I'm sure is the question on everyone's mind okay so organizing and sharing and team drives let's focus on that first so again pleased to announce that hiding team drives is generally available end of this week rolling out next some tips and tricks there as you saw in a multi-select it's the best way to go in and really clean everything up you probably want to advise your users to do that and you can right click with one click and hide next we have searched by creator which is generally available today so using the using the Creator operator you can find files that are located in a team drive so I don't know if you guys have ever had this problem but you're trying to find a file you can't for the life of you remember the document title but you remember who you're collaborating with so the creator operator solves this problem all you do is type in creator colon and then the user name and it's going to return all the files located in a team drive that that user has created and a little tip here you can now actually also search creator : me and find all the files that you've created and a team drives and that's generally available today ok and the shortcuts you guys saw me go through in our North Star experience when I was referencing from manufacturing to healthcare that's going to be generally available this year shortcuts how are incredibly important to users and you've probably been getting some of this feedback as you've been using team drives you know right now a file can only live in one team drive it inherits those permissions so before shortcuts you know those weekly status know that your team is always referencing they can only be located in one place and you may not want to give everyone access on the team to that file and after the launch of shortcuts you can create a pointer to that document in as many team drives as you'd like so it's a great organization organizational tool that makes team drives much more flexible okay and then lastly but not least we have folder sharing and team drives everyone get those cameras up so I just want to take a moment here and pause and say that this feature really matters to the team at Google it matters to customers and we realize how critical this functionality is whether you're migrating files into team drives or whether you're starting afresh so right now our timeline still is directional this functionality is gated behind our next-gen of infrastructure it's to make sure that we're delivering a fast dependable reliable experience in team drives we have a huge team working on this with dozens of our drive engineers on the case so rest assured that this is the highest priority across olive team drives and we're working on it diligently once we launch this next generation of infrastructure it's going to unlock some benefits for you as users as well so it's going to unlock the ability to have greater visibility into files in the team Drive folders in a team drive and also a fast and reliable system performance so I'll also be upfront here if you have any questions or additional feedback on that feature all right so now let's dive into collaborating externally more and more frequently we need to collaborate across organizational boundaries with vendors with contractors with partners and I'm pleased to say that our pin verified visitor sharing feature solves that need so you can collaborate across boundaries securely and easily and this is an active beta right now so it's out in the wild you know before visitor sharing you might have had to LinkShare which might not meet your security needs through your organization your partners may have had to create consumer Google accounts just so that they could access and collaborate on the file or you could send along these temporary view-only documents so these options are you know at best and convenient and it works just not meeting the security needs of your organization so now you can input any user into the sharing dialog and they'll get the sharing email like I said just go through a lightweight pin code flow and there they there they are in the document they can edit comment view just a few notes on the feature they'll just need to redo the pin code flow every seven days and if you want to remove them from the document you go into the sharing dialog like any other user remove and save so this has been quoted as a game-changer for our customers and I'm very very pleased to share progress here in active beta so most of you in the crowd probably manage users in your organization and sharing securely is top of mind I'm gonna take you through a few sharing features for a simple and secure user experience so first off our sharing dialog redesign this is directional for this year and as you saw in our North Star experience we are completely redesigning the dialogue from the ground up it's been a passion project of ours and I'm beyond excited to announce this today sometimes the best security is good UX design so we're excited to share this with you today a few things that we've really focused on here in the dialogue is really separating out sharing to people and sharing with a link we want to make sure that copying a link and turning on a link are two very separate actions you'll notice that the dialogue is the same for Team drives and my drive and it's very understand who has access to a file what links sharing options are turned on so and that information is not hidden behind a click so we've tested this new dialog extensively with users and it significantly exceeds what we've got today and we've seen high confidence ratings from users so it's just really great to see that data coming back and this redesign will be rolling out in our G suite alpha and beta bundle program in 2019 next we have custom link sharing this is directional timeline right now you know how often do your users really need to publish a document to the entire organization most of the time not often if you want marketing to share only with marketing if you want engineering to share only with engineering you can limit the scope of link sharing to make sure it's fitting your security needs directional and lastly we have advanced data loss protection and drive so we've been working closely with our DLP team and we're expanding the consequences of DLP and drive so if you go in to your admin console and you set up a rule in Drive that's looking for the word confidential it's scanning for that word confidential and if it's found what's gonna happen is the rule we're trigger and block all downloading copying and printing on that document so it really allows you to put some more guardrails on your content in your data and I'm pleased to announce that today a directional for this year okay so in summary we talked about organizing and sharing and team drives we focused on collaborating externally and sharing securely and now I'm gonna turn it over to Josh Smith's product manager everybody how's it going my name is Josh Smith that's me in there when you work in Google cloud that's actually business casual so we take it very literally very excited to share with you the progress that we've made so far let me just log in here for the demo that's upcoming so I'm going to talk to you about how we can help you stay informed and focused and why it matters and overall the impact that we think we're having and that the data is indicating is helping you work smarter so what's the issue that's happening what's the problem that we're addressing well people are spending more and more time on mundane tasks and I think we can all feel that in our daily lives at work one example is people spend eight hours a week searching for and consolidating information and when you sum it all up you take all the overhead the work around work people spent up to 50% of their week just getting ready to work that's that's a big problem the nature works changing but it's changing in the wrong direction for a lot of us so why is that happening well increasingly we have this flood of information that's coming at us but our focus quickly turns into distraction there's too many people too many apps and projects all vying for our attention and what's the result you feel overwhelmed you can't focus and as a repercussion you have this really high cognitive switching cost between tasks it takes 20 or 30 minutes on average to get from one taxi task through the other and you would think you know the benefit of this is well at least I have all that context I'm situationally aware now but the truth is you end up distracted and uninformed and there's a real tension there because the important information gets drowned out by the noise we've all had that moment in meeting somebody somebody goes hey have you read the attachment and it's the attachment you didn't know was sitting unread in your inbox and that's problematic for you and the organization so going a layer deeper why is this happening well there's a lot of reasons I want to call your attention to two the first one there's a cognitive tipping point in many cases our bandwidth as individuals is being outrun by the sheer speed the breadth and depth of data and information that's flowing at us the second one well then you say well hey out there there's a ton of Technology and tools and resources they should be all solved my problem for me why aren't they well the truth is a lot of those tools were developed in the 1990s and architected for on-prem environments they weren't designed with the cloud in mind and who incurs that cost will you incur that cost with your time and your organization incurs that cost on their bottom line so as your most valuable asset you're in for your organization's informations lying dormant we're feeling distracted uninformed and it's a challenging situation that means if we keep operating this way we're gonna wake up tomorrow further and further behind but what if we could do something about this what if we could take that flow of information that's overwhelming us mix it up and turn it into something that's powerful prioritized easy to digest and helps you focus on the things that matter well we're really happy to announce that in the last two weeks we completed rolling out our new priority page to GA this all right this priority page uses a number of powerful machine learning models to do two really important things one is take the content that needs your attention and put it in front of you the other is let you focus on just the limited number of files you actually need each week how many files do you think you actually really give attention to each week well we did we did the math and so most people only use maybe 10 to 20 files in a given week it's kind of an alarming statistic right we have access to thousands of documents and yet you use 10 or 20 and what do we do today to get to those 10 or 20 we dig through the thousands that we have priority let's you avoid that by bringing those to the surface when you need them the the files that need your attention and the results have been really outstanding on this and we're going to go through a demo but I want to talk about the impact so already priority saves fifty fifty percent of the time you would have otherwise spent finding your files that sounds you know fifty percent is good it's ten percent on the at ten seconds on the average find that the average moment where you go to access and find content on the long tail when you spend four minutes trying to remember what was that word and that document from two years ago you know maybe what the file type wasn't and I can't think of it maybe I'll just chat my colleague and ask him if they still have it ends up adding up to twenty years of work and time saved every single day across our user base so and that in that spirit let's do it live okay so you know here we are a Jeff's profile Jeff just came back from lunch I think all most of us prior to lunch at some point it comes back to lunch so this first priority suggested card right across the top we have these priority cards comes back from lunch here there's this core pitch he was working on before lunch and we understand that he was editing it recently it might be the file that he needs right now right so underneath the surface here is a variety of powerful machine learning models they're looking at the activity that's occurring on content you care about and surfacing when you need it this one is a little bit of an easier one you just accessed it before lunch you came back great there it is let's go to the second one well it's 1:15 p.m. Jeff has a meeting coming up with rich he was so heads down in his presentation he forgot about it and attached to that meeting is this proposal for this account the great outdoors so Jeff can open it from here and easily access and be prepared for that meeting making sure he's more productive in the organization is as well at the same time he's gonna meet rich pretty soon and in this third card we see that rich had just left him a comment on another summary dock for the same account now we can go into that meeting and answer rich quickly and easily yeah I saw your comment I respond to it was really helpful thanks for the nudge so that's one part of it this top row will suggest files and content you need intelligently and at so far the data in Kate's very successfully across our all of our testing one of our overwhelming top feedbacks is that users have just loved this the amount of time that saved them it's been immense so one part of it is okay what's the content I need this is here at the top of priority always servicing and calculating and making sure that you have the content that makes sense to you but another part of it is well if I only need ten or twenty files this month this week let's give you a way to collect those files in a way that's meaningful to you and that's workspaces workspaces a new concept in Drive and let you collect files the way that makes sense for you here you can see that Jeff has created one workspace on whiteboard strategy session let me zoom out a little more see if I can perfect he's had it three files in here from the strategy session we can zoom in and see him right here and if you want to he could add more by simply simply clicking add files and selecting items from the picker here on the side but also at the same time Jeff notices there's a suggestion here for him what we've done here is we noticed that Jeff's been working a lot with Sue in this case it's sue Peabody and she has there's six files that they've worked on and collaborated together and we used over eight different clustering algorithms to understand what files fit together and how and automatically make those suggestions to you and you can kind of see where this is going we can start to help you curate your content so you can focus on the work that really matters to you not on the overhead so here I might select a file add it to a to a workspace or save it but for now I'm just going to create a new workspace I want to create one about this account we were talking about outdoors and what I want to show here is I typed in outdoors and we ran those same algorithms and we quickly understand that oh the outdoors account well here's six files that you might might want to add to this because they seem to make sense together and I can select one or two of those and add them it's automatically made a workspace and it's done something really special here you can see it says add files so based on the files are in your workspaces we've run additional machine learning algorithms to understand what other files are relevant that you might want to add getting us a step closer to taking away that overhead that you that we all kind of suffer through so maybe I want to add the event list it gets added to this this workspace here to two pieces of data I'll share one on this card up here with the comments when people use priority and they use these cards on average they respond to comments ten minutes faster than they would otherwise that's ten minutes of that's the difference between going to a meeting uninformed or informed in workspaces when on this on this outdoors workspaces that I showed you here the add files people are adding files at 40% of the time already just launched but we're already at a level where we can understand how your content fits together in a way that makes sense for you that people are selecting to add files based on these suggestions 40% of the time so and then of course there's always projects that come and go you have the opportunity just to hide a workspace so you can you can stay focused on what matters and here you can see the hidden workspaces rest down here at the bottom and you can always recover or reopen those unhide you can imagine over time with the projects that come and go throughout your quarters and years how easy this makes it to organize your work in the way you think so very excited to show you share this with you will will end the demo all right can we go back in slides all right we did it live great okay so what have we heard today we heard I think three really powerful three powerful comments here that we think there's a better way to work and we think Drive can help you access that way to work that's a seamless interoperability collaboration that's simple and secure and lastly and with priority here we talked about how can we help you work smarter so naturally your next question is well how do I get this I wanted I want this how do I get it well we want to highlight something that we've shared with you before but really make sense in this context and that's drive enterprise drive enterprise is a standalone offering that includes Drive editors identity security and admin it packages it all all of it up together so that you can work slightly differently your organization can hopefully work better and what I want to note here is we talked earlier about this foundational issue about a lot of the other tools out there might have been born an architect in the 90s for an on-prem environment Drive is built from the ground up for the cloud we saw that with team drives we saw it with file file stream all this designed in a way to optimize your greatest asset your organization's knowledge and your time so another thing I want to impart so okay we have we have the package you can get Drive Enterprise you can start using it but what's it gonna cost you well I'm excited to say far and away if you take if you walk out of here thinking one thing I want you to know this it is the most affordable business model in the industry subtext by a longshot competitive products cost twenty twenty-five thirty dollars for a comparable feature set as you can see eight dollars and it's not just eight dollars it's eight dollars per active user per month and a dollar for storage of 25 gigabytes of storage what so let's unpack that a little bit when we say active user that's really important here because what happens today is that when you pay for unlimited you overpay you're paying for underutilized space you're effectively paying for other people's storage at times but with an active user consumption model you only pay for what you use so in reality that $8 number is actually much much less when it gets to your bill so we started off with competitors 20 25 30 starting point $8 but let's think about the factors that really go into what what that turns into for bills for for customers so first of all there's this you know most in most organizations 30% of actual seats are never used right so that means you in most situations you commit to this contract and you commit to the total number seats that you have well that doesn't always work out because the watermarks really high it's at the total number of employees you have yet not everybody uses those seat licenses well we didn't think that was fair we want to we want to charge you for the value we create and that's why we went to a model where you pay for only what you use second another consideration most 50 percent of organizations actually have work work first fluctuation seasonally maybe its retail staff going up and down again you commit to this contract with high watermarks you pay for all that regardless of whether or not you use it here with drive enterprise you only pay for what you use and now you're going well okay that's great but what about that bottom line the dollar for 25 gigabytes of pool storage I'm gonna need a lot of storage maybe but most likely not in most organizations the average user only uses maybe 20 gigabytes of storage all right that's 80 cents we're at it up to 25 minute a dollar you can understand why looks better on a slide so that concern about storage it's not necessarily built in reality all the time in fact at the 98th percentile people use less than 200 gigabytes of storage so this notion of a limited it really isn't it's really for a small percent of people maybe less than a percent right so this average this adds up easily to 75 percent savings over competitive products right you you could also quickly jump to that it's actually an order of magnitude maybe against competitive products and what I mean by that is we're just talking about the face level seat license cost there's a variety of other factors when you add it up and you do the math it makes it even cheaper one migration included for free with the product no per seat cost two years ago we acquired a bridge leading migration firm in the industry it's included in the seat license cost here second support costs you don't you know by comparison you might have high support costs won't be paying those the avoided or mitigated data breach risks you can take that out of the equation and then of course what we talked about the whole time the increased productivity when you add all of that up we believe that 75% numbers actually much higher and to get into that range and say compared to everybody else in the industry we're seventy five eighty five percent cheaper we're really proud of that and that we hope that you're really happy with it because it means we now have a product that fits your needs and is extremely affordable but you say AHA one more thing I already have the competitive product I don't want double pay well let me yeah I agree nay I say don't double pay if you have a competitive product we want you to know that you may qualify for a promotion and what what we mean by that is you will get Drive enterprise for free for the
