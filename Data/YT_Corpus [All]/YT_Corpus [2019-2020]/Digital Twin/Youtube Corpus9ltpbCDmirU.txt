 Welcome to Leaftech, the digital twin for proactive building control. Our data services enable your building to anticipate upcoming events and energy demands which saves up to 20 percent of CO2 emissions and utility costs. We analyze and anticipate the demands for all your building systems including cooling, heating, ventilation, illuminance, and shading. In order to anticipate upcoming demands, Leaftech first assembles all static information regarding your facility such as CAT or BIM models, 3D city models, typography models, or additional satellite scans. Combining and measuring these data points creates the first layer of Leaftech's digital twin. The second data layer of the digital twin combines all dynamic data points such as indoor room conditions, user schedules and user amount, and upcoming weather conditions. Merging these data points with the static data enables Leaftech to predict how much energy is required in different rooms or segments of the building. You can access your building's digital twin through Leaftech's web platform. It contains all relevant data layers regarding your facility and shows you which services are currently active. If we look into solar radiation analytics, for example, you can clearly see how diffuse, direct, or total radiation influence your building's energy balance. Based on this technology and the analytic results, you can order an analytic radiation reports, upgrade your shading control system with Leaftech's shading control data, or integrate the knowledge of upcoming solar radiation intake into your building automation system via API.
