 buildings are the hub of human activity they're where we work where we learn where we call home and they present a massive opportunity in our race for 2050 carbon neutrality our building stock produces about 40% of all of the UK's carbon emissions but is the only major infrastructure not to have a digital twin with hundreds of thousands of retrofits needed each year to meet our climate change targets we urgently need a better understanding of our building stock there is a solution with support from UK research and innovation UCL has developed the world's leading 3d digital model of the building stock it uses available data to construct a digital representation of buildings and how they use energy from single family homes to multi-purpose complexes thanks to 3d stock London already has its own digital twin which is driving targeted retrofits scaled up towns cities in the nation could quickly follow suit helping them combat fuel poverty and reduce carbon emissions and the model is becoming more powerful all the time around half of all buildings have an energy performance certificate and information from these is now included in 3d stock automatic calculation of the missing energy ratings fills in the gaps and releases greater value from this important resource harnessing these and other data sources improves our understanding of building energy use and helps us to plan for the best low carbon retrofit solutions 3d stock has the potential to inform policy create markets and support the delivery of Net Zero Carbon across the nation this is Britain's chance to lead the world in national digital twins
