 [Music] hi everyone welcome to Azure Digital twins powering the next generation of IOT this is our digital breakout session we're super excited to have all of you joining us today my name is Pamela Cortes i am on the azure product team and i will be your host for today I am here with our main speaker Christian he's one of my favorite people on the team and he is one of our partner PMS focusing on digital twins he's gonna give us all of the updates on Azure digital twins and what is digital twins so let's go ahead and get started if you're in chat feel free to ask questions throughout this presentation we're gonna try to answer them all through the presentation and QA at the end and so Christian we're hearing a lot about digital twins and how is this next new wave of innovation for IOT could you give us a little overview of what digital twins is and then also what is as your digital twins offerings sure Pamela thank you very much and welcome everybody so let me actually get to my first slide here a digital twin is a digital replica of real word things places business processes or people designed to understand control analyze and improve real-world business operations so today we're going to talk about agile digital twins our development platform for next generation your key solution to that model the real world and a little bit about the background of digital twins so using the power of IOT we have connected and monitored individual assets and machines for quite some time now IOT has made it possible to bridge the traditional gap between design models and real world products and that allows us to improve both products and customer experiences really this often involves many types of digital twins for example digital twins of an entire factory line that are used to improve the operation of the factory our customers really have also started building digital twins of the individual products that they make and share and these product twins really help designers and manufacturers to gain a lifetime view of their products literally from the drawing board from the design phase to pass the recycling board in the coming phases of digital twins we will take these capabilities beyond engineering optimization and beyond assets and enable customers to create rich models of entire business environments and eventually networks of businesses in a very holistic manner and this new generation of digital twins will combine traditional business data with a comprehensive model of many different aspects of reality in a single pane of glass as a transparent model of a business that can drive operations analytics simulations and optimizations of the general flow of business now today modeling and creating connected environments is quite challenging even for a sophisticated business and that brings us to as a digital twins as a digital twins is a developer platform for next generation IOT solutions that model the real world we were very shortly within the next few months release an exciting new preview of a traditional twins that brings our digital twins platform to a completely new level but why did you the twins in the first place let's talk about an example so as a commercial building manager you traditionally know very very little about the actual use of the building and as a result it is difficult to manage everything from energy consumption heating and cooling to space utilization efficiently so it really seems like a good idea to use IOT data to enable data-driven decisions in the building but it does turn out that raw IOT data is not all that interesting and informative to make sense of it we need context information we need to know what place they're given sensors measuring where is located what other sensors are around it and correlated to it and so on also really as a building manager you don't necessarily care about sensor readings at all what you really want to know is which spaces in the building are comfortable how the spaces are utilized how satisfied your tenants are with the waiting time in the cafeteria how efficient from an energy usage point of view your HVAC system operates and so on really what customers want is they want to reason about the word in terms that match their understanding of that word and this is really really important I wonder software solution that describes the word in my terms so what we need is a scalable design pattern that allows customers to create software models that represent their real words the building's floors rooms HVAC systems if you are building manager or power stations transmission lines and substations for energy grids or farms stables and maybe in cows for a farming solution and this design pattern is digital twins now one of the core goals for our digital twins is to allow developers to focus on adding business value and differentiation for their business instead of having to worry about building and operating complex distributed systems infrastructure at scale so in summary the upcoming ADT preview release is built around the ability to model your perspective of the real word an execution environment that is brought to life with data from IOT sensors using a built in event-driven data processing system and input and output connectivity so many of you may already have used our previous preview that we released quite a while ago the initial preview of a digital twins was very very focused on smart spaces we got great feedback validating many of the underlying design ideas and concepts but we also hear very loud and clear that customers wanted to use digital twins for applications and other domains beyond smart spaces so in response to that feedback we made quite a number of changes to Azure digital trends so where ADT preview one came with a hard coded ontology of entities for smart spaces topology system focused on the sort of hierarchical relationships tuned specifically for the building domain the new version delivers a flexible modeling system that lets you design your own custom types your own entities to represent the things and people that matter in your word it also lets you create complex graph topologies with much richer connectivity between the entities your model customers have also asked us for a more flexible compute model in the original preview than in the original preview where we let you run you know custom code as JavaScript functions in the new version you can use external compute for example Asha functions which makes it possible to use existing code libraries and additional programming languages and you get a much better debugging story on top in version 1 io T hub was integrated and somewhat hidden from you for the developer that made it hard for customers to use all the capabilities of IOT hub for device management in the way they wanted therefore in the new version you can bring your own IOT hub and you have full access and control over the hub in any way you choose and finally we did significant work on enabling solutions at a much larger scale so let's look at some more details of the new preview of ADT so real world environments in ADT are modeled as a topology graph the entities that make up the graph are called twins and each type of twin is described as a collection of properties telemetry commands relationships and components really at the heart of the graph building our relationships relationships define how individual twins can be connected to other twins I always like to think of relationships as the words between the nouns where each entity represents a noun for example buildings HVAC systems floors and so on the verbs are the connective fiber between right building has a flaw HVAC system to cool neighborhood a B and C or air compressor is built to customer relationships also can have properties which allows for real rich knowledge graphs to be constructed the way you've right twin definitions is using the digital twins definition language DT DL which is a simple language based on json-ld you see an example for a simple type definition here at the right on the slide once you have to find your custom vocabulary in Azure Digital twins you can create a graph of twins typically customers do this programmatically driving the topology for example with data that is already available in other databases for example a building information management system will actually show a customer example later in this talk for this in ADT also all data changes generate events for example incoming telemetry property changes in the graph the creation or deletion of twins or relationships all result in events that custom business logic can react to developers can then define event handlers for processing events within the graph and propagate data throughout the graph also very importantly ADT provides a very powerful query system that lets you extract insight from your modeled environment developers can feed the graph with data from external sources for example IOT hub as I said earlier unlike in the previous versions of digital twins the new version does not have a built-in IOT hub as a result it's much easier to attach ADT to existing IOT solutions and of course to exist xercise full control over the design devices you have and file management operations using the ADT REST API so it's also possible to drive ADT with data sources other than IOT for example you could create a connector for logic apps or other services that can represent routes that send selected data out to downstream services supported endpoints include things like event hubs event great service passes and typical use cases include for example sending data to cold storage in a data Lake to connect to machine learning or other analytic services like as a synapse or to do workflow integration with logic apps another important integration candidate is time serious insight that you can use to track data over time and apply historian analytics really it's important to think of digital twins as a developer platform that is there are no UI components that face end customers at this point digital twins UI is effectively api's for developers think of it as a model component in the sense of a Model View controller pattern that developers can use to drive any number of views such as maps for example or data overlays on 3d models or traditional dashboards overall digital twins is a platform as a service offering it's controlled using a rich set of REST API for public preview we have a c-sharp SDK available that you can use to program against it and for other languages you can currently use outer rest to generate a custom SDK and we will have official SDKs for Java JavaScript and Python coming in the near future there also is a parcel library that lets you validate and reflect over DT DL typical use case as a side of just validating DT DL on the client side I think such as passing the DT DL into an object model that you can use for example to create model driven UI you know from from the metadata of the models that you have let's switch gear a little bit and talk a little bit about customer use cases so ADT already is used in multiple business domains across a word a few example use cases edge technologies is a developer of a new generation of very very cool unusual commercial buildings designed to be both healthy for the humans that work in them and sustainable for the environment behind that sustainability and comfort of the buildings lies the smart building software platform that is built on Azure digital twins in a completely different domain wisata is all about manufacturing SN is V the SATA provides a platform for manufacturing automation and opt-in that is built on as a digital twins and that adds rich AI and data exploration capabilities to the mix Bosch Building Technologies provides solutions and services for commercial buildings the software solution is based on a traditional twins and is a great showcase for the power of semantic modeling in generating insight from raw data Willow leverages as a digital twins to deploy Willow twin it's a software as a service offering for real estate and infrastructure customers peopleo twin enables owners and operators of real assets to reduce their costs and improve operational efficiency and to better engage with occupants let's take a slightly closer look at visitors platform what I really like about it is how it demonstrates how Ridge domain specific visual authoring and operations experience can be built on top of the azure digital twins platform visit our software today is actively used for example in steel making plans to manage production processes with blast furnaces borsch a multinational engineering and technology leader pursues ongoing energy efficiency improvements for its customers and very importantly for itself Bosch has committed to a very aggressive date for being carbon neutral by the end of this calendar year to help with that Bosch developed an energy monitoring and management solution that is running on Microsoft Azure using Digital Trends to gain spatial understanding of all their IOT data with that solution Bosch customers can apply forecasts and predictive insights to make faster more informed decisions for improving their buildings performance and carbon footprint at Microsoft we also strongly believe that comprehensive digital twin solutions are a partner play where products from multiple vendors together provide a solution that is more than the sum of the parts to this end we are also part of the new digital twins consortium as a founding member there was a press release earlier during build announcing the foundation of that organization in this I just want to highlight two of the partners we are working with answers and Bentley systems physics based simulation has long been an essential part of the product design process helping engineers to optimize and validate design choices with the broad deployment of IOT sensors and products and the product environments it's now possible to apply that same simulation technology after a product has been built shipped and deployed in the field beyond you know like the design phase simulation technology can be used to optimize performance in the field to optimize energy usage predict failures in really accurate and immediate ways without some of the complexities associated with alternative techniques answers is the market leader and technical simulation software and their twin builder product lets engineers quickly deliver real-time simulation models for operational use with Microsoft Azure digital twins platform it's then possible to efficiently integrate the simulation cause the simulation based models into a broader IOT solution in the world of infrastructure development complex CAD data is the backbone of planning execution and operation of infrastructure Bentley systems create software towards CAD systems and so on for the creation and for the design of these infrastructure solutions and their I twin platform captures design geometry and metadata of the project in its environment if the source of truth that drives daily decisions throughout the entire life cycle of the product as a developer you can think of it as a github for CAD using a digital twins we can bring this backbone to life using raw and processed information from IOT sensors distributed throughout the infrastructure by bringing a wide range of information sources together into a comprehensive digital trends including CAD data real word scans photometry IOT sensor data weather feeds and many more we can really revolutionize the way infrastructure projects a planned built and operated um just a quick look at the overall architecture of a combined I twin and as a digital twin solution the I twin cost services at the lower left in the diagram I twin can take in data from a wide variety of CAD systems from different vendors and then apply a rigorous change management and a revision control process for the designs and whenever a particular revision is approved and when data changes an automatic export task now reads from my twin and automatically creates and instantiates all the relevant digital twins topology and ADT and from this point on ADT can receive and process all the incoming sensor data now ADT will push this data on to time serious insight for a temporal view it will also push the data to Bentley's open source I view a platform which allows customers to see the cat data from I twin with overlays from as a desert winds for the IOT data and other sources such as maps for backgrounds real word laser scans for complex environmental 3d geometry and so on and so forth all into a single 3d view that people can use you know to generate insight from the environment and to end this solution architecture provides an industrial-strength workflow to integrate a wide variety of data into a single efficient operational pane of glass so let's summarize our key takeaways digit wins an important component of next generation business solutions and connected environments the upcoming preview release of Ezzor digital twins is your development platform for next generation IOT solutions it's built around the ability to model your perspective of the real world and provides a rich execution environment that is brought to life with data from IOT sensors and other data sources accessible with powerful queries you get an event-driven approach to data processing and flexible connections to the outside world please stay tuned for a future announcement as I mentioned earlier the updated preview will be available within the next couple of months and with that I'll back to Pamela all right Thank You Christian for giving us that overview an update on the Refresh of azure Digital twins so I'm really excited for folks to get it their hands on this the Refresh v2 for public preview so we have a lot of great questions and chat so I'm going to go ahead and just say these questions to you Christian right throw some softballs at you and maybe I'll throw a couple of couple of hard ones for you so first question is will any features of digital twins come to Microsoft teams integration and then they also made a note they missed you since your expression bland presentation days yeah so the first question teams integration so and we are definitely looking at integration you know with the entire palette of Microsoft products and the office products especially Microsoft graph definitely a super interesting candidate there are tons of really exciting use cases we don't have anything concrete to announce right now on it but it's definitely in our roadmap and something we are very very interested in doing okay by the way if you have concrete scenarios that you would like to share with us we're always really really interested in input you know like that helps us to design you know what we're thinking of in the right way for you so that it really serves your needs and how would people be able to get in contact through the tech community or what would you recommend Christian if for folks you have feedback yeah I mean the all the general channels will work fine but people can also contact our p.m. alias that maybe you can put somewhere in the chat so that people have a way to have it and that's also a great place to to send us messages and let us know about your needs okay now the next question will this replace device twins and IOT hub or is this a superset of what is already offered there this is a really popular question ya know that is a great question so everything that is an IOT hub stays exactly the same it is and we do not assume that every user of IOT hub has to use digital twins in the future obviously we will be very happy if you do but you don't have to so the device twins in an IOT hub is a legacy feature that is very widely used and we certainly will continue to support that with IOT plug-and-play in IOT hub we add another layer of information about devices that we don't get through device twins basically plug-and-play is a means for developers to create self-describing devices and these self-describing devices make it very very easy to create software solution that automatically can adapt to the devices that are connected to IOT hub so think of basically plug and play as another layer on top of IOT hub and then as ur digital twins allows you to create a whole new word of modeled environments on top of these device representations that you have an IOT hub because of course plug and play devices are described in the same description language DT DL as the twins and a digital twins so there's a lot of compatibility in the API surface and in the way how you talk to them and all the concepts are beautifully aligned okay thank you and this question I've seen quite a bit actually in Sam session when he was giving the Microsoft IOT vision and roadmap and then also in our fire chat last night I do use will as your digital twins support running on edge for example our IOT edge one time what is their support looking like for for that so edge support is definitely on our roadmap we strongly believe you know like in the power of solutions that spend the intelligent edge and the intelligent cloud and we will not have edge support right at G a time it will come a little later but it's definitely on our roadmap and again same ask as before if you have particular scenarios how you would like to use digital twins on the edge please let us know and this will be very very valuable input to us okay the next one you know this is going to be a really popular question as well so all of those developers working with the v1 so when we announce as your digital twins a while back and folks are already working with it what is the migration path look like to get the capabilities in v2 will that have to be fully transition and then also are we still going to be supporting v1 yeah great question so we when will stay around for a little longer we will not retire version one or the first version of the the first public preview I should say until after GA of the new version but we will not keep it running infinitely so we do recommend all customers who have solutions built or have started POCs on top of the first public preview to migrate to the new public preview once it's available publicly and to transition onto it as fast as you can because all the future development will be on the new version okay and then we you know you mentioned the the graph Korean language earlier the question is what what is the graph query language the graph query language that we use is based on sequel it's a security elect that is similar to the sequel queries that are used in IOT hub with some extensions to Express graph queries to query relationships and to query through the topology okay perfect and then next question is what indoor mapping capabilities are supported is it just imagery or is there anything more intelligent is the solution entirely self-service or do you offer mapping as a service for users yeah so again what I said earlier digital twins itself does not have any UI components and does not have any built-in mapping capabilities itself but we do have a very powerful mapping component as a Maps and as a Maps has just announced that build their indoor mapping creation tools and we have already worked with them together very closely to make sure that you can use data from ADT very easily to push it into map visualizations and to drive if you know like the visuals of maps with data from from a digital twins so as a mapping component we strongly recommend to evaluate other maps because it's really a very powerful component to visualize a mapping information in conjunction with a digital twins and then one of the most important questions is when can people get their hands on this all of the the public preview refresh updates when can focus are play very very soon so it will take a little bit longer so stay tuned but within the next couple of months for sure and then the next question that you probably already know I was gonna ask was when is it gonna GA is that something where we're gonna share we're not going to share a concrete date but we're looking at the second half of this year okay perfect and it looks like we got time for a couple more service integration with our other products and services one that comes to mind is as your time series insights could you speak a little bit about that and that integration yeah so we've been working very tightly together with the time series inside team to make sure that it is very easy for customers to not just send telemetry data to Azure digital twins but also topology data so that you can use all the topology information that is thought and Azure digital twins to drive your time series inside hierarchies we we will definitely announce more about that as we go forward but time series integration is definitely very high on our list of priorities and there's a question about the the slides I'm what about those great 3d maps we saw earlier in the slides is that available is that a feature sorry which which 3d maps are you referring to I think in the presentation there was an imagery of maps yeah no sorry yes so the the 3d visualizations are basically part of client software that people have written on have written on top of as a digital twins so as I said earlier digital twins itself does not have its own visualization side it's a model component but people have used all kind of 3d platforms from unity3d to browser-based 3d to drive properties all 3d geometry with data from as a digital twins it's actually quite straightforward to do Thank You Christian really appreciate I think everyone for joining us and meet us at our future deep-dive January or June 29th and we're super excited for you to join us for future events thanks everyone thank you very much [Music]
