 len lease's one sydney harbor located in barangaroo and designed by renzo piano architects is one of the most luxurious development projects in australia and maybe even the world sitting at 70 stories tall with a wide variety of building services both design and construction introduce obvious complexities and coordination in addition more subliminal issues surrounding structural slab deflection over the construction period as well as over longer durations during the building's lifecycle are of concern in partnership with len lease digital and podium in our digital twin as a service solution offering cad makers is developing a digital twin for construction incorporating all disciplines from architecture structure and mepf into one fully integrated model in this video we'll be sharing a project update from our typical floor concrete slab deflection studies where we integrated finite element analysis output data from the structural engineering consultants here we're determining the short-term and long-term impact of the structural deflection on the various elements within the level through different construction timeline scenarios the luxury units on level 68 were selected as the units to study as this was the floor identified by the structural engineer as having the maximum deflection in particular for this project we studied the following [Music] this video will focus on the first study analyzing the impact of the deflection on the adequacy of ceiling space for the installation of services data for a single construction scenario the worst case of the service's install timeline is shown here starting with the finite element analysis output data we translated the deflection data into a mesh surface and heat map to visualize the structural deflection next we layer in the digital twin components of mepf interior architecture and exterior facade to identify areas of potential risk since we have building components incorporated into the model we can precisely identify areas where the deflection of the slab above will limit the space allocated to piping or ductwork equipment lights or other elements within the ceiling space here we can see a tightly packed ceiling space above the kitchen for one of the units where the addition of the structural deflection means there is insufficient space for the services from here we work with the gc and associated trades to assess the impact and identify solutions this is another example of a pinch point where one of the proprietary solvent or aerator fittings for the riser stack does not fit in the ceiling space taking into account the deflection at this location knowing this in advance the team has resolved this issue by ensuring we have an enlarged fire stopping sleeve to accommodate the fitting partially into the concrete soffit in addition to the ceiling space we also studied the finished floor to determine if the deflection of the slab would cause cracking of the large format stone tiling or an uneven finished floor over the building life cycle from including the facade fabricator's custom mowing profiles structural post tension cables and their associated over pull volumes no detail was spared in this project although the digital twin is beautiful in itself it's not just a pretty picture incorporating all details of the drop ceiling insulation and fittings we were able to pre-coordinate the project before mobilizing resources on site and work with the construction team to identify and incorporate solutions while this project is still ongoing our hope is that our digital twin solutions don't stop with just coordination with all the necessary equipment metadata incorporated into the twin per industry or client-specific standards this will soon be an as-built digital twin model that can be used for downstream operations and maintenance purposes this data can include model numbers operational data maintenance data and even spec sheets when sensor technologies catch up this data can be fed into the digital twin as well this is just a small preview of our digital twin capabilities and fly-throughs for this project if you like this video please like comment and subscribe and reach out to us if you're interested in learning more about how we can help de-risk and optimize your projects this has been ryan from cad makers thanks for joining us and we'll see you in the next video you
