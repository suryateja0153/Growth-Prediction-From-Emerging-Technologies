 welcome everyone and thank you for joining us today on this live webinar that digital twin technology now it seems that this is a popular buzzword right now but is it just another marketing label is a real value in what the technology has to offer process industries well you can be the judge after listening to this webinar this webinar is a collaboration between Yokogawa and KBC a Yokogawa company now I'm not sure if you're aware but KBC was founded in 1979 by Creek Krekorian John Bryce and pizza close and the name KBC was formed from the initial letters of their surnames in 2016 KBC was acquired by Yokogawa an integration of KB C's distinct consulting and software capabilities with Yokogawa's excellence and industrial automation field will ensure that we continue to deliver superior results for you our customer I would like to introduce our presenters Duncan MacLean and Kevin Fannin to you today Duncan is responsible for the business strategy and marketing functions of KBC a Yokogawa company as well as Yokogawa's North America business he is passionate about technology and the value it can unlock Duncan started his career in engineering industry with ammok where he provided health safety and environmental liability management advice on mergers and acquisitions covering upstream production assets refining and petrochemicals after moving to KBC he has held business management roles focused on business development strategy restructuring and planning kevin Finan is a system consultant at Yokogawa and has over 30 years of experience with oil and gas measurement process automation and SCADA systems he was previously an independent consultant serving the automation and measurement industries vice president of marketing for CSE semaphore and director of marketing at Bristol Babcock again welcome and thank you for joining us today please remember you can send in your questions and type them into the Q&A box at any time right let's get started over to you Duncan thank you Thank You Christy well good morning good afternoon and good evening everyone thank you for joining Kevin DNA on this webinar about digital twin now digital twins can't just be thought of as a nebula concept or abstract enabling technology they're an enabling technology in the journey towards autonomous operations so in this webinar we'll look at the journey towards autonomous operations and with that concept in mind focus on the digital twin in terms of what it is where does it exist what is the scope of insight derived the scalability of the digital twin what it's not how it can be hosted in the cloud or on-premise the potential business model impacts that this that the digital twin has and finally the value digital twins aren't all made the same so we'll focus on two case studies I'd like to open by asking everyone on this webinar one question as you seek to squeeze incremental value from your people processes technologies and physical assets are you guilty of just pursuing a faster horse or is there another perhaps better way your horse may have been serving you well over the years and we're pleased for that but will your horse carry you forward at the pace this new world we live in which is a lot more digital affords we look forward to sharing our passion on the other perhaps better way through the digital twin before we dive into the nuts and bolts of digital twins the pursuit and adoption of these technologies in the context of a digitalization journey driven by both internal and external factors the process industries drive towards semi and fully autonomous operations coupled with energy transition realities and pressures are forcing operating companies to seek digital platforms and fully adopt disruptive technologies as their normal way of doing business in their quest for superior results sustained as Christy mentioned Yokogawa along with its subsidiary KBC a Yokogawa company is digitalising the energy and chemical industry through a unique combination of domain knowledge and experience be a technical commercial or in operations technology be it AI IIT Digital twin and automation and thirdly through digitally wise and digitally savvy methodologies roadmaps and change management techniques but delivering superior results sustained does involve some subjectivity for a business that is at the low end of the operational excellence maturity spectrum as you see here success may be continued loss minimization whereas for a more operationally mature business towards the right success may be positive cash flow or repeats repeatable results you can see these at the base of each of the vulnerable accepting and structured pillars but irrespective of maturity effective progression on the journey from left to right involves accepting your current maturity deciding what the improvement ambition is ie the desired end goal for example is it the structured maturity pillar and then agreeing a realistic timeframe of which the improvement needs to happen what we found is things always take longer than you'd like it's often a multi-year process for coherent progression of all aspects of the operating model people processes technologies and physical assets the starting point of the evolution is always a set of high fidelity first principles based models of the business incorporated within a multi-purpose lifecycle simulation platform these are really the heartbeat of the business and provides situational awareness without them you're just guessing at the beginning of the journey towards the left hand side there are low levels of automation the plant is manually operated by a large front line workforce executing a collection of best practices supported by first principles models as the plant implements more and more manufacturing execution systems it becomes more automated and in doing so achieves a smaller front line workforce footprint who are primarily executing advice based actions in open-loop all the while the stability controllability and predictability of the plant is being enhanced for widespread adoption of closed-loop control and procedure automation ultimately in closed-loop optimization different parts of the energy and chemical industry are further along in this journey than others for example discrete discrete batch processes in specialty and fine chemicals have been able to advance faster than say refining liquefaction or other complex continuous processes key to the progression is the implementation of mes analytics AI and machine learning technologies through this process the plant becomes more empowered to run learn adapt and thrive in an increasingly dynamic business environment so you're probably wondering where does the digital twin fit in what is interesting about the previous illustration is that each progression towards autonomous operation involves evolution in how decisions are made a digital twin is a decision support tool that enables improved safety reliability and profit and profitability in design operations it is a virtual digital copy of a device a system a human or process that accurately mimics actual performance in real time there's executable and can be manipulated allowing a better future to be developed so to be a virtual digital copy of a device human or process means that the digital twin can exist at any level within the traditional is a 95 architecture and be scalable to integrate with other components in subsequent slides I'll make further reference to the scalability of the digital twin as will my colleague Kevin as far as scope of insight is concerned digital twins work in the present mirroring the actual human device system or process in simulated mode but with full knowledge of its historical performance and accurate understanding of its future potential in this way the digital twin allows the full scope of hindsight insight foresight and oversight to be delivered but why is this important well it allows understanding of what is happening or has happened it allows an understanding of why it has happened and then switching to the future what will or might or can happen and lastly what should happen and this is not just about a bunch of graphical dashboards it goes well beyond that to incorporate first principles models so let's move away from conceptual and theoretical to real delivered value will do this through two case studies one involving a subsea production system feeding an FPSO the other involving a 55,000 barrel a day FCC in refining the concepts and realities are equally applicable in petrochemicals too let's start with the upstream example so reservoir fluid characterization on the seabed KB C's multi flash software can be used to provide a digital twin of the reservoir fluid phase behavior under different pressures volumes and temperatures this is vital for assuring the integrity of line fluid flow building on the multi flash-based digital twin is a twin representation of the entire subsea production network of whatever complexity including wells chokes flow lines and a wide range of processing equipment this is done using Maximus with the multi flash twin capabilities natively integrated into the more expansive Maximus model of the production system flow across the whole network can be optimized building yet again on the multi flash and Maximus models is a representation of the entire production system including topside facilities and power generation be it an FPSO or offshore platform the incorporation of power generation is absolutely key because power generation systems apart from constituting a major variable cost drive a number of critical production processes such as compression systems oil export pumps and utility systems offshore powers offshore power generation systems of 5,200 megawatts are not uncommon the challenge with offshore power generation is that the power generation feedstock is also the product for export in order to ensure power generation resilience there's a need to better understand production dynamics in conjunction with power generation the petrol sim model incorporating multi flash and Maximus allow matching of power generation - well deliverability which is worth a lot of money as we'll see on the next slide how much money in short one hundred and eighty million dollars per annum for this particular case the asset comprise just over 20 Wells feeding a self-powered fpso the FPSO had a capacity of 90,000 barrels a day of oil 10 to 20 million cubic feet per day of fuel gas handling and treated water injection rates of up to 30,000 hours a day matching well deliverability to topside power generator and compressor availability in a single model environment was able to boost FPSO production by nine thousand barrels a day these results involved no capex investment use onboard equipment only and matched subsurface to surface pressure and flow first time power production balance was implemented resulting in a new production regime with altered production rates driving significant incremental value as you see here as I move on to the next slide I won't spend a lot of time on these but I would like to point out how in this first screenshot you'll see how well models and subsurface templates along with FPSO trains power generation and on-board compressors were represented in an integrated manner cumulative and system-wide production dynamics were able to be rigorously represented this next slide shows a little bit more detail when you drill down into the individual system components with a lot more detail available which obviously you can't see through this screen but each of these components can be drilled down a lot further lastly the chart on the next slide shows the nonlinear relationship between pressure and flow at different turbine intensities without the model the nonlinear relationship would not have been apparent and the optimum operating conditions would have been a lot more difficult to observe that's all I'm going to cover on this case study but if you'd be interested in receiving a more detailed write-up on this please email me at Duncan McClung at us Yokogawa comm so this nick's case study i realize not everyone plays in the upstream world so switching to downstream and specifically a 55,000 ballad AFCC unit this is a key unit as many of you know in around 50% of refineries worldwide for converting heavy gas oil vacuum gas oil or residue feedstock components into significantly higher value products the problem today is that the tools used in the roof in the refinery in this case the FCC to forecast economic performance are not necessarily conducive for use by the engineers actually operating the plant and who are responsible for delivering the operating plan this case studies about how over a million dollars per year can be made through much tighter monitoring of youth unit performance by comparing actual unit performance with high fidelity model simulated and the LP on the next on this chart on the next slide the actual performance is in red the simulated plant performance using high fidelity models is in blue and the yellow line is the LP model of the plant it's clear the best representation of the plant comes from the first principles models so it makes sense to use these for more of the operating decisions on the front line for identifying profit opportunities and reoptimize encapsulating benefit of the LP is its speed enhancements in compute power and multi-threading of first principles technologies is making them increasingly ripe to be used for more of the optimization decisions this particular example involves an FCC the same can be scaled for other units around the refinery of particular interest in today's and business environment being say the hydro cracker and the coca for bottom's conversion so far I've mentioned simulators models and digital twins are these the same no models exist in the context of traditional simulators as well as digital to but traditional simulators are different to digital twins the best analogy of a traditional simulator is a traditional calculator inputs are punched in manually for a particular calculation the result is a static snap snapshot in time and the result is available to only but a few people who are standing around the calculator or consider on the other hand a digital twin is an accurate representation over its full range of operation all the time with the history captured for say data mining as well as the future for what if what's best and what's next analyses instead of being manual it's automated and the outputs are democratized or can be democratized much more easily across the organization for joined up thinking and action across silos but what does the digital twin look like in practice what's an example and I'll show you on the next slide it simply involves a high fidelity model of the asset built say using petrol Sun so that can include upstream production facilities LNG gas processing plants refineries olefins and aromatics units models built are then fed real-time production data from the assets DCs historian and lab system and by the way this is not difficult to set up the application of complex first principles physics and chemistry based algorithms to DCs historian and lab system data in real time opens up phenomenal new insights for supply chain optimization and production management but instead of the gems of insight remaining siloed to the engineers running the model what's key is they liberated to the rest of the organization with both the the PI system and the petro sim-based twin always remaining aligned now this is a game-changer for driving convergence in decisions and actions across engineering operations and other consumers of data from the OSI soft system and other plant technologies that feed in and feed off that so with that in mind that's just one example I'm gonna hand over to my colleague Kevin who's going to talk to you about a few others Thank You Duncan we do offer a broad portfolio of digital twins with widely varying purposes and I won't describe all of them but should mention those that perhaps you might not expect for instance enterprise insight is a digital boardroom that comprises a series of business and financial KPIs which are updated in real time as part of an enterprise wide balanced scorecard the underlying KPI calculations combine simple dashboarding of measured parameters with integrated logic that could be linked to other digital twins that optimize the process energy consumption in the supply chain you might see where we're going this but I'll explain some of the other digital twins first capability assurances the suite of digital twins that includes a human knowledge twin which captures work processes those can be tracked and manipulated in real time they comply with is a 106 modular procedure automation for example one of our customers implemented modular procedural automation by putting their best operative practices on paper not exactly digitalized but still a quantum leap over the prior standard operating procedures but then they did digitalize them to take advantage of change management then further that deployment of digital twins for all of the work processes has minimized the learning curve for incoming users and it vastly improves validation of operating scenarios there's also a safety time I'll describe in a minute operator training simulation or OTS digital twins substantially enhanced earlier model-based in inferential LTS implementations through artificial intelligence and real-time enablement OTS digital twins work seamlessly with human knowledge digital twins to completely optimize all human aspects in the enterprise now the automation and control integrity digital twins use digital copies of the live planning in all processes and all automation algorithms they allow engineers to conduct fundamental process control tests at their workstations they include any proposed adjustments before they apply them to the life process is an example a customer wanted to see the interactions not only within the controller but exactly how the process responded to changes in the application code a safety instrumented system digital twin also uses a digital copy of the life plan and processes but incorporate safety logic in place of the process control logic now keeping up on certified functional safety management policies is a big issue safety systems change over time Duncan earlier mentioned the hindsight insight foresight and oversight the digital twin provides those have turned out to be key to maintaining that functional safety certification as the safety system involves now in addition all these digital twins could be combined like the safety instrumented system and automation and control integrity difficult winds could be combined for both integrated process control and safety also a combination of the safety digital twin and the human knowledge digital twin mentioned earlier provides full safety visibility including future scenarios to an operator and the management team now we can describe the other digital twins further in QA or even afterward if you want to contact us via email I think they're probably more in line with solutions you'd expect from Yokogawa and KBC that is evolutions of the simulation technologies that Duncan described earlier so again this portfolio digital twins can operate independently or together providing a single version of the truth but now the question is where will that lead our view of it is digital nirvana contemporary digital twin technology's evolving in a way that is leading to a single multi purpose digital twin instead of multiple digital twins each of which serves a different purpose the single digital twin encompasses today's multiple digital twins in a supplier agnostic manner and it aligns all assets and the value chain ubiquitous data sources replace the ad hoc siloed data to provide a completely coordinated and connected environment to illustrate a typical situation subject matter experts use their domain knowledge to operate the plan and then they combine that with facilities simulation technology for process and production optimization the models built are placed online and they're fed with real-time operations data instead of a simulator that creates a digital twin delivering real-time insight and augmented we're needed with insight from beyond the plant rather than simply data as a service that in turn enables outcomes as a service so we've just mentioned the cloud so far but a running the digital twin in the cloud does shift the business model sometimes substantially by the way in the cloud the digital twin not only serves the entire enterprise but can also engage subject matter expertise and technology from outside the corporate boundaries that could be vast external data feeds and analytics expand your agility and radically reduce infrastructure costs this enables new business models that best exploit the subject matter expert domain knowledge and simulation technologies to provide bi-directional added value now that's between corporate assets central or remote operation centers support teams and third parties it also enables third party suppliers to offer outcome as a service again for example instead of a catalyst the partner third party supplier could offer catalyst performance as a service so now I'll hand it back over to Duncan to conclude with where the digital twin fits in and how it is delivered through a discipline roadmap thanks Kevin so on this next slide if these are the four main pillars of your operating model in terms of your people physical assets systems and practices where does the digital twin fit in well it sits at the interface or of people and the physical assets being or to be operated as I mentioned earlier it is a decision support tool it's where each of the attributes meet where significant value can be unlocked where people interact with systems it's important that the right data is available it's clean it's supported by the technology infrastructure it's made available in a way that it is actionable and that the the people to act on the data are competent where systems interact with practices the technologies in place need to support execution of business processes to deliver the hindsight insight foresight and oversight often this is often this information is sufficient to guide day-to-day frontline actions of operators however to really understand the implications of these possible actions more rigorous tools are needed for decision making to be able to accommodate what if what's next and what's best analyses particularly where as I mentioned previously nonlinear relationships may exist so it's here that digital twins and first principles models are of the highest value lastly to actually move the plants operations so say decisions have been made the actions need to be taken on the front line at the interface of practices and systems initially operational execution or moving the plant is done manually based on best practices and then moves to open loop and closed loop - procedure automation and eventually closed loop optimization as I mentioned before this doesn't happen overnight and it does take a phase progression but a deliberate progression all of this underpins the KBC digitalization roadmap which involves initially ensuring readiness moving on to situational awareness and only once these two epps have been accomplished should the digital twin be considered for implementation because as I mentioned previously when we were saying we'll what's the difference between a traditional simulator and a digital twin if you are going to be automating this then readiness is absolutely vital before you start to try and automate and lastly the final two steps beyond this involve execution and sustainment the twin makes this significantly easier with that said I'm going to hand back to Christie but before doing that I hope that if you are or have been guilty of pursuing a faster horse please consider the digital twinners perhaps a better more valuable way of achieving your business goals if you'd like it a more detailed write-up of the thinking behind the digitalization roadmap again please do email me at Duncan McClure met us tokugawa comm and lastly Kevin did make reference to the different types of digital twin please do look out for other digital twin webinars that will be running as part of this digital twin series these will be focused on the more specific twin technologies and their application and value and so with that back to you Christy thank you thank you so much Duncan and Kevin for that fascinating presentation and it's really great to hear about the two case studies and and real-life examples of where digital twin technology is bringing value to the process industries right we're going to look at the Q&A now so if you would like to send through your questions please type your question in the Q&A section and send it to all panelists our first question received you stated that digital twins accurately mimic actual performance in real time how do you define real time Kevin do you want to tell us more about this real time is relative to the speed of the process the key point that it is is supposed to historical and it has to use sufficient resolution in terms of time to capture process dynamics for example turbomachinery requires a resolution in terms of tens of milliseconds flow processes are typically about one second and a level or temperature processes are slower they could be in multiple seconds or even minutes thank you Kevin a second question received our digital twins either real-time or historical but not both they are both the digital twin works in the present marrying the actual human device system or the process in simulated mode but it has a full knowledge of his historical performance and an accurate understanding of its future potential in this way the digital to analyze the full scope of hindsight insight foresight and oversight to be achieved thank you and we will gather up the rest of the questions and answer them by email we appreciate the hosts Kevin and Duncan joining us today thank you very much and thank you for joining us we look forward to having you on another Yokogawa webinar in the future everyone have a good day thank you so much
