 [Music] whether you're looking to design a production line from the ground up or centralize your planning data cadmaker's delmia digital twin solution offering on the 3d experience platform is the way to go the first step in the cad makers process planning design assist service is to distribute product cad parts into a modularized manufacturing bill of materials structured with a logic that is intuitive and flexible once we've built the m-bomb we can begin process planning we leverage the power of ekl 3d experience's native scripting language to automatically create a library of processes and agreements with the mbom modules cad maker's modular approach to process planning allows for the creation of multiple variants of your process plans optionary in this way allows for the testing and validation of different production scenarios minimizing the time your engineers spend on rework this too has been simplified using automation at this stage the product build sequence can be simulated for viewing and validation purposes or exported to tabular form useful for internal distribution automation also allows us to rapidly create 3d layouts corresponding to each process plan option you're considering when comparing multiple production scenarios a process plan and a 3d model of each can be used in your assessment delmia is capable of detailed installation simulations for the most delicate of operations within the context of your factory environment this gives you insight into the types of tools you need and how specialized equipment will interact with your line and the products it will handle delmia's robotic capabilities can also be called from your process plan for those operations that require automation process planning data can also be used in combination with delmia's work instructions app to create and update build books for use by assembly operators typical and custom data managed in your delmia process plan can be exported for use by other stakeholders which can be especially useful for pushing data to systems like your mes or your erp if you're interested in learning more about our process planning services or more information about the 3d experience platform please visit the link in the description below
