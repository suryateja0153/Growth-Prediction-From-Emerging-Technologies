 Efficient engineering is one of the essential pillars of the COMPLETE line system. Nowadays it is not worth mentioning that efficient engineering is equate with digital engineering. Therefore, the comprehensiveness of digital product data is mandatory. Today Sophia Bulmahn visits me to give me a brief insight on that topic. Hi Sophia! Everybody talks about the digital twin – but what does this mean exactly? If you think about a physical product like this here there is a lot of things that we can see from the dimensions but also things that we know from the production process. We put that into digital data, so it is available through all of the systems. What kind of digital data does Phoenix Contact offer and where is it available? We offer a lot of different data for example CAD data which are for 3D models or CAE data for CAE systems like EPLAN, WSCAD, Zuken and of course classification data for ecl@ss basic and advanced. You can find it on the product detail page but there is also a page for master data that is available on our homepage and of course you can find the CAE data in the portals of the CAE systems. How does this digital data enable a continuous workflow in control cabinet building? If you think about how many people are actually involved in building such as control cabinet, we have planning engineers, but we also have also people working there together in production and to make this really efficient you need the continuous data workflow in between these units and that makes it efficient and therefore it is necessary. During the next weeks we will take a closer look at the planning and marking software PROJECT complete to see how the process Sophia described works out in detail.
