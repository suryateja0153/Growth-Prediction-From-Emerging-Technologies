 The digital twin is a virtual model representation that allows data analysis and system monitoring to streamline operations and generate actionable intelligence. By pairing the physical and virtual world, the Abyssal platform integrates an ecosystem of applications. It combines data and intelligence to represent the structure, context and behavior of its physical counterpart. All the Abyssal applications are connected through a cloud infrastructure, that reads and integrates relevant data such as imagery, 3D models, survey information and documentation, from third party systems. All data is kept securely in the Abyssal Cloud and is accessible to all platform applications. The Abyssal Designer provides engineers with an enhanced 3D digital view, accurate GIS positioning and contextualized data of the subsea environment. Teams can collaborate in the 3D field layout design, perform accurate feasibility studies and reliable risk assessments. All data generated in the Designer is securely synchronized and correlated with the digital twin. The asset geometry data, physical and environmental properties available in the platform, allow the creation of realistic simulations. The Abyssal Simulator is a 3D rendering engine with accurate physics simulation models. Virtual scenarios are driven by integrating real world information. Engineers can perform Virtual System Integration Testing while planning procedures, assessing the  feasibility of subsea tooling tasks, performing accessibility  and maneuverability studies, executing constructability reviews and identifying opportunities for increased efficiency. Operation planning teams no longer need to execute these tasks on the field, drastically reducing cost, time and risk. All data generated in the Simulator is synchronized and correlated in the Cloud infrastructure, further enriching the Digital Twin with created procedures, planned operations, simulation results and simulation videos. The Digital Twin data also enhances real time operations. The Abyssal Offshore is a real-time monitoring, navigation and management tool for offshore operations. Based on 3D visualization, GIS and augmented reality technology, it provides operators with a live 3D overview of the operations environment, increasing their overall visibility and spatial awareness. The real-time visualization of the 3D environment coupled with the Augmented Reality feature, improves safety and efficiency in navigation, and eliminates any downtime due to low visibility. The ability to create virtual flight paths and virtual safety areas enhances real-time communication and collaboration, reducing risk in response times. The capability to connect to any Asset Integrity Management System and enable the visualization of historical data and performance metrics of subsea assets, improves both safety and reliability. Additional features like the  advanced Video Recording System, Digital Dive Logs and instant Reports, allows Engineers, Pilots and Supervisors to focus their time on value-added tasks. The live connection to the platform enables the correlation of real-time telemetry, video and divelogs. Abyssal Command Center provides onshore personnel with a real-time 3D overview of the entire operations environment, through the use of cloud and satellite communication technologies, increasing their overall knowledge of the operation and allowing them to act either in emergency response or in routine situations. The Cloud infrastructure offers fully web-based functionality to any compatible browser, providing Abyssal’s Engineering and Operational applications to anyone, anytime, anywhere.
