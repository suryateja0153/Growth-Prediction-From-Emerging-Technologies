 cat maker's robotics cell design assist services provide your manufacturing engineers new levels of insight into their projects whether you're programming offline to minimize production interruptions or to validate a cell before installation we can help the first step in CAD makers body and white cell design assist service is to virtually replicate the workstation using DXF drawings layouts and a pre-existing library of simulated robots we can recreate your cell and 3d experience we can also capture 3d scans to use in place of or as a supplement to traditional inputs we then add kinematics and control functions to any custom end of arm tooling utilized in the cell this can include building spot weld profiles by buying parameters like weld depth and pressure to be referenced in the simulation next the spot weld point operations are recorded as targets on the workpiece and a reach study is performed to ensure all assets are sized and located correctly this data can be exported as a CSV and manipulated and re-imported if needed once all tags have been defined they're linked together in a sequence to create a robot program at this stage the program can be played through to identify any clashes between the robot the end effector the workpiece jigs and fixtures or anything else in the environment [Music] fine tuning robot motion profiles happens next in joint limits are checked speed and acceleration plots are monitored in those cases where robots are handling heavy payloads final deliverables typically include videos and pictures of the simulation reports containing graphics and key figures relevant to the scope and robot program are exported in any major robot manufacturers language such as cuca or Phaneuf for immediate deployment our digital twin capabilities are not limited to body and white spot welding they also include pick-and-place operations welding an adhesive bead applications dispensing from a stationary unit or an end effector as well as spray applications and milling [Music] please reach out if you'd like to learn more about CAD makers and our robot related services you
