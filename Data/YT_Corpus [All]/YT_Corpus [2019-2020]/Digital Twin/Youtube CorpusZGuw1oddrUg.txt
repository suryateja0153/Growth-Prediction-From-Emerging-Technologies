 hi all I'm Dan Smeg rod founder that we get around that work forum today is Wednesday May 20th 2020 and you're watching wgan TV live at five our topic today matter port digital twins for facilities management we have a subject matter expert on our show today if the provision solutions VP business development James Duffy hey James good to see you again Dan great to see you again thank you for having me yeah you bet James has been on our show twice before talking about one show dedicated to matter port for as Bilt's and a whole nother show for matter port for a weekly construction documentation James Before we jump into matter port digital twins for facilities management how about giving me an overview of if the provision solutions yeah thanks a lot Dan so you know if T has been e like a solutions provider utilizing matter port cameras and you know with our technician base of three hundred technicians across the United States and Canada and we provide enterprise-level solutions for commercial companies that have a lot of spaces and need consistent deliverables across the country - terrific I'm curious about how if the pro solutions actually ended up in this business of having 300 matter port service providers you asked Canada how did that happen so the nice thing is we we understood there was a need out there and our company has been around for over 20 years doing another service concrete moisture testing for a lot of these national retail chains and we saw a need for visibility beyond just camera photos and basic surveying so we did our due diligence and research and we found matter port cameras as a great solution not only for the visibility Pro can provide but also with the point cloud and basically our project manager an ability to create you know accurate CAD plans from them and everything so we have a business model that we knew how to grow a network and a task force that can live and do the quality control efforts that we have and we spent the last couple of years building that up to you know really be you know nationwide and you know a two-hour drive from anywhere okay terrific let's jump in Madhupur digital twins for facilities management I'm a matter port service provider I've been scanning residential real estate what what is what our facility facilities and what is what is facilities management yes so facilities and facilities management for a lot of these enterprise level places so places that have multi brand sites so you know it could be a dozen it could be hundreds it could be thousands where they have to manage multiple assets so they obviously can't be at one place all of the time so they have to rely on organized information to help them with two things predictive information because as soon as you have a space it is going to deteriorate over time so they all have a life cycle and also reactive work of something happened at the facility whether it be you know something that's naturally occurring like you know the paint is getting worn and it's time for a refresh or something with a busted pipe and they have to figure out who's the right vendor to help fix something so basically keeping the machine which are the physical space is humming is what facilities management is okay I thought it might be helpful if we took a look at an actual example and I thought we'd start out on your website I'm it you know how to find it thank you I'm at provision dot IFT i.com and I selected the tab for facilities management so I'm going to scroll down on the site to a matter port tour I'm gonna go ahead and launch that tour and perhaps you could tell us what we're looking at for this space what what is this space yeah so this is a mechanical room in a very large industry company building and what you're looking at is all the makings of what make a building operates so from electrical to plumbing to pressure so everything that is there that allows you to make you know your normal everyday life happened this is the mechanical room which is kind of the heart of any building that's there so this is larger than others and one of the uses which is there is there's turnover amongst facilities people and there's vendors that need to service things and it's never the same person over and over again so the hard part is understanding what is there and having intuitive documentation so the nice thing is by getting a scan of the space you're clear of what is where and the nice thing is you can utilize the matter tags for documenting what you're what it is you're looking at and not only doing that but taking it a step further you can also embed any of the manuals you can embed video of how to utilize something so any of that knowledge that's there you can actually embed right there in the space so you can be looking at it right in front of you but also looking at it on your phone to have a clear understanding of what that is in real time and you know the main thing is to prevent any sort of gap in communication of what's supposed to be done and what's there so either while you're there or from your desk so every building I go into I never see that but there there is a mechanical electrical plumbing Center that looks like this same size bigger or smaller that's right just think about your home you have a boiler you have an electrical they might be separated or they might be in a closet somewhere so the bigger they are like everything goes to scale okay and so about maybe if we could list the the kinds of documentation that matter port matter tags facilitates would what are the different things that can they come to mind that are helpful to label yeah so it changes in every client is unique of what information they're already capturing in some way that is effective for them but what we've seen for a lot of our customers one of the simplest that's most utilized is the electrical panels so when you're scanning a space like a tip is you'll get it most of the time the panel is closed well if you take another step and scan it over a second time with the panel open then not only the facilities management can understand what's inside and they could read the labels of what's there but that also helps them communicate to the electrician of what kind of voltage is their amperage what can fit into that space so by able to not only scan it a second time with it open I'm also taking out your phone and embedding a picture because if you notice with the matter like you no matter port camera it has clear definition but it cannot read within a millimeter of chicken scratch that somebody wrote eight years ago but your phone probably could so make sure you bring your phone when you're going out and working and capturing what's in the inside the panel as well and usually on the on the inside part of the door there's something they call a schedule so that gives you all the information there might be multiple plate pages so usually taking those out and giving that full documentation for what all the information that is there for the electrical panel is what a lot of customers and facilities managers will need that would be like the most obvious one okay so I understand in a space that we just looked at electrical plumbing mechanical commonly referred to as MEP uh I can understand that we have matter tags that let you label the those things and you mentioned in one case the electrical panel what is it what are the different uses of all these things that we might label with information right so the clear thing is think about what they were using it before how are they documenting the space and that will give you a better understanding so before how they would label a place would just be imagining in a file folder of I have a floor plan and these are all the pieces of equipment that are in there and then may be attached to that is a manual of what it is but what it doesn't give you is the condition of it in real time with with that scan so what you're doing is taking those things that used to just exist in a file holder and may or may not be organized into something that is organized because it is the space of where it is so you're transferring over it from a process-oriented in a you know in a folder system to also having that digital twin of a living documentation and you know providing all the same information of manuals out to with also the addition of you can overlay and add video to it as well so you can even talk about how you're supposed to operate something okay let me see if I can go through a list and and maybe have a conversation around some of these items planned renovation so is it is it typical that a an MEP room like this might have a piece of equipment that gets added gotta know what the size of that space is and the person who needs to know that information may not be on site maybe literally in a different state so is or is the matter port tor the digital twin documented and then having this measurement capability does that help in terms of if there's some renovation plans getting some key measurements is that an example of a of a use case it doesn't quite jump out of a file folder system versus the digital twin yeah it is a nice it is a nice feature to have that measuring tool right there to kind of let you know in real time what space is available for say if you had to pull some an old piece of equipment out and they've changed the way it's shifted in a space and you know they leave as you saw in the example that we have there is a little room right no one is wasting space anywhere so getting a chance to figure out what fits and what's there and you know the nice part of the capabilities is of the room you might need a new as built for the new as is conditions because the floor plan they might have is well this is what the space looked like when it was empty well now this is what it looks like when it's filled so what's left and how they can reorganize it so the nice thing is not only just having that visual but you know on the back end you can also get them upgraded as is drawings of what's in the space so how they can basically reimagine it ah so that's that that would refer back to the show that we did previously on as built so you're a matter poor digital twin literally is an as-built where the matter port matter packed data can be exported and and then an architect can bring that into a CAD program like Revit in order to reimagine the space and add some other piece of equipment to this space correct yes so but at a at a very basic level there's there some level of hey I'm I'm in Chicago the the room I'm looking at is in Atlanta I can virtually walk around the space and get some sense about whether we're going to have some room or not have room for something even to take it to that renovation stage to figure out how we're going to add another water tank or whatever it might be that's right so they would have that information and the nice thing is to think about for our customers it's highly unlikely that we would go into a space and just scan one room we would be capturing the whole asset and then what we would do is kind of real able and make sure like that facilities management they know where the mechanical room is and then that they can ask that like you know document what is there so it is like it's the value that's already there and you know most likely you know they're not just asked we're not tasked to just do like a unit task or thing of just one thing of capture everything and help us with the solution for our needs but then we have all this other added value mm-hmm you mentioned turnover of staff and at the same time I think you mentioned a little bit about maintenance schedule so would it be typical to document a space on oh this device here it needs to be serviced every six months this one needs to be serviced every three months this one needs to be serviced a year here's the vendor that does that service here's their phone number their email their contact the the last reference point of contact so is ongoing maintenance is that part of the documentation for for MEP so it's usually done where we've seen it as not adding so this is more on the customer and once they have it well like you know of becoming a collaborator they can constantly reimagine the tags as it goes through time because if the space hasn't changed but the information has you know enable them like help them understand how to do that themselves but when you're starting off and you're giving it to them you know they can already just add and then add in that information to the same thing to keep the schedules there but all the critical information that isn't going to go anywhere with that space like who would call how to operate something the manual like all of those things should be curated with that piece of machinery because none of those things regardless of who's there is going to have to tackle the problem the same way so having those basic foundations of information living on it are the you know most critical and and and I think you solved a problem that I hadn't anticipated but I was kind of scratching my head going oh my gosh I don't know anything about this equipment I mean I know I can add matter tags the label but what that thing is I'd have no idea so the good news is using the the matter port collaboration feature is really to invite the client to collaborate and teach them how which is not that hard to add matter tags so that that they're the ones that curate what they want to do in terms of labeling that's right so and a lot of a nice customer service feature it's kind of depending on everyone's bandwidth of what they can do and can't do is you can help them up saying hey give me an inventory of what you need documented and I can do that for you or you know let's get the space and I'll show you how to do it yourself okay and you can customize it that way yeah maybe a combination but back to kind of this this list I mentioned for for renovations ongoing maintenance we touched on I think training the I guess I can imagine a room like this touches a lot of different departments within a building within an organization electricals different than the group that works on plumbing yes they're different than the group that works on mechanical so I I guess the part of what this is doing is aligning the different groups through common a common way to communicate about a space that's right so if you're always thinking of the asset lifecycle so when it when the company or the owner has the building for that lifecycle facilities management is the / is the cup is the department that's in charge now if they're going to remodel or redesign a space it went from facilities over to architecture and design well then they'll manage the reconfiguration of the space and get new vendors electricians plumbers to help that unfurl it but for the living things of keeping them going they would want to keep who are the people that serviced this equipment at the ready and when you have that space you can document their work of how they do it so if you've ever tried anything at home or try to there's always like jiggle something this way or explain it in a nuanced way you can embed that information that would be lost and you would start all over again every time you can capture and curate that information in a scan in a way that you've never could otherwise and I think it's a real change factor that prevents like you said that staff turnover or getting a you know a good vendor one day and making sure they can replicate that results another time that it needs service things like that you mentioned that the the digital twin for a facility is well it's new and it replaced I guess I never really thought about well how does a facilities manager keep track of everything and so if it previously has been done with file folders in in notes what's wrong with that process why shouldn't all the manuals be in a file cabinet why why not in a file folder so what what problem is matter poor digital twin for facilities management solving so really you what it's really solving is a bottleneck so the curator who's owning all that space that put them in the folder while you're leaving it there while you're relying on that person to make sure that that information gets disseminated each time for all of these spaces and the timing a lot of these things is critical because a majority of facilities management is reactionary rather than proactive and that's what all that information is the nice thing is if you can give time back to those facilities managers of instead of just having the curated information of what a building is but no context by then being able to manage and not only understand what's there but see the condition understand what's going on you're giving that company more and more time to make predictive information and give like facilities management a leg up to say wow looks like on 70% of our facilities that the paint is deteriorating more quickly than we thought let's hire a vendor we'll paint all the facilities again or you know the electric is due on a bunch of facilities and it looks like you know we're going to add some more features which we're going to need to up our amperage like by you being able to visualize that and see where the reality is it's going to give you a leg up on making better decisions for the future rather than just waiting for a problem to fix it mm-hmm I understand using matter port for construction documentation is that would would an MEP room mechanical electrical plumbing room be rescanned more than once I could see it happening where you would want to as the as the site changes and as you add in different machinery I would definitely see a reason because what you don't want to have is outdated information so the the the capability is so readily available that you would want to enable your customer that is doing it once to let them know hey I can always come back and rescan it for you anytime you change out any of the information so you can keep an up-to-date copy of what's there mm-hmm I I think about a space like this is the some local in person that takes care of it how much of a decision making is actually done remotely yeah so usually there's like a facilities manager so if you just you know imagine this and they have vendors or they'll have a facilities management team like a custodial person kind of taking care of the decision and what is usually happening and because most of the work is still reactionary is that facilities manager is going to get a phone call from that custodial person saying hey there's an issue I'm hearing something something's wrong well what are you talking about well instead of just relying on that custodial person to make sure that they're effectively communicating what it is they're looking at you can in real time be talking on the phone with them looking at the space and all of those things that you know about it are going to be you know jogged up right away and you can walk that person through hey have you tried X Y & Z before we have to call someone and if I do have to call someone I might have the information right there on a tag of in case of problem contact best person and then they can send it to them giving them the go-ahead for it so it really helps with the context and if that custodial person they also have a phone they can take a picture of what happened and they can also look at what it used to look like and know right away of oh there's an issue here and I could imagine in this mep room with all these pieces of equipment there's there must be tons of manuals and i imagine today those manuals are all online so is a lot of the documentation that your if the provision solutions is seen is documentation that links to online manuals rather than figuring out where you're going to store all these manuals that are probably out of date as soon as the manual is published that's right it's an easy way to hold it and solve it because you'll have that physical one when you buy any sort of equipment like that but having the digital version of that manual and having it downloaded and then upload it onto a matter tag you're ensuring you're syncing up the right system with the right piece so you could have 15 facilities they all have an HVAC system but they all have it from five different companies and which one is which year and everything else so if you're already directly doing it as part of your maintenance and operation for curating that space you're just speeding up a whole lot of hassle that will happen later on if you didn't mm-hmm four four four companies that have now switched to matter port digital twins from a file folder a file cabinet do you hear any aha moments from them that where it's created new better save money save time any kind of reaction that you get feedback that that if the provision solutions here's so it's not like I would ever throw a customer under the bus but some of the nice things are I didn't know that we had that there like so it's clear like from asset documentation of really what is in a space and what they've had in their files can be so outdated so getting them up to speed just on what is really there is important and then the second thing of what they really like is when they're thinking about a space is to adding the video of talking about their knowledge and transferring that to the space so it doesn't just live within a person it lives for the space so that really helps enable you know that that like asset lifecycle move in a more like precise motion because they love that they could share this in a context that's great and somebody doesn't have to wait for them or they can forget about it that you know it's ready to go so is that literally happening yes they're recording yeah so just imagine like you and it's like it's easy to put it in context so imagine you had two something and you did the manual and you're like well what was it like to do this where do you need to start how do you finish these are the steps you need to take because the manual says it one way reality of how that fixes in a space is completely different so being able to share that knowledge transfer and nuance is critical for a lot of companies because it prevents a lot of headaches and then usually a lot of other extra cost if they don't know and then they have to hire someone all over again to do some regular maintenance which is basically you know why they're there in the first place so it really helps with you know keeping those contingency costs down mm-hmm I I guess I could imagine if I was a facilities manager for a specific building I might have some concern for my job if or my job security might be well all that knowledge is in my head about how to how to run this place and where the manuals are and how to start these pieces of equipment do you get any pushback or struggle from the one site person to coming in with a this new way of doing facilities management documentation so I am sure that there are people that will always be worrisome about how to utilize technology and make it more efficient for their job because there's just two ways to always look at it but we always look at it with our customers of this is going to help you with that knowledge transfer to share it because how are you spending your time and it's it should be taking care of problems and getting to problems before they occur so if you're spending all your time just fixing something and not getting to the hey let me help prevent future problems people will pay the same person to prevent problems rather than adding more cost to you fixing them because it's the same but you're actually doing the company and yourself a service it's a probably just a better way to think about it okay in in terms of okay we're gonna wheee switched to matter port digital twins of a facility what is there like a key you know you know here are the three reasons that it like totally make sense either from a saving time or saving money or enabling something to be done better or faster is there is there some tremendous pain point which motivates somebody to say yes let's go shoot a digital twin of our facility the number one thing that you're gonna eliminate for them is the number of site visits that they would need to so just imagine especially for enterprise clients it's one or a few people traveling to multi sites and all that travel time in between and it's basically a rotating shift so if you can help reduce the site visits because they know what's in a space and they can communicate it like that would be the number one thing and then the secondary part of once you've reduced the site visits is curating the space so that's like the secondary capability of okay now I don't have to keep that going back to it because I know it and I understand it and I can comprehend it and I can communicate that to other vendors colleagues everyone else then the second thing is curating the space which you can help them and you know both of those things are saving them not only the time of getting there but all the direct costs and indirect costs that it takes to focus on one space to understand something in the nuanced you know amount of time mm-hmm I didn't even think about this there really is a lot of money spent on travel at a corporate level to go visit all the facilities which could be visited through a virtual walkthrough that's right so imagine you had to travel because there's an electrical problem and you had to go meet the electrician to explain to him this is what it is now just imagine you got on the phone and say hey I'm gonna send you a link I'm gonna show you exactly what this electrical unit is so you know what kind of tools you need to bring to service it and call me when you get there and we'll talk about it like that's the new world rather than the old one of oh I'll meet you there let's figure out a time and get out there to walk you through it kind of stuff mm-hmm and so I mentioned I'm in Atlanta doing a lot of let's say typical matter port service provider maybe doing a lot of residential real estate see what you've described in terms of matter port digital twins for facilities management is an opportunity where do you begin what's the title of the person to talk to where are these people yeah so the the nice thing is to remember for facilities management is every building has one okay so even at the residential it could be the parent or the owner of the place there the facility manager for their individual space but for you know commercial spaces the facility director of facilities is a good place to start and to say and ask them you know how are you documenting your assets which is the space and everything in there and we could save you time and money with giving you that digital twin of your space to help you understand what's going on for those conditions and the nice thing is you can start with them but you can start with anyone else that needs that visual of the space and you can also let them know of hey while we're capturing that digital twin can you share this with the facilities department because they will also have a view and a use for this so if it started with you know business development or marketing needed it say listen marketing you could also share that mechanical room that would be a real value to facilities ah so it may have really started with an as-built somebody wanted to do a renovation but the department that does the renovating is different than the facilities management and may not be aware that this digital twin of the space has tremendous value to a different department within a large organization that's right we always say that the scans themselves have a residual ROI so they always start with from a place of need but the more that you can share that space you're breaking down silos within a company of I don't need to pay for this five times I can utilize this once and share it and now we're all communicating effectively and when those companies get it it's like turning on a light bulb of wow like we could actually work together rather than you know in separate silos so it's real it helps actually bridge a company's gap that has always existed hmm fascinating the the on the on the digital twin for that MEP room I you know when we went through our list I I don't think we we we said anything about insurance if you run across anything in terms of ah we could use this for insurance documentation this these are our assets that if there is a fire or a flood that we can quickly communicate to an insurance company that yes this is this is this is what got destroyed and we have a a digital twin to back up what our claim is is that has that use case shown up yet yes and yeah it happens throughout Madden report I think it's one of the best value as that besides the service of who could utilize it the most it's you know those actuaries that have to usually go on-site to understand what has happened and what it was so being able to provide that embedded virtual walkthrough of what that spaces or take pictures of anything of what it used to be compared to what it is now is a vital service that you know helps that whole industry and you know they should be able to document it now in case of something so like if you live in an area that is prone to seasonal natural disasters like I live in California and there's fires if you live on the East Coast it could be floods or earth so there is a need and there's a general like risk aversion that a lot of these places have that your documentation will help them be ready for if something happens they can do something about it okay I did want to return to that question of who do I call where am i where am i trying to develop business am I starting literally asking for the on-site facilities manager or am I really calling corporate and asking for a title of VP facilities you really want to reach out to someone at the corporate level more often than not because the person on site is living in so what they what they need effectively from a corporate governance is well what is happening at these spaces at a strategic level and how can we like increase efficiencies overall so the Director of Facilities facilities manager which will probably be maybe more than one thing those are the places to start VP of facilities if they're they're also operations is the other line that some of the titles so it could be operations for an actual physical space as well mmm-hmm and into projects for the the documentation of a mechanical electrical plumbing room and MEP visit there's the the these kinds of projects often begin first in creating an as-built or doing the construction documentation and it led into the conversation of using the matter port digital twin for the facilities management or do projects like this begin the the first project into a company begin with facilities management it's I would there's it's worked every which way so we have customers where its start with the facilities director and they're like I need to document all of my spaces in this format and function and they already have the need and then we will also then share well not only are you getting the visual asset but you also getting this two point cloud opponent so now we're then talking to the architect and design lead of well when you have remodels you can also utilize this same space that we can develop help you develop floor plans or you can yourself to get cat or Revit models of what you need so it could work that way or starting from the architecture design or construction once the space is complete we go for the grand opening and say well that phase turnover now from construction now gets handed off to facilities so instead of construction just holding the scan and saying thank you you give it to the next person that has to hold on and curate and care for these spaces so in terms of an asset like a physical space it can start with anyone because all of these departments haven't have a role to play in nurturing that space through its lifecycle so the nice thing is you they can share and you know one visual of the as his space it's just looking through the lens of a different person they'll see a value in it but one thing you said a lot of important things but one of the things that you said really kind of resonated with me was oh well they actually have lots of spaces to do this for so if I'm lucky enough to uncover an opportunity where all of some sudden the VP of Facilities needs 10 spaces 50 spaces a hundred spaces 200 spaces that's beyond my capability as a matter port service provider but I don't want to necessarily call matter port and say hey what should I do with this how do I work with if the what does that look like yes so thanks for bringing it up Dan so yes like I said at the beginning of the show we have over 300 technicians in our network and we built this on consistence and quality of giving you that so if there is someone that sees that there's something larger than what they can cover they can give us a call they can actually just call me directly and we can work with them of not only ensuring that they're continuing to do the business and the area that they servus but we can also service the clients and you know we'll even give a referral out there for that kind of business as a way to say thank you so I I might either refer it to you too if t provision solutions I might stay as the point person I have a trusted relationship with the client that's right yeah so it's um it's whatever the preference is you know that client better than we do and you know that you can rely on us with the work that we've been doing and knowing how to nurture an account and a customer but whatever that person feels comfortable with we'll be able to work up or work down it doesn't matter to us okay so I think what I'm hearing is if the provision solutions is happy to work with a matter port service provider in a way that makes sense for everyone and if the service provider wants to pass you the lead there's an interesting conversation there if the if the service provider wants to continue to be let's call it the Account Executive on the project certainly can do that once they have perhaps I would you ever be transparent to the to the discussion yes yes so it's it's pretty basic for the referral like we would be able to offer of any of the work that we're doing for them you know basically 10% of the fees we'd accumulate so it is can be quite empty of an incentive and in terms of the larger spaces we're a large enterprise company that can handle some of those things where it might get beyond your scope of insurance indemnities all the legalese that you would need to do to handle an account for risk aversion of the other companies that you know we can take the lead and we would still work in good faith of making sure everyone is you know happy because what we're doing is just trying to help the customer at the end of the day see the value in the service that not only we provide but as that like the technician on the ground doing it that you know we're all looking at the same goal mm-hmm so if I'm talking to a large company perhaps with different a residential real estate agent that might text me and say hey am i available at four o'clock on Thursday I text back yes boom I'm scanning that's the end of the paperwork it was a it was a text message a larger company is going to require typically something in terms of a significant amount of paperwork you mentioned just a couple of examples in terms of insurance requirements indemnification whatever that is and therefore a large company may prefer to do business with a large company that's capable of providing the level of insurance and the comfort level to be able to handle one quote one point of contact multiple markets correct so even if I did want to actually maintain the relationship with the client and have if the transparent to that it still might be a challenge for me to be able to provide the the the what a large company needs in order to do business across America that's right so it could be just something of you know have you handled scopes like you know this magnitude do you have the insurance to handle that can you operate in every state you know all these things that come up that we're equipped to do okay so for me as a service provider in Atlanta the advantage may be hey I'm here there might be somebody I can develop the business and there actually might be a way bigger opportunity for me to tee up a well-qualified lead ready to go provide the introduction and boom I don't necessarily have to figure out how I'm gonna ski and all that's right it can just be as simple as you know a phone call or an email introduction which is all the extra work but it's just realizing that when you get a call to do one job if you take the next step to say hey is there an opportunity to do more than this that's usually all it will take and then you'll have an idea of if it's something more for you or if it's something that you know maybe this we'll be a good way to work together okay awesome I think what I'm going to do is just share my screen because you mentioned about contacting you so I imagine we're back on provision dot IFT I comm I happen to be on the facilities management screen but I imagine any of these tabs I'm still going to end up with this 800 number in the right-hand corner a contact us which I presume goes right down to this lead generation page here correct and again there's that phone number and this again this is you James Duffy BP business development for if t proces solutions that's awesome James are there any questions I haven't asked you about facilities management meets matter port digital twins that I should ask you know Dan you you went over everything quite well I think the only thing I'd want to reiterate is for the facilities management and we went over the mechanical room is it's thinking about the larger space so if you're asked to do just one space within a larger one let them know it's you're already at the 10 yard line let's get to the end zone and capture the whole space and then the other way on the inverse is once you capture that whole space for someone to let them know that there's a value for the kind of market segmentation of the visual inside these spaces they they work with other people so we went over it again but I think it was a real good takeaway to let them know that there's other departments that these companies can share value with and to make sure that they know that that residual ROI lives in a matter port skin so we're perhaps I've been overly focused on that MEP room that is just a small space within a larger building that is filled falls under facilities management right so fixtures like the lighting around the space they could be switching to LED lights and they need to know where everything is or facilities management needs to know safety things so where fire extinguishers are located and exit signs and you know there's just myriad of these this information that's there so whether it's in one room or within a whole space like that documentation and responsibility falls on facilities to maintain and operate mm-hmm cool James thanks again for being on the show oh I appreciate it Dan Thanks
