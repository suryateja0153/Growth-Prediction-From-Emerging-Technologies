 [Music] the concept of the digital twin means many different things to different disciplines maintenance operations predictive asset management digital twins automation digital twins but these are typically focused on only one discipline providing one set of functions without context in between each other yokogawa's digital twin concept combines high fidelity simulation with automation safety digital twin platforms asset management platforms from sensor all the way to the equipment level and draws the context between all of these various different technology twins we include with this the digital twin of the human behavior so we map all the human activities on site digitalize them and provide them visually so they can be included in the improvement activities going forward this results in a context-driven digital twin combining all the various aspects of technology in order to drive deeper insights for better decision making as manufacturing and production transition more and more towards a more autonomous future the digital twin is going to be the core driving technology that is going to enable us to do that and without context between all these technologies there will be limitations in what can be achieved
