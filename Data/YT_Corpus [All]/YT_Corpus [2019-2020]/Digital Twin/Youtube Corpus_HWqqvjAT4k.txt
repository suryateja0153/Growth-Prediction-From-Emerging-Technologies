 Welcome to the third part of our video series. In Part 2 we had a look at all sorts of data companies need to collect about their products. Data must be collected and made available along the entire supply chain and throughout every single phase of a product's life cycle while ensuring the data’s quality, traceability, and the intellectual property. The effort involved is worth it, because with this data, it is possible to virtually simulate all phases of the product life cycle during the design phase and thus create a digital twin of the product. Using this digital twin in the design phase, a company can determine what raw and processed materials are best suited - for the product, - for production, - for the use phase, - and for recycling, so that they can be incorporated and reintroduced into a new lifecycle further down the line. Based on this knowledge, purchasing can decide where these materials are to be procured from, that is, - from natural sources or recycling, - from which regions, and - from which suppliers. And based on the digital data collected, a company can also ... -   identify risks to the environment, people, and the company, and assess, minimize or even avoid them from the outset -   identify critical materials, processes, technologies and suppliers and find alternatives -   include existing legal requirements, customer wishes, and consumer demands into their plans -   identify potential savings in material and energy efficiency -   introduce further sustainability indicators and use them to secure their competitiveness -   inform institutions, clients and consumers about the origin and sustainability of their products and processes -   and by doing so, put in place a sustainable and efficient life cycle management system. And we're here to help you do precisely that. iPoint—Your expert for digitalizing the circular economy.
