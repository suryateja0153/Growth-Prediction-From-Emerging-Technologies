 Smartphones are often only used with one hand using the thumb for touch input. However, with today’s larger smartphones, users can no longer comfortably touch everywhere on the screen without changing their grip. We developed three interaction techniques comprising combinations of touch input with head tracking available on modern smartphones to address this reachability issue. In two user studies, we found that two of our interaction techniques that combine head and touch input have a higher success rate than direct touch and are faster then other reaching techniques such as BezelCursor.
