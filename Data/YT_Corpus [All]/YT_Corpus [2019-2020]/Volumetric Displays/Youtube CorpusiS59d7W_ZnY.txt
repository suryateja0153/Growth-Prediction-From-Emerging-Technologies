 a biofuel is a fuel that is produced through contemporary processes from biomass rather than a fuel produced by the very long winded geological processes involved in the formation of fossil fuels such as oil since biomass technically can be used as a fuel directly eg wood logs some people use the terms biomass and biofuel interchangeably more often than not however the word biomass simply denotes the biological raw material the fuel is made of or some form of thermally chemically altered solid end product like torrefied pellets or briquettes the word biofuel is usually reserved for liquid or gaseous fuels used for transportation the EIA US Energy Information Administration follow this naming practice if the biomass used in the production of biofuel can regrow quickly the fuel is generally considered to be a form of renewable energy biofuels can be produced from plants ie energy crops or from agricultural commercial domestic and/or industrial wastes if the waste has a biological origin renewable biofuels generally involve contemporary carbon fixation such as those that occur in plants or microalgae through the process of photosynthesis some argue that biofuel can be carbon neutral because all biomass crops sequester carbon to a certain extent for Miscanthus x giganteus Macau Mon a towel found carbon accumulation rates ranging from 0.42 to three point eight tonnes per hectare per year with a mean accumulation rate of one point eight four tonne 0.74 tonnes per acre per year or twenty percent of total harvested carbon per year the grass sequester's carbon in its continually increasing root by ass together with carbon input from fallen leaves however the simple proposal that biofuel is carbon neutral put forward in the early 1990s has been superseded by the more nuanced proposal that for a particular biofuel project to be carbon neutral the total carbon sequestered by the crops root system must compensate for all the emissions from the related above-ground biofuel project this includes any emissions caused by direct or indirect land-use change many first generation biofuel projects are not carbon neutral given these demands some have even higher total GHG emissions than some fossil based alternatives some are carbon neutral or even negative though especially perennial crops the amount of carbon sequestrated and the amount of GHG greenhouse gases emitted will determine if the total GHG lifecycle cost of a biofuel project is positive neutral or negative Whitaker at all estimates that for Miscanthus x giganteus GHG neutrality and even negativity is within reach a carbon negative life cycle is possible if the total below-ground carbon accumulation more than compensates for the above-ground total life cycle GHG emissions the graphic on the right displays two co 2 negative Miscanthus x giganteus production pathways represented in grams co2 equivalents per mega Joule the yellow diamonds represent main values successful sequestration is dependent on planting sites as the best soils for sequestration are those that are currently low in carbon the varied results displayed in the graph highlights this fact for the UK successful sequestration is expected for arable land over most of England and Wales with unsuccessful sequestration expected in parts of Scotland due to already carbon rich soils existing woodland plus lower yields soils already rich in carbon includes peatland and mature forests grassland can also be carbon rich however Milner @al argues that the most successful carbon sequestration in the UK takes place below improved grasslands the bottom graphic displays the estimated yield necessary to compensate for the disturbance caused by planting plus lifecycle GHG emissions for the related above-ground operation the two most common types of biofuel are bio ethanol and biodiesel bio ethanol is an alcohol made by fermentation mostly from carbohydrates produced in sugar or starch crops such as corn sugarcane or sweet sorghum cellulosic biomass derived from non-food sources such as trees and grasses is also being developed as a feedstock for ethanol production ethanol can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form a 100 but it is usually used as a gasoline additive to increase octane and improve vehicle emissions bio ethanol is widely used in the United States and in Brazil biodiesel is produced from oils or fats using transesterification and is the most common biofuel in Europe it can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form be 100 but it is usually used as a diesel additive to reduce levels of particulates carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons from diesel-powered vehicles in 2018 worldwide biofuel production reached 152 billion litres 40 billion gallons u.s. up 7% from 2017 and biofuels provided 3 percent of the world's fuels for road transport the International energy agency want biofuels to meet more than a quarter of world demand for transportation fuels by 2050 in order to reduce dependency on petroleum however the production and consumption of biofuels are not on track to meet the IEA sustainable development scenario from 2020 to 2030 global biofuel output has to increase by 10 percent each year to reach IEA s goal only 3% growth annually is expected there are various social economic environmental and technical issues relating to biofuels production and use which have been debated in the popular media and scientific journals topic generations topic first generation biofuels first generation or conventional biofuels are biofuels made from food crops grown on arable land with this biofuel production generation food crops are thus explicitly grown for fuel production and not anything else the sugar starch or vegetable oil obtained from the crops is converted into biodiesel or ethanol using transesterification or yeast fermentation topic second-generation biofuels second-generation biofuels are fuels manufactured from various types of biomass biomass is a wide-ranging term meaning any source of organic carbon that is renewed rapidly as part of the carbon cycle biomass is derived from plant materials but can also include animal materials whereas first generation biofuels are made from the sugars and vegetable oils found in arable crops second generation biofuels are made from lignocellulosic biomass or woody crops agricultural residues or waste plant material from food crops that have already fulfilled their food purpose the feedstock used to generate second-generation biofuels thus either grows on arable lands but adjust byproducts of the actual harvest main crop or they are grown on lands which cannot be used to effectively grow food crops and in some cases neither extra water or fertilizer is applied to them non human food second-generation feedstock sources include grasses jatropha and other seed crops waste vegetable oil municipal solid waste and so forth this has both advantages and disadvantages the advantage that unlike with regular food crops no arable land is used solely for the production of fuel the disadvantage is that unlike with regular food crops it may be rather difficult to extract the fuel for instance a series of physical and chemical treatments might be required to convert lignocellulosic biomass to liquid fuels suitable for transportation topic third generation biofuels from 1978 to 1996 the u.s. nael experimented with using algae as a biofuel source in the aquatic species program a self-published article by Michael Briggs at the UNH biofuels group offers estimates for the realistic replacement of all vehicular fuel with biofuels by using algae that have a natural oil content greater than 50 percent which Briggs suggests can be grown on algae ponds at wastewater treatment plants this oil-rich algae can then be extracted from the system and processed into biofuels with the dried remainder a further II process to create ethanol the production of algae to harvest oil for biofuels has not yet been undertaken on a commercial scale but feasibility studies have been conducted to arrive at the above yield estimate in addition to its projected high yield alga culture unlike crop based biofuels does not entail a decrease in food production since it requires neither farmlands nor freshwater many companies are pursuing algae bioreactors for various purposes including scaling up biofuels production to commercial levels professor rodrigo ET Tierra from the University of Alabama in Huntsville demonstrated the extraction of biofuels lipids from wet algae using a simple and economical reaction in ionic liquids topic 4th generation biofuels similarly to third generation biofuels fourth generation biofuels are made using non arable land however unlike third generation biofuels they do not require the destruction of biomass this class of biofuels includes electrofuels and photo biological solar fuel some of these fuels are carbon neutral topic types the following fuels can be produced using first second third or fourth generation biofuel production procedures most of these can even be produced using two or three of the different biofuel generation procedures topic biogas biogas is methane produced by the process of anaerobic digestion of organic material by anaerobes it can be produced either from biodegradable waste materials or by the use of energy crops fed into anaerobic digesters to supplement gas yields the solid by-product digestate can be used as a biofuel or a fertilizer biogas can be recovered from mechanical biological treatment waste processing systems landfill gas a less clean form of biogas is produced in landfills through naturally-occurring anaerobic digestion if it escapes into the atmosphere it is a potential greenhouse gas farmers can produce biogas from manure from their cattle by using anaerobic digesters topic singers singers a mixture of carbon monoxide hydrogen and other hydrocarbons is produced by partial combustion of biomass that is combustion with an amount of oxygen that is not sufficient to convert the biomass completely to carbon dioxide in water before partial combustion the biomass is dried and sometimes pyrolyzed the resulting gas mixture Singer's is more efficient than direct combustion of the original biofuel more of the energy contained in the fuel is extracted singers may be burned directly in internal combustion engines turbines or high temperature fuel cells the wood gas generator a wood fuel gasification reactor can be connected to an internal combustion engine cinders can be used to produce methanol DME and hydrogen or converted via the fischer-tropsch process to produce a diesel substitute or a mixture of alcohols that can be blended into gasoline gasification normally relies on temperatures greater than 700 degrees Celsius lower temperature gasification is desirable when Co producing by ochre but results in singers polluted with tar topic ethanol biologically produced alcohols most commonly ethanol and less commonly propanol and butanol are produced by the action of microorganisms and enzymes through the fermentation of sugars or starches easiest or cellulose which is more difficult biobutanol also called bio gasoline is often claimed to provide a direct replacement for gasoline because it can be used directly in a gasoline engine ethanol fuel is the most common biofuel worldwide particularly in Brazil our qahal fuels are produced by fermentation of sugars derived from wheat corn sugar beets sugarcane molasses and any sugar or starch from which alcoholic beverages such as whiskey can be made such as potato and fruit waste etc the ethanol production methods used are enzyme digestion to release sugars from stored starches fermentation of the sugars distillation and drying the distillation process requires significant energy input for heat sometimes unsustainable natural gas fossil fuel but cellulosic biomass such as ba gas the waste left after sugarcane is pressed to extract its juice is the most common fuel in Brazil while pellets wood chips and also waste heat are more common in Europe waste steam fuels ethanol factory where waste heat from the factories also is used in the district heating grid ethanol can be used in petrol engines as a replacement for gasoline it can be mixed with gasoline to any percentage most existing car petrol engines can run on blends of up to 15% bio ethanol with petroleum gasoline ethanol has a smaller energy density than that of gasoline this means it takes more fuel volume and mass to produce the same amount of work an advantage of ethanol ch3 ch2 o H is that it has a higher octane rating than ethanol free gasoline available at roadside gas stations which allows an increase of an engines compression ratio for increased thermal efficiency in high altitude thin air locations some states mandate a mix of gasoline and ethanol as a winter oxidizer to reduce atmospheric pollution emissions ethanol is also used to fuel bio ethanol fireplaces as they do not require a chimney and are flawless bioethanol fires are extremely useful for newly built homes in a mints without a flu the downsides to these fireplaces is that their heat output is slightly less than electric heat or gas fires and precautions must be taken to avoid carbon monoxide poisoning corn to ethanol and other food stocks has led to the development of cellulosic ethanol according to a joint research agenda conducted through the US Department of Energy the fossil energy ratios there for cellulosic ethanol corn ethanol and gasoline are ten point three one point three six and zero point eight one respectively ethanol has roughly one third lower energy content per unit of volume compared to gasoline this is partly counteracted by the better efficiency when using ethanol in a long-term test of more than two point 1 million kilometers the best project found ffb vehicles to be one to twenty six percent more energy efficient than petrol cars but the volumetric consumption increases by approximately 30 percent so more fuel stops are required with current subsidies ethanol fuel is slightly cheaper per distance traveled in the United States topic other bio alcohols methanol is currently produced from natural gas a non-renewable fossil fuel in the future it is hoped to be produced from biomass as bio methanol this is technically feasible but the production is currently being postponed for concerns that the economic viability is still pending the methanol economy is an alternative to the hydrogen economy compared to today's hydrogen production from natural gas butanol c4h9 OAH is formed by Abe fermentation acetone butanol ethanol and experimental modifications of the process show potentially high net energy gains with butanol as the only liquid product butanol will produce more energy and allegedly can be burned straight in existing gasoline engines without modification to the engine or car and is less corrosive and less water-soluble than ethanol and could be distributed via existing infrastructures DuPont and BP are working together to help develop butanol Escherichia coli strains have also been successfully engineered to produce butanol by modifying their amino acid metabolism one drawback to butanol production in e.coli remains the high cost of nutrient rich media however recent work has demonstrated a coli can produce butanol with minimal nutritional supplementation topic biodiesel biodiesel is the most common biofuel in Europe it is produced from oils or fats using transesterification and is a liquid similar in composition to fossil mineral diesel chemically it consists mostly a fatty acid methyl or ethyl esters fames feedstocks for biodiesel include animal fats vegetable oils soy rapeseed jatropha Mahua mustard flax sunflower palm oil hemp field pennycress Poonam iya Panetta and algae pure biodiesel b100 also known as nate biodiesel currently reduces emissions with up to 60% compared to diesel second generation b100 biodiesel can be used in any diesel engine when mixed with mineral diesel it can also be used in its pure form b100 in diesel engines but some maintenance and formants problems may then occur during wintertime utilization since the fuel becomes somewhat more viscous at lower temperatures depending on the feedstock used in some countries manufacturers cover their diesel engines under warranty for b100 use although Volkswagen of Germany for example asks drivers to check by telephone with the VW Environmental Services Department before switching to be 100 in most cases biodiesel is compatible with diesel engines from 1994 onwards which used Vuitton by DuPont synthetic rubber in their mechanical fuel injection systems note however that no vehicles are certified for using pure biodiesel before 2014 as there was no emission control protocol available for biodiesel before this date electronically controlled common-rail and unit injector type systems from the late 1990s onwards may only use biodiesel blended with conventional diesel fuel these engines have finally meted and atomized multiple stage injection systems that are very sensitive to the viscosity of the fuel many current generation diesel engines are made so that they can run on b100 without altering the engine itself although this depends on the fuel rail design since biodiesel is an effective solvent and cleans residues deposited by mineral diesel engine filters may need to be replaced more often as the biofuel dissolves old deposits in the fuel tank and pipes it also effectively cleans the engine combustion chamber of carbon deposits helping to maintain efficiency in many European countries a five percent biodiesel blend is widely used and is available at thousands of gas stations biodiesel is also an oxygenated fuel meaning it contains a reduced amount of carbon and high hydrogen and oxygen content than fossil diesel this improves the combustion of biodiesel and reduces the particulate emissions from unburned carbon however using pure biodiesel may increase NOx emissions biodiesel is also safe to handle and transport because it is non-toxic and biodegradable and has a high flash point of about 300 degrees Fahrenheit 148 degrees Celsius compared to petroleum diesel fuel which has the flash point of one hundred and twenty five degrees Fahrenheit fifty-two degrees Celsius in the u.s. more than 80 percent of commercial trucks and city buses run on diesel the emerging US biodiesel market is estimated to have grown 200% from 2004 to 2005 by the end of 2006 biodiesel production was estimated to increase fourfold from 2004 to more than 1 billion US gallons three million eight hundred thousand cubic meters in France biodiesel is incorporated at a rate of eight percent in the fuel used by all French diesel vehicles Averell group produces under the brand Easter a fifth of eleven million tonnes of biodiesel consumed annually by the European Union it is the leading European producer of biodiesel topic green diesel green diesel is produced through hydro cracking biological oil feedstocks such as vegetable oils and animal fats hydro crackling is a refinery method that uses elevated temperatures and pressure in the presence of a catalyst to break down larger molecules such as those found in vegetable oils into shorter hydrocarbon chains used in diesel engines it may also be called renewable diesel hydrate vegetable oil or hydrogen derived renewable diesel unlike biodiesel grain diesel has exactly the same chemical properties as petroleum-based diesel it does not require new engines pipelines or infrastructure to distribute and use but has not been produced at a cost that is competitive with petroleum gasoline versions are also being developed green diesel is being developed in Louisiana and Singapore by ConocoPhillips Nestor oil Valero dynamic fuels and Honeywell UOP as well as priam in Gothenburg Sweden creating what is known as evolution diesel topics straight vegetable oil straight unmodified edible vegetable oil is generally not used as fuel but lower quality oil has been used for this purpose used vegetable oil is increasingly being processed into biodiesel or more rarely cleaned of water and particulates and then used as a fuel as with 100 percent biodiesel b100 to ensure the fuel injectors atomized the vegetable oil in the correct pattern for efficient combustion vegetable oil fuel must be heated to reduce its viscosity to that of diesel either by electric coils or heat exchangers this is easier in warm or temperate climates man B&W diesel wärtsilä and Deutz AG as well as a number of smaller companies such as Elsbeth offer engines that are compatible with straight vegetable oil without the need for aftermarket modifications vegetable oil can also be used in many older diesel engines that do not use common rail or unit injection electronic diesel injection systems due to the design of the combustion chambers in indirect injection engines these are the best engines for use with vegetable oil this system allows the relatively larger oil molecules more time to burn some older engines especially Mercedes are driven experimentally by enthusiasts without any conversion a handful of drivers have experienced limited success with earlier pre pumper dues VW TDI engines and other similar engines with direct injection several companies such as ellsberg or wolf have developed professional conversion kits and successfully installed hundreds of them over the last decades oils and fats can be hydrogenated to give a diesel substitute the resulting product is a straight chain hydrocarbon with a high cetane number low in aromatics and sulfur and does not contain oxygen hydrogenated oils can be blended with diesel in all proportions they have several advantages over biodiesel including good performance at low temperatures no storage stability problems and no susceptibility to microbial attack topic by ofs by ofs also referred to as fuel ethers or oxygenated fuels are cost-effective compounds that act as octane rating enhancers bioethanol reactive iso olefins such as isobutylene with bio ethanol bioethics they also enhance engine performance while significantly reducing engine wear and toxic exhaust emissions although bioethicists it is highly unlikely they will become a fuel in and of itself due to the low energy density by greatly reducing the amount of ground-level ozone emissions they contribute to air quality when it comes to transportation fuel there are six ether additives dimethyl ether dmae diethyl ether d methyl tert-butyl ether MTBE a siyul tert-butyl ether ate a bay a turd ammo methyl ether tame and tert amal ethyl ether tae a the european fuel oxygenates association PFOA identifies methyl tert-butyl ether MTBE and ethyl tert-butyl ether etbe as the most commonly used ethers in fuel to replace lead ethers were introduced in europe in the 1970s to replace the highly toxic compound although europeans still use bio authorities the u.s. no longer has an oxygenate requirement therefore bioethanol ong ger used as the main fuel additive topic by region there are international organizations such as IEA bioenergy established in 1978 by the OECD International Energy Agency IEA with the aim of improving cooperation and information exchange between countries that have national programs in bioenergy research development and deployment the UN international biofuels forum is formed by Brazil China India Pakistan South Africa the United States and the European Commission the world leaders in biofuel development and use are Brazil the United States France Sweden and Germany Russia also has 22% of world's forests and is a big biomass solid biofuels supplier in 2010 Russian pulp and paper maker Vyborg skya cellulose said they would be producing pellets that can be used in heat and electricity generation from its plant in Vyborg by the end of the year the plant will eventually produce about 900,000 tons of pellets per year making it the largest in the world once operational biofuels currently make up 3.1 percent of the total road transport fuel in the UK or 1440 million liters by 2020 10 percent of the energy used in UK road and rail transport must come from renewable sources this is the equivalent of replacing 4.3 million tons of fossil oil each year conventional biofuels are likely to produce between 3.7 and 6.6 percent of the energy needed in road and rail transport while advanced biofuels could meet up to 4.3 percent of the UK's renewable transport fuel target by 2020 topic air pollution biofuels are similar to fossil fuels in that biofuels contribute to air pollution burning produces carbon dioxide airborne carbon particulates carbon monoxide and nitrous oxides the WHO estimates 3.7 million premature deaths worldwide in 2012 due to air pollution Brazil burns significant amounts of ethanol biofuel gas chromatographs studies were performed of ambient air in Sao Paulo Brazil and compared to Osaka Japan which does not burn ethanol fuel atmospheric formaldehyde was 160 percent higher in Brazil and acetaldehyde was 260 percent higher the Environmental Protection Agency acknowledged in April 2007 that the increased use of bio ethanol will lead to worse air quality the total emissions of air pollutant such as nitrogen oxides will rise due the growing use of bio ethanol there is an increase in carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels to produce the biofuels as well as nitrous oxide from the soil which has most likely been treated with nitrogen fertilizer nitrous oxide is known to have a greater impact on the atmosphere in relation to global warming as it is also an ozone destroyer topic debates regarding the production and use of biofuel there are various social economic environmental and technical issues with biofuel production and use which have been discussed in the popular media and scientific journals these include the effect of moderating oil prices the food vs fuel debate food prices poverty reduction potential energy ratio energy requirements carbon emissions levels sustainable biofuel production deforestation and soil erosion loss of biodiversity impact on water resources the possible modifications necessary to run the engine on biofuel as well as energy balance and efficiency the international resource panel which provides independent scientific assessments and expert advice on a variety of resource related themes assess the issues relating to biofuel use in its first report towards sustainable production and use of resources assessing biofuels assessing biofuels outlined the wider and interrelated factors that need to be considered when deciding on the relative merits of pursuing one biofuel over another it concluded that not all biofuels perform equally in terms of their impact on climate energy security and ecosystems and suggested that environmental and social impacts need to be assessed throughout the entire lifecycle another issue with biofuel use and production is the US has changed mandates many times because the production has been taking longer than expected the Renewable Fuels andddd RFS set by Congress for 2010 was pushed back to her at best 2012 to produce 100 million gallons of pure ethanol not blended with a fossil fuel topic banning of first generation biofuels in the EU the revised renewable energy directive calls for a complete ban on first generation biofuels by 2030 particularly fuels made from such oils such as palm oil and soy oil are being targeted topic sustainable biofuels many of the biofuels that were being supplied in 2008 using the first generation biofuel production procedure have been criticized for their adverse impacts on the natural environment food security and land use in 2008 the Nobel prize-winning chemist Paul J Crutzen published findings that the release of nitrous oxide n2o emissions in the production of biofuels means that overall they contribute more to global warming than the fossil fuels they replace in 2008 the challenge was to support biofuel development including the development of new cellulosic technologies with responsible policies and economic instruments to help ensure that biofuel commercialization is sustainable responsible commercialization of biofuels represented an opportunity to enhance sustainable economic prospects in Africa Latin America and Asia biofuels in the form of liquid fuels derived from plant materials have entered the market driven by the perception that they reduce climate gas emissions and also by factors such as oil price spikes and the need for increased energy security according to the Rocky Mountain Institute sound biofuel production practices would not hamper food and fiber production nor cause water or environmental problems and would enhance soil fertility the selection of land on which to grow the feedstocks is a critical component of the ability of biofuels to deliver sustainable solutions a key consideration is the minimization of biofuel competition for prime cropland topic greenhouse gas emissions some scientists have expressed concerns about land-use change in response to greater demand for crops to use for biofuel and the subsequent carbon emissions the payback period that is the time it will take biofuels to pay back the carbon debt they acquire due to land-use change has been estimated to be between 100 and 1,000 years depending on the specific instance and location of land-use change however no-till practices combined with cover crop practices can reduce the payback period to three years for grassland conversion and 14 years for forest conversion a study conducted in the toe canter state in northern Brazil found that many families were cutting down forests in order to produce two conglomerates of oil seed plants the jakers jaesi group and the our commune is our si group this region is composed of 15% Amazonian rainforest with high biodiversity and 80% cerrado forests with lower biodiversity during the study the farmers that planted the JC group released over 2000 193 mega grams co2 while losing 53 to 105 mega grams co2 sequestration from deforestation and the RC group farmers released 562 mega grams co2 while losing 48 to 90 mega grams co2 to be sequestered from forest depletion the production of these types of biofuels not only led into an increased emission of carbon dioxide but also to lower efficiency of forests to absorb the gases that these farms were emitting this has to do with the amount of fossil fuel the production of fuel crops involves in addition the intensive use of mono cropping agriculture requires large amounts of water irrigation as well as of fertilizers herbicides and pesticides the has not only led to poisonous chemicals to disperse on water runoff but also to the emission of nitrous oxide no2 as a fertilizer by-product which is 300 times more efficient in producing a greenhouse effect than carbon dioxide co2 converting rainforests peatlands savannas or grasslands to produce food crop based biofuels in Brazil Southeast Asia and the United States creates a biofuel carbon debt by releasing 17 to 420 times more co2 than the annual greenhouse gas GHG reductions that these biofuels would provide by displacing fossil fuels biofuels made from waste biomass or from biomass grown on abandoned agricultural lands incur little to no carbon debt in addition to crop growth requiring water biofuel facilities require significant process water topic current research specially bred mustard varieties can produce reasonably high oil yields and a very useful in crop rotation with cereals and have the added benefit that the meal left over after the oil has been pressed out can act as an effective and biodegradable pesticide the nfe SC with santa barbara based biodiesel industries is working to develop biofuels technologies for the US Navy and military one of the largest diesel fuel users in the world a group of Spanish developers working for a company called eco fatha announced a new biofuel made from trash the fuel is created from general urban waste which is treated by bacteria to produce fatty acids which can be used to make biofuels before it's shut down Joule unlimited was attempting to make cheap ethanol and biodiesel from a genetically modified photosynthetic bacterium topic ethanol biofuels bio ethanol as the primary source of biofuels in North America many organizations are conducting research in the area of ethanol production the national corn to ethanol Research Center NC ERC is a research division of Southern Illinois University Edwardsville dedicated solely to ethanol based biofuel research projects on the federal level the USDA conducts a large amount of research regarding ethanol production in the United States much of this research is targeted toward the effect of ethanol production on domestic food markets a division of the US Department of Energy the National Renewable Energy Laboratory NREL has also conducted various ethanol research projects mainly in the area of cellulosic ethanol cellulosic ethanol commercialization is the process of building an industry out of methods of turning cellulose containing organic matter into fuel companies such as ioj n poet and a bang goer are building refineries that can process biomass and turn it into bio ethanol companies such as diversa Novozymes and dyadic are producing enzymes that could enable a cellulosic ethanol future the shift from food crop feedstocks to waste residues and native grasses offers significant opportunities for a range of players from farmers to biotechnology firms and from project developers to investors as of 2013 the first commercial scale plants to produce cellulosic biofuels have begun operating multiple pathways for the conversion of different biofuel feedstocks are being used in the next few years the cost data of these technologies operating a commercial scale their relative performance will become available lessons learnt will lower the costs of the industrial processes involved in parts of Asia and Africa where drylands prevail sweet sorghum is being investigated as a potential source of food feed and fuel combined the crop is particularly suitable for growing in arid conditions as it only extracts 1/7 of the water used by sugarcane in India and other places sweet sorghum stalks are used to produce biofuel by squeezing the juice and then fermenting into ethanol a study by researchers at the International crops Research Institute for the semi-arid tropics ICR is a tea found that growing sweet sorghum instead of grain sorghum could increase farmers incomes by $40 per hectare per crop because it can provide fuel in addition to food and animal feed with grain sorghum currently grown on over 11 million hectares ha in Asia and on 23 point 4 million hectares in Africa a switch to sweet sorghum could have a considerable economic impact topic jatropha several groups in various sectors are conducting research on jatropha curcas a poisonous shrub like tree that produces seeds considered by many to be a viable source of biofuels feedstock oil much of this research focuses on improving the overall per acre oil yield of jatropha through advancements in genetics soil science and horticultural practices SG biofuels a SAN diego-based jatropha developer has used molecular breeding and biotechnology to produce elite hybrid seeds that show significant yield improvements over first-generation varieties SG biofuels also claims additional benefits have arisen from such strains in improved flowering synchronicity higher resistance to pests and diseases and increased cold-weather tolerance plant research international a department of the wage-earning and University and Research Center in the Netherlands maintains an ongoing jatropha evaluation project that examines the feasibility of large-scale jatropha cultivation through field and laboratory experiments the Center for sustainable energy farming CFS EF is a los angeles-based nonprofit research organization dedicated to jatropha research in the areas of plant science agronomy and horticulture successful exploration of these disciplines is projected to increase jatropha farm production yields by 200 to 300 percent in the next ten years topic funghi a group at the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow in a 2008 paper stated they had isolated large amounts of lipids from single-celled fungi and turned it into biofuels in an economically efficient manner more research on this fungal species cunning Amelie japonica and others is likely to appear in the near future the recent discovery of a variant of the fungus glycol ATM rose ium later renamed Oscar Koren sarcoid points toward the production of so-called micro diesel from cellulose this organism was recently discovered in the rainforests of northern Patagonia and has the unique capability of converting cellulose into medium-length hydrocarbons typically found in diesel fuel many other fungi that can degrade cellulose and other polymers have been observed to produce molecules that are currently being engineered using organisms from other kingdoms suggesting that fungi may play a large role in the bio production of fuels in the future topic animal gut bacteria microbial gastro intestinal flora in a variety of animals have shown potential for the production of biofuels recent research has shown that to 103 a strain of Clostridium bacteria found in zebra feces can convert nearly any form of cellulose into butanol fuel microbes in panda wastes are being investigated for their use in creating biofuels from bamboo and other plant materials there has also been substantial research into the technology of using the gut microbiome ease of wood feeding insects for the conversion of lignocellulosic material into biofuel equals equals see also
