 today on brstv investigates what do we really know about protein skimmers beyond them being a mechanism to create bubbles in order to remove organic waste and fish poo from our reef tanks can we begin to learn more about skimmers in order to make smarter decisions as to which one is better for our reef tank or how to optimize our current protein skimmer for the best performance possible well today we're diving deeper one video at a time and answering those questions for good hi I'm Randy with this Friday's brstv investigates where we put popular reefing gear theories and methods to the test by experimenting on our own tanks so you don't have to experiment on yours and in today's experiment we open the Pandora's skimmer box a little wider with a second round of testing skimmer air drop performance only this time we're switching it up a bit while always keeping in mind that we're looking for better ways of not just tuning performance but also selecting the right tool for the right job ok I'd be willing to bet that many if not most reefers probably share similar experiences when choosing a protein skimmer for their tanks and that skimmer choices are usually whittled down by a handful of criteria such as one the skimmer has to fit my budget too I rely on the manufacturers rated capacity and tank size and bio load three it has to fit with the new dimensions of my sump and skimmer chamber and four hopefully somebody else has used the skimmer on their tank and shared either their positive or negative reviews to help me make my decision looking at those criteria again really only one is being driven by data meaning that there has to be more we can learn about skimmer performance beyond tank size rating alone that can help us make more informed decisions not only on which one to buy initially but also how to get better performance from the protein skimmer we may already own so I'll admit that last week when we tested air draw from the six most popular skimmers in that 150 to 250 dollar price range we were called out by one of our favorite reefers and sometimes sharpest critics from the YouTube reefing community Glenn Rudolph who mentioned that measuring skimmer air drop may have been a bit boring and I can mostly agree but I assured him that there is a rhyme and reason for the testing this is exactly why today and over the course of maybe a half dozen other experiments we plan to collect some baseline data share our findings with the community learn from that data to refine and evolve new tests and performance experiments in order to ultimately find a path to optimal skimmer performance and the best tools to achieve it meaning coming up with the right tool for the right job so today's testing is an evolution to our last test which was based on each skimmer manufacturers recommended operating depth however this week we're going to ignore those recommended depths to test the air drop from six of the most popular skimmers in the next price bracket up of 250 to $450 and operating levels of 5 up to 11 inches in order to determine their optimal depth and which options have the largest installation sweetspot to learn more about the question to skimmer operating depth really matter here's how this experiment went down as I mentioned we tested six of the most popular standard protein skimmers as voted by you guys in terms of units sold starting alphabetically with the NIOSH quantum 120 reef octopus classic 150 SSS reef octopus classic 202 s the reef octopus essence s 130 red C's RSK 300 skims SM 167 monster DC skimmer all from that price range bracket of two hundred and fifty to four hundred and fifty dollars using our new toy from Kelly pneumatics which measures volumetric airflow we tested the each skimmers air draw when install the depths of five six seven and up to 11 inches in order to see how the water level impacted the air draw as we move deeper and deeper from the data we gathered today we not only hope to chip away some of the layers of mysteries surrounding protein skimmer performance and operation but better yet if you already own one of these skimmers or are in the market for one this data may help to optimize that performance or help you with a selection so with that let's get to the numbers to make today's data easier to digest we're going to show you a graph of how each skimmer performed at each operating depth from 5 inches and beyond with some notable call-outs to what we're seeing let's get started with the read CRS k300 schemer at 300 bucks which utilizes a CJ PSK 600 pump which we tested at an average wattage of 29 watts with an air rated draw of 600 litres per hour and a recommended operating depth of 6 to 8 inches right away we see pretty stable performance from 5 inches up to 9 inches where the overall change in average air draw ranges from 582 liters per hour at the low end to 680 at the high end where the most air draw is right in between that recommended sweet spot of 7 inches of water at 10 to 11 inches of operating depth which is pretty deep and not very common in most installs we weren't able to collect the air draw data due to the skimmer overflowing into the skimmer collection cup which made it unusable for any reefer attempting to utilize it effectively at that depth I'd also note that the best performance came right in that six to eight inch sweet spot recommended by red sea where it dropped off on either end and is exactly where I would operate this skimmer on my own system the reef octopus essence s130 is next at around 310 dollars which has a little over a one-inch recommended operating depth sweet spot from 7.1 inches to 8 point 7 inches and comes outfitted with an aqua trance 1,800 pump that we tested at 18 watts and is manufacturer rated for 480 litres per hour air drop as we can see from all points of 5 inches to 9 inches there's really not much of a change to the air draw where the lowest comes in at 365 litres per hour at 7 inches deep to the highest air draw of 395 liters per hour just one inch higher in 8 inches of water the small difference of 30 liters per hour from the lowest to the highest seems to show little concern for operating depth on this skimmer however at 10 to 11 inches it did overflow the skimmer cup to a point that made it unusable at those depths moving on to the $450 reef octopus 202's skimmer which runs the Aqua trance 3000 pump which we tested at 23 watts and is rated at 880 litres per hour with an operating recommended depth of less than one inch between seven point nine inches to eight point seven inches looking at the data a 5-inch operating depth to 11 inches we see the largest change overall from the lowest to highest air draw happen in between 7 & 8 inches where there's only a marginal 38 liters per hour difference from 3 12 at 7 inches to 350 at 8 inches again the highest air drop performance is right in that recommended eight to nine inch operating depth yet overall the max of around 350 liters per hour that we tested was pretty far away from aqua trance 3000 s rated 880 liters per hour I have a feeling we'll find out in future tests how much of a role a difference of over 500 liters per hour air draw effects skim a production performance but for now it looks like this skimmer is pretty unaffected by operating depth up next is the reef octopus classic 150 SSS which is the most affordable in our group of skimmers today coming in right at about 275 bucks the Aqua trans mm pomp in this skimmer was tested at 17 watts and is rated for 720 litres per hour with a small operating window of less than an inch by the manufacturer from seven point nine to eight point seven inches when we look at the performance from five to eleven inches we see a very even air draw rating regardless of operating depth where there's only a difference of 36 liters per hour from 425 at 11 inches deep versus 461 at 7 inches from the looks of it in this case it seems as though the optimal range for this skimmer is somewhere in that 6 to 8 inch depth where we see the highest amount of air draw which is slightly lower than that recommended operating depth our only DC powered skimmer is the skims SM 167 monster that's currently listed for just under $400 and utilizes skims his own QP s 4.0 pump which we measured at 15 watts on the highest power setting this DC pump is rated by skims at 900 to 1,200 liters per hour of air draw and has a recommended operating depth of seven to nine and a half inches looking at the data across all operating depths from 5 to 11 inches this one is by far the most surprising results we've seen with an overall change of 1038 liters per hour from 55 at 5 inches to 1093 at seven inches at the highest pump setting we can see that the air draw just continues to increase as the skimmer gets deeper and deeper in the water so with skims we see the highest performance in terms of air draw however it is absolutely affected by operating depth yet it does come with the feature of being able to adjust the amount of air draw due to the adjustable speed of the DC pump I would say that even though the air draw is greater at the 11 inch depth I would still install it within that recommended range of seven to nine and a half inches from skims although if necessary to install deeper you could potentially turn down the pump speed the next skimmer is the NIOSH quantum 120 in that same $400 price range and utilizes an 8 watt quantum 1.0 pump rated at 500 litres per hour and has recommended operating depth of just 8 inches looking at the data for this skimmer we see a pretty stable air draw from 5 to 8 inches with surprisingly the highest amount of air draw in that lower 5 inch operating depth at 220 litres per hour from the 5 inch depth to that recommended 8 inch sweet spot we see a majority of the highest air draw and then it starts to drop off into higher operating depths until 11 inches where we couldn't keep the cup from overflowing from the looks of it I'd say that this skimmer has a wider sweet spot than what's listed in the instructions with a more usable range of around 4 inches so much like we saw in the last skimmer air draw test some skimmers absolutely have more air draw than others however it looks as though these larger models with the higher wattage pumps are less susceptible to drastic changes at various operating depths versus last week's look at some smaller models with the exception of the skims DC pump one thing I'd also note here is that each of these skimmers we tested are commonly referred to as space-saving models with their respective pumps housed inside the body this gameis DC pump did wind up drawing the most air out of the bunch today with deeper operating depths seeming better yet it was pretty drastic swinging from the low end of the high which may be accounted for when you start to factor in the added ability to adjust the pump speeds perhaps the effect of changing that pump speed at various depths my something we could explore further in future tests to continue on that thought path of today's question does skimmer operating depth really matter last week I rated this one a 5 out of 10 using a handful of smaller size skimmers where installation depth was absolutely a factor for some more so than others so for this week I think I'll bring this one up to a 7 out of 10 for the main reason that for a majority of the larger skimmers we tested today we saw some of the best performance right in that operating range that manufacturers recommend so in almost all cases I'd say that it's best practice to follow those recommendations as closely as possible but what about skimmer designs such as recirculating skimmers that are not as dependent on water operating depth in the next evolution of our skimmer testing we're going to take a closer look at how performance is affected with those recirculating skimmers that utilize a dedicated pump for the sole purpose of drawing an air and a second pump to feed water through the skimmer versus more traditional protein skimmers much like we've already tested that utilize a single pump to serve the dual purpose of controlling the water level as well as the air draw together looking back on a lot of the testing we've done over the years of brstv investigates many of our experiments in some way shape or form have revolved around the question is more actually better when it comes to the amount of flow in our tanks it's been commonly thought that for some tank types particularly those SPS dominant systems in fact yes more is better however the data we found in this experiment where we tested exactly that showed seemingly otherwise and you might be surprised at how we came to that conclusion so
