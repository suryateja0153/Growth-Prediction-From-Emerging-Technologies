 I am Ana Martin I am the program coordinator for the Water Resources Research Institute like I said we have a very large group today and they're all still trickling in so we're so happy that you guys can join us on this cloudy day to talk about wetlands with some experts in the field we are this is our second believe Sun you so everyone again as I was saying my name is Anna and this is our second session for the material that you would have heard originally presented in March so we're so happy you could be here just a few ground rules if everyone would please mute your microphones uh this will minimize any background noise our presenters are presenting we've had a lot of questions about the recording of this website and it is recording it will be posted on our new virtual content page on the WRI conference site and we are happy to shoot a link to you for that it will take a day or two to get it posted maybe a little bit longer because it will have closed captioning so just be aware and you are free to access that whenever possible and share it with colleagues we've had a lot of that done with the first session so really happy to to see that the material is getting out there to those who need it the most once this session is over you guys will be provided with in a link to an evaluation a few short questions we'd love to hear your feedback it helps us improve and bring you the topics that you want to hear the most so please feel free to do that it'll take five minutes of your day maybe maybe five minutes and I'm sure Carolina wetlands would appreciate hearing the feedback and so as you may have noticed this is a session all about wetlands and we have a great sponsor on board today with Carolina wetlands association and so representing that group we have the president Rick Savage is on and then moderating we have the vice president Kim Matthews and she also represents RTI so we have a couple of different relationships with these guys and we're just very happy that they are able to do this with us closed captioning is not free so even though the zoom feature is a free thing every little bit helps so the support is appreciated and just a brief shoutout to our continued series sponsor which is why acai and xylem if you joined us for the first event you may have seen their name pop up so without further ado I am going to send it over to Kim Matthews and let her kick us off so thank you so much Kim great thank you Anna I am gonna share my side thanks for that great introduction and so while I have all these people who are obviously interested in wetlands before we get to our presentations I wanted to take just a couple of minutes to tell you a little more about the Carolina wetlands Association and what we are celebrating this month which is American wetlands month so Carolina wetlands Association is a non is a is a non-profit we're a science-based organization advocating for wetlands across North and South Carolina and so one way one of the ways we do that in celebration of American wetland month is to recognize wetland treasures across the Chu State so this slide here represents this year's wetland treasures and we we normally would do in-person tours to all of our wetland treasure sites each May but due to the limitations we are doing virtual tours so every Monday throughout May we've posted virtual tours to each one of these sites on our website and on all of our social media accounts so this year's was Brogdon Bottomly and Botany Bay Panther town valley bunch Arrowhead preserve and pocosin Lakes on our web site Carolina wetlands org there's an interactive map where you can get information on all 25 of our wetland treasure sites which are listed at the bottom of this slide and we also have links to those virtual tour videos we have created PDF fact sheets and there's also links to other organizations that have the have information about each of those sites so we encourage you to go check out all of the information we have about about these wetland treasures and the other wetland information you can also sign up for our newsletter or follow us on our social media so thank you for that time and now we are going to go ahead and start with our presentations this is going to be the order of presentations we'll go through today each presenter has about a 15 minute presentation and we'll follow that up with some question-and-answer time after each presenter so Mike while I introduce you if you want to go ahead and take control and share your screen you can do that so our first present presentation is from dr. Mike virtual he is a professor at North Carolina State University's Department of biological and agricultural engineering he works in the area of ecosystem restoration constructed wetlands for storm water and wastewater treatment and other water quality protection take it away Mike all right thank you can everybody see my screen okay there's a single slide okay I see some I see some upturned thumbs that's great so good morning to everybody and thank you for joining us for this virtual session and thank you to WRI and Carolina wetlands Association for hosting today I'd like to share with you a case study involving constructed wetlands for tertiary treatment of wastewater and this project is part of our team's ongoing to what quest to look for new ways or sometimes always that have been forgotten or ignored for quality and a meaningful and cost effective manner okay I'm trying to advance my slide here come on okay go back out and get it cranked up again just a reminder for everybody else but please mute your line sometimes it does that I don't know why all right so you know most of you in this session I bet you've dedicated a significant portion of your career to protect water quality in North Carolina and some of you probably own in this session or working towards planning to do that in particular trying to figure out ways to achieve the reduction goal of thirty percent in place for the noose and the tarp cam watersheds so you know we have we've done a good job at moving toward those efforts probably we've made some progress their efforts have reduced nitrogen loads and some but not many you know in some areas but but many of the reductions have really kind of leveled out so that makes me wonder if there are additional sources of nitrogen entering the watershed that are unaccounted for perhaps from places like smaller wastewater facilities and you know with any project whether or not it would be something that you're working on around the house or a larger project it seems like it's easy to make a lot of progress early on and kind of quickly but achieving that last bit of perfection takes up some additional fault and effort so I'd like to talk to you about surface flow constructed wetlands for nitrogen removal this is a technology that's been around for quite some time it's an excellent example of ecologic 'el engineering and the wetland if you're trying to recreate here is most similar to natural emergent macro fight dwellings well they have high plan and microbial activity abundant carbon sources and both aerobic and in particular anaerobic zones to begin near the soil and water interface that really promotes denitrification which is the removal of nitrate from the waste stream wetlands also can remove some ammonium as you'll see but the really the backbone of how wetlands work is really in removing nitrate forms of nitrogen through denitrification it's a great example of ecologic ingeniero Marilee because it uses natural energy sources low fossil fuel inputs it's generally low maintenance and cost-effective but low maintenance does not mean no maintenance as you'll see as part of this presentation moving forward so if constructed wetlands are so great for nitrogen removal you one would think there would be numerous in North Carolina well they're really not a survey we conducted a few years ago revealed only a handful of constructed wetlands for wastewater treatment in North Carolina and that's really a lot less than other states like Florida and California despite the fact we have a great climate for them to be really efficient of note on the right side there if you notice the year bill most of these wetlands are now twenty and twenty-five years old and so they're getting a little bit older and they're getting outside of what you can find in literature for what you should do with a wetland that there are these old and also the data on their performance is extremely limited so we've got these wetlands out there we think maybe they're doing a good job but we're not really sure because we don't have a lot of data on so during this time the same time period late you know mid-90s till now there's been dozens upon dozens of constructed wetlands for stormwater treatment that have been constructed and they and they've been a really important part of achieving stormwater compliance but if you look at storm water wetlands versus constructed wetlands stormwater wetlands are going to be a vent base they generally have a lot less concentrated nitrogen entering them than say if you put a treatment wetland right next to a package plant which may have as much as 10 to 20 milligrams per liter nitrogen coming out all day every day if you compare a flow amount of two you know the flows that you would get with an event-based stormwater wetland versus the treatment wetland you can come up with a mass and if you use kind of a a pretty average removal rate for treatment wetlands you can see that over the course of a year one treatment wetland has the potential to remove 30 times the amount of nitrogen per year when compared to the same size stormwater well so it really begs the question that you know if you can build one of these store these treatment wetlands right downstream with something that you know has a concentrated amount of nitrogen you can usually build these things in if they're the equivalent nitrogen removal of 30 storm water wetlands why aren't we building more of these they could also be a lot cheaper built in a rural environment versus an urban environment that you would find your stormwater wells so so we were really curious to see why these destructive weapons for wastewater treatment rot willing to have not been embraced fully so we set out to study one of these sites and hoping to increase the visibility of these wetlands and show the potential of constructed wellness to improve surface water quality and maybe resulting in the increased adoption particularly by small towns they could and all of this could really you know help move that needle a little bit further in reducing nitrogen loads and of warships so it went up to one of those five wetlands that I noted earlier up in Walnut Cove North Carolina now this was a pretty innovative system at the time it took a lagoon system and added several components including a constructed wetland to help meet their treatment goals rather than put a mechanical large or more expensive mechanical plan in there and so from the wetland standpoint there were two parallel cells about 1,200 feet long by 60 foot wide a little under two hectares that received about half a million gallons per day of wastewater that had been pretreated and had a hydraulic retention rate of about four days now at Walnut Cove the state said that their permit needed to be 10 milligrams per liter for nitrogen and 30 milligrams per liter for both total suspended solids and B OD so this is how the wastewater treatment plant was supposed to form basically they look good from a nitrogen standpoint this was the strategy so the water wastewater came in that was pretty high in ammonia and virtually no nitrate in it and it was aerated mineralization and nitrogen nitrification would reduce the amount of the concentration of ammonium and increase the concentration of nitrate the ammonium rape in the duckweed Raceway which was supposed to be built for the duckweed to grow on this and be harvested would remove a little bit more of the ammonium but when the warner entered the wetland cells it would be primarily in the form of nitrate at which point denitrification in the wetlands would help reduce that nitrate down to some pretty low levels before it exited the plant so our goal was with the help of WRI was to really go there and study what we thought was perhaps a high-performing wetland and helped develop design standards and build support for expanded use of wetlands to combat nitrogen loads two watersheds in rural North Carolina so we set up an experiment you'll hear a little bit more about that later so we started checking the water that was coming into the wetlands and through the wetlands and at the effluent of the wetlands measuring a whole host of different things from hydraulics to water quality to the weather there and what we quickly realized is that the believe it or not the ammonium in the water coming out of the wetlands many times during the year was actually higher than was what was going in so that was initially a pretty baffling thing to discover in addition the the high levels of nitrate that we expected to be coming into the wetlands through pretreatment was not there and so the wastewater the nitrogen forms in the wastewater was predominantly ammonium now it should be noted that the the the the town was not really aware of this because they're monitoring only require that they monitored at the effluent of the wetland so they did not they did not have a true picture of how the nitrogen was moving as it was going through the entire treatment so we started looking at the numbers and yep you know even you know is recently is fall of 2018 we're still seeing very low concentrations of nitrate the amount of nitrogen that's coming in into the wetland was about a it's going out at about eight and so there's really no really no treatment of the nitrogen going through this wastewater treatment well and when my graduate student brought that you that you'll hear from a few minutes really started digging into some of the data that was available from the NPDES permit affluent you can see that this trend of monthly ammonium concentrations has been steadily going up over time and if you note it's still below this ten milligram per litre limit but it's a slow bleed toward the town actually starting to come in to be had the potential to have some permit violation issues not to mention that you know there's four times more nitrogen leaving this wastewater treatment plant than it was you know ten years ago so what essentially was going on is that the ammonium was staying was reduced a little bit in the primary lagoons but was not not changed very much going through the the wetlands so as Brock started doing his work there we started we saw some other early symptoms of poor performance there was a lot of detritus that actually would get stuck in our outlets and was making its way into the chlorinator dechlorinator and I don't know how many calories that guy has burned and removing that stuff to keep from clogging out the well but it was an everyday occurrence and it was really really affecting the treatment performance in a chlorinated dechlorinator it's it was he described it as like a glacier of muck that seemed to be moving through the system now remember this system is 25 years old and we also started seeing shallow water moving through these areas that also looked like it was short-circuiting but it's true circuiting means is that when the wastewater gets in the wetland it's not spinning as much time in the Welland's or is not it's also not being distributed across the wetland as much as you would think and so the wetlands not able to treat the water as it was intended so we did some roto bean diet racer studies and the aerial images were really striking you can really pick out the short-circuiting through the sails here once you drop a die in there to see that only a small portion of the wetland is actually being used that the water is only using a small section of the wetland and so that means that the water was not staying in the wetland as long as it was designed and the entirety of the surface area was not being used for treatment anymore this was all likely because it was a 25 year old wetland that had filled up with detritus in fact when we when we collected the data we would measure the the breakthrough of the die by collecting automated samples at the outlet you can see that the majority of the dye concentration would pass through the wetland in less than a day so the wetlands could not provide treatment they were designed for under these conditions so no wonder we were starting to see some of those trends in the money and go up here's a photograph when you got in there and dug around you can see that there was over a foot of this detritus that has built up over time and the wetland plants were like growing on top of it and so you've gotten a short circuiting this poor mixing not to mention the an internal source of ammonium that could be formed in there as the detritus slowly broke down with time and we started when we were going in visiting other Whelan's we were seeing similar issues observed at Aurora and at Caledonia prison prison so these things are getting older and it was going to make it pretty difficult for us to endorse wetlands when the ones out there might be currently having some problems so we were lucky enough to get a community collaboration research grant through North Carolina Sea Grant and WRI and went out there and remove the detritus to try to breathe new life into one of the Sale document the process and then test the effect on water quality oxygen distribution in internal hydraulics for the system so essentially we were trying to reduce these systems from one that had shorter hydraulic retention time and a high internal source of ammonium for longer retention time and lower internal sources of ammonia once we were able to reestablish the vegetation in there that would increase some assimilation help coupled denitrification and nitrification maintain our pH and provide biofilm attachment on the plant sites so the clean out plan included taking one of the cells out letting it dry out in May and then taking an excavator with a 60-foot boom and work from downstream to upstream pull the detritus back up on the on the bank and allow that to dewater and stabilise leave about four to six inches in the bottom of the cell and then as we were going along we were scooping out clumps of existing cattail and replanting it as we go on four-foot spacings there two to revegetate the cell pretty quickly and it ended up being about a five day process a few pictures of the before and after of the cell one you can see that there was not much vegetation growing in here because it was it with the water it stayed backed up in these areas a lot of times a little bit of fringing cattails but you can see afterwards a lot of that strides have been moved out and you can see the spacing with our cattail clumps there and this big long L here is the cell that we cleaned out compared to the inner cell that we did this photograph was taken in the fall and you can see that wetland cell one with the tribes removed and replanted looks much more like the type of wetland that was initially designed in comparison for sale - which ended up being our control to try to see the effect of what the Detroit remove will actually have so how did it work where you're going to find out some of the preliminary results that we had when Brock does his presentation we're going to be looking we looked at water quality flow and other environmental conditions did some additional tracer studies we're looking at methods of aeration upstream of the Wellum to increase nitrification and create more nitrate and we've been doing some outreach in training in particular the lessons that we've learned in cleaning out this wetland are probably going to be applied to another wetland at Caledonia State Prison so overall this is my last slide that the project impacts we really want to distribute the constructed wetlands or technology that should be added back to the toolbox for water quality improvement particularly for rural towns in need of additional nitrogen treatment to reap to meet permits it's the low cost technology that can be efficient when operated correctly it could be for rural towns in need of treatment plant expansions if they are expecting new populations and then this idea of tertiary treatment of wastewater from packaged plants that export excess and often unaccounted nitrate they're meeting their ammonium distribution or discharge limits but they're still pumping out a lot of nitrate which isn't under permit basically discharge this this water from packaged plants to constructive wetlands and obviously you know reduce in send less nitrogen into our local surface waters so with that I guess I can pause for questions please follow the work that we're doing on at NC State wetland if you've got any questions about wetlands or anything about water quality please contact me at my email address so that does it thank you thanks Mike we do have a handful of questions that were submitted on the chat and just a reminder that Broncs presentation is going to be the second part of this talking focusing on the detritus removal so there'll be more details on that part so one of the first questions did you monitor the microbial flora much of the nitrogen breakdown happened by that microbial level and that will affect the nutrient uptake great question that is something that we have done and is currently being analyzed we have a microbiologist on our faculty that is helping us work on that and we have some initial information on the different bacterial groups in in the lagoon versus the wetland versus the oxidation trench and I can't tell you how much this means necessarily for nitrogen treatment but you can see those groups change as you go through the well go through the treatment plant and that's something that we're going to focus in more as that information becomes available good question the work that was done to review the detritus do you require a permit from the Corps of Engineers no the Corps of Engineers doesn't oversee these types of constructed wetlands this would be managed by BEQ and since we didn't take the detritus off the property and allowed it to D water back into the wetlands and revegetated a permit wasn't required that does answer another question said what did you do with the detritus and muck he removed so it with all the waters in really I'm sorry I didn't make that more clear but when the excavator grabbed the detritus we laid it on the bank we left the the cattails we're kind of fringing all of the wetlands and we use that almost as kind of a coarse filter to allow that to kind of slide back in there in deep water and then it dried out compressed and revegetated right there on the bank so what about like long-term there was a question about you know wastewater treatment plant operator and municipality wanting to maybe event sillies in at the end of their lifespan would they with that they wouldn't have to do that with the mitigation requirement or a nationwide permit you know what would be the long-term implications of the treatment wetlands and what they what would happen at the end these type of dwellings don't that when you construct a well and for West water treatment it is not like another wetland that falls under the pours guys so it's part of a wastewater treatment thing and so it's not it's not protected like natural and restored wetlands off and what about the discharges then if there's any contaminants that are coming out of the treatment plants would that be potential for remediation obligation under like a CERCLA Arikara I'm so I don't really understand that question if the wastewater treatment discharges has some contaminants but not not nitrogen but maybe some others like emergency emergency amants or other listed contaminants what would be would that be considered a remediation under CERCLA Arikara like a hazardous waste site this I mean this is this would fall under the guidance of just like any other wastewater treatment plant in North Carolina and they're they're not necessarily held to meeting permit regulations for those types of emerging contaminants so this one is no different and I'm gonna ask one more question before we go on to Brock and then I think because I think Brock will get to some of these other questions that are being asked why wait 2025 years for four I mean can't you be doing more routine maintenance to preserve better treatment if you do the maintenance on a regular basis that is the number one type of point that we would like to make out of this research unfortunately back in the 90s when these were being built there wasn't a lot of maintenance guidance it was a lot of people thought these were literally build them and walk away and they'll take care of themselves I talked to one of the major authors of the Bible if you will of treatment wetlands and he's got about two pages on maintenance when I was telling him about what we were doing here he said that that these that this this could be a chapter in his new book because there was not enough done from for given maintenance guidance and you're exactly right we would recommend that different sections be cleaned out every year kind of as an ongoing process so you don't have to spend all the money in one year and you get all the benefits of cleaning these things out from year to year so it should be an ongoing process and they should be as brock will tell you these should be designed and maintenance documents should be should make these very clear and and I really think the lack of maintenance documentation is one of the things that really has held back this technology from being more wives widely accepted in North Carolina because of all of the uncertainty about how these things are going to work when they get older great thanks thanks we're gonna end the questions right now and we're gonna go on to a Brock's presentation Mike if you want to look at some of those questions in the chat during Bret's presentation maybe you can come back and help answer those at the end so Brock if you want to pull up your presentation while I give you a little introduction to use of Brock is the doctoral student of dr. virtual and state state university department of biological and agricultural engineering and he is studying is we're going to hear more about the performance of constructed wetlands for tertiary treatment of wastewater so go ahead Brock take it away all right is this am i working yeah okay all right thanks for that introduction my presentation here will be kind of a part two to dr. Bertrille just presented he's also a co-author on this presentation as well as dr. Jack Turkey Fox and so for this presentation well you just heard in dr. virtuals presentation was at our study site the walnut Cove waste where our treatment plant is one of three municipal wastes for our treating plants that uses these free water surface constructed wetlands for biological nutrient removal and this site was put online in 1996 and lately we have seen a general decrease in performance at the site while flow at the site stayed relatively the same which indicates there was some problems internally at the site and one way to try to remediate that has been to and to improve team performance in those wetlands was to rejuvenate the Welland cell one while leaving that second dwelling cell in its original state as a reference or control and then for my presentation I kind of want to get more into the in-depth look at kind of the short-term impacts and what we've seen so far in terms of well in performance since that rejuvenation so to start here is walnut Cove again that cell one is the outside cell cell to kind of makes that backwards s internally both cells have the same surface area 0.7 hectares the same aspect ratio and the same morphology they're a flat base and they're supposed to have about 10 inches of water depth in them and so for my I'm sorry to interrupt you but could you perhaps speak a little louder there's a scheme speak a little a little louder it would be great is this better yeah I think sounds good so our sampling stations we place those located on the set on the picture with the white dots those are installed at the inlet splitter box as well as at the outlet of each well and these sampling stations monitored flow using state by measuring stage and using a sharp crested Weir equation these also had automatic samplers which you can see in that bottom left picture and those took daily water quality samples which were then composited into weekly samples for analysis and in addition to these composite samples we also took grab samples for every site visit we took those at the inlet midpoints which of those red dots in outlet and that allowed us to get longitudinal profiles of nitrogen species the ones as well I'm in addition to that we also took water quality parameters and there was an on-site weather station installed and that was installed where that blue star is on the map but on top of our water quality and flow measurements we also did tracer tests to determine the internal hydraulics we used rhodamine dyes are in the tracer two sets transfer tests for dining to sell prior to rejuvenate and then since rejuvenation we've done three sets and these provide the basis for our hydraulic performance quantification and getting back into dr. virtuals presentation just kind of rehash this one more time so some of the main factors for reduced treatment in these wetlands was number one was significant to try this accumulation it had limited the volumetric efficiency down to 25 percent the design volume it drives the mean lessons time down to about one day the water column was about four inches instead of ten to the point about microbial processes it had started the flow is now moving around vegetation in tight channels instead of through vegetation so that limited microbial attachment sites and then finally all this detritus in the cell likely was forming an internal source of ammonia through middle is mineralization and then the second main factor was then that that Inlet or nitrogen concentration was dominated by ammonia about 70 percent of the intellect or nitrogen was in the form of ammonia and as a result to have effective erection removal we needed both assimilation for temporary removal and storage and that was limited by the sparse vegetation short residence time and then for complete removal you need paired nitrification denitrification which was then limited by inadequate biofilm attachment sites through themselves as well as then again to come back to it that very short residence time so this should take us to kind of where dr. Burke will kind of ended we perform this wetland rejuvenation in late April you can see these are similar pictures to maybe what you just saw the cell was brought back online at half capacity after rejuvenation in mid-may and then brought back to full capacity in mid-august 2019 so to get into the rejuvenation goals specifically these are kind of our media khals were one to improve well in hydraulic performance and then to was to reestablish that vegetation throughout the cell this would hopefully then increase our assimilation potential in the cell shading by those cattails would limit algal blooms in the cell and help maintain low PHS or neutral pH as I guess and water moving through the vegetation instead of around it would allow those vegetation stems to provide microbial attachment sites so now we're getting into our post rejuvenation hydraulics and this is at the start of the tracer test and cell one the picture on the left is at the start of a tracer test before rejuvenation and then the picture on the right is at the side of a tracer test after rejuvenation and it's was immediately clear that now the cell instead of just moving through a central channel was now spreading out over the entire width of the cell and would hopefully move through the entire cell using up that whole surface area to get further into our actual tracer test results we have our residence time distributions here on x-axis is days since the tracer was injected the vertical lines on these charts the T Nam is the nominal husband's time or the design residence time and that is assuming the cell has 100% volumetric efficiency as well as ideal plug flow hydraulics well contrast that with the towel vertical line which is the mean residence time mount was derived from our actual tracer tests and on the left you can see cell one with the detritus removed you have a mean residence time that's now closer to the design residence time as well as that mean residence time is now more long one of three days instead of one day and you can see that cell two without any change still has that mean residence time of about one day so just getting into more quantification of this performance we looked at three traits or hydraulic indices with a you're going to see for the hydraulic efficiency for short-circuiting and also for mixing I'm not going to get into the values in this table in this presentation but just know that these values are used to qualitatively rank well in treatment cell performance and that using these values we were able to determine that before rejuvenation both welland cells or hydraulic be compromised well since rejuvenation so on the rejuvenated cell is now main dissatisfactory where cell two is still and not compromised as your poor performance ranking so that just goes to show that so far we've accomplished our first goal our residence time is now near three days and we are meeting or having at least satisfactory hydraulic performance did that rejuvenate itself and then getting in our second goal which is the rejuvenation is the vegetation coverage doctor Bertrille already kind of talked about this but here's a photo of the cell in the fall of 2019 and you can see that the outside cell is fully vegetated with both cattails and duck weed in areas that there are cattails where well and so to which is kind of an back there I still has those large open water areas and then looking kind of down the runway in these cells this is from January of 2020 you can see that the cell with detritus removed still it's fully vegetated across the cell and down the length of this where saltan still has that vegetation just along the edge I also felt like I should probably point out that give me good photographer I did manage to capture myself and both of these images but that just goes to show that you know we've established the second goal as well which is reestablishing that vegetation and in addition to that we've actually observed at the site biofilm growth on the portion of the cattail stems that are within the water column so that is I'm good as well getting more into the water quality aspect of things the inlet speciation is still the same still dominated by ammonia you can see ammonia is 5.3 compared to total nitrogen 7.3 but what I do want to bring your attention to from this is the fact that well and so one and that bottom right table is now showing a concentration reduction of 23% for total nitrogen removal where is that wetland to is now showing negative four percent concentration reduction through the cell but these are just mean values of the course from May to January since for Juvonen in getting you to actually what we've seen kind of month-to-month this is a chart of me monthly tour measuring concentrations with in fluent tone action in black the Selwyn effluent in red and they sell to effluent blue the gray bar shows when rejuvenation occurred and I want to point out that since that would you Venetian so to the right of the gray bar the red line has been lower than the blue line for every single month since rejuvenation but in addition to that there are two occurrences that I also wanted to point out what is this immediate major reduction in total nitrogen in cell one right after rejuvenation and then second is this referring to see improved performance now moving into June we're kind of at the end of our sampling so far so what is what is kind of causing these within our monitoring to investigate these I wanted to show you the longitudinal data for both nitrate concentration on the left there ammonia concentration the light blue lines are the treatment cell where the dark blue lines are the control cell that wasn't rejuvenated and getting into that first case that media team removal it appeared that there was not due to nitrification production necessarily but just a massive amount of assimilation that was occurring there in the spring of 2019 through the cell and that brings us to what we saw and it looked like this was actually occurring due to kind of an algal bloom within that cell right after a rejuvenation and replanting the cell was kind of opened up and allowed abundant sunlight into the cell and it basically turned we don't have correlated data from that time but the water was Mountain Dew green so I'm guessing that cORFO a was pretty however as the vegetation the cattails and duck we grew it started to shade the cell and likely limited the algal blooms that could occur then the cell and then moving into that second case though was that increased tor nitrogen removal this winter and this is what we're actually getting pretty excited about we for the first time we're seeing a fair amount of nitrate production paired with ammonia removal and this is really key for that complete by that Payard nitrification denitrification reaction so to kind of sum up the short term monitoring we had an initial algal bloom that likely led to an immediate reduction of ammonia however this was unlikely to be a long-term phenomenon and it was just kind of caused by that opening up of the cell that being said now this new to improve nitrogen removal performance that we saw this winter that correlated to that nitrate production that is highly makes pretty happy and gives us hope that we're going to see improved nitrification denitrification through the cell in overall improved total nitrogen performance in 2020 that being said sampling was halted in March so I don't have any new data to share after that we don't really know if it's still happy or not and that's where we can get back out there and keep sampling it's going to be critical to know if that pair of nitrification denitrification is likely still happening and then to kind of read all together four loadings that we've seen at the site since rejuvenation in may sell one removed 136 kilograms of total nitrogen where sell to the nominated cell exported about 18 kilograms a total nitrogen and I feel like this really shows one the impact that rejuvenation has had on nitrogen removal through the cell while at the same time it also shows that you know these cells that are sparsely vegetated filled with detritus and hydraulic premised are going to struggle to provide adequate performance so just moving a little bit forward we are going to continue to try to increase nitrate William cell we're going to try to do that through increased aeration we actually had a senior design project this year that works to establish to install aerators in that upstream oxidation ditch and they looked at microcosms of growth media that could possibly be put into those oxidation digits along with that and our laboratory we want to do mesocosm studies to quantify better quantify the impacts of detritus over time and similar to the comment that was made in dr. virtuals presentation we want to start investigating strategies for sectional public sectional removal overtime of detritus to provide maintenance overtime to reduce the need for this grand scale rejuvenation so in conclusion you know everyone at cove we saw that our immediate well and rejuvenation goals have been met and along with that that our total nitrogen removal and sub one has been promising so far but that these results were obtained during startup period and that further long-term data will help and begin to reflect what will happen in terms of steady-state conditions and then just generally for all constructed wetlands you know over time this accumulation of detritus will lead to hydraulic inefficiencies and compromised treatment performance and that we should begin to look at improving constructed wetland lifespan by designing these systems with this future maintenance in mind whether it be this vet rejuvenation or harvest intermediate harvesting and I'll just finish on some broader impacts we're hoping that this study will provide an additional resource for site managers that have constructed wetlands that need to operate them on site and finally hopefully this shows that constructive balance couldn't offer a relatively inexpensive and long-lasting nitrogen removal I mean for our study this is the one time to try this clean-out and vegetation management and a 25 year old well and still provided 15 percent total hydrogen reduction so these things not have a longer lifespan anything with rejuvenation and with that I'd like to thank Fred summers the woman code of Public Works Jack Turkey Fox Tommy Jonathan and Jerry for helping me out in the field there's been some hot rough days health care but we've made it through and I'd like to thank you hey thanks for us we have about three minutes for some questions and Mike's been doing a good job of responded to some of them but there was this earlier question you may have mentioned it what um with the size of walnuts code what's the size of the community that the wetland wetlands treating is about 1,800 people so if there's a mono visuality the plant there are some questions about wildlife that has it may be using the wetland treatment site did with any I guess did you observe or do any type of studies on of birds or amphibians that may have been using the wetlands we haven't done a study on it but I've seen both great blue herons out there and a few green herons typically like every two weeks on either side there is a bird watcher out there I think there's a website you can go to to see what has been observed at the site haven't actually looked into that in a while but that's the extent it's enduring the work that she did did you have to take any special precautions for protection of animals there was the wildlife that would be at the site I can answer that Brock don't we do yeah go ahead so there are a lot of turtles that that reside in the wetlands and we we feel pretty strongly that the turtles as we were making our way down there the turn did have the ability to go from sell one to sell two and so we we salvaged what we could and what we saw in there but they did have that mass exodus option to them for them here's a good question if you were gonna build a wetland today would you use the similar design or would you change something with the design I think we saw in mind while the seventeen to one aspect ratio can lead to clotting that we saw a little bit more easily I think if you put in these more intensive maintenance procedures this is that aspect ratio works better for the actual internal hydraulics of the system so I think the design is actually really good it's probably maintenance that would need to be improved and when the site was so what was the vegetation that was planted and the site looks like all cattails was that I guess was there any thought to other types of plants that it could be used for treatment cattails cattails and bulrush or your two heavy hitters for wastewater treatment wetlands because they can stand the constant one foot inundation and they can handle high pollutant loads there are quite a few more questions in but I think we need to move on to our next speaker we're at 11:30 so as you want to give an opportunity so thank you Brock you got some nice applause and there are like I said we can button can give you the questions and we can try to follow up with them later after the session all right so our next speaker is melinda Martinez if you would like to go ahead and start your presentations while we are while I do your introduction so we'll end Martinez is working towards her doctorate in forestry with a minor in remote sensing also at North Carolina State University but in the Department of Forestry and natural resources her work is focused on determining the early warning signs of the transition from forest ton Marsh Melinda we see the presentation view and not the slide view you know we see Windows Melinda I think if you go back to where you just were and then hit at the top a view slideshow okay donut the but yes that icon there yeah I think that's a shame can you still see that uh-huh and then at the very top next to in show it's either gonna be you slideshow or swap displays on the left-hand side of your screen there keep going to the left use slideshow swap displays we can see it at the very top of your screen next to anything there you cool thank you thanks sorry about that yours okay I'm making her move very clearly so I'm just gonna talk about one of my Tucker's and my dissertation which focuses on greenhouse gas emissions from standing dead trees and coastal forested wetlands and my advisor at NC State is Marcella rhythm so the greenhouse gasses that I am focusing on our carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxides which are important due to their ability to absorb energy and although methane and nitrous oxide are much lower atmosphere concentrations it is important to understand their pathways and emissions because they are more potent than co2 so methane is about 40 times more potent while nitrous oxide is about 300 times more potent and although wetlands occupy as many know a small portion of the globe they do contribute significantly to the global carbon cycling through carbon sequestration and also methane emissions and so they contribute as much as 20 to 30 percent of the global methane emissions and so it's a lot and more recently studies have focused on tree stems of sources of greenhouse gases that could provide more insight in understanding the global carbon cycle and I just oxide emissions so many fresh water forests and wetlands across the southeastern US are rapidly transitioning from Forest to Marsh due to a combination of saltwater intrusion which can be a drought induced or caused by storm surges or sometimes wind tides and a second disturbances also increase more increasing flooding events and as forested wetlands transition to marshes there are many standing dead trees that are left behind which many people refer to them as ghost forest so in forested wetlands there are various pathways greenhouse gases can take to be emitted from soils to that Monsieur and McKenna Genesis which is the production of methane occurs in soils because of anaerobic conditions from high water levels and soil saturation and nitrous oxide can be produced in soils when nitrification and denitrification is incomplete and so greenhouse gases can be emitted directly to the atmosphere by either diffusion or abolition which is just bubbling and so this is much higher concentrations and this happened through the water column the soil and water column but they can also be transported through a tree stems and so this can happen in live and dead trees and so in live trees this occurs because of movement of water up the tree stems which can also bring up greenhouse gases up the tree stem and in that cheese of a lot of this water is flushed out and so this leaves a lot of open cells allowing greenhouse gases for the soils to move up the tree stems due to pressure differences and so in the way these standing dead trees are acting as straws for greenhouse gases produced in the soils and then being emitted to that list here so here in North Carolina there are many freshwater forested wetlands that are transitioning to marshes along the Albemarle Pimlico Peninsula shown here yes and I will bring to this as a pee-pee and so I selected five sites around the peninsula which experience various levels of salinization and flooding and so the sites on the northern portion of a PP are more fresh and so they have very low swimming levels about 0 to 1 parts per thousand well aside from the southern portion tend to be more saline and so they have absolutely knees as high as maybe 12 parts per thousand and so these include Swan quarter and gold rock at the bottom and so another site that I have is pocosin Lakes which is right in the middle Nick and this is right next to the Intracoastal Waterway and so inlets peninsula there's a lot of hydrologic connectivity because of the many canals that are that were created and this is they will create it for agriculture purposes to drain some of the wetlands and so you can see some of the images of my sites and so the main questions I wanted to ask were do treat some greenhouse gas fluxes differ from nearby soils and if you're not familiar with the term flux is just the movement of something flowing out and so in this case is of greenhouse gases from the tree stems soils so the second question are there differences in tree stem greenhouse gas fluxes across the peninsula and what are the main drivers of tree stem Green dances and then which tree Sun Cree house gases contribute more to the radiative balance as I mentioned before a methane and nitrous oxide are more potent than co2 even though they are much lower in concentrations and so the sites were selected because of the abundance of standing dead trees present versus live trees and here I'm just showing um the tree density per site although Palmetto pear tree preserved highlighted in red was different in that there were more live trees and than dead trees but overall the number of standing dead trees were similar across the sites and then most of the trees that were selected were pine species although there were a few ball types are selected we've done coast and lake sites so this is just a general monitoring setup for I had for each site greenhouse gases were measured in two ways using a gas map which is a portable gas analyzer or using a syringe take samples from the chambers and then bring them back to the lab to be analyzed with the gas chromatograph and so field campaigns occurred during the growing season both in 2018 and 2019 and for each site I'm a total of five snags were selected Truths and greenhouse gases were measured using the flexible chamber which was a polycarbonate sheet and that was wrapped around the tree and then soil chambers about 30 centimeters in diameter were also installed about one or two years away from each tree and fluxes were calculated by greenhouse gases clean house gas concentrations over time and then weather parameters were measured of during sampling using orchestral yet meter and then during the second field campaign we installed one well at each site the technical campaign inventory 19 we installed one well at each side to monitor water levels and specific conductivity and in 2019 we also installed three sets of pore water zippers at two depths at 15 and 30 centimeters depth and at one of the sites that go wrong we also installed additional zippers at four 57 years and soap or water strippers are just made for PC with 2 being attached to a pumice stone at the bottom to extract pour water I thought specific death and so yeah you sounds a little low could you is there anything you could do to try to talk a little bit louder yeah that's fine I'm I could probably bring the mic closer is that better that's better thank you yeah okay so in 2019 we also took several soil cores to get a better idea on how different soil characteristics were across sites and so we measured both density Carbonite in nitrogen and their stable isotopes in water tractable solutes and just by looking at the soil corium because you can see that Palmetto pear tree has a much salary shallower mineral layer than all the other sites and once again I do want to point out that go rock was the only site that had additional pore water zippers so this information is showing pore water solute concentrations and so overall when looking at the concentrations by depth insight there were clear differences among sites and general increases in concentration with depth sulfate and ammonium were the most different sulfate on the left-hand side and ammonium that mill graph the top middle graph but you can see I highlighted sulfate with girl rock in Swan quarter on the right hand side they're much higher than all the other sites but gold rock highlighted in red had significantly higher ammonia than all other sites so the variability and pore water concentrations also increase with depth and slightly differ between sites so here on the left hand side you have total co2 concentrations in the middle is total methane concentrations and on the right is total nitrous oxide concentrations and soap or water methane differences among sites were kind of the opposite to those sulfate patterns you previously saw and so the sites with the highest sulfate which were gold walk-in swum quarter now have had had the lowest pore water methane and so this occurs because sulfate inhibits methane production and so there were also no differences in pore water nitrous oxide among sites or depth so one of the biggest differences between the two years of sampling was the amount of precipitation here I'm showing the average cumulative precipitation across sites throughout the growing season until 2018 shown in blue this was a much wetter year compared to 2019 which is shown in red which further affected greenhouse gas fluxes and soils and tree stems and so here I'm showing the co2 fluxes for tree stems and soils by year in cite the bolded text indicates significant factors using a two way ANOVA and overall tree stem greenhouse gas fluxes were five to six times less than soil fluxes and as you can see by the difference in the y axis between the two trees stem co2 fluxes did not differ between years but were different among sites while co2 fluxes on the right hand side were different between years and among sites with higher fluxes in 2019 due to the drier conditions and so following the same format these are the methane fluxes tree stem methane fluxes were significant different by site and here and there was also significant interaction effect and Gerlach had my tired tree stem methane and 2018 which then decreased in 2019 while all other sites increase from 2019 to night to 2018 to 2019 and then palmetto pear tree tree stem methane was much lower in concentration compared to all other sites and so soils so my thing did not differ by year but did decrease in variability and had a significant interaction effect and so lastly these are the nitrous oxide fluxes tree stem nitrous oxide fluxes differed by year and site with girl rock once again having much higher flexes and a decrease between 2018 to 2019 all other slides also had a slight decrease in tree stem nitrous oxide and so there was more variability for soils Edge's oxide fluxes between the years and among sites which made the interaction effects significant and so I used a Pearson correlation matrix to explore some of the relationships between tree stem and stole house gas fluxes as well as the correlation between gases themselves and here the strength of the color indicates a stronger correlation and this data is only for 2019 greenhouse gas fluxes so here I just want to walk you kind of through this figure what I'm highlighting here is the correlation between tree stem co2 flux and the soil co2 plug so they are positively correlated and this is the same for the trees that tree stem methane flux as well as the soil methane flux and this kind of lets us know that the the positive correlation lets us know that that the gases that are being emitted from the tree stems are more likely soul produced and this also occurs is a positive correlation between the tree stem and the soil nitrous oxide flux and so when I was looking at greenhouse gas relationships within tree stems and soils there is the negative effect a negative correlation between co2 and methane fluxes within tree stems and soil so you can see I highlighted the red boxes and the state of correlation also occurs between co2 and nitrous oxide fluxes but then when looking at the methane and nitrous oxide fluxes there is a positive correlation in both tree SEM and soils and so I created many of the new regression models to further determine which environmental factors explain the most variability for each tree semuc greenhouse gas and this is done for only 2019 data and so I build separate models by environmental group which are shown at the top to determine which factors were more important and I combined the factors that were significant had the highest explanatory power and so the weather parameters included the wind speed barometric pressure and temperature and the water parameters included water level and it's deviation specific conductivity and precipitation and this was done over different ranges looking at what those water parameters were the day of sampling one day before two days three days and seven days before actually sampling and so for tree stem co2 flux we were able to explain about 21% of the variation with wind speed which was negatively correlated specific connectivity which was also negatively correlated and mission and for tree stem methane fluxes were able to explain 83% of the variation and it was strongly explained by the soil methane flux which is positively correlated and specific connectivity which is also positively correlated and precipitation which is negatively correlated and so the specific connectivity and precipitation correlations are kind of opposite of what you would think so it kind of shows this disconnect between soil what drives soils and trees that methane flexes and so for treestand nitrous oxide fluxes we're able to explain about 52% of the variation and this was explained by soil and nitrous oxide fluxes and positively and then water level deviation which is positive as well and when we consider methane and nitrous oxide as co2 equivalents because as you may remember methane nitrous oxide are more important than co2 so we see that after converting to co2 equivalents co2 still contributes the most to overall radiative balance and trees and soils but in 2018 tree stem nitrous oxide contributed just as much as co2 and so this evidence of course the need to take trees and greenhouse gas emissions into account at the ecosystem level and so conclusion going back to our main questions do tree stem clean house gases differ from soils yes they are much lower than solar greenhouse gas fluxes do they differ across the sites yes but also the tree stem greenhouse gases responded differently to drought by site and so what are the main drivers of tree stem clean mouth gases this differed for each greenhouse gas and for co2 is largely driven by wind speed and precipitation and for methane it was mostly soil methane flux and for nitrous oxide for truth semi just oxide it was largely driven by soil and nitrous oxide and so lastly which tree Sam greenhouse gas contributes more to radiative balance it was still mostly co2 but it also depends on the precipitation so a driver is wet year because in a wet year the tree stem nitrous oxide fluxes were able to contribute the same amount as co2 fluxes and so I guess with that I'll take any questions oops thanks Melinda if you have a question I don't think there were any questions for Melinda typed into the chat if you want to unmute yourself and ask the question directly please go ahead or go ahead and use the chat and I can relay it in Melinda Anna has posted the feedback evaluation in the chat so he can also take a few minutes to do that before you leave Richardson hmm I have a quick question what were the units for the methane production per unit area within nanograms or milligrams milligrams per meter square per hour do you mean the seems quite high but maybe I'm remembering those wrong but yeah milligrams per minute all that we had yeah seems a bit high but that's what we've measured but um you know it is whatever you measured no yeah when I compared to other studies who's actually along the same lines as other cities and actually in places like the Amazon basin they've recorded tree stem I think to be as high as like 60 milligrams per meter square per hour right I was just concerned about the soil ones I didn't realize soils were quite that high well these are also like in wetlands they're they can be pretty high all right here's a question for you if the trees were harvested and removed before the marsh converts would that limit the ability of the greenhouse gas to be emitted or with retention in the soil so if they're harvested before Brahe if they're harvested before them well I guess you'd be removing all three gases but I don't look so because they're still intact they are emitting something but it's still not as much as soils so I guess the take home here is that they need to be taken into account the soils are still the largest contributor for all three gases I don't know that makes them what would be the result of harvesting some of the snags with that change the emissions or retention factors oh yeah I mean you'd be making way for I guess you'd be easing the transition from Forest to Marsh but it's kind of hard to say because these aren't even though they're transitioning and they are acting with straws these are also like new habitats for certain species and so you just kind of have to go with it and so I guess I don't know if harvesting would be the best John husband you asked the question at the tree um into mode versus soil and chemo do you want to elaborate on your question yeah [Music] and it was just striking to me how much more nitrous oxide yeah yeah I guess I thought maybe that the overall equivalence might be similar but this is pretty striking for nitrous oxide to me I don't I don't know what might be at work there at play I have not thought much about tree stem greenhouse gas flexes though yeah this is I feel like there's more recent studies coming out I mean a lot of I think tree stem gas emissions have been measured since this Seventeen's but it hasn't been a very popular subject and it's now being considered more important as an additional pathway to help kind of close some of these uncertainties and budgets in greenhouse gas budgets and so yeah like I was actually shocked to how in 2018 tree stem nitrous oxide fluxes can contribute you know just as much as the co2 but it varies because in 2019 it was much drier and so that really affected a lot I wonder how many years look more like 2018 how a verge of a response that might be yeah I'm not sure I would need more repeated measurements are you still collecting data right now or two years study I'm only plugging the data from one other site which was not mentioned here but I'm done with these sites um there's two questions for you why do you think greenhouse gas emissions were negatively correlated with wind speed yeah I was still trying to figure that out myself I'm not I'm not entirely sure yeah City has any ideas that secret yeah I had and then I guess the last question is from dr. Richardson with barrows level below which your methane was reduced to Sarah with I was very water level below which methane was reduced do you have a threshold amount value for women yeah what I'm wondering is we have found that if you kept the water level below the surface say hello say 10 or 15 centimeters then you get a certain amount of methane versus if you keep it at 5 centimeters or above so you were looking at different water levels and I'm just wondering if you happen to note when you would get a little more or less methane at any particular water level not for the soil flexes um for a 20-19 the water level was much lower than 2018 so it was reduced but I didn't necessarily affect the tree stems in fact it was actually higher and I think it's because for the tree stems the roots are still intact and so they're at they're getting nothing from deeper soils yeah deeper depth yeah all right we'll do one last question it said what happens with the tree stem emissions once the land around the trees are inundated with water what happens to whenever they're inundated well eventually these tree stems fall over like they don't last I mean they do last awhile but everyone's wrong whenever you get a hurricane you just get knocked over or you get knocked over and slows down decomposition and then it kind of becomes part of the soil but greenhouse gases from the soldier can still be diffused through the water column either through bubbling because you get like a an overabundance of greenhouse gases and then they just kind of bubble out - that must be here or it can just slowly diffuse through that water column so eventually I mean they'll be more likely if it's inundated it'll be more likely there will be higher methane production great job on this study there was one or two more questions that came in Melinda but you can look at after this and you can get back in touch with the people that asked them but we're at the end of our time so I want to thank you and all of our speakers today and wri for hosting this virtual session and I delimit have any closing words thank you so much Kim I will just wrap it up quickly I'll say thank you to our audience thank you to our moderator Kim and Carolina wetlands for sponsoring overall we appreciate your support thank you to Mike and Barack and Melinda I know you guys put a lot of effort into getting up getting dressed and putting on your expert hats this morning so we certainly appreciate it and again this recorded session will be posted within a few days on our conference website we will also follow up with that recording and also the evaluation to everyone once again so thank you for your time today and will we're planning a third session already so get ready coming in June hopefully we will have that ready to go so take care of Rigate thank you
