 the Soyuz TMA as a revision of the Soyuz spacecraft superseded in 2010 by the Soyuz TMA M tea transport needs transport nee meaning transport em modify serie Vantage modify any meaning modified a entropy Metro cess cage anthropometric Chesky meaning anthropometric it is used by the Russian Federal Space Agency for human spaceflight the spacecraft features several changes to accommodate requirements requested by NASA in order to service the international space station including more latitude in the height and weight of the crew and improved parachute systems it is also the first expendable vehicle to feature a glass cockpit Soyuz TMA looks identical to the earlier Soyuz TMA scraf the outside but interior differences allow it to accommodate taller occupants with new adjustable crew couches topic design a Soyuz spacecraft consists of three parts from front to back a spheroid orbital module a small aerodynamic reentry module a cylindrical service module with solar panels attached it the first two portions are habitable living space by moving as much as possible into the orbital module which does not have to be shielded or decelerated during atmospheric reentry the Soyuz three-part craft as both larger and lighter than the two part Apollo spacecrafts command module the Apollo command module had six cubic meters of living space and a mass of 5,000 kilograms the three part Soyuz provided the same crew with nine cubic meters of living space an airlock and a service module for the mass of the Apollo capsule alone this does not consider the orbital module that could be used instead of the Apollo lunar module Soyuz can carry up to three cosmonauts and provide life-support for them for about 30 person days the life-support system provides a nitrogen oxygen atmosphere at sea level partial pressures the atmosphere has regenerated through Keo two cylinders which absorb most of the co2 and water produced by the crew and regenerates the oxygen and lioh cylinders which absorb leftover co2 the vehicle is protected during launch by a nose fairing which is jettisoned after passing through the atmosphere it has an automatic docking system the ship can be operated automatically or by a pilot independently of ground control topic orbital module Bo the four part of the spacecraft as the orbital module in Russian by Devoy Asik Bo bitte voi oxic also known as habitation section it houses all the equipment that will not be needed for re-entry such as experiments cameras or cargo commonly it is used as both eating area and lavatory at its far end it also contains the docking port this module also contains a toilet docking avionics and communications gear on the latest Soyuz versions a small window was introduced providing the crew with a forward view a hatch between it and the descent module can be closed so as to isolate it to act as an airlock if needed cosmonauts exiting through its side port at the bottom of this picture near the descent module on the launch pad they have entered the spacecraft through this port this separation also lets the orbital module be customized to the mission with less risk to the life critical descent module the convention of orientation in zero-gravity differs from that of the descent module as cosmonauts stand or sit with their heads to the docking port topic re-entry module saw the reentry module in russian space game i apparat sauce bus game ii apparat saw is used for launch and the journey back to earth it is covered by a heat-resistant covering to protect it during re-entry it is slowed initially by the atmosphere then by a braking parachute followed by the main parachute which slows the craft for landing at 1 meter above the ground solid fuel braking engines mounted behind the heat shield are fired to give a soft landing one of the design requirements for the reentry module was for it to have the highest possible volumetric efficiency internal volume divided by hull area the best shape for this as a sphere but such a shape can provide no lift which results in a purely ballistic reentry ballistic reentry's are hard on the occupants due to high deceleration and can't be steered beyond their initial deorbit burn that is why it was decided to go with the headlight shape that the Soyuz uses a hemispherical forward area joined by a barely angled conical section 7 degrees to a classic spherical section heat shield this shape allows a small amount of lift to be generated due to the unequal weight distribution the nickname was coined at a time when nearly every automobile headlight was a circular paraboloid topic service module pal at the back of the vehicle as the service module in Russian preborn Oh aggregate nee datsuk preborn Oh aggregate neots ik pal it

part of the service module contains the main engine and a spare liquid fuel propulsion systems for maneuvering in orbit and initiating the descent back to earth the ship also has a system of low thrust engines for orientation attached to the intermediate compartment in Russian para hanno datsuk para hanoi oxic pkh o outside the service module are the sensors for the orientation system and the solar array which is oriented towards the Sun by rotating the ship topic re-entry procedure because it's modular construction differs from that of previous designs the Soyuz has an unusual sequence of events prior to re-entry the spacecraft has turned engine forward and the main engine as fired for de orbiting fully 180 degrees ahead of its planned landing site this requires the least propellant for re-entry the spacecraft traveling on an elliptical home in orbit to a point where it will be low enough in the atmosphere to re-enter early Soyuz spacecraft would then have the service and orbital modules detached simultaneously as they are connected by tubing and electrical cables to the descent module this would add in their separation and avoid having the descent module alter its orientation later Soyuz spacecraft detached the orbital module before firing the main engine which saves even more propellant enabling the descent module to return more payload in no case can the orbital module remain in orbit as an addition to a space station for the hatch enabling it to function as an airlock is part of the descent module re-entry firing is typically done on the dawn side of the earth so that the spacecraft can be seen by recovery helicopters as it descends in the evening Twilight illuminated by the Sun when it is above the shadow of the earth since the beginning of Soyuz missions to the ISS only five have performed nighttime landings topic spacecraft systems you thermal control system Systema obese pechenyi attempt Avago resume SOT our CI steamer obese pass any attempt level go

the Baikonur cosmodrome zku garen start launch pad in Kazakhstan at 4 hours 14 minutes and three seconds coordinated Universal Time the new modernized Soyuz TMA a.m. series was developed and built by rkk Energia as an upgrade of the baseline Soyuz TMA 36 obsolete pieces of equipment have been replaced with 19 new generation devices and the vehicles total mass has been reduced by 70 kilograms 154 pounds in particular the reliable but heavy 70 kilograms are gone digital computer and analog systems which had been used on Soyuz ships for more than 30 years has been replaced with a new digital computer the TSV m101 and digital avionics power consumption has been reduced throughout the ship there are also changes to the spacecraft structure such as replacing the magnesium alloy used in the instrument module frame with aluminium alloy to make the ship easier to manufacture the modernized Soyuz will also enable engineers to test new equipment which may also be used in Russia's next generation manned space ship that is currently under development nasa astronaut scott kelly part of soyuz tma oh one ms crew praised the ship's new displays saying that they make flying easier and less operator intensive to flight development flights were launched Soyuz TMA oh one M on October 7th 2010 and soyuz I am on June 7 2011 the third ship Soyuz TMA o3m launched on the 21st of December 2011 and was used for qualification tests in addition to verifying the nominal operation of the space ship the testing included verification of off nominal modes such as manual attitude control issuing of orbital maneuvering pulses using for berthing and attitude thrusters and flying around the ISS in manual control mode the TM AM variant flew 20 missions at a cadence of four times a year before being replaced in 2016 by the soyuz ms for the launch schedule see list of russian manned space missions
