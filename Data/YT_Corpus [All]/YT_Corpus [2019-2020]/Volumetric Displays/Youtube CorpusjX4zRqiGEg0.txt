 Kawamata Tsunemasa captures a lively landscape under cherry blossom in this view of Yasaka-jinja in Kyoto. He’s constructed a dramatic aerial perspective on the sprawling horizontal plane of the Japanese screens known as byobu, and which can fully embrace the architecture and see the people coming together from the city. Tsunemasa was an artist active in the first half of the eighteenth century and was considered the most highly regarded artist of the Kawamata school. He was contributing to a style that would become famous through ukiyo-e woodblock prints, particularly seen here through the slender figures that populate the painting. This painting also belongs to a genre known as meisho-e, literally meaning ‘pictures of famous places’, and commonly taking their subject and sites around the old capitals of Nara, Kyoto and Edo (present-day Tokyo). This was made at a time when Japanese borders were essentially closed and contact with the outside world was limited, and so artists and common people took great joy in celebrating the sites and landscapes of Japan. Yasaka-Jinja is a Shinto shrine sometimes known as the Gion Shrine, in the popular tourist area of Gion in Kyoto, it’s a shrine that’s been important for thousands of years, and is widely known across the city of Kyoto. The abundant cherry blossoms of sakura shown in Kawamata’s screen shows it is a spring scene, the season of new life. Hanami, or cherry blossom viewing is a popular past time in Japan and has been for hundreds of years. When people come together wearing the latest fashions and celebrate the coming of spring. The celebration captures the idea of admiring seasonal change and the short season of Hanami echoes a philosophy of impermanence and transience that underpins so much Japanese art and poetry, inviting us to welcome and appreciate short moments of beauty and times of change.
