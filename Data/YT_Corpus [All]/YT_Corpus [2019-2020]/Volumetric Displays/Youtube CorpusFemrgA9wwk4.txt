 Hi, here Fantom again Magnetostatics notes series part 3. Vision of invisible. In the introductory video, I said that I want to build my videos differently  from many authors of videos on magnetic motors, which show something spinning without the slightest attempt to explain anything or show the results of any measurements. It's time to be responsible for my words It's time to be responsible for my words We will start with the creation of measuring systems Without the ability to measure and visualize the interaction parameters of permanent magnets,  the study of magnetostatics will make very little sense  and will be akin to wandering in a forest at night It seems to me that for a conscious movement forward, we need to create three main systems of measurements:  a system for measurements and detailed visualization for the values of the magnetic field strength  a system for measuring the force of the linear interaction of parameters magnets  measuring the complex of dynamic parameters of the rotor rotation,  since the magnetic motor is a rotation system  Let's start in order Have you ever seen what a magnetic field looks like? In detail, as a high-resolution image? Not? Me too, have never seen it before On any physics book and Internet there are totally no such materials available You can find the results of mathematical modeling of the distribution of magnetic fields But how close they are to reality is a big question, since there are no objective means of verification Detailed visualization of magnetic fields To effectively build magnetic systems, we need to see how exactly magnetic fields from magnets or magnets combinations are distributed It is also a good idea to have measurements of the magnetic field strength at each point in the target area All this seems to be absolutely necessary for a conscious approach to the construction of magnetic systems  In general, it's very challenging be able to see in tiny detail, what is a picture of magnetic field strengths distribution  Because of topic of visualizing magnetic fields is very interesting in itself Have enough materials to produce dozens of videos  How detailed it is worth covering it in the next videos, I would be grateful to know from your comments on this video Please look to vote form on video below  Just repeat. Have enough materials to produce dozens of videos  Because for the topic of magnetic motors, the visualization system is just a necessary measuring tool  Let's continue What methods of visualizing magnetic fields are currently available? the oldest and the simplest Using a magnetic arrow or compass The 21st century in the yard is manifested only in the fact that options with a large number of arrows have appeared  Allows you to roughly visualize the direction to the poles of the magnetic field method is more suitable for demonstration in school lessons Iron filings Most popular in school textbooks and in many videos Dry on a smooth surface or in a viscous liquid.  In a magnetic field it forms chains of individual iron particles, which for obscure reasons are called “force magnetic lines”  The method allows for a qualitative assessment of the magnetic field strength in specific areas Next one - magnetic fluid Ferromagnetic nanoparticles suspended in a viscous liquid Placed in a magnetic field form intricate volumetric figures on the surface No other use other than purely aesthetic pleasure is visible  Last one - magnetic visualisation film Ferromagnet nanocapsules in a liquid between layers of a polymer film The capsules rotate under the influence of a magnetic field and either reflect light or transmit it  This is perhaps the most advanced visualization method available  Allows you to see the boundaries of zones of different magnetic field strengths well However, it is essentially binary The capsules either fully rotate or not  Accordingly, the method allows visualizing only sharp drops in the magnetic field strength  Perhaps these are all the visualization methods that I managed to find  The desire to make a system of normal visualization of magnetic fields appeared for a long time Soon after that, I managed to come up with a method to implement it But for other reasons, there was no time to translate everything into a real design When the situation forced us to suspend other projects, it became possible to finally turn the idea into a working system  Russian says: “There would be no happiness but unhappiness helped” As a measuring sensor, I chose a Hall effect sensor  Let me briefly recall the principle of its operation If we take a plate made of metal, connect a current source to its two opposite faces, tnen place the plate in a magnetic field with a strength vector that is perpendicular to the surface of the plate  Then an electric potential will appear on two free edges of the plate, proportional to the magnetic field strength The effect is purely superficially similar  to the experiment on deflecting an electron beam in a vacuum by a magnetic field, demonstrated at school The advantages of the Hall effect sensor include small size, low current consumption, relatively high speed and output signal level compatibility with most microcontrollers The disadvantages include the dependence of the measured value of the intensity on the angle between the magnetic field vector and the plane of the sensor crystal and some temperature instability However, if you remember this feature, then all undesirable moments can be leveled by constructive solutions of the sensor system and computer processing of measurement results Let's look to block diagram The measuring controller is based on the STM32 microcontroller.  To enter the values of the magnetic field strength, the built-in ADC of the microcontroller is used The controller is connected to a computer via a serial interface to which the measurement data of the tension are transmitted for further processing by a special software What can be obtained as a result of using this complex? Let's look for example, the dependence of the magnetic field strength on time, when the sensor unit passes over the pole of a cubic neodymium magnet 10x10x10mm.  Now let's add a graph of the field when the sensor passes over the side face  of the same magnet - green curve However, this one-dimensional map of tensions turned out to be insufficient for normal analysis I wanted to understand how the field strength is distributed over the plane 2D result As a result, a sensor positioning unit was added to the measuring complex  The positioning unit is based on two stepper motors and microcontroller a controller connected to a computer via a serial interface It able to provides positioning of the sensor o the desired point of the scanning field with an error of 0.05mm The sensor block become to consists of three Hall sensors faced to three orthogonal planes As a result, we can measure the strength of the magnetic field, the vector of which comes from any direction Some complexity arises only in the algorithm for processing this data, but more on that later The computer software receives and initially filters the incoming data, then displays them by encoding the value of the magnetic field strength at each point with a shade of color and placing them on the image field according to the exact coordinates of each point What is the described measuring complex parameters?  It allows obtaining a map of the distribution of magnetic field strengths in the plane with a linear resolution of 0.1 mm  a step in intensity of magnetic field of 0.16 G with a less sensitive set of sensors  and 0.04 G with a more sensitive set  The maximum size of the scanning area is 150 x 150 mm  Let's see how this complex allows you to see the magnetic field distribution  We take same 10x10x10mm cubic neodymium magnet  Let's run! Now on let's display this scan in pseudo 3D format  It's not field shape. Field dos not have a shape.  Just in addition to the color, the tension value will be displayed as the virtual height of the point above the plane Now let's take a scan of the field in the plane of the side face of the magnet, where its equator passes. Of course, this is just a small part of the data obtained by me when scanning the fields of various magnets  In order not to make the video too long, let's stop at this point  Repeat my request to vote using the link at the bottom of the video What will be more interesting for you to continue the publication of the distribution of magnetic fields of various magnets, or proceed to the next step on the way of researching magnetic motors See you in the next videos Thank you for your attention Here was Fantom
