 scientific visualization also spelled scientific visualization is an interdisciplinary branch of science according to friendly 2008 it is primarily concerned with the visualization of three-dimensional phenomena architectural meteorological medical biological etc where the emphasis is on realistic renderings of volumes surfaces illumination sources and so forth perhaps with a dynamic time component it is also considered a subset of computer graphics a branch of computer science the purpose of scientific visualization is to graphically illustrate scientific data to enable scientists to understand illustrate and glean insight from their data topic history one of the earliest examples of three-dimensional scientific visualization was Maxwell's thermodynamic surface sculpted in clay in 1874 by James Clark Maxwell this prefigured modern scientific visualization techniques that use computer graphics notable early two-dimensional examples include the flow map of napoleon's march on Moscow produced by Charles Joseph Minard in 1869 the cockscombs used by Florence Nightingale in 1857 as part of a campaign to improve sanitary conditions in the British Army and the dot map used by John snow in 1855 to visualize the Broad Street cholera outbreak topic methods for visualizing two-dimensional data sets scientific visualization using computer graphics gained in popularity as graphics matured primary applications were scalar fields and vector fields from computer simulations and also measured data the primary methods for visualizing two dimensional 2d scalar fields are color mapping and drawing contour lines 2d vector fields are visualized using glyphs and streamlines or line integral convolution methods to D tensor fields are often resolved to a vector field by using one of the two eigenvectors to represent the tensor each point in the field and then visualized using vector field visualization methods topic methods for visualizing three-dimensional datasets for 3d scalar fields the primary methods of volume rendering and isosurfaces methods for visualizing vector fields include glyphs graphical icons such as arrows stream lines and streaklines particle tracing line integral convolution LIC and topological methods later visualization techniques such as hyper streamlines were developed to visualize 2d and 3d tensor fields topic scientific visualization topics you topic computer animation computer animation is the art technique and science of creating moving images via the use of computers it is becoming more common to be created by means of 3d computer graphics though 2d computer graphics are still widely used for stylistic low bandwidth and faster real-time rendering needs sometimes the target of the animation is the computer itself but sometimes the target is another medium such as film it is also referred to as CGI computer-generated imagery or computer-generated imaging especially when used in films applications include medical animation which is most commonly utilized as an instructional tool for medical professionals or their patients topic computer simulation computer simulation is a computer program or network of computers that attempts to simulate an abstract model of a particular system computer simulations have become a useful part of mathematical modeling of many natural systems in physics and computational physics chemistry and biology human systems in economics psychology and social science and in the process of engineering and new technology to gain insight into the operation of those systems or to observe their behavior the simultaneous visualization and simulation of a system is called visual ation computer simulations vary from computer programs that run a few minutes to network based groups of computers running for hours to ongoing simulations that run for months the scale of events being simulated by computer simulations has far exceeded anything possible or perhaps even imaginable using the traditional paper and pencil mathematical modeling over ten years ago a desert battle simulation of one force invading another involved the modeling of sixty six thousand two hundred and thirty nine tanks trucks and other vehicles on simulated terrain around Kuwait using multiple supercomputers in the DAAD high performance computing modernization program topic information visualization information visualization is the study of the visual representation of large-scale collections of non numerical information such as files and lines of code in software systems library and bibliographic databases networks of relations on the internet and so forth information visualization focused on the creation of approaches for conveying abstract information in intuitive ways visual representations and interaction techniques take advantage of the human eyes broad bandwidth pathway into the mind to allow users to see explore and understand large amounts of information at once the key difference between scientific visualization and information visualization is that information visualization is often applied to data that is not generated by scientific inquiry some examples are graphical representations of data for business government news and social media topic interface technology and perception interface technology and perception shows how new interfaces and a better understanding of underlying perceptual issues create new opportunities for the scientific visualization community topic surface rendering rendering is the process of generating an image from a model by means of computer programs the model is a description of three-dimensional objects in a strictly defined language or data structure it would contain geometry viewpoint texture lighting and shading information the image is a digital image or raster graphics image the term may be by analogy with an artist's rendering of a scene rendering is also used to describe the process of calculating effects in a video editing file to produce final video output important rendering techniques are scanline rendering and rasterization a high-level representation of an image necessarily contains elements in a different domain from pixels these elements are referred to as primitives in a schematic drawing for instance lines segments and curves might be primitives in a graphical user interface windows and buttons might be the primitives in 3d rendering triangles and polygons in space might be primitives ray casting ray casting is primarily used for real-time simulations such as those used in 3d computer games and cartoon animations where detail is not important or where it is more efficient to manually fake the details in order to obtain better performance in the computational stage this is usually the case when a large number of frames need to be animated the resulting surfaces have a characteristic flat appearance when no additional tricks used as if objects in the scene were all painted with matte-finish radiosity radiosity also known as global illumination is a method that attempts to simulate the way in which directly illuminated surfaces act as indirect light sources that illuminate other surfaces this produces more realistic shading and seems to better capture the ambience of an indoor scene a classic example is the way that shadows hug the corners of rooms ray tracing ray tracing is an extension of the same technique developed in scanline rendering and ray casting like those it handles complicated objects well and the objects may be described mathematically unlike scanline and casting ray tracing is almost always the Monte Carlo technique that is one based on averaging a number of randomly generated samples from a model topic volume rendering volume rendering is a technique used to display a 2d projection of a 3d discreetly sampled data set a typical 3d data set is a group of 2d slice images acquired by a CT or MRI scanner usually these are acquired in a regular pattern eg one slice every millimeter and usually have a regular number of image pixels in a regular pattern this is an example of a regular volumetric grid with each volume element or voxel represented by a single value that is obtained by sampling the immediate area surrounding the voxel topic volume visualization according to rosenbloom 1994 volume visualization examines a set of techniques that allows viewing an object without mathematically representing the other surface initially used in medical imaging volume visualization has become an essential technique for many Sciences portraying phenomena become an essential technique such as clouds water flows and molecular and biological structure many volume visualization algorithms are computationally expensive and demand large data storage advances in hardware and software the generalising volume visualization as well as real-time performances developments of web-based technologies and in browser rendering have allowed of simple volumetric presentation of a cuboid with a changing frame of reference to show volume mass and density data the how much tool produced by this equals

Times Square in the image the results from the samr AI simulation framework of an atmospheric anomaly in and around Times Square are visualized topic in mathematics scientific visualization of mathematical structures has been undertaken for purposes of building intuition and for aiding the forming of mental models higher dimensional objects can be visualized in form of projections views in lower dimensions in particular for dimensional objects are visualized by means of projection in three dimensions the lower dimensional projections of higher dimensional objects can be used for purposes of virtual object manipulation allowing 3d objects to be manipulated by operations performed in 2d and 4d objects by interactions performed in 3d topic in the formal sciences computer mapping of topographical surfaces through computer mapping of topographical surfaces mathematicians contest theories of how materials will change when stressed the imaging is part of the work on the nsf-funded electronic visualization laboratory at the University of Illinois at Chicago curve plots visit can plot curves from data read from files and it can be used to extract and plot curve data from higher dimensional datasets using lineout operators or queries the curves in the featured image correspond to elevation data along lines drawn on dem data and were created with the feature line out capability lineout allows you to interactively draw a line which specifies a path for data extraction the resulting data was then plotted as curves image annotations the featured pot shows leaf area index lie a measure of global vegetative matter from a netcdf data set the primary plot is the large plot at the bottom which shows the life of the whole world the plots on top are actually annotations that contain images generated earlier image annotations can be used to include material that enhances of visualizations such as auxilary plots images of experimental data project logos etc scatter plot visits scatter plot allows visualizing multivariate data of up to four dimensions the scatter plot takes multiple scalar variables and uses them for different axes in phase space the
