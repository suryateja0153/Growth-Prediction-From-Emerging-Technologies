 hello everyone and welcome back to another blender made easy video in this video we are gonna be looking at the blender viewport how big is the blender viewport at one point or another everyone who has used blender has taken an object and scaled it up very very big this is fun and all but it got me thinking of how big the viewport actually is can you scale up an object infinitely is there a limit to figure this out I opened up blender and selected the default cube and of course I deleted it from there I added in a new fresh cube and then I pressed end to open up the property panel over on the right side it displays the location of whatever you have selected so from there I decided to take that Z Direction going in the positive direction I added a bunch of numbers until I couldn't go any higher that number is this now I'm not gonna even attempt to try to figure out what this number is or how you say it so I'm just gonna leave that up to you guys if you can figure it out I will pin that comment keep this in mind this is going in the positive z direction we also need to take into account at the negative Z so what we need to do is just multiply this by 2 that gives us this number now this number is extremely big and you don't really understand the true scale of it so let's go ahead and do a little bit of comparing with real-world objects let's first convert this to miles so we can actually determine the distance this comes to this number right here or if you're not from the US it comes to this number in kilometers the distance around the world is 24,901 miles so what you would have to do to travel that distance in blender is you would have to go around the world this many times let's go a little bit bigger the circumference of the Sun is two million seven hundred and twenty thousand nine hundred and eighty four miles around so you would have to go around the Sun this many times to reach that same distance in the blender viewport let's go even bigger one light year is about five point eight eight trillion miles so let's take our original number of miles and divide it by five point eight eight trillion to see how many light years we would have to travel in order to reach the top of the blender viewport our galaxy is only estimated to be about a hundred thousand light-years across so let's see how many galaxies can fit going straight up in blender which comes out to seven hundred and nineteen a quadrillion 191 trillion so yeah you know what the number is right there you can just look at it you would have to stack those many galaxies going straight up to reach the top of the blender viewport that is pretty insane I also forgot to mention that in order to figure out the square space you would also need to take into account the X and the y direction you would have to take that original number of miles and multiply it by itself and then you would have to multiply that by itself one more time which comes out to actually that number is too big for the online calculator to handle well there you have it guys that is the true scale of the blender viewport and you might be asking yourself what was the point I'm creating this video well
