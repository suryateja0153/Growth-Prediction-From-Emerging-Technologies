 okay this chapter is on post processing and specifically we're going to be defining some terms related to reformatting and retrospective reconstruction as well as talking about different forms of reformats like mprs as well as the both the limitations and the benefits of these different kinds of ways of orienting the picture so broadly post processing impacts two things and the big things are reconstruction and reformatting reconstruction is any time that raw data is used to create an image and a reformat is when an image is reassembled to produce images in a different plane or to produce like 3d images it's significant to note that these things are very very different so for example reconstruction is largely handled by the computer and the reason it's called reconstruction is because the image is the data is first deconstructed into a matrix and then reconstructed into an image a reformat is done solely on image data and it is just formatting the way that the data is displayed so retrospective reconstruction we can change a whole lot of things about how image data is reconstructed but we cannot change the orientation so it needs to be exactly the same orientation for example if the images were acquired in axial we will reconstruct into an axial view but the things that we can change our the display field of view so say the scan was scanned at too small of it's quite a display field of view we can increase that we can also change the ISO center or the image center we can change the reconstruction algorithm so for example we could add a filter to filter out metal or we could use iterative reconstruction techniques in this retrospective reconstruct part we can change the slice incrementation only if we're using a helical or volumetric data set if it was acquired axially we will not be able to change the slice increment or we will get like a stair-step kind of artifact we can also change the image thickness if we're using a multi detector CT system so um the significance here is that and we'll talk a little bit more about overlapping and stuff in just a moment but the significance here is that we want to use very often will want to use a thin slice for scanning and then reconstruct thicker slices for viewing because then in storing those images it's going to be more easy to manage those files and we will maintain spatial resolution so sometimes there is a need for an overlapping reconstruction and for the activity for this class we are going to look a little bit at whether or not we need to do an overlapping reconstruction so let's spend a little time talking about this one thing to bear in mind is how pixels and voxels are understood by a CT scanner so it mentions that overlapping reconstructions are not necessary if foxholes are isotropic what does that mean she gives an example in our textbook of this in it's on page 182 in clinical application Bach eight box 82 if I have two dimensions of data like an X and a y dimension of data so this would be in my X dimension this will be my y dimension I'm going to call this a pixel all right but if I include a third dimension in the form of a z-axis right so here I have a z-axis going off in this direction this is now a voxel because it has a certain depth to it so when we talk about bit depth and stuff like that it's a little bit different because what we're talking about now is the distance that this pixel value is said to represent and that that distance is basically the thickness of the slice so for example if we have slices that were acquired at 2.5 right that means that each each element here for example is 2.5 millimeters thickness of data alright so I guess the question then is what happens if we have a tumor volume here it will then be partial volume averaged right so we would these two slices would have split that measurement in half and we would not have an accurate display of that so we what we might mean need to do is change and increase the number of reconstructions to include stuff in the gaps right so that we adequately display all that information in general overlapping reconstructions are not necessary if the voxels are isotropic that means if this was a 2.5 right here and we also only moved it to point 5 so the pitches of one then we don't need an overlapping reconstruction but if we're increasing the pitch of the CT scanner beyond one we may need to produce overlapping reconstructions another case that she mentions is we may not need to do overlapping reconstructions if the slice thickness is very thin so 0.5 millimeters and less with a field of view that's very small like less than 25 centimeters overlapping general reconstructions generally are not worth the inconvenience associated with storing this larger data set there's not going to be anything really added to the information so we can retrospectively reformat the image to change the thickness of the slice and that's precisely what we're doing when we when we do overlapping reconstruction on a multi detector system the data from parallel rows of detectors can be combined so sometimes we use a thinner slice for scanning but then we reconstruct at a thicker slice reviewing and storing this is going to maintain a high resolution for the image and it also makes the workflow more manageable I think I talked about it in some of the other classes but basically given the amount of CT scanning that we're doing this day and age radiologists are seeing quite a few of these images in fact one institution i looked at the radiologists were required basically to read or interpret an image every three to four seconds so anything we can do to help manage that data volume they will appreciate so that was a image reconstruction now we're going to talk about imagery formatting which is totally different um sometimes some texts refer to it as image rendering but when we reformat a CT study first of all all of these things must be absolutely identical they must have the same display field of view the same isocenter or image center the same gain a gantry tilt and there needs to be no gaps between the information so sometimes if we're going to do real fancy reformats we may need to do overlapping reconstruction prior to the reformat but again I don't want students to get tripped up by this so reconstruction the reason we call it reconstruction is because the images the data is first deconstructed into a mate a matrix in order to construct the image image reformatting we are just formatting the image for viewing so we are using image data we're no longer using raw data we're using image data for imagery formatting we are going to generate images in a different plane or orientation and we can better display relationships this way we can do these three dimensionally or two dimensionally or we can do two dimensional images that actually account for the intensity of a sample and in general the thinner of the original slice the better the reformatted image will appear so multiplanar reformat or NPR is going to be a two-dimensional image but it can be oriented in any of these different directions so it might be in the coronal plane of like sagittal or even reconstructed in the axial plane one thing of note here since mprs r2d in nature they will retain the original CT attenuation value so we will be able to measure a Hounsfield unit off of an NPR that will not be the case when we talk about three-dimensional imaging so here are some examples of multiplanar reformats in particular these look like they're imaging the aorta or maybe the the heart in fact this view up here is coronal sagittal and this is an oblique view that allows us very nicely to see almost the entire a ortak arch a curved planar reformat are created along the centerline of a tubular organ and so the texts are manually putting in waypoints for the machine to create a curvilinear imagery format plane so here's an example of the entire carotid artery more or less from the arch of the aorta up into the brain and this was done in a curved planar reformat because if you can imagine here's the arch of the aorta with the carotid artery branching off and then it goes back midline and so essentially what they've done is they've put way points along the length of the carotid artery to tell the Machine exactly how it should be reformatting and it created a plane of reformatting that's essentially like that so as it is it slices through the anatomy we got a single slice with the entire carotid artery on it 3d reformats are going to represent an entire scan volume on a single image and so the techniques that we're going to use to manipulate the data is we're not going to be able to include the original Hounsfield unit values and basically it creates an imaginary line from the viewer through the data volume and so it's going to generate manipulator along that line it will shade the data in order to give it a 3d so the first part these are largely older in technology or technique the surface rendering I think a lot about older video games if you've ever been playing a video game and you've seen it maybe through the map be the world to kind of a gray space or an area that looks strange that kind of uncanny valley they call it in programming language that's because its surface rendered so there's nothing beyond that surface there's no actual volume to what you're seeing so she has an example in the textbook found on page 86 of a surface rendered image of a foot and you can actually see portions of the bone that appear almost kind of cardboard cutout cut out looking so only the voxels on the surface of the structure are used and this is this technique has largely been replaced by volume rendering so here are the MIPS and this is an interesting way of thinking about three dimensional data and though you may say this still looks two-dimensional to me but what the computer has done is it's gone through and it's selected the voxels with the highest value to display throughout the 3d volume so for example we have these nice beautiful clear views of the aorta on these images and here we have this oblique view up here where we see the entire a orta in a single view and we're seeing it as a myth as a maximum intensity projection and so all of the values that are higher are being displayed right now men it's our minimum intensity projections and largely these are only used when we're viewing the lungs or the trachea and now we're going to select the voxels with the lowest value to display so in this case we can clearly see the trachea and both lungs volume rendering this is like in in contrast to the surface rendering in this case we're able to see the entire volume of all the voxels that are included in the image and so this allows us to display multiple tissues in the relationship to each other also with a volume rendered 3d image we can actually go slice by slice through the 3d volume and see the relationships to things within themselves in their luminal reformats are a form of virtual reality and they allow a perspective of a volume rendering or like virtual fly-through any kind of luminal space so this could be a bronchoscopy virtual bronchoscopy or CT virtual colonoscopy and it's designed to look just through the lumen of that structure so you can kind of fly through the colon or through the bronchioles so region of interest editing is done to remove or obscure structures from the 3d image so the software allow this in either a manual automatic or semi-automatic fashion so for example looking at the discussion earlier we talked about the carotid artery if we're tracking the carotid artery up and it goes up eventually it passes through the base of the skull in this area and if we want to look at this as a three-dimensional view right we might have to subtract out a portion of the skull but the problem is is if I highlight this area here with an ROI it will start to populate out everything that has the same attenuation value as the region that I've highlighted with the ROI so it will grow out this carotid artery up through the area of interest but when it reaches the bone of the skull it will start to grow out the skull similarly if there's any kind of streak artifact like say the patient has metal teeth or shouldnt say metal teeth of dentures or orthopedic or any kind of a streak artifact occurs it could eventually start to grow out into the street artifact as well anything that has the attenuation value that I first indicated with the ROI so that is both a advantage there is that you can quickly grow out an arterial study disadvantage is that it may include areas that were not of interest so there's a number of things that can detract from a reformatted image segmental images are our segmental errors I should say our anytime that there's a gap between data sets so say we used a reconstruction had some gaps between the data we will see segmental Aires where we can see the gaps between the data set any kind of image noise will impact the quality of our image and so if we look at page 91 in our textbook we can see a number of artifacts that are caused one in particular figure 8 12 has some motion that has distorted the view of the aorta metal as I indicated before can cause a metal artifact or a streak on the image that might influence any kind of reformat and then if we if the vault if the data set was initially acquired axially we will not be able to do any kind of three-dimensional or a black or perhaps even coronal reformats will get a stair-step by artifact we can see that on figure 8-13 in our textbook alright that concludes the this lecture this portion of the lecture thank you very much
