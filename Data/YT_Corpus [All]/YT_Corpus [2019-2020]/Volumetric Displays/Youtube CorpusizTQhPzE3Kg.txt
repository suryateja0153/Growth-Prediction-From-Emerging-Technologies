 [Music] [Music] hello and welcome everyone here in the fourth lecture of this online structural geology course and today's topic is stereographic projection and its application in structural geology so what we will cover today is mostly the basic concepts and construction of stereographic projection the different components of stereo net and finally we will see how to plot structural data on stereo net now before we go to the actual topic of stereographic projections let's have some ideas that what is a projection now imagine a globe that we have all seen and you also have seen the map the world map which we see in our computer screen or a piece of paper which is flat and what we see in a sphere is not flat now how this spherical map is converted to this map is a question and if you try to do that that means say if you break this globe and then try to make a rectangular area interestingly you cannot do it if you have to fit it you have to stretch some areas you have to deform some areas of this globe and then only you can make this flat map now the stretching or deformation of this globe or pieces of this globe is the concept of projection and the stretching or deformation of these pieces you just don't do it randomly you do it using some mathematical relations mathematical formulations and therefore you achieve the projection of the map on a flat surface from a globe now there are many ways one can project the map so the different ways are essentially a function of that what is your need of projecting the map so based on that people do project the map in different ways now this is not only valid for map you actually can project anything in any different ways so this illustration that we see these are human faces is one human face and you can see that based on the different Greed's that we see the face has been projected differently in this area so this is one of the classic projections that I took from a book and it's date it dates back of 1921 what is important that I said already that any projection or any projection operation involves extremely complex mathematics so you can do with them whatever you want to as long as each point on the on the map or on the object you are projecting to are mathematically defined so there are many ways of projections but in structural geology they are mostly for different ways we project maps one is conformal one is equal area one is equidistant and another is equal angle now all these four are somehow related to each other for example in conformal projection it preserves the same scale in every direction locally thus it maintains the correct correct shape and the features on the other hand the equidistant projection depicts the correct distance between a point at the center of the projection and points in any direction away from the center so conformal mapping keeps the shape and equidistant projection keeps the distance between two objects equal area and equal angle equal area map you preserve the area but it distorts the shape and in equal angle you keep all the angular relationships equal to the projected map now it is important to understand here that you cannot have all of the above or all of this conformal mapping equal area mapping equidistant mapping and equal angle mapping in a single map because though they are somehow related but you cannot project them together so instruction geology you use stereographic projections mostly to plot or display orientation data we have learnt about different orientation data about planar features about linear features and so on what is most important that you can collect data from the field and then you can gather in a single place and plot them in the stereo net so in addition to that a still unit can also used to do complex calculations such as rotations calculating lines of intersections etcetera etcetera we will learn all of these so in general what we'd see in stereo net what we generally see it is essentially looks like the globe in in plane and it has some Greed's there are some vertical grids and there are some horizontal grids the vertical grids are known as great circles and it's very analogous to what we call longitude running from one pole to another pole and then there are some small circles that runs that run from east to west of this circle so in this image the great circles are marked by blue color and small circles are marked by orange color now as I said that there are many different projection styles there are many different possibilities so in structural geology there are two different types of stereo nets that we use one is equal area and another is equal angle equal area map is also known as meet Lambert innate and equal angle projection is also known as wolf project or the stereo net is known as wolf net the advantage of equal area projection is that it minimizes the area distortion as it defines so it better analyzes the data accuracy and it's also easier for data continuing on the other hand the equal angles alternate it does an excellent kinematic analysis it does a good job in analyzing the angular relationships and therefore it is suitable for strain analysis in this lecture and in most of the structural geology operations at least in basic levels people use mostly coal area net so in this lecture we will also use the Equality on it unless we state otherwise in some places okay let's go to the concept of the stereographic projection a stereographic projections generally as we have seen it's a circular area but what is the circle now this circle is achieved by inserting a horizontal plane inside a sphere as you can see here on the left side you have a sphere and if I insert this green horizontal plane through the equator of this sphere then it creates a circle in the middle and this is your stereo net or projection plane this circle is also known as primitive circle as you can see here here are these are your great circles on different sides and these are your small circles running from west to east so we will see now that how using this concept of stereographic projection what we have learnt in our last lecture that will plot a line will plot a plane and we will also learn how to plot the normal of a plane in the stereo net let's look how to plot a line now the fundamentals of plotting a line in the stereo net is you have a line which is inclined and you have to pass this line through the center of the sphere and also through the center of this primitive circle or projection plane if you do that then the line would intersect the surface of the sphere two times one at the upper hemisphere which is the point a here and one at the lower hemisphere which is point B here now this is only possible if the line is inclined if the line is horizontal then it would probably lie on the equatorial claim but that's not that's not the case we are discussing here so because we will be projecting on the lower hemisphere we call it lower hemisphere projection so we'll be concerned or will be concerning with only the point B so this point B if we consider which is actually the line this would also intersect at a middle point of this projection plane or the primitive circle now to project this line on this primitive circle the task is to draw a line connecting the zenith of the sphere which is the Point C here and the point P that is the intersection point between the line we are concerned with and the sphere now how will we do that when we connect this line from B to C it also passes through the projection plane and we get a point here which is D now this point D is actually your projection of the line that we have seen before so if I now project this circle in plane then the point D would appear somewhere here and this is the projection of this inclined line on the stereo net let's have a look how to project a plane on the stereo net or what is the basic of projecting a plane on the stereo net it's very similar the way we projected the line but because it's a plane so it involves a little complexity but first let us define the plane in this diagram what we see we have this blue sphere the zenith is there then this is your equatorial plane and we have a plane which is orange in color here and inclined and also we have a green horizontal plane now this green horizontal plane and this yellow and the orange sloping plane would intersect along a line and from the definition we learned on the last lecture this line is your strike line and the orientation of this line with respect to magnetic north is your strike of this sloping orange plane the angle it makes with the horizontal on vertical plane is the deep angle in this case this is alpha now this plane is inserted such a way through this circle that it passes through the center of the sphere again we are concerned with the lower hemisphere so I sort of made the top part little transparent to get better focus on the lower hemisphere and what we see here that when this plane is passed through the centre of the sphere intersects the projection plane or the primitive circle along a line a and B okay now this line is very important because this is your strike line we can also figure out that the intersection of this sphere and this plane also makes an intersection plane which is highlighted by orange color here and this is the intersection plane between the dipping plane and the sphere so the challenge task is to project this intersection plane in the projection plane and you can clearly visualize that this sort of semicircle is the axial plane we were concerned with so we have to project it on the projection plane now to do that as we have done with the line will draw a series of lines from the age of this intersection plane and the sphere to the zenith so all these violet lines if we can connect continuously it would produce some sort of a cone and this cone individual lines of this cone would also intersect on this projection plane now it is possible that you can connect all the points starting from A to B by a curved line now this curved line is actually the projection of the dipping plane on the projection plane so if we now see the projection plane only then it appears something like this so this a and B these are the two points and this blue line actually these are different points that we have drawn which are the intersection lines between this plane at the lower hemisphere and connecting it to the zenith of the sphere and we have connected these points through a curve and this curve is actually the projection plane that represents the dipping plane on the stereo net and the deep angle is this one how to read it or how to interpret all these type of features differently we will learn it later so to visualize this in a different way that whether we are actually projected our plane to this stereo net here is a different illustration now what we see here this is the sloping plane that we are concerned with the sloping plane passed through the center of the sphere now this is the half sphere this is the lower hemisphere so this line this intersection line between the equatorial plane and this projectile plane is your strike line and this angle here is your deep angle now if I make this and see this in plan view then this is the strike line this is the projection of the plane and this angle defines the deep angle of this plane and rest is 90 degree minus your deep angle or which is in this case alpha let's have a look how to plot the pole of a plane or what are the basics or darts the theoretical ideas when we plot the pull of a plane on the street unit so pole of a plane is nothing but the normal line of on the plane so if I have a sloping plane like this then the normal to the plane is the pole of this plane okay the challenge is to plot this line on the stereo net given I have the plane on the stereo net so it is very similar the way we have plotted the line but we use somehow different technique because we don't have the data of the line or the line is not there we have the plane only so the normal of a pole of a dipping plane is an imaginary line perpendicular to the dipping plain and as I said it can be considered as a linear element so projection are projecting the normal or the pole of the dipping plane therefore has a similar principle of projecting a line what we see here in this diagram this is again you can you may remember this is the plane we were concerned with and then we have to draw a normal on this plane so this red line here is the normal to the plane now because we will be doing lower hemisphere projection so we will extend this line so that it passes through the lower hemisphere and intersects the lower hemisphere and here is the point where it intersects with the lower hemisphere now the task is simple we have the intersection point at the lower hemisphere then we connect this point to the zenith it would intersect somewhere on the projection plane or on the equatorial plane or on the primitive circle and this point is the pole of this plane projected on the surface so this is how it looks like once we are ready with the projection so the plane is similar plane that we have projected before this blue line and now this point a here is the projection of the plane of the blue line which is a dipping plane on the stereo net now this is your deep angle as we have seen before and this angle from here to here is 90 degree and therefore it is the pole of this plane which is a blue line in this diagram now I believe the concept is clear we'll try to see how if a data of plane line or any other structural measurements are given then how to plot them in this tree unit now generally in classes we show students directly but here because this is an online lecture it was not possible to show you one-to-one or sitting on a desk so what I try to do I try to give a series of illustrations that would at least help you to understand how it is done all the illustrations are given very clearly with arrows and other features and what is being done with all these illustrations I have given instructions or the steps written on the right side so again the way we understood how the projections are done or what are the basic concepts of the projections from line then to claim and then pull of a plane will follow the same sequence and refers to it first start with plotting a line in stereo net so let's start with a lineage n' with an attitude 33 1 0 that means it has a plans 30 degrees and trained 3 1 0 degrees to plot this data on the stereo net you need a stereo net you can download it from internet but be sure that you are downloading an equal area stereo net and if you can't find you can write to me or you can ask any of the teaching assistants they can help you and then once you downloaded this stereo net you print it keeping the aspect ratio constant and mount carefully on a hard board once you are done then you have to have a tracing paper to cover entirely the stereo net so in this illustration or in the following illustrations this background the white color is your stereo net and it will be referred as tea doughnut throughout and this translucent bluish paper with a little folding on this south corner is your tracing paper so to plot this line what do you have to do first you have to trace the circle on the study unit the primitive circle on the studio net and mark the north with an arrowhead as it is done here at point B now our lineage n' trends three one zero degree so you have to find the three one zero degree on the primitive circle in this case the three one zero degree is Point C in this illustration now you have to rotate the stressing paper such a way that these three one zero degree trend mark aligns with either the east or west side of the steel unit along the equatorial plane now once it is done then you count the plunge angle which is 30 degree along the equator from the three one zero degree mark which is aligned with the equator and mark the point as D so in this stereo net which is at the bottom each grid is ten degrees so here we count ten twenty thirty and we arrive at this point D and then once you are done then you rotate back the tracing paper so that the north mark on it that you made on the tracing paper at the very beginning aligns to the north of the stereo net and this would also align simultaneously the three one zero degree mark on the tracing paper to the three one zero degree mark of the stereo net now this would also rotate this point D that we have marked in the previous step so this is the point D and this point is the plot of the lineage n' with the attitude 30 degree three one zero on the stereo net now let's see how we can plot a plane on the stereo net in this case we have the x example of a dipping claim with the data 0 6 0 / 75 degree southeast that means it strike is 60 degree it dips 75 degree towards southeast direction now the initial steps are very similar that means you have to mount carefully your stereo net on a hard board and then you have to find a tracing paper that covers the interested unit and then you place it over the stereo net again you mark or you trace the primitive circle on the tracing paper and you mark the North which is here the point B on the tracing paper now as the strike is 60 degrees so in a very similar way you mark the strike 60 degree on the tracing paper the way it is done in the previous step and then you this time you don't align this 60 degree towards the east or west you align this to the north so you rotate this stereo net such a way that it aligns to the 60 degree the 60 degree mark to the north of the stereo net okay as the strike line is aligned vertical because this is your strike line and you can see this is aligned vertical so the deep direction should be on either side of the strike line so if I have this fine strike line it can dip either this side or it can be either this side unless the bed is not vertical but in this case it is not vertical we know it is dipping 75 degree towards southeast so now I have rotated my steel unit and with this arrow head here I know that this is my North if this is not then this is my South this would be waste and then this would be East if this is so and the bed is dipping on the south east side so it must dip in this direction so we have to count therefore from the east or the equatorial intersection here 75 degree towards the center of this steel unit so again the grids are 10 degrees so we count 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 and here you have 75 degrees and you mark this 75 degrees point with a dot now these tasks require requires a little skill but with practice you can do it very easily what you have to do you have to carefully draw a great circle containing the strike line intersections that means your North Pole and South Pole and the 75 degree dot that you have made on the previous step these other great circles which are printed below would guide you to draw the great circle please note you cannot draw a straight line if you draw a straight line then you will indicate that your plane is actually vertical but this is not because it is dipping 75 degree towards the southeast direction so this is how you carefully draw a great circle containing North Pole South Pole and the deep angle 75 degree that we have plotted on the stereo net now your task is to rotate the steel unit back again and align your North mark on the tracing paper to the knot mark of the straight unit doing so your 60-degree mark on the tracing paper would also align to the 60 degree mark of the straight unit and the great circle that we have drawn in the previous step it would appear like this and this is the projection of the dipping plane 60-degree 75 degree southeast so if you take off it from the studio net it would look like this you just write the value here what is the data of this plot and you are done by plotting a plane on a stereo net let's have a look how to plot the pole of a steel unit I remind you pole of a plane is nothing but an imaginary line which is normal to the plane so we will follow the similar process and in this case we have the dipping plane with the data 246 degree 40 degree Northwest that means the strike is to 46 degrees 40 degrees is the deep angle and it is dipping towards Northwest we will follow the similar procedure that means we will mount the stereo net on a hard board we find a tracing paper and cover the entire unit with the tracing paper next stage is to trace the primitive circle on the tracing paper and Mark the north on the tracing paper which is point B in this illustration now our strike line is to 46 degrees so we have to mark to 46 degree on this primitive circle based on the data which we have at the steel unit so in this case this is your to 46 degree marks that is Point C here and this is how you mark it now we will follow a very similar process now this to 46 degree mark will rotate it such a way that it aligns with the north of the studio net now once it is done we'll follow the same practice this is the north so this must be the south this must be waist and this must be east this is based on the orientation of the tracing paper because not the solo is marked and what we see that the dipping plane is dipping 40 degrees towards Northwest so in this case it must be on this side so again we can count 40 degrees which is the deep angle so 10 20 30 40 and we get our deep angle here in the studio net but that is not the end because we have to plot the pole Pauly's 90 degrees added from the deep point towards the center of the primitive circle so we further proceed counting 90 degrees from this point sir 10 20 30 40 60 70 80 and we come to 90 did I make a mistake 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 no it is right so this this must pass to the center of this primitive circle and this point II you can mark by a dot so again you have to rotate it back so that this 240 60 degree marks comes back to 246 360 degrees and also the North that you marked on the tracing paper aligns to the north of the stereo net in this case what we see this point II that we have marked in the previous slide is actually the pole of this dipping plane to 46 degrees 40 degrees Northwest and if you would see that this blue dotted red circle is actually the projection of the plane to 46 degrees 40 degrees Northwest and if you take it off from the studio net it would look like this okay so because we are doing it here online and I just have given you some illustrations and some advices how to plot it but you can do it sitting at your home or at your classroom so I have given a series of data a data for plotting the planes eight data for plotting the lines and a data for plotting the poles of the planes you do it manually the way I have advised you once you are done and to see that if you had done it correctly you can actually download a stereo net software from this website the link is given here and you can check whether your manual plottings are correct by plotting them also with the software's and if you have any questions you can always write me back or you can contact the teaching assistants if you are interested with these operations and would like to know more then you I have given two references you can download them and read them these are very interesting to read and you would have a very good idea and you will be a skilled expert of stereo net if you follow these texts and do the exercises which are given in this - - PDFs what we have learnt today in this lecture that the basics of stereo net different components of the stereo net and we learned three very basic plottings how to plot a line how to plot a plane and how to plot the pole or normal of a plane these are the very basics but on the fundamentals of these basics we structural geologists do very complex analysis and sometimes simple analysis as well so we learn all these analysis in time when we learn about more complex structures will deal with complex datasets but for the time being we are done with the stereo net with time with associated lectures we will include the exercises with steady units for example if I have to differently dipping planes of a fold then I can figure out what is a fold axis using a stereo net if I have the data of fault planes I can and the lineage ins and other features then I can figure out what is the direction of the fault movement using this to do net so this is how these steel units are useful for structural geology but we learn it in course of time so in the lakes lecture we'll focus on the kinematic parts of structural geology and we'll learn more about deformation and strength thank you very much and bye for now [Music] [Music] [Music]
