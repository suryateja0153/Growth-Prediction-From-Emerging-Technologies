 flow measurement as the quantification of bulk fluid movement flow can be measured in a variety of ways the common types of flow meters with industrial applications are listed below a obstruction type differential pressure or variable area B inferential turbine type C electromagnetic D positive displacement flow meters which accumulate a fixed volume of fluid and then count the number of times the volume is filled to measure flow e fluid dynamic vortex shedding F anemometer G ultrasonic Aitch mass flow meter Coriolis force flow measurement methods other than positive displacement flow meters rely on forces produced by the flowing stream as it overcomes a known constriction to indirectly calculate flow flow may be measured by measuring the velocity of fluid over a known area for very large flows tracer methods may be used to deduce the flow rate from the change in concentration of a dye or radioisotope you topic units of measurement both gas and liquid flow can be measured in volumetric or mass flow rates such as liters per second or kilograms per second respectively these measurements are related by the materials density the density of a liquid is almost independent of conditions this is not the case for gases the densities of which depend greatly upon pressure temperature and to a lesser extent composition when gases or liquids are transferred for their energy content as in the sale of natural gas the flow rate may also be expressed in terms of energy flow such as Giga Joule per hour or BTU per day the energy flow rate as the volumetric flow rate multiplied by the energy content per unit volume or mass flow rate multiplied by the energy content per unit mass energy flow rate is usually derived from mass or volumetric flow rate by the use of a flow computer in engineering contexts the volumetric flow rate is usually given the symbol Q display style q and the mass flow rate the symbol M display style dot M for a fluid having density Rho display style bro mass and volumetric flow rates may be related by M equals Rho Q display style dot M equals Rho Q you topic gas gases are compressible and change volume when placed under pressure are heated or cooled a volume of gas under one set of pressure and temperature conditions is not equivalent to the same gas under different conditions references will be made to actual flow rate through a meter and standard or base flow rate through a meter with units such as a cm H actual cubic meters per hour SM 3 SEC standard cubic meters per second KSC m8000 standard cubic meters per hour LF M linear feet per minute or MMS CFD million standard cubic feet per day gas mass flow rate can be directly measured independent of pressure and temperature effects with thermal mass flow meters Coriolis mass flow meters or mass flow controllers you topic liquid for liquids various units are used depending upon the application and industry but might include gallons US or imperial per minute liters per second bushels per minute or when describing river flows cumecs cubic meters per second or acre feet per day in oceanography a common unit to measure volume transport volume of water transported by a current for example is a Sverdrup SV equivalent to 106 cubic meters per second you topic primary flow element a primary flow element as a device inserted into the flowing fluid that produces a physical property that can be accurately related to flow for example an orifice plate produces a pressure drop that is a function of the square of the volume rate of flow through the orifice a vortex meter primary flow element produces a series of oscillations of pressure generally the physical property generated by the primary flow element as more convenient to measure than the flow itself the properties of the primary flow element and the fidelity of the practical installation to the assumptions made in calibration are critical factors in the accuracy of the flow measurement you topic mechanical flow meters a positive displacement meter may be compared to a bucket and a stopwatch the stopwatch is started when the flow starts and stopped when the bucket reaches its limit the volume divided by the time gives the flow rate for continuous measurements we need a system of continually filling and emptying buckets to divide the flow without letting it out of the pipe these continuously forming and collapsing volumetric displacements may take the form of Pistons reciprocating in cylinders gear teeth mating against the internal wall of a meter or through a progressive cavity created by rotating oval gears or a helical screw you topic piston meter rotary piston because they are used for domestic water measurement Piston meters also known as rotary piston or semi positive displacement meters are the most common flow measurement devices in the UK and are used for almost all meter sizes up to and including 40 millimeters one and a half in the piston meter operates on the principle of a piston rotating within a chamber of known volume for each rotation an amount of water passes through the piston chamber through a gear mechanism and sometimes a magnetic drive a needle dial and odometer type display are advanced topic oval gear meter an oval gear meter as a positive displacement meter that uses two or more oblong gears configured to rotate at right angles to one another forming a t-shape such a meter has two sides which can be called a and B no fluid passes through the center of the meter where the teeth of the two gears always mesh on one side of the meter a the teeth of the gears close off the fluid flow because the elongated gear on side a is protruding into the measurement chamber while on the other side of the meter be a cavity holds a fixed volume of fluid in a measurement chamber as the fluid pushes the gears it rotates them allowing the fluid in the measurement chamber on side B to be released into the outlet port meanwhile fluid entering the inlet port will be driven into the measurement chamber of side a which is now open the teeth on side B will now close off the fluid from entering side B this cycle continues as the gears rotate and fluid as metered through alternating measurement chambers permanent magnets in the rotating gears can transmit a signal to an electric reed switch or current transducer for flow measurement though claims for high performance are made they are generally not as precise as the sliding vane design you topic gear meter Geir meters differ from oval gear meters in that the measurement chambers are made up of the gaps between the teeth of the gears these openings divide up the fluid stream and as the gears rotate away from the inlet port the meters inner wall closes off the chamber to hold the fixed amount of fluid the outlet port is located in the area where the gears are coming back together the fluid is forced out of the meter as the gear teeth mesh and reduce the available pockets to nearly zero volume you topic helical gear helical gear flow meters get their name from the shape of their gears or rotors these rotors resemble the shape of a helix which is a spiral shaped structure as the fluid flows through the meter it enters the compartments in the rotors causing the rotors to rotate the length of the rotor as sufficient that the inlet and outlet are always separated from each other thus blocking a free flow of liquid the mating helical rotors create a progressive cavity which opens to admit fluid seals itself off and then opens up to the downstream side to release the fluid this happens in a continuous fashion and the flow rate is calculated from the speed of rotation you topic mutating disk meter this is the most commonly used measurement system for measuring water supply in houses the fluid most commonly water enters in one side of the meter and strikes the new tating disc which is eccentrically mounted the disc must then wobble or new tate about the vertical axis since the bottom and the top of the disc remain in contact with the mounting chamber a partition separates the inlet and outlet chambers as the disc new Tate's it gives direct indication of the volume of the liquid that has passed through the meter as volumetric flow as indicated by a gearing and register arrangement which is connected to the disk it is reliable for flow measurements within 1% you topic turbine flow meter the turbine flow meter better described as an axial turbine translates the mechanical action of the turbine rotating in the liquid flow around an axis into a user readable rate of flow GPM LPM etc the turbine tends to have all the flow traveling around it the turbine wheel is set in the path of a fluid stream the flowing fluid impinges on the turbine blades imparting a force to the blade surface and setting the rotor in motion when a steady rotation speed has been reached the speed is proportional to fluid velocity turbine flow meters are used for the measurement of natural gas and liquid flow turbine meters are less accurate than displacement in jet meters at low flow rates but the measuring element does not occupy or severely restrict the entire path of flow the flow Direction is generally straight through the meter allowing for higher flow rates and less pressure loss than displacement type meters they are the meter of choice for large commercial users fire protection and as master meters for the water distribution system strainers are generally required to be installed in front of the meter to protect the measuring element from gravel or other debris that could enter the water distribution system turbine meters are generally available for four to thirty centimetres one and a half - twelve in or higher pipe sizes turbine meter bodies are commonly made of bronze cast iron or ductile iron internal turbine elements can be plastic or non-corrosive metal alloys they are accurate in normal working conditions but are greatly affected by the flow profile and fluid conditions fire meters are a specialized type of turbine meter with approvals for the high flow rates required in fire protection systems they are often approved by underwriters laboratory's all or Factory mutual FM or similar authorities for use in fire protection portable turbine meters may be temporarily installed to measure water used from a fire hydrant the meters are normal made of aluminum to be lightweight and are usually seven point five centimeters three in capacity water utilities often require them for measurement of water used in construction pool filling or where a permanent meter has not yet installed you topic Waltman meter the wolfman meter invented by reinhard Waltman in the 19th century comprises a rotor with helical blades inserted axially in the flow much like a ducted fan it can be considered a type of turbine flow meter they are commonly referred to as helix meters and are popular at larger sizes you topic single jet meter a single jet meter consists of a simple impeller with radial vanes impinged upon by a single jet they are increasing in popularity in the UK at larger sizes and are commonplace in the EU you topic paddlewheel meter paddlewheel flowmeters consists of three primary components the paddle wheel sensor the pipe fitting and the display controller the paddle wheel sensor consists of a freely rotating wheel impeller with embedded magnets which is perpendicular to the flow and will rotate when inserted in the flowing medium as the magnets in the blades spin past the sensor the paddle wheel meter generates a frequency and voltage signal which is proportional to the flow rate the faster the flow the higher the frequency and the voltage output the paddle wheel meter is designed to be inserted into a pipe fitting either inline or insertion style these are available with wide range of fitting styles connection methods and materials such as PVDF polypropylene and stainless steel similar to turbine meters the paddle wheel meter require a minimum run of straight pipe before and after the sensor flow displays and controllers are used to receive the signal from the paddle wheel meter and converted into actual flow rate or total flow values the processed signal can be used to control the process generate an alarm send signals to external etc paddle wheel flow meters also known as Pelton wheel sensors offer a relatively low-cost high accuracy option for many flow system applications typically with water or water like fluids one you topic multiple jet meter a multiple jet or multi jet meter as a velocity type meter which has an impeller which rotates horizontally on a vertical shaft the impeller element as in a housing in which multiple Inlet ports direct the fluid flow at the impeller causing it to rotate in a specific direction in proportion to the flow velocity this meter works mechanically much like a single jet meter except that the ports direct the flow at the impeller equally from several points around the circumference of the element not just one point this minimizes uneven wear on the impeller and its shaft thus these types of meters are recommended to be installed horizontally with its roller index pointing skywards you topic Pelton wheel the Pelton wheel turbine better described as a radial turbine translates the mechanical action of the Pelton wheel rotating in the liquid flow around an axis into a user readable rate of flow GPM LPM etc the Pelton wheel tends to have all the float traveling around it with the inlet flow focused on the blades by a jet the original Pelton wheels were used for the generation of power and consisted of a radial flow turbine with reaction cups which not only move with the force of the water on the face but return the flow in opposite direction using this change of fluid direction to further increase the efficiency of the turbine you topic current meter flow through a large penstock such as used at a hydroelectric power plant can be measured by averaging the flow velocity over the entire area propeller type current meters similar to the purely mechanical Ekman current meter but now with electronic data acquisition can be traversed over the area of the penstock and velocities averaged to calculate total flow this may be on the order of hundreds of cubic meters per second the flow must be kept steady during the traverse of the current meters methods for testing hydroelectric turbines are given in IEC standard 41 such flow measurements are often commercially important when testing the efficiency of large turbines you topic pressure-based meters there are several types of flow meter that rely on Bernoulli's principle either by measuring the differential pressure within a constriction or by measuring static and stagnation pressures to derive the dynamic pressure you topic venturi meter a venturi meter constricts the flow in some fashion and pressure sensors measure the differential pressure before and within the constriction this method is widely used to measure flow rate in the transmission of gas through pipelines and has been used since Roman Empire times the coefficient of discharge of venturi meter ranges from zero point nine three to zero point nine seven the first large-scale venturi meters to measure liquid flows were developed by Clemens Herschel who used them to measure small and large flows of water and wastewater beginning at the very end of the 19th century you topic orifice plate an orifice plate as a plate with a hole through it placed perpendicular to the flow it constricts the flow and measuring the pressure differential across the constriction gives the flow rate it is basically a crude form of venturi meter but with higher energy losses there are three type of orifice concentric eccentric and segmental you topic dull tube the doll tube as a shortened version of a venturi meter with a lower pressure drop than an orifice plate as with these flow meters the flow rate in a dull tube as determined by measuring the pressure drop caused by restriction in the conduit the pressure differential is typically measured using diaphragm pressure transducers with digital readout since these meters have significantly lower permanent pressure losses than orifice meters doll tubes are widely used for measuring the flow rate of large pipe works differential pressure produced by a dull tube as higher than venturi tube and nozzle all of them having same throat diameters you topic pitot tube a pitot tube is used to measure fluid flow velocity the tube is pointed into the flow and the difference between the stagnation pressure at the tip of the probe and the static pressure at its side is measured yielding the dynamic pressure from which the fluid velocity is calculated using Bernoulli's equation a volumetric rate of flow may be determined by measuring the velocity at different points in the flow and generating the velocity profile you topic multi-hole pressure probe Multi hole pressure probes also called impact probes extend the theory of pitot tube to more than one dimension a typical impact probe consists of three or more holes depending on the type of probe on the measuring tip arranged in a specific pattern more holes allow the instrument to measure the direction of the flow velocity in addition to its magnitude after appropriate calibration three holes arranged in a line allow the pressure probes to measure the velocity vector in two dimensions introduction of more holes eg five holes arranged in a plus formation allow measurement of the three-dimensional velocity vector topic cone meters koan meters are a newer differential pressure metering device first launched in 1985 by micrometer in Hemet CA the cone meter as a generic yet robust differential pressure DP meter that has shown to be resistant to effects of asymmetric and swirling flow while working with the same basic principles as venturi and orifice type DP meters cone meters don't require the same upstream and downstream piping the cone acts as a conditioning device as well as a differential pressure producer upstream requirements are between zero to five diameters compared to up to 44 diameters for an orifice plate or 22 diameters for a venturi because cone meters are generally of welded construction it is recommended they are always calibrated prior to service inevitably heat effects of welding cause distortions and other effects that prevent tabular data on discharge coefficients with respect to line size beta ratio and operating Reynolds numbers from being collected and published calibrated cone meters have an uncertainty up to plus or minus 0.5 percent uncalibrated cone meters have an uncertainty of plus or minus 5 0 percent you topic linear resistance meters linear resistance meters also called laminar flow meters measure very low flows at which the measured differential pressure is linearly proportional to the flow and to the fluid viscosity such flow is called viscous drag flow or laminar flow as opposed to the turbulent flow measured by orifice plates Venturi's and other meters mentioned in this section and is characterized by Reynolds numbers below 2000 the primary flow element may consist of a single long capillary tube a bundle of such tubes or a long porous plug such low flows create small pressure differentials but longer flow elements create higher more easily measured differentials these flow meters are particularly sensitive to temperature changes affecting the fluid viscosity and the diameter of the flow element as can be seen in the governing hagen poiseuille equation you topic variable area flow meters a variable area meter measures fluid flow by allowing the cross-sectional area of the device to vary in response to the flow causing some measurable effect that indicates the rate a rota meter as an example of a variable area meter we're awaited float rises in a tapered tube as the flow rate increases the float stops rising when area between float and tube is large enough that the weight of the float is balanced by the drag of fluid flow a kind of rota meter used for medical gases as the thorpe tube flow meter floats are made in many different shapes with spheres and spherical ellipses being the most common some are designed to spin visibly in the fluid stream to aid the user in determining whether the float is stuck or not rota meters are available for a wide range of liquids but are most commonly used with water or air they can be made to reliably measure flow down to 1% accuracy another type as a variable area orifice where a spring-loaded tapered plunger is deflected by flow through an orifice the displacement can be related to the flow rate you topic optical flow meters optical flow meters use light to determine flow rate small particles which accompany natural and industrial gases pass through two laser beams focused a short distance apart in the flow path in a pipe by illuminating optics laser light is scattered when a particle crosses the first beam the detecting optics collect scattered light on a photo detector which then generates a pulse signal as the same particle crosses the second beam the detecting optics collect scattered light on a second photo detector which converts the incoming light into a second electrical pulse by measuring the time interval between these pulses the gas velocity is calculated as V equals D T display style V equals DT where D display style D is the distance between the laser beams and T display style T is the time interval laser based optical flow meters measure the actual speed of particles a property which is not dependent on thermal conductivity of gases variations in gas flow or composition of gases the operating principle enables optical laser technology to deliver highly accurate flow data even in challenging environments which may include high temperature low flow rates high pressure high humidity pipe vibration and acoustic noise optical flow meters are very stable with no moving parts and deliver a highly repeatable measurement over the life of the product because distance between the two laser sheets does not change optical flow meters do not require periodic calibration after their initial commissioning optical flow meters require only one installation point instead of the two installation points typically required by other types of meters a single installation point is simpler requires less maintenance and is less prone to errors commercially available optical flow meters are capable of measuring flow from 0.1 m/s to faster than 100 m/s 1000 to 1 turndown ratio and have been demonstrated to be effective for the measurement of flare gases from oil wells and refineries a contributor to atmospheric pollution you Topic open channel flow measurement open channel flow describes cases where flowing liquid has a top surface open to the air the cross section of the flow is only determined by the shape of the channel on the lower side and is variable depending on the depth of liquid in the channel techniques appropriate for a fixed cross section of flow in a pipe are not useful in open channels measuring flow in waterways as an important open channel flow application such installations are known as stream gauges you topic level 2 flow the level of the water as at a designated point behind we're or in floom using various secondary devices bubblers ultrasonic float and differential pressure are common methods this depth is converted to a flow rate according to a theoretical formula of the form Q equals K H X display style Q equals KH caret X where Q display style q is the flow rate K display style K is a constant h display style H is the water level and X display style X is an exponent which varies with the device used or it is converted according to empirically derived level flow data points a flow curve the flow rate can then be integrated over time into volumetric flow level to flow devices are commonly used to measure the flow of surface waters Springs streams and rivers industrial discharges and sewage of these Weir's are used on flow streams with low solids typically surface waters while flumes are used on flows containing low or high solids contents you topic area velocity the cross-sectional area of the flow is calculated from a depth measurement and the average velocity of the flow is measured directly Doppler and propeller methods are common velocity times the cross-sectional area yields a flow rate which can be integrated into volumetric flow there are two types of area velocity flow meter 1 wetted and 2 non-contact wetted area velocity sensors have to be typically mounted on the bottom of a channel or river and use Doppler to measure the velocity of the entrained particles with depth in a programmed cross section this can then provide discharge flow measurement non-contact devices that use laser or radar are mounted above the channel and measure the velocity from above and then use ultrasound to measure the depth of the water from above radar devices can only measure surface velocities whereas laser based devices can measure velocity subsurface you topic dye testing a known amount of dye or salt per unit time as added to a flow stream after complete mixing the concentration is measured the dilution rate equals the flow rate you topic acoustic Doppler velocimetry acoustic Doppler velocimetry adv is designed to record instantaneous velocity components at a single point with a relatively high frequency measurements are performed by measuring the velocity of particles in a remote sampling volume based upon the Doppler shift effect you topic thermal mass flow meters thermal mass flow meters generally use combinations of heated elements and temperature sensors to measure the difference between static and flowing heat transfer to a fluid and infer its flow with a knowledge of the fluid specific heat and density the fluid temperature is also measured and compensated for if the density and specific heat characteristics of the fluid are constant the meter can provide a direct mass flow readout and does not need any additional pressure temperature compensation over their specified range technological progress has allowed the manufacture of thermal mass flow meters on a microscopic scale as MEMS sensors these flow devices can be used to measure flow rates in the range of nano Leiter's or micro liters per minute thermal mass flow meter also called thermal dispersion or thermal displacement flow meter technology is used for compressed air nitrogen helium argon oxygen and natural gas in fact most gases can be measured as long as they are fairly clean and non corrosive for more aggressive gases the meter may be made out of special alloys eg Hastelloy and pre-drying the gas also helps to minimize corrosion today thermal mass flow meters are used to measure the flow of gases in a growing range of applications such as chemical reactions or thermal transfer applications that are difficult for other flow metering technologies this is because thermal mass flow meters monitor variations in one or more of the thermal characteristics temperature thermal conductivity and/or specific heat of gaseous media to define the mass flow rate you topic the MAF sensor in many late-model automobiles a mass airflow MAF sensor is used to accurately determine the mass flow rate of intake air used in the internal combustion engine many such mass flow sensors use a heated element and a downstream temperature sensor to indicate the air flow rate other sensors use a spring-loaded vane in either case the vehicles electronic control unit interprets the sensor signals as a real-time indication of an engines fuel requirement you topic vortex flow meters another method of flow measurement involves placing a bluff body called a shudder bar in the path of the fluid as the fluid passes this bar disturbances in the flow called vortices are created the vortices trail behind the cylinder alternatively from each side of the bluff body this vortex trail is called the von Karman vortex street after von Carmen's 1912 mathematical description of the phenomenon the frequency at which these vortices alternate sides is essentially proportional to the flow rate of the fluid inside a top or downstream of the shedder bar as a sensor for measuring the frequency of the vortex shedding this sensor is often a piezoelectric crystal which produces a small but measurable voltage pulse every time a vortex is created since the frequency of such a voltage pulse is also proportional to the fluid velocity a volumetric flow rate is calculated using the cross sectional area of the flow meter the frequency is measured in the flow rate is calculated by the flow meter electronics using the equation F equals s V display style F equals s VL where display style F is the frequency of the vortices L display style L the characteristic length of the bluff body V display style V is the velocity of the flow over the bluff body and s display style s is the stru whole number which is essentially a constant for a given body shape within its operating limits you topic Xonar flow measurement sonar flow meters are non-intrusive clamp on devices that measure flow in pipes conveying slurries corrosive fluids multi-phase fluids and flows where insertion type flow meters are not desired sonar flow meters have been widely adopted in mining metals processing and upstream oil and gas industries where traditional technologies have certain limitations due to their tolerance to various flow regimes and turndown ratios sonar flow meters have the capacity of measuring the velocity of liquids or gases non-intrusive ly within the pipe and then leverage this velocity measurement into a flow rate by using the cross sectional area of the pipe and the line pressure and temperature the principle behind this flow measurement as the use of underwater acoustics in underwater acoustics to locate an object underwater sonar uses two knowns the speed of sound propagation through the array ie the sound speed of seawater the spacing between the sensors in the sensor array and then calculates the unknown the location or angle of the object likewise sonar flow measurement uses the same techniques and algorithms employed in underwater acoustics but applies them to flow measurement of oil and gas wells and flow lines to measure flow velocity sonar flow meters use two knowns the location or angle of the object which is zero degrees since the flow is moving along the pipe which is aligned with the sensor array the spacing between the sensors in the sensor array and then calculates the unknown the speed of propagation through the array ie the flow velocity of the medium in the pipe you topic electromagnetic ultrasonic and Coriolis flow meters modern innovations in the measurement of flow rate incorporate electronic devices that can correct for varying pressure and temperature ie density conditions nonlinearities and for the characteristics of the fluid you topic magnetic flow meters magnetic flow meters often called mag meter a Sur electromag s use a magnetic field applied to the metering tube which results in a potential difference proportional to the flow velocity perpendicular to the flux lines the potential difference is sensed by electrodes aligned perpendicular to the flow and the applied magnetic field the physical principle at work is Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction the magnetic flow meter requires a conducting fluid and a non conducting pipeliner the electrodes must not corrode in contact with the process fluid some magnetic flow meters have auxiliary transducers installed to clean the electrodes in place the applied magnetic field is pulsed which allows the flow meter to cancel out the effect of stray voltage in the piping system you topic non-contact electromagnetic flow meters a Lorentz force velocity system is called Lorentz force flow meter lff an lff measures the integrated or bulk Lorentz force resulting from the interaction between a liquid metal in motion and an applied magnetic field in this case the characteristic length of the magnetic field as of the same order of magnitude as the dimensions of the channel it must be addressed that in the case where localized magnetic fields are used it is possible to perform local velocity measurements and thus the term Lorentz force Vella Scimitar is used you topic ultrasonic flow meters Doppler transit time there are two main types of ultrasonic flow meters doppler and transit time while they both utilize ultrasound to make measurements and can be non-invasive measure flow from outside the tube pipe or vessel they measure flow by very different methods ultrasonic transit time flow meters measure the difference of the transit time of ultrasonic pulses propagating in and against the direction of flow this time difference as a measure for the average velocity of the fluid along the path of the ultrasonic beam by using the absolute transit times both the averaged fluid velocity and the speed of sound can be calculated using the two transit times T u P display style T underscore up and T D Oh W n display style T underscore down and the distance between receiving and transmitting transducers l display style l and the inclination angle alpha display style alpha one can write the equations v equals l to sin alpha t u p minus t d w n t u p t d w-n displays Tyl V equals prac l2 sin left alpha right frac t underscore up t underscore down t underscore up t underscore down and C equals L to T you P Plus T D w n T u p t d Oh W ehn display style C equals frac l to frac t underscore up plus T underscore down T underscore up T underscore down where V display style V is the average velocity of the fluid along the sound path and C display style C is the speed of sound with wide beam illumination transit time ultra sound can also be used to measure volume flow independent of the cross sectional area of the vessel or tube ultrasonic doppler flow meters measure the Doppler shift resulting from reflecting an ultrasonic beam off the particulates in flowing fluid the frequency of the transmitted beam is affected by the movement of the particles this frequency shift can be used to calculate the fluid velocity for the Doppler principle to work there must be a high enough density of sonically reflective materials such as solid particles or air bubbles suspended in the fluid this is in direct contrast to an ultrasonic transit time flow meter where bubbles and solid particles reduce the accuracy of the measurement due to the dependency on these particles there are limited applications for doppler flow meters this technology is also known as acoustic Doppler velocimetry one advantage of ultrasonic flow meters is that they can effectively measure the flow rates for a wide variety of fluids as long as the speed of sound through that fluid is known for example ultrasonic flow meters are used for the measurement of such diverse fluids as liquid natural gas LNG and blood one can also calculate the expected speed of sound for a given fluid this can be compared to the speed of sound empirically measured by an ultrasonic flow meter for the purposes of monitoring the quality of the flow meters measurements a drop in quality change in the measured speed of sound is an indication that the meter needs servicing you topic coriolis flow meters using the Coriolis effect that causes a laterally vibrating tube to distort a direct measurement of mass flow can be obtained in a Coriolis flow meter furthermore a direct measure of the density of the fluid as obtained Coriolis measurement can be very accurate irrespective of the type of gas or liquid that is measured the same measurement tube can be used for hydrogen gas and bitumen without recalibration Coriolis flow meters can be used for the measurement of natural gas flow you topic laser doppler flow measurement a beam of laser light impinging on a moving particle will be partially scattered with a change in wavelength proportional to the particle speed the Doppler effect a laser doppler velocimeter LDV also called a laser Doppler anemometer Lda focuses a laser beam into a small volume in a flowing fluid containing small particles naturally occurring or induced the particles scatter the light with a Doppler shift analysis of this shifted wavelength can be used to directly and with great precision determine the speed of the particle and thus a close approximation of the fluid velocity a number of different techniques and device configurations are available for determining the Doppler shift all use a photo detector typically an avalanche photodiode to convert the light into an electrical waveform for analysis in most devices the original laser light is divided into two beams in one general LDV class the two beams are made to intersect at their focal points where they interfere and generate a set of straight fringes the sensor is then aligned to the flow such that the fringes are perpendicular to the flow direction as particles pass through the fringes the Doppler shifted light is collected into the photo detector in another general LDV class one beam is used as a reference and the other as Doppler scattered both beams are then collected onto the photo detector where optical heterodyne detection is used to extract the Doppler signal you topic calibration even though ideally the flowmeter should be unaffected by its environment in practice this is unlikely to be the case often measurement errors originated from incorrect installation or other environment dependent factors in situ methods are used when flow meter is calibrated in the correct flow conditions the result of a flow meter calibration will result in two related statistics a performance indicator metric and a flow rate metric you topic transit time method four pipe flows a so-called transit time method as applied where a radio tracer is injected as a pulse into the measured flow the transit time is defined with the help of radiation detectors placed on the outside of the pipe the volume flow is obtained by multiplying the measured average fluid flow velocity by the inner pipe cross-section this reference flow value as compared with the simultaneous flow value given by the flow measurement to be calibrated the procedure is standardized iso 2975 7/4 liquids and BS 5857 - 2.4 for gases the best accredited measurement uncertainty for liquids and gases as 0.5% you topic tracer dilution method the radiotracer dilution method is used to calibrate open channel flow measurements a solution with a known tracer concentration is injected at a constant known velocity into the channel flow downstream the tracer solution is thoroughly mixed over the flow cross-section a continuous sample is taken and its tracer concentration in relation to that of the injected solution as determined the flow reference value is determined by using the tracer balanced condition between the injected tracer flow and the diluting flow the procedure is standardized iso 9555 minus 1 and iso 9555 minus 2 for liquid flow in open channels the best accredited measurement uncertainty is 1% you topic see also automatic meter reading flow meter error ford viscosity cup gas meter laser Doppler velocimetry
