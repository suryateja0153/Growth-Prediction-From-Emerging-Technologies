 [Music] [Applause] [Music] all right also especially big thanks to our speakers today because they muscle works I really don't find the speakers please drop that I have such a funny speakers thank you he shares like that so I really appreciate we're going to talk like you're sharing with us today and I'll just pass the mic on and let them let them do the thing that's really important in this group which is share our stories about detective experiences and content that we're creating virtual reality [Music] hello I'm John Ashe police car and we're toronto-based vr filmmakers which you can imagine everybody else here as frown face - and we recently gave this talk at GCE a couple weeks ago and then Stefan was like a ghost at the same time so a whole girl having a good time at GGC so far here the price is really good to get in so we're glad you came and we're here to talk about our beer documentary project that we're currently making twice we are and our stereoscopic volumetric we do capture technique that we developed in order to make it possible and this light behind us is our company so so the choice is a documentary about reproductive rights and I'm so happy to see so many men here in the room it's pretty awesome and so and what are you into separately you meet people who had abortions and they share their experiences feelings and how they came to their decision it is a documentary which means that we have some news oh it's and we feel that some aspect is important and this was our starting point our goal is to share this feeling with our audience and the experience itself the near experience starts with our empty void the craving device is that you are inside body and mind for the fictional person who discovers that she is pregnant and and is not sure what to do nice also disclaimer I keep using the female version but of course not only women have an abortion is just a side note for now so this woman who looks for some clues and meets other people who share their experiences with her and the important aspect is that it will be your story as a viewer and you are the crucial part of the whole experience and people that you will need are great people people sharing their own personal stories Vieira is not the easiest menu it has many limitations and issues make it challenging but do we think it has many really incredible opportunities I may disrupt I made this project to use the strengths of it and avoids the immersive technology is really good at so I want you not just to hear those stories but to meet those people like you met them in real life so what is documentary you can think about the motion picture as the continuum between cinema and journalism documentary is somewhere in the middle cinema is creating a fictional world and invites their lives to look through a window into it how the window is framed affects how they feel and understand what they are saying when the news and journalism use the motion motion picture the fundament is that we learn information about the real world and they don't hide the cameras or the studio the microphones there is no magic just reality as close as it can be represented of course sometimes they use our belief that they only tell the truth and massage it or fabricated but then suggest about journalism and then documentary what is the documentary 3:7 some misconception what it and what the documentary actually is some people believe that it's kind of visual or Wikipedia so it should tell you oh that's known about some phenomenon take it from all possible angles perspective and explain it to you but documentary is not Wikipedia and it's not scientific paper documentary is showing some aspect of the world through the lens of the filmmaker so there is a point of view there is only some part of the whole image and there is probably some interpretation maybe even assumptions and when I share this description some people ask is it not neutral and very much so documentary is not know each other but they are reward that is very important here is that documentary has to be honest if you look through your lens you have to both identify lens for yourself but also for your audience I think that's the baseline no matter what the documentary is about so the question is what is my lens I see that abortion debate is very much focused on studies stereotypes and entitled assumptions but when you actually talk to people who have personal experience with it you realize that there is no two people alike and no two likes alike and no two stories like it's often easy for you if you didn't have this experience yourself to say that I would do this or I will do that and easy it's easy to judge decision that someone else made but when you meet them those people and hear more and more details and more and more aspects they fought through suddenly you realize that there is always so much more in every single story that you would be able to think of Aaron and this is what I think is missing from the whole debate so not statistics not numbers not experts opinions bad people their stories their emotions sometimes they have without fear or relief we are still in production production and I think I've spoken to over 100 women so far not all of them want to be in VR experience many times they just called to me strike me my only just to share their stories to share some burden and some relief and I think I haven't heard a single person that said that it was an easy choice for them it was maybe obvious one to make he's the one that was right for them and almost all of them would be the same words that it was right that they would do it again but there is also much more emotions that that we think that we decide openly and this one is very challenging because the anti-choice movement uses that so what they hear that someone has the doubt or fear that this is for them to prove that abortion itself is damaging for the person to either close it and this is huge misconception because when we take every big decision in our lives we have many doubts many fears the outcome may not be as good as we imagined but doesn't mean decision yourself was wrong so if we would allow for this discussion just this discussion about this aspect I hope that many stereotypes and false assumptions would finally go away and so when you meet this women in the choices you see the process they all went how carefully they make every decision how responsible they were in it and that's among the main point to see into a low for it to allow them to make it for themselves and the people that I talk to trust me with their stories and I would love for everyone to have this opportunity as well but it can be exhausting for them to share it over and over publicly and also for the public to listen especially when you maybe are not ready yet to hear it but it is important like with every other stereotype to meeting a person face to face and to listen so hearing at the stories is changing me a lot and I want the audience to experience the same thing and we are is very personal menu and it's not like the motion picture there is no window between you and the subject and I want to use this aspect there is a lot of talk about presence in PR but we usually define it as a principle presence of the viewer being in the neutral world when I record this interviews I give those people a real space where they can talk freely they can open themselves about all the emotions that they want to share and I'm here I'm there to listen and to record it so when the you were enters to speak to a world that I think they now feel and bidirectional presence with the woman women telling their stories the viewer feels like they are they are there with them so the viewer takes my place in mounting with no judgment without comment nothing they can do or say can interrupt these from the subjects as they tell their stories so it means that to participate is to listen and SS story goes you now not only physically took my spot but also the tracks and feelings that they put towards me and now yours is a new way and now how do you achieve that so in order to maximize feeling a bidirectional presence we wanted to film our interviews Polly magically so what it is small I'm educated for those you don't know it is the concept of recording a video that also includes spatial data so a motion picture is shaped early on we started to look at what technologies existed to allow us to do that first we looked at light stage and photogrammetry is a possible approach but it is much too heavy and expensive and also challenging to make the subjects themselves feel comfortable for example you know you might have heard Microsoft's mixed reality stage which is I believe the top one there and the going price for ten minutes of completed footage is $100,000 so documentary films feature films typically have a budget of $100,000 so that's not going to work with our needs but even besides that using the all I step on yeah steal them from some touch controllers this one I do at home uh yeah so even though it costs a hundred thousand dollars for your 10 minute you know blade render experience the results still feel very waxy and dead I and they don't really feel like living people it's like you're watching somebody who's made out of clay and it's also a lot of extra work just to record the back of people's heads like for examples and if any of you right now really need to see what the back of us look like at this given moment so we also looked into performance capture is another option which has most of the same issues but also introduces ethical issues of being an abstraction of our subjects and it raises the question what's a genuine emotion and what's a technical interpretation and it's important for us that the viewer believes that there's no filter or processing between them and who is speaking there's also on a very affordable tool set called depth kit which has been used extensively for a lot of really great VR experiences but it's more of kind of like an impressionistic or is it method I'm and I'm there's actually a lot of really great depth kit filmmakers in Toronto and there's a lot of really cool things you can do with depth kit but it's much more of like a hologram aesthetic and it makes people feel like they're ghosts and it's really hard to believe that you're sitting in front of a real person if you're so caught up in the process of how they're represented this thing is a quick oh and maybe this so we decided what to focus on what's important for our needs our subjects are not moving and they're seated which relaxes the subjects as you've seen in any documentary people are seated but also it relaxes you the viewer if you're in a seated position as well we don't need the full geometry from all directions we only really need the point of view of the observer because naturally people want to stay in the eyeline of somebody they feel like they're having a conversational connection with and will so we need to record for long periods of time in unstructured ways and not shooting in short bursts of what the system can provide we need to give them time to feel comfortable with the process and it can take many hours to really get somebody to open up like on our film we did an interview that was four hours long and actually we found out last or two weeks ago did you see that what it cost us what twenty-four million dollars so yeah that's not a viable solution you don't have it we don't get that kind of money but most important of all besides all those other things even beyond cost is their faces need to feel a lot unbelievable and a lot of volumetric video processes don't create that illusion but what does is 3d stereo and our backgrounds is in 3d cinema we're both filmmakers and camera people that used to work back when 3d was a thing everybody remembers avatar and it's a process known as stereo graffiti so what is stereo field we see the world and VR most of us any wave we have both arise through binocular vision and it gives us our ability to perceive depth we know distance just by looking at something based on how the separation of parallax between one object appears in both our eyes helps us understand if it's closer further away and stereo fee is the reproduction of this effect by creating two discreet images and then displaying each to each individual eye that's why VR headset has two eyepieces but there are less understood aspect of our vision is something called retinal rivalry or in computer vision is known as binocular rivalry and it isn't just the parallax between objects that tells us about what we're looking at through our both eyes by the oval but it's the difference that each of our eyes sees an example I've been using since avatar to explain why just putting parallax into an image isn't a good way of making stereo and it was more of analogy about why converted movies aren't so good and now knowing this next time you watch you know Avengers part 20 and in 3d you wonder why it will swap this is why so there's a stereoscopic image of the lemon and you can see between as it puts between the left and right news the tips and marks on the surface move left and right in our differently space because it's round so you can see how much depth there would be based on the parallax between the two and your brain also understands that it falls around off the edges and surround shape but if you look at the specular highlight on the top right it's not the same in each eye it's not the same at all this is the wrinkle rival one is something that the other one does not and this is how your brain can understand okay this is a glassy surface and you also see if it picks themselves some head highlights some don't and they change shape from each eye and that also tells you a lot of information about the surface itself through occlusion and you can also see that one side of the lemon you can see some pits that the other eye can't see but your brain understands that the lemon continues around vs. exactly perfect information and all the other twos are there so your brains like I got it it's a lemon instead if we use like a depth map we can synthesize the second view from a single image I'm still create the parallax we've got like a a 3d depth map of white and the black bees further away and then we project that they project the left eye and the radar all the original informations and brick arrival information is gone now it just looks like a round shape with a lemon texture suck on it and this is a great idea computer graphics because it makes you easy to do the hard work of bringing one image and then using a diplomat for to synthesize the second language but it doesn't really fool you into thinking it's real language and the problem is is all of these small details are present many things and when they're gone it just doesn't look right to our brain it looks like somebody's you know made out of clay or made out of some completely uniform surface as you can see here the differences in the highlight on her skin the different reflections in each line and the subtle parallax and eyelashes themselves you can see the inclusion and transparent that one i'm i sees a strand that the other one doesn't even see in the teeth to the top you can see all of these some of these hills that when you remove them only mention people stop looking new and they become possible you can't believe put your finger on it and this is the same effect but by converted movies can be off-putting and why the death is so low and a converted movie because the more deputy introduced the more obvious that these cues aren't present and the less natural diverse so there's important problem for us to solve first because everything about the documentary grows out of interviews that we captured so we meet bro filmmakers over a year ago we ran a modest pig starter campaign and some people here help us out and we really appreciate it to raise money to refine and develop our own stereoscopic volumetric we do casual technology and we're calling it the really exciting name of the s 3d gaming system stereoscopic 3d plus step and it's small a normal camera footprint which is important because it keeps our subjects feeling comfortable they don't feel intimidated they're not like they're they're sitting inside the giant green quite a bit and we can travel with it which makes it possible to go to our subjects instead of making them come to us or to some specialized recording sound stage which is important because sometimes we just don't have the resources available to focus on stage so our system or current system this is a little bit of an older version of it but it's facing the same now is a pair of sony 4k cameras if you're actually using the recording right now and these consumer cameras don't have frame sync unlike our earlier GoPro quarter tech which she's probably saw in some of the video loops at the beginning but it's an affordability trade-off to have superior skin tones which and low Englishman's which is much more important in our use case that Frank's and if we had live resources we've upgraded to a camera that supports frame sync but it isn't really necessary for somebody sitting in front of you and the Kinect version 2 is still the best and cleanest step camera on the market and things like you know it's a real sense and Williams at Kimmel other stuff things that use stereo to depth just aren't good enough and they get confused by the regular bright way that we're trying to reproduce anyway and then the depth information is recorded onto a tepid laptop and we use a really great depth capturing software called crackle point cloud which allows us to record the depth stream the compressed format which is very important if you're doing like an uncut four-hour long tape that you can actually fit in on slate a reasonable klausman after that we use affordable depositing software Blackmagic designs in fusion which i think is built is now into which resolved which is free if you're not doing like crazy stuff like this but I think the paid version it's like 399 it's not the $10,000 for you and it's actually essentially used by the film industry to convert films into 3d anyway so a lot of the tools are already there and we ingest all our footage here we synchronize it we color grade it and color match it and then we composite the dip recording which i think is looping now where we take the depth information and we project the left eye onto it and the right eye onto it and then we can sit back with a single camera of the both discrete views and this reduces this the stereo parallax very little and then we have an image that has very small amounts of localized stereo but it's only in the small features but the image itself has no parallax on but we also have the dip map that goes along with it so we output a video texture that contains eleven image the right image and a depth map with a mattes that's a two-bit mask and then audio all inside of a regular HSS core video file and we can log and edit it just like a regular video which is important you've gotten really long interview sessions and it takes a lot of effort and a lot of reviewing a lot of logging to manage that amount of footage and then we then use this video to drive a vertex shaker which displaces a segment of like a spherical I mentioned you can see the shader here and this way that because it's displacing along a spherical mesh the polygons all are shooting towards the viewer head position and then what we do is we render the left texture in the left headset Sweden the right texture in the right fit set display and that brings the stereoscopic effect back into view which of course doesn't really translate on the screen here and then the video files can be local or straight to a client and the examples that are all here or just 60 megabits a second which is way smaller than like a regular 360 video file and if you're viewing from just a few feet away and you don't because we don't report the back side we have enough information that we can super sample Olivera displays or not you're not looking between the pixels your every pixel you're looking at in your headset is representative the video so it looks very crisp which is important that faces don't appear blurry which is another sign effective volume entity so the you can see well why not just shoot 3d 360 video or 3d 180 and we actually originally started prototyping with 3d video and we quickly discovered that it just isn't good enough and the key thing is the inability to lean in or out ruins that feeling of bi-directional presence and as you naturally change your body language like lean to the side or move over or lean forward you bottom alignment with the three degrees of freedom video and because it's 3d any of the two images you get huge amounts of ice cream so why is that that's because the 3d cameras were fixed in space there goes looking at yeah so you can see that the cameras for fixing space and they don't actually represent where your virtual eyes are and this causes huge amount of waste ratings your fine muscles are desperately trying to align an image that just isn't aligned alone you'll notice this to give or watch like a 3d video in the art you took your head to the side and there's something close to you it can be really really uncomfortable and the lack of six degrees of freedom is another problem as you leap forward or back it's simply not reflected in what you see and again it embraces the illusion of a person virtually present and this is important not just from let's say technical weird-looking point of view but also pure psychology so during this talk many of you did this to listen a little bit more or like you're thinking you're fine and they just think the information that we are sharing and this is what we do in our everyday everyday everyday lives and those want to eat inches movements matter and this is the fundamental fundamental aspect of our society societal interactions so leaning in when you want to listen closer and catching some distance when you need to think about it and digest the stuff in so especially with this subject was very not easy subject I want you to be able to move closer when you hear something that like you really want to hear to it or when you think okay I need mount time to listen or like to think what she was talking about so that's why you seeks you and for ask was just essential and so we make this so we make this or topic video online onto 3d space so this way they don't have a lot of parallax to misalign as you move around so they're kind of glued to the pretty much and here you say you can see how our process changed over time so they're like images before and the right is after we use this money to update develop our technology so for example on the left you can see some issues with enhance they're like very wavy and this felt very very weird in PR and we were also thinking about some creative ways of addressing it but then we decided it takes too much attention of the viewer away from the subject and we decided to spend our time on repairing that and then also the changing image quality from using how a higher quality cameras that we started with and better skin and orientation so these are just two things that we focused on like face being the most important and hand and there is also some other stuff I feel some like waving on your body but being broken feeling like we decided we had to decide what's important perhaps we had cake in a year and they said and we had to decide what's first of all was doable was doable within the reasonable time frame because it's been over a year already and people keep waiting for us to be finished and we would love to finish and so we have to decide that and also we have to decide what can we do also being good to people a team and people want to help us that's awesome or now that's two of us so with the capture technology so our next considerations are what to do with the rest of the virtual space unlike a lot of other documentary experiences in VR we didn't want to place people inside the environment so whether it would be their living room or their workplace we don't want to collaborate with the things that distract you and take your attention away a couple of years ago Stanford made a study and the study showing that when we have too much visual information which is not part of the story it's hard for us to ignore it so they call it the detective mode so you investigate every single element that's there and subconsciously you worry that it will be important so for example if you would put us in VR somebody would keep looking like all of my phone like why can I put this is it important we play the role in the story we just wanted to remove all the clutter and that's why with our capture technology we only captured the images of the people who share their stories because they are the most important for the experience and everything else initially everything else is just a black void but the same Stanford study showed also that using this 360 volume makes the viewers remember less factual informations and so into the research the participants were watching with 90 degrees 180 and 360 and with 90 degrees they remember the most factual informations no matter if they were shown with visual clues or with the clues but they didn't really understand emotionally what the scene is about and who is the person that they are looking at with their full 360 degree they remembered less details but they understood much more of the context and they had the feeling that they know who is the person that died that they are following and in the choice understanding emotions of the people is actually crucial to achieve our goals so having that in mind we want to both use the whole 360 volume 360 space but without cluttering so how to do it and we're very much inspired by oculus Studios year angeleka in a way that we dynamically dynamically bring things in and out of the black void so they also use the audio to create a spatial soundscape that's really emotionally places you in the scenes if you didn't watch it we very much recommend it and we've the choice the up Lloyd are the people so we the rebook people so we record them with our technology but we also plan to use smaller visual illustrations made with quill of each of the stories so to stimulate your imagination so to also to enhance enhance your emotional connection and this is just an example that we did we're not very good artists in this way so another thing that we are looking for is for somebody who can help us with that I mentioned initially that the whole experience is told from the viewers perspective and so we all know that VR has incredible ability of transporting you to other places are the times but when analyzing the abortion debate we realized that there is about half of the population and much more than half of this room here that cannot really imagine how it is to be pregnant to go through this decision even a fear of this decision not just going through that but just thought about it you can a man you cannot imagine it so that's why we decided that we will use VR to put you there to put you to frame the experience is your experience so the pregnancy the holding decision my think will be happening to you and also to make it simply more engaging and interesting some documentary filmmakers Errol Morris being one of the pioneers of it try to get in touch with the viewer to the point where the audience almost sits in the space and but no matter how great they are how many four four holes they will break there is still this window that puts you always as an observant as a witness not being the part of the story so with ER we have the opportunity of putting you directly into someone's shoes and we very much want to do that in going back also to the Stanford study they also identified some other aspect of VR so with changing the viewers position we change their understanding of the scene and of their own role even if they have no role in the experience just putting them in the wrong spot makes them feel uncomfortable or the taken on content concentrating on the story and here are examples of the viewer this lady this way so when she was putting at the bar she felt that she can observe the classroom but she was feeling that now she's one of the students and she has to actually so my role was to upsell they'll done and follow his history but when she was put back there she Jesus villain and she needs to listen to the future when she was put here in between the teacher in the classroom she was feeling that oh I'm in front of the teacher teacher cannot share the story the the lesson even if it did not really apply to the story because it was not the interactive experience with just the media so just putting the viewer into proper space from the perspective of the story is extremely important and this is what we do with the chance so we start with you and budding this humorous avatar we create the story like it's happening to you and then on your way you find those women to share their stories and you sit there and listen so we both physically and mentally with the story design coaching naturally in the situation of listening we still have a long way to go funding institutions and can't well I guess we're all in Canada Canadian funding institutions where we're all from we're now starting only now starting understand 360 video is a serious documentary being but they still understand why and non-commercial Gammage and the experiences necessary for a documentary but we're continue to work on their own steam and with our personal resources improvement for people who are helping us and hopefully eventually things like can counsel and come to understand that VR documentaries 360 good film necessarily and we're always looking for partnerships or anybody who's interested in participating in the project and you know people reach out to us with their personal stories from so many places that we get people from Texas the last even as far as DePaul and we're working really hard to try and get the documentary more global voice instead of just our local community and that's kind of our current focus is to film the interviews before really anything else especially with the changes in technology now that we have our capture figured out now the focus is filming the interview so interviews interviews and then once that's all we have to store a book together we have the greater narrative then it comes back around work back towards to technology and thank you very much for coming everybody [Applause]
