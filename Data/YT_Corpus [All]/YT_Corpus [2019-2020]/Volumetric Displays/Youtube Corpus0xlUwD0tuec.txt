 hi I'm Beth Wilson I'm one of the hosts of stem in 30 which is a science program for middle school students that is produced here at the National Air and Space Museum welcome to our weekly live chats today I am really excited we are talking all about spacesuits and to help us navigate the world of spaces we have our spacesuit curator dr. Cathy Lewis we have our spacesuit cure conservator Lisa Young and we have NASA astronaut and veteran space Walker Colonel and McLane thank you all for joining us today as I said we're talking all about spacesuits if you're watching on the line please put your questions in the comment section and we will get to as many of them as we can to get started I want to talk to Kathy Kathy can you tell us a little bit about collecting Apollo spacesuits and importantly what does Neil Armstrong's spacesuit tell us historically well Neil Armstrong's suit is really the crown jewel of our collection we have a spacesuit collection it's the largest in the world and believe me I've seen others so like I can say that with very confidence but we have everything from prototypes to its contract suits lots of suits that didn't ever fly but in Neil Armstrong's suit we have that one space suit that allowed a human being to walk on another world and it captured that moment when much of the world was watching simultaneously watching him step down on the surface and what people saw was not Neil Armstrong the man but that spacesuit taking that step down and that that in the days of stark high contrast black and white video the footage that's really the icon that imprinted itself on people's minds in history and these suits were built specifically for the Apollo astronauts so when you look at the tag and Neil Armstrong suit what does it say sighs Armstrong they took numerous measurements one of each of the astronauts and they fit checked and rechecked many times so no one else could fit that suit but Armstrong and and today they're a bunch of different astronauts doing a whole lot more space walking so they don't build suits that are sized specifically for you and it is understood that some of that sizing may have influenced a decision you had to make for spacewalk you took yes sir the current does basics that we use on the international space station are built to be modular so they they get resized for whatever astronaut is going to be flying and it's also they were built for a variety of missions the suits that we have on Space Station right now were built when I was in preschool and so they have been around for a while and they have contained astronauts of all sizes and shapes and to do a variety of missions they really are amazing development you know they're almost more like a small spacecraft than they are a spacesuit when you picture a spacesuit don't picture us putting on you know our shirt in our pants it's more like we are getting into a small spacecraft with its own power and electric system and pressurization system and they're soft components and there's hard components and they're amazingly resilient to temperatures and pressures and atmospheres and so but right now the most of the suit is very module we could change the length and the leg length the arm length the torso size the only thing that oftentimes is custom-made to astronauts are the gloves but even the gloves they take measurements all the way down to how how large are think where do our fingers Bend because if you think about you and I may have the same size hands but if our joints are not in the same place and we can't wear the same size gloves because what's really important is that the suit needs to bend where your body bends and so you referenced a change of the crew that we did up on Space Station and you know and I'd love to clearly because one of the things I want to emphasize is that it wasn't because we didn't have the suits or that suits didn't work it's that the suit did work after my first EBA I went on a suit the suit was perfect I came back in I had no problems with it I was meant to wear a different size on the next one but also that that was only one small part of the decision and so all the time we were running these missions up in space you know I think people gotten used to seeing astronauts outside and it started to look routine well NASA is amazing at making the extraordinary look routine there is nothing routine about any day in space it is always a conglomeration of a lot of Engineers and risk mitigators thousands of people will look around from across the world to do things right so on that particular day just like everybody working at our agency we looked at all of the risks and and and we always want to put crews out that that are the best for that mission and so I recommended based on based on many factors the suit being only a small factor that we changed the crews up now those two crew changes happen all the time unfortunately that we got highlighted because it was going to be a historic spacewalk and a lot of people ask if I was disappointed to not have done a spacewalk and what I will say is that and now is that we we can't set out to make history or we will accept risk that we shouldn't we make history by doing the right thing every day and the next best step for exploration and so it wasn't the right thing on that day but I'm so happy that two of my best friends later that year Christine and Jessica I got that opportunity to do that well I think that that also brings a point that you know if wearing spacesuits and doing spacewalks looks routine but it's not I mean it's a very dangerous thing to do even though you might just think that it's work yeah it is it is hard work it's about seven hours on the space station we're usually between six and seven hours is normal we've had spacewalks that are longer and shorter a lot of the times and those missions we've never done those exact procedures on the ground you know back when we were flying shuttle the spacewalks were very scripted and exact cru would practice that exact facelock many times well now we go live on the space station for six and a half months and it's we don't always know what procedures are going to fall on our mission so they are long and difficult tasks they require probably more mental energy than physical energy yet it's the metabolic equivalent of about a marathon and a half I mean a rugby player I would say coming back in after a spacewalk it felt a lot like after a rugby match you are just mentally and physically exhausted but Suki you feel very accomplished but you're absolutely right working out in the vacuum of space humans were not built to be there it doesn't have the right atmosphere it doesn't have the right pressures it has crazy amounts of temperatures you know if the Sun is hitting me in the front on a suit that can be a two to 300 degree difference between the shadow back and inside my suit I can make a nice little adjustment because I want it to be 70 degrees instead of 68 degrees so these machines these space suits are really incredible Lisa you work on conserving these phases and we just heard how Ann talked about she really works in that suit which means there's a lot of sweat and breath and just gross people's stuff what kind of challenges does that create for you when you're conserving a suit you know from the 1960s and earlier yeah so I mean conservation of all the suits are complicated because as Ann described we trained in textile conservation or objects conservation and museums to preserve single materials that we know a lot about NASA as she pointed out has a history of using innovative materials made to do the job get the job done correctly often documented sometimes not on the earlier suits the challenges of all those materials together is it's a very big preservation challenge because we cannot take the seats apart so whatever happens in them however they're used is how we guess them we like to keep them to be gathered together because every goal mark on the anodized aluminum or crinkle and the rubber or the outside layer staining it all tells stories about the actual history omission of that suit but even more so NASA cleans and decontaminates most of the items before we get them we're not going to get a suit that was recently used with somebody's I sweat although we have the linked I'm sort of chloride corrosion on the wrists disconnects if you heard me talk about them before to some of that contamination from earlier suits in the spacecraft like Germany and Mercury missions where they were in the suits much longer and that really did impact the materials but even cleaning them out presents another challenge because you've exposed modern materials to a chemical and so we have to watch those materials really closely learn how they degrade and what do we need to do pretty preserve them and and how we can keep these miniature spacecraft as she says together and preserved for the future so people can see them on display in our Museum well we've got questions rolling in so let's just get started here Kathy I think this is probably a good one for you to follow up on is the moon dust from these suits still damaging the fabric let's really Elise a question there is re its ELISA question it is very damaging to the fabric on a microscopic level you can see it embedded in the outer layers of the beta cloth especially on the Apollo suits which was a fiberglass material so it was meant to keep meteorites and small particles from penetrating through the suits to the astronaut and because there's no atmosphere on the lunar surface the angular lunar dust particles have embedded themselves right into that fabric and has left a mark but even though it looks like it's on the surface you can't really dust it off it's pretty secured to the fabric and our only job is to make sure that it remains there and doesn't cause additional damage in the future we have like value so we like to we want to retain it just for the historic value to document what happened when they were exploring the moon actually that's if I could pick it back up what Kathy just said and I you know we a week we learned from our history and we are we want to put boots back on the moon by 2024 and the only way we're gonna do that is to learn learns lessons of history so the suits that you all got to preserve and that information that you've kept and how that lunar dust affects the suit how it sticks to the suit where it embeds the damage it does that is very much informing the decisions that we're making on future designs of suits Greg from Winter Garden Florida would like to know where were the Apollo suits made and what did we learn from those suits to make better suits well if I can jump in the one thing we did learn is that we're not gonna use zippers to hold in the pressure on suits that is first and foremost the zippers work through the Apollo program and a couple of repressurization but they swapped it is very late before flight and they're just not that reliable wonderful elegant system that worked at the time there were too heavy brass zippers with a rubber gasket in between and when the suits were pressurized that would form the seal but you don't want to bet repeat it pressurization zhan that all the seals now are hard metal with a rubber o-ring or gasket in between and held into place and those are far more reliable not as flexible a whole lot heavier a lot more mass but they're more reliable and is it true that the suits were made at by different contractors different were made by different contractors is that correct yes so the two major contractors were ILC Dover ILC industries at the time they made the soft goods and components and then Hamilton standard made the life support backpack that they provide a communications oxygen cooling water that actually op the operational system they integrated it but all of the components were made by different companies we had the Bata Shoe Company in Switzerland that made the boots the zippers were manufactured BF Goodrich all sorts of components come in from all over the world airlock company made the all of the aluminum components we've got a lot of people watching from DC Illinois Texas Maryland England Minnesota the Ukraine Utah Indiana Florida and the Netherlands thank you so much for watching keep those questions coming in and somebody would like to know how hard is it to take an earth selfie when you're in your suit somebody read my read my Twitter you know it's interesting because the cameras you know so the gloves on the suit they have to hold the pressure and like I said they need to bend where your fingers Bend so they're actually quite robust and so right now our suit our gloves if you relax your hands there they kind of go to about a 45 degree angle and that's a chain jaw performer suit sometimes some of the the old gloves would actually kind of keep your hand in this position and when you're under about 4ps idea pressure you know you have to use muscles to to grasp and you have to use muscles to open your hands and so a lot of what we do during our seven-hour space walks is try to conserve that energy so you'll see us instead of moving on station by by gripping you know the handrails like this we try to just kind of lightly move ourselves along to try to conserve that hand strength well taking pictures is strangely one of the things that can be really fatiguing on your fingers because we take out our normal cameras they just a third won't like it around them and then we take pictures but we also can't hold them up to our eyes so whenever we go to take a picture we actually take about 30 pictures and just hope that some of the ground system through and and and when you're taking a selfie there's a couple things to think about one you've got the camera turning around it's gigantic you can't really feel the button so you're just pressing and you're hoping and you're not holding on to anything at that time and so you you know you put your tethers down and and you start floating away and so the earth you have a great picture in the back but they don't floating away cuz you have nothing like hard to the structure so a lot of the I hate to say this but a lot of the pictures that you see of astronauts out on spacewalks were probably one in a series of 30 and probably those uh Lisa Jack would like to know what was the most challenging piece to restore on Neil Armstrong suit oh that's a good question I think the gloves as we've said is is one of the more challenging aspects we have never displayed the gloves actually attached to the suit because it causes problems for the display and we made the decision with the Armstrong display that we were going to represent the piece as it was on the lunar surface so designing the mannequin to hold the glove in a George '''l position but not have it attached to the suit the gloves are super fragile as Ann says they were they're used the most they were used quite a lot in the Apollo missions and some of the materials are degraded more than you would see on the suit just because of use and also the size of that object so and I think they tell them oh the more personable stories as she's pointed out about activities that they they did even getting in and out of your spacesuit with the gloves taking them off to do activities within the command module and lemmon things so they're a very special piece of the suit and they can't be replaced with any other part and Brooklyn would like to know what do you wear underneath your spacesuit it's not normal every day underwear I understand no that's true it is probably the most expensive piece of underwear that I've ever worn so the layers that go underneath our suits so right up against our body we wear basically what looks like long johns I'm just a real thin piece of material against our skin and that just kind of gives us a little bit of buffer between our next layer which is called the LC VG the liquid cooling and ventilation garment and and so if you look at it it looks like kind of a one-piece you know zipped up like toddler pajamas it's kind of the form that it is zips up in the front and then you'll see big big ventilation tubes if you see an astronaut can you look these up online you see the astronauts are do you see big ventilation tubes coming up our backs and they go all the way down to our hands and also get our legs and what that tube does is it takes the air when we're in our suit we connect it to the suit to the place the big area of the backpack if you will and that provides us air circulation through the suit and all those tubes direct the air circulation into our hands and feet for the air flow and then also in that garment is very small tubes that run all the way around our body that is for liquid cooling given us this if acute of liquid it is a lot more efficient to cool cool your body or to cool anything with liquid than it is with ventilation and so the way that we actually control our core temperature during a spacewalk is the temperature of the water that is right up against our skin and actually we do that by just controlling the speed through which we put the water into our suit so if water is really fast then it doesn't have a lot of time to heat up because of our body heat and so therefore it cools us more and if we turn that flow down more then it goes slower around our body therefore a body heats that water up a little quicker and so we wear those two things we also wear instrumentation that gives ground data on our heartbeat so we have some notes I kind of connected to our chest area and then we wear under gloves under our underneath the gloves that we work in and then for different crew members the suits fit differently so a lot of crew medals will wear something like moleskin to prevent blisters just keep the shoes that's sting Cathy somebody would like to know how many suits do we have in our collection and why don't the astronauts get to keep them first quite a second question first the astronauts don't get to keep them because they are federal employees and like all of us who are federal employees you don't get to keep your equipment when you leave the job take it out it's federally issued equipment but we have a collection of it's hard to say it's plus or minus two hundred and seventy-eight suits that doesn't mean that we could outfit an army of 278 astronauts some of these are components as I said some of these are prototype suits they're not complete somewhere asymmetrical some of which we only have parts maybe shoulders or arms or we have suits without the shoulders and arm joints so and these go back to the pre human spaceflight age suits that nasty use to develop ideas about what kind of space suits they'd like to use including suits that have been accepted and rejected by the Air Force and the Navy during the 1950's so it's a wide range of wonderful suits we've got watching from Anne's hometown of Spokane Washington we have the primary school Dillo Catholic school we also have people watching in Arkansas Kansas Mexico Ohio Louisiana so keep those questions coming in let's see is there a difference and between the suit that you wear when you're spacewalking and the one that you wear when you're training there is yes so the major components are the way it feels however we were training we actually use old suits that are no longer in what we call class one service so suits that are actually certified to go up in to space and we use them in the swimming pool and so if you can just think of you know what swim pulled us to your bathing suits after a while you know it's very a harsh chemical go ahead and chlorine on those suits and so those are our last three suits and so they're good for training in the pool but we would not fly them because the materials wouldn't wouldn't be sufficient we also when we train in the pool the big backpacker that is the place the portable life support system now in space that is all self-contained and it created it has the real hardware that has our oxygen stores it has the it pumps the liquid and the air through our suits and it scrubs the co2 out of the air now when we're in the pool we're actually connected by a big umbilical so all of that is just kind of a volumetric mock up because those suits like I said we get it's like a small spacecraft that you get it and so one of the important things to learn in space is how big a mine and if when am I gonna bug things because when we go out into space we obviously don't want to bump our backpacks our suits there are handles of switches that we don't want to damage and we also don't there everything on the outside of the space station is quite fragile and you don't want to inadvertently damage something so the suits are different volumetrically they're the same and they Bend in the same way that's how we learn where we need moleskin if we need it that's where we learn what sizing we need and a lot of our initial spacesuit training is really trying to get that fit just right so we have a couple of so I do want to mention that we are releasing Smithsonian science starters and we were very fortunate to work with Ann and her colleague Nick on one of the first ones that we aren't releasing so keep an eye out for those they are coming out soon we have a question about the layers from Frankie : and essen Kathy and I'm going to start with you Kathy how many layers do these spacesuits have and why do they look so thick well that the number of layers depends on which suit you're talking about and where you count the Apollo spacesuits are commonly cited as having 21 layers that's depending on where there are more layers on certain elate places of abrasion but the suits would have and these are layers meant to insulate against solar radiation help promote you know insulation against generating or absorbing heat from the Sun or out there or temperature declines are supposed to operate it plus a minus 250 degrees Fahrenheit but there most importantly the outer layers of the suit that that sort of gives a bolt are actually very lightweight these are lightweight fabrics textiles that are inter layered in order to stop that that particle traveling at a at seventeen and a half thousand miles per hour and the concept is that if a particle does and these are tiny particles smaller than one-tenth of a millimeter if it penetrates the outer layer it'll break apart lose momentum and that process continues as it proceeds through the layers and at which point it comes to rest and it has worked it's taken out they have a special test site where they test the layers just to make a little bit it does work in principle now with the emu that am war that has 11 layers it's not that it's less any less protective but the technology the materials technology has advanced and Lisa can talk about that a little more but what they've done is combine layers of of textiles into what a single layer but they still have to take as much care they have to test every single new lot that they get to make sure that this holds up the way that they expected to do the way the previous ones have done and and when your person I'm sorry and Lisa when you're confusing everybody today Lisa when you're preserving and conserving these suits are there challenges in dealing with so many different layers and fabrics and materials yeah I mean the materials and the layers themselves are one thing and like I said we can't really take the seats apart and treat them how we would say an aircraft engine where we can dismantle it and treat every part individually and then put it back together the challenges also come from the way the layers are adhered and taped together by using a special tape called Kapton tape and those adhesives which also break down over time restrict the layer so when han was talking about interestingly enough moving in the suit they've had to come up with ways to actually allow the layers inside to become more flexible and loose when you're using it and pushing against it and doing activities which we don't see in the early suit so you know it's like taking a Gila helium balloon that's made of mylar which is one of the layers and you know when it's flat and you have a birthday balloon and you stretch it it might move one way but it's not going to move the other way that the materials aren't moved to made that way but one of the big ways that we see inside the suits and you can see some of our research online as we do x-radiography we have an x-ray unit in the lab we do we can actually see the layers of the different materials we've done a CT scanning like you would do using a machine at the Natural History Museum where they CT scanned mummies and we've done that for spacesuits and then we've taken all of that digital data when we produced our online product last summer on Armstrong suit so people online can actually see the outer layers of the student then look inside the suit to see what we're talking about we have a question from violet in Mexico for and if your spacesuit is broken how would you know and what would you have to do yes sir thanks for this good question and I lived in Mexico in high school so from another hometown of mine so as I mentioned it's not so much you put on it's a small spacecraft - and so much like the spacecraft's like the Soyuz or like the company SpaceX dragon or the Boeing starladder we have a whole set of cautions and warnings we have the whole set of procedures how we react to those and so if you look at an astronaut suit on the front there's actually like an electronics box and this one it would be like right here and on if when I look down at that box there's actually a screen that has messages and I can scroll through like a normal status of the suit I can look at what pressure it's at what temperature it's at all the different water temperatures measured at different places in my suit that can be indicative of problems in different areas then all of that data is also getting wirelessly sent to the ground and so we have ground teams many ground a couple layers of ground teams on it on the day of an EBA that are looking at every parameter of the suit and so ground actually would probably see an impending problem long before I did for instance if I felt like my carbon dioxide inside the suit was was not scrubbing adequately and I started to feel symptoms of that I would look I would look down and I've scrolled I'd see that number well long before that well I haven't we haven't got to that point because long before that somebody on the ground is monitoring that that instrument that trend and they're seeing a trend come up and so that's kind of the best way that you do have cautions and warning tones that'll make it opening into your ear and then you look down and again one of the things much like when we trained to fly aircraft that we do in our in our neutral buoyancy lab under water is we trained how to react to each of those emergencies and it's Evan who is in South Lake Texas would like to know how long does it take to conserve a suit and then Lisa if you can also talk about what we've had to do as far as putting Neil Armstrong's suit in a case to keep it safe it can really depend on the suit it doesn't really take that much time to do the actual conservation treatment because as I've said a lot of this the materials are not accessible to us and a lot of our experiences that we just want to leave as many things intact as possible so we preserve history and so most of the research and the digital photography and the analysis we do that takes the most time and then over the past few decades in partnership with Kathy and other team members at NASA we have studied and come up with a way to preserve the suits the way we know best which is to control the environment around them and just like the suit is a spacecraft we've built a case that we are donning as the next spacecraft for the suit it is temperature and humidity controlled we do know that a lower RH preserves plastic and polymer materials they don't off gas as much or leach plasticizers or any other things that were causing the degradation in the past ventilation is key we want to move those gases that are continuing to come out even after 50 years away from the materials within the case we have a scrubber as well in the in the display case which catches our gases and returns clean air to our environment in there we also have worked really hard to develop an innovative mannequin system for Armstrong's display which is one of the keys successes to preserving him on public display where we have int elation now running through the suit through the mannequins frame itself we have more support going to the materials catching those places that Anne alluded to where there's pressure points and little bends and details in the suit where the person where a Neil Armstrong who wore it would have had his own body in the suit and would have been able to support those materials in those places so we've done a lot of research we're hoping to use this system for future suits it's a one of the kind project and it did take a lot of work probably 13 years to get it back on display for the public not working on it every day but definitely a long time for us to get it on display for the 50th anniversary last summer you can I ask you a question of course is the mannequin the same size as Neil or did you size manikin for the suit so we sized it off his original measurement so we got from ILC through Kathy during her research we did have to scale it down the suit materials as you probably know shrink and sort of stiffen up over time and moving the mannequin pieces in and out to build it took some some other creative forces because we don't want to put force on the suit but we want to support those materials it's pretty close we used a CNC router with our exhibits production team to cut the inert foam that we use we built the skeleton out of an aluminum frame and sized it right up but it's not quite the size that Neil Armstrong probably was when he worked I've been asked to the people sending me questions to mention that the odd noise you may hear in the background is my cat he apparently wakes up at what o'clock as soon as I start these live chats and sings this sad songs of his people we have an 11 year old who is a huge NASA fan and is just loving this discussion and she would like to know if you could have it in an improvement on the suit what would it be and Kathy I want to start with you on this question to talk about the improvements that were made from Apollo or even in the Gemini program on and then and I'm going to ask what you would like to have in the suit well personally I want to hear Ann's answer okay have been improvements in materials making them more reliable obviously they have to survive for a longer duration the upon its really had up a shelf life of working only six months the materials most notably the robbers the mix of natural and synthetic latex in the suits so those those were the most important suits and of course the suits the Apollo suits and the is SEM you are different in mission Neil Armstrong suit had to be made so he could walk on another surface and and her colleagues don't have to walk they use their feet to propel them but not walking on a surface but your your answer is I'd be really interested because NASA is working on a new concept this new exploration EMU and what suggestions are you making for the next suit what what is the first thing that you'd like to see improved yeah it's interesting this question is a lot like I used to fly helicopters and anybody that that's a pilot you kind of fall in love with the first aircraft that you get to know really well and then everything outside of that seems like something you have to get used to and it's a lot like that with a suit you know my first reaction is hates great works you know works great lasts a long time but but really when we look at the future missions that NASA is going to be accomplishment you mentioned going back to the surface of another planet also just having suits in space for a sustainably long period of time I mentioned that these suits were built when I was a toddler when I was a toddler the shuttle was flying these suits were going up to space for 1014 days at a time doing a couple of CBA's and coming back to earth and getting completely refurbished in a lab and now the suits live up on space station they're very large they're very bulky we don't have the semi truck space shuttle going back and forth all the time anymore and so one of the things I think that needs to be addressed is the ability for crew to do on-orbit maintenance some of the maintenance that we do on orbit was not designed to be done on orbit and so we have a lot of little workarounds you know how to use a very small needle nose pliers to catch a small screw that you're unscrewing because you don't you can't have that go into the suit into it into a place you can't find it you also need to use that screw to put the pieces back so some of the maintenance is is difficult to do on orbit I think we have to think about that for future designs if we're going to send them to the surface of the Moon that sustainable presence that we keep talking about at NASA we want to put boots on the moon leave them there we're gonna have to have suits you can work on in zero or a news gravity like on the surface of the Med I also think that there's a lot of preventive maintenance you know these suits are well past their design and so there's a lot of preventive a there's a lot of hours that go into getting a spacesuit ready to go out the hatch on our DBA so some of those are the design considerations we need to think about how the suit moves for surface missions just for a familiar ization they let us stand up in the suit one time here when we were getting our first initial fit and I'm telling you it's not a suit that you want to walk around in it's great for the ISS mission but those boots were not made for walking so we're gonna have to take a look at that and then perhaps on a practical level I mentioned that we're outside for seven hours at a time we have looked at a lot of different ways that we can get calories into an astronauts body during a TVA the only thing we have out there is water and so if you think about that that sustained period of time and working if we never want to be the limiting factor so it's very important that we stay fit but if there was a way that the materials were not so sensitive that we could actually have a sports drink or caloric drink or even a solid piece of something that we could eat in there it would make that last hour of NEPA a lot more comfortable for us it's not like you need a conservator on the ISS Lisa Jack would like to know how many people were involved in the conservation of the Neil Armstrong suit we have lots of people we have collections staff that we work with we have our curator Cathy and her colleagues we have a team of conservation specialists that I work with we also work with industry experts which is our favorite part of our job is reaching out to people not only people like NASA at NASA astronauts but we we consult with the actual astronauts from the Apollo program plus the people who made the suits our research is just not done in a vacuum and we we can't give credit enough to all these people but we work with seamstresses to consult about our mannequin materials I mean I would have to say on probably this type of project there was upwards of 40 different people that I interacted with and researched with not to mention not to give a plug for our kicks campaign which was awesome and helped support this project but people came out of the woodwork providing documentation and historical archival information to us on the suit reaching out to us from all over the country in the world sending us photos of the suit we love to see old photos of our displays in our seats so we can see how they have changed through time because while we think we have all the answers they may have had a life before in a different part of the museum that somebody's forgotten about or out on a loan somewhere to another museum so we have just a lot of people and I can never take full credit for anything we do because we work in a big team I just like to put a shout out to our colleagues at the National Zoo who are the first right an x-ray at the Natural History Museum who loaned us time on their CT scanner other conservators who specialized in textiles throughout the Smithsonian and outside of the Smithsonian just a world of people historians in Delaware the Hagley Center will have information on on the development of both DuPont - made materials and and ILC Abby is in Arlington and this is a question for you and do you sleep in your spacesuit when we go out the door and there's way too much adrenaline harness for those days and you know when we go outside we don't we don't just go out to go for a stroll we don't just go for the V order taking pictures that's what we do we happen to have a freeze for a minute or two but those entire spacewalks are very choreographed and we're going out to fix something very important so for instance one of my spacewalks was to upgrade up the power system on the on the space station and so we were removing large batteries and replacing them with more modern technology so it's a lot of physical labor you're definitely keyed in and you're very busy whole time but not it's even hard to sleep the night after really well I this is going to be the last question we've got to wrap up what someone would like to know what are the red and blue valves on the Armstrong suit for in with the good stuff red is out with the bad stuff this whole way to remember the oxygen supply the water supply comes in through the blue it's just to make sure that you don't have a backup it's taken from I think it is actually green and blue scuba somebody should correct me but those are the colors that have been uniform throughout history same colors on that that the Russians used now on on their their suits as well so just avoid any mix-up well I'm gonna thank you all for joining us today I want to let you know that we have a new episode of 7:30 that came out today it's all about
