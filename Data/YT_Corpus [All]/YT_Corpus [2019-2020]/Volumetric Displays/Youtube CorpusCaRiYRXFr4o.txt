 a couple of years ago I was telling a right actually the very beginning of my time at Berkeley I was telling a great friend of mine about my research and my thesis and these amazing fMRI studies that I saw and lamenting that it would be just so great if I had all the money in the universe and I could get all these school children from Tibet and get them into fMRI machines and then do the same with the cohort in the United States and check the volumetric difference in their amygdalas and then do it again on some longitudinal study it'd be really glorious my friend said a couple weeks later he went to a dinner Thursday night dinner with this amazing woman and she was working to develop a portable MRI machine like super portable like portable in an ambulance or out in the field maybe in Tibet or India in an ambulance in medical offices back pack then he mentioned that she was one of the founders for one laptop laptop per child and for those of you who don't know that's a non-profit initiative with the goal to transform education in developing countries by creating and distributing low-cost educational devices that have low power and were super sturdy and I was then instantly is super fan when I was ten I saw on the big screen Ardi r2d2 open up and it was projected right Princess Leia does anybody remember that scene nobody in that movie theater was ever thinking about any of the advances that would come from the inspiration that our next guest got at the same scene so she double majored in art and an electrical engineering from Brown University she received her Master of Science in computational holography Oh holography yeah how long it's about holographs thanks for laughing from the MIT Media Lab where she was later a professor she returned to Brown and received her doctorate in optical sciences our speaker was an engineering executive at Facebook oculus Google and Intel she is named one of our times greatest thinkers by some of the greatest thinkers of our time she has founded for startups and holds over 250 patents I know right it's like she has superpowers while her CV lists many of her accomplishments it will not reveal her lifelong drive to learn understand and innovate and it will not reveal her continual efforts to use those superpowers for good please join me in welcoming our speaker Perry Lou Jepsen [Music] all right hello yes hear me all right thank you so much car for that wonderful introduction well as you can tell it's going to be hard to cover everything that mary lou has done but we want to give you guys a taste of her journey and how she got to the portable fMRI machine that Cara was mentioning what she's working on now so Mary Lou can we start a little bit by you know going back to the beginning and maybe you can tell us a bit about your formative years what was it like where he grew up I grew up in Connecticut but not the rich part I grew up in a farm in Connecticut it was violent there are a lot of guns we had neighbors that shot at us they never went to jail my father got stabbed my father was an auto mechanic my mom taught taught high school great and where their significant early in your early life where their significant moments you think may be shaped who you are today yeah I would say um it was really violent and I sort of withdrew into myself I really loved two things math and art and so I would basically do those under my bed it was quiet and then I agree to like this other thing swimming because people could yell at you while you were swimming but you couldn't hear them and I liked the quiet so I became kind of a nerdy science kid as a way of coping I think with the chaos around me that makes total sense and yeah so it seemed like then in your education you did focus on engineering math and art and kind of this intersection and then you know eventually you were very attracted to holography and as Cara said maybe the Star Wars movie was a big you know inspiration for you you know later something I thought was really cool that was in 1991 you put on this big display in Cologne Germany and it was only could be seen for ten minutes a day for 55 days out of the year and it filled a city block yes in Cologne what was that like to work on that project and where did this love for Holograms and holography come from oh I liked optical things I mean I had a little had a book I think it's called Thumbelina growing up and it had this lenticular these stripes these lens stripes on it so it looked 3d mm-hmm and as a little kid you know four or five I tried to scratch to get inside of the 3d image and I wrecked the optics I made it worse I couldn't get inside and I wanted to know how it worked so when I started college I majored in engineering but I took an elective in holography and hopefully they're better now but when I was an undergrad in the at the time the music you heard was coming out the clash was very popular the early eighties I thought the curriculum would have killed any ounce of creativity I might have had and I'm not saying I had much but I started taking I took this holography class I'm like whoa this is pretty cool it's the closest thing to a religious experience I ever had like you know like you couldn't mean all this optical stuff you bolted it down on this two-ton table that floated on nitrogen you have these lenses setup is beautiful lasers going around you couldn't even at the whole room was the camera it had to be completely dark you couldn't even breathe while you're making the exposure because nothing could move more than a fraction of a wavelength of light relative to something else and then you take this piece of what's called silver halide film it's what used to be in cameras and you had to develop it and you develop it and and dry it with a hair dryer in this it would be this magical 3d scene and I just like I was hooked I'm like whoa I don't really like electrical engineering the way it's taught but I can sort of dive in from this angle we learn all I can about electronics computer science electricity and magnetism chemistry human visual system coding the whole thing and I was just I sort of focused on it from that lens to get through it in a way that I could love it so when did you realize that you could actually study this in your formal education did you always kind of know that or when it did come you know change from being maybe something you're interested in the hobby to and you realizing that you could actually study this oh well my parents as I mentioned I grew up not not wealthy and they said they'd help me pay for the best school I could get into as long as I majored in electrical engineering today that might be computer science and they were quite serious like I wanted to be an English major like I didn't know what I wanted to be but like I liked everything at you like you you're a Berkeley you're probably good at everything your test scores are off the charts you can probably do whatever you want to do you just have to want it that's the problem and so what do you love enough to pour yourself all of you into and so I had to get the electrical engineering degree or I would have had to pull out of school but I tried to leverage it in this way so but then the media allowed the MIT Media Lab was starting up and they had taken somebody just walked in with a Polaroid sir it's amazing they had taken Steve Benton out of Polaroid where he worked with the founder of Polaroid you guys probably don't remember Polaroid it's a it was the Apple Computer of its day it was this super cool company but he came back to the Media Lab to do a master's degree in holography and so I'm like whoa that's the cool place to be I applied they let me in I had no idea I wanted to go to grad school but like if there was grad school in holography I was in but there was no PhD so anyway I started moving around and I thought I'd get a PhD in physics and that optical computing with like deep learning neural nets it was like gonna be the thing in the late 80s and oh my god it was awful so then I ended up putting my resume online this is like in 1990 and some guy wrote back and me I said hey do you want to be a computer science professor at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology in Australia kind of like yeah sure send me the ticket and he did so I got on the plane and went he did that and I ended up in Cologne cuz I got thrown out of Australia I've been completely exonerated really I didn't do anything wrong but my visa wasn't renewed it was the misunderstanding I can explain if you want to but you know but yeah so this art school said why don't you come be a fellow because they had started these multimedia art schools in Germany I ended up I ended up there sort of taking this project I was working on with an artist from Sydney to make a lunar illuminated hologram that filled the beach Cove and then when I was there I realized well forget like the Sun or lunar they go why not just do the whole thing like a real moonshot project video on the moon and so I started talking on that when I went to do my PhD Wow but it's averted that's amazing so but I like the art stuff it keeps me going you know do you think he would have studied art if your parents had not oh I got another degree in art at Brown because I just took the courses to kind of agenda going to punk rock band I took like just to keep um it really felt to me like I was being squeezed into this you know round peg round hole and I actually wanted facets and I don't know I was rebellious like right like Geiger was a street fighting kid I don't know I couldn't I couldn't like I didn't want to compress myself in that way it was very isolating very lonely I think like probably all of you we've been given a lot of confidence that were smart you're in Cal you're smart right um you can probably do whatever you want but like those first couple of years of college I thought were really tough because everybody's my high school like the mayor taught physics their physics class was basically a solar cooker for a hot dog it's basically a centrist like ridiculous so it didn't have the same background as my colleagues probably better school so it took me a while to catch up but like I had confidence but I needed to be in love with something to pour myself into it and I like I happened to never really take a math class until I got to college because I was really good doing it out of the book so it's doing calculus in seventh grade I was really good at it but I wasn't the idea of somebody deriving an equation on the board and the students showed II now the s ign's of plus or minus like I didn't understand why that I was used to digesting it at my rate not at the rate and so you have to learn things and like you know I was not I had it took a couple years so it sounds like your education was helpful and gave you good skills but you really needed some kind of outlet in order to actually apply it in to learn for me to get it I mean just inclined planes don't do for me you're solving for tress if it's just you know like I'd rather solve a real problem and I'm totally fine to do the tress stuff or the you know I grew up in a farm like I never once saw I don't know if you guys take static from the connection in I had too much fun she never once saw a block go down an inclined plane that way never once as well in tractors out of you know swamps all the time like it never worked how it was supposed to and so I just thought it was all just it was really hard to get excited about it yeah that's dry well I think that or now yeah I think I think so I think one thing many people in the room are often thinking about is the idea of like risk right as an entrepreneur risk is maybe one of the biggest things that we're thinking about and you've done you know almost everything career-wise you've been a CTO you've been a professor you've started companies so when you founded one laptop per child you were actually at the MIT Media Lab can you tell us a bit about what was like to found one laptop per child and how you were able to take that risk to leave MIT Media Lab and being a professor to start this company well the bigger risk was telling the CEO of Intel which is I had been at the previous year that the project they were spending call it 100 million dollars a year was never gonna work cuz until only has what's called rail-to-rail processes and for this chip that we were making to be the best in the world we needed graded levels of voltage not just zero or high and so that killed the project and then I thought I'd never do commercial work again and I I applied to be a professor at MIT and got got a calling in and the founder met that had to stay two days to meet with the founder of Media Lab Nicholas Negroponte a-and this sort of ten minute meeting is for him to check off on me as a professor turned into a three-hour meeting and we started One Laptop Per child but I needed to start something and I got the faculty gig it's kind of like a safe lifetime gig I sold my houseboat and Sausalito moved there but I didn't find it at all risky to do that started my first startup I did after having brain surgery and I needed healthcare and we got some like this is us finishing my PhD four million dollars of dark but from DARPA so that seemed pretty low risk and then I was the CTO and I said look I'll join if I get to pick the health insurance because I had a brain tumor so in my 20s so you know I'm fine I finished my PhD afterwards done all the stuff so the sense but there's a stigma I just really had a brain tumor or you start smart or not and I'd have to take pills every 12 hours since 1995 or I die so I care a lot about getting a good health insurance so that was a risk for me One Laptop Per child we had like all this money to try it and I also have this faculty gig although I did have to choose at one point the president of MIT sent me a letter did this sort of project manager thing that's what she thought it was for $100 laptop or be a professor and I sort of thought huh couple dozen students couple dozen papers or the opportunity to transform educational opportunities for the children of the world we literally throw away half the children that are born in the world in that they don't get anything any of us would consider to be an education so it was a pretty easy choice it's a nice way to get fired she's like okay get it out your system and then comment like okay so like even then it was like get it out of your system then come back and do it and they just because it seemed even though it's a not-for-profit it seemed like a startup and for ethical and conflict-of-interest reasons both myself and the director of the Media Lab had to leave I just didn't come back because the not-for-profit made a billion dollars of revenue catalyzed thirty billion dollars of revenue fair for profit partners became the fastest-growing consumer electronic category ever recorded and transformed the lives collectively between us and the for-profit companies of a hundred million children in the world and I was definitely I'm just like well there are not enough MIT professors sleeping on the factory floors of the world I grew up in a farm I don't care like it's fine like Adi make things that can actually directly transform people's opportunities in life and we had just done it so I moved to Asia Wow and left MIT sadly it was 2008 I mean I woke up every day for three years saying I gave up being an MIT professor to be in this economic collapse where R&D is all it was just likely Google bought my company but yeah it was it was really rough so that was risky so there were some points where you actually did feel like some regret maybe like oh maybe I shouldn't have done this and you weren't really sure while you were on the I think at the end of the startup particularly I'm always metaphorically curled up in the fetal position with a blankie and wanting a bottle of tequila but you know like but then you know you got to shake it off get up the next day and figure out what you're gonna do next but you know you put all of yourself into these things and it doesn't always go right people remember the successes it's a cliche but the failures really suck but yeah yeah so OLPC was really I thought not much risk to do it although I mean my mom wanted to disown me finally her daughter was this respectable and my favorite message is like why are you leaving and I just you know I just I needed to do it so I had to give up MIT to do it which was hard because they really wanted to loved MIT I wanted to be MIT as well but um it's much more risky when you put all of your savings you put your house up for more against you take millions of dollars from your friends as I did at the entity because I started this company called pixel Qi where we were the I mean I don't know if you remember q3 2008 but like the sky really fell I really felt and like in q4 like on Sand Hill Road like there were free drinks in the fridge and the lights were on but there was no money going out of that and I had just started this I just mean this billion dollar thing and I was commercializing a lot of that technology to get people really low-power screens that were sunlight-readable retinal resolution before Apple had retinal resolution that we're in the lowest cost laptop ever made by far they went into a hundred dollar laptop that we shipped that I designed and architected and shipped and delivered a high-volume mass production and so I got money but I had to take millions of dollars to my friends I wanted my friendship it's interesting somebody was talking in the intro about Thursday night dinner rooster kale was one of my investors who Internet Archive and you know I was not gonna lose their money so a great you know personal costs I didn't see my family free I lived in Asia or on a plane and it was it was really quite difficult it was Sisyphean it was the fabs that make the LCD screens were running at negative 40% margin there were multi billion dollar fines for price fixing this CEOs were going to jails in California for the price fixing scandal but we had nothing to do with it I was a professor totally like you couldn't hire a sales guy you had to go to the DOJ website to find out if they were under indictment for price-fixing and literally all of them were under indictment and see like it was just it was awful but Sergey Brin really liked what I was doing and hired the company so I got to worry for Sergey Bryan at the end of it who was Sergey Brin is a co-founder of Google Larry so that was good it was five years help well what do you think the your biggest learning was from that experience then you know what did you learn that maybe you applied in your next startup it sounds like you you know like it was really I didn't want to lose them money from my friends but it just you know it nearly destroyed me I think it was very painful in a way that my first two startups weren't because even though we were shipping product like we'd have these contracts really good deals in sales and so forth and then literally go into a meeting and they're like go ahead sue us a broke anyway I'm going to jail next week I don't care see I found myself like riding my bike around figuring out where that executives kid played soccer I wasn't really stalking I'm just like Oh Junior play soccer here by the way that deal can we do this in stuff it had to be in a minute and shake and like you know now I know all the executive a good part about us I know the executives all over Asia and how to renegotiate fast because just a handshake at that point because they're not gonna sign anything we can get something out of it and I had to figure that out to try to save the company and that was that was hard I know all the bike paths in Taipei yeah so closing earlier and you know since we're here in Berkeley you know we have a lot of students who want to do like the social impact startups and ventures is there any other advice that you would give to them about starting a social impact venture yeah you know you probably have the idea how do you get the money and I would say what I do is they think of this crazy fun idea of something I want to do and I start telling everybody I'm gonna do it and you know you have to be willing to have them think you're stark raving mad you just have to be willing like everything I've ever done of any note when I first voiced it people thought I was stark raving so if they think that great you're on the right track there even a little bit jealous that's you know and you know take the feedback what you have to hear is like oh that'll never work they can say that but would be really helpful is if you can ask them why it won't work and they might have some good and write them down like I remember in the hundred dollar laptop days I was over with a very very very large maker of consumer electronics like very very I knew not Swiss Anil with you and the Chairman wanted to see me so I flew over and saw the Chairman and watch into this room he was flanked by four EVPs on one side four EVPs on the other side and they just started laughing at me it was just me on the other side they still wore a suit I can't tell the country but it would be obvious if I said the name of the country and they just started laughing and they're like hundred dollar laptop hahaha I'll never work and I realized I was actually the humor portion of their day and so the women in the audience will like this I pulled out a notebook and I'm like okay tell me why it won't work and I did athlete sig notes for the next hour and a half at the end of the hour and a half there were like 21 things on the list and like you know 16 of these totally solved but these new five these are really good we hadn't thought you guys know a lot about laptops of course you got a lot about laptops you know a lot about manufacture you know a lot about you know the whole end-to-end thing here's what I'm gonna do as I proposed to the chairman of this extremely large company with eight executive vice presidents in the room I was gonna take it back to the team the team that was just me did not and we were gonna chew on him for a while and could be come back and have some dialogue the next three months see how he got through it and it was very good for face and then I realized wow this is a great way to get people and this is to answer the question to debug your idea on paper it's so much easier everybody says build something first deploy like it's actually way easier to think about it on paper first with people that have expertise in different aspects of what you're trying to do because they can debug it really fast and can save you a whole bunch of time so I started arranging for meetings with every high-level executive I could get to call me back and basically I think in three months later Kofi Anan the then head of the United Nations unveiled my hand-soldered prototype for the hundred dollar laptop at the United Nations summit on the digital divide and at that point there after almost every head of state on earth one of the laptops on mass through the ministries of Education in their country is to distribute to the children like textbooks and so that was enough at that point to show sales and marketing for the manufacturers who had laughed in my face just three months earlier to say whoa we could move a lot of product this way yep and that design is really solid the CTOs said the CTOs that they trust it yep so you know you like you hear you have to ear the negative feedback and just view it as you know like like you know like a lawyer like an engineer just write it down like it's just problem solving simultaneous problem solving of all these things and so that's that's what I would do is just tell everybody and if it's really a fun crazy project the crazy if you tell people about it kindred spirits will beat a path to your door because they want to work on it too and they're gonna be good at this other thing that you're not and then you know then you can do it together and it's less lonely and then you can somebody else can point out a thing and that's how I kind of do everything you just start with this crazy idea but you have to be willing to let people laugh at you it's okay just it's part of the process I think that's so interesting yeah I think that you know not to stereotype engineers but sometimes engineers might jump to building something right before they even you know see if people want it or see if yeah if there are customers for it so since that initiative you this is how you developed your ideas for all of your adventures you've been you've told people who you think might be interested and if they're not laughing at you then maybe your idea is not big enough yeah exactly it has to be really big I mean for also I mean what's really this latest thing that I'm doing I really wasn't sure I'd left Facebook to pursue we'll talk about later this project in doing and I wasn't sure if I should go back to the University if it should be enough for profit if you should stay and do it at Facebook but it just really seemed like a swing for offenses venture-capital kind of thing and that we could when we could get to scale its if successful so I decided to create it as a start up for that reason it matches well with what venture capital needs to do with its structure like they need 10x hundred X returned they make all their money I would have you know as Reed Hoffman writes he's like what are the three companies starting this year that will actually have a thousands the three it will actually matter in seven years to his top line bottom line and there's there are only three so he needs to be in more than three but you know that's what venture capital works on and so they're gonna bet on you if you have an opportunity to do that you know if you're doing social good here's the really interesting thing about venture capitalists it's not just about money they're totally happy to do social good to like they'd love for it to work especially it doesn't end up being one of those three and it's providing great you know return for Humanity that's fantastic if it can even just do 2 X 3 X 10 X that kind of thing it's also awesome everybody focuses on the top ones but you can you can work in that structure in an in a VC structure they might not fund you if they don't think you can be one of those three but if you fall short as BAU Z's do you can still have an interesting business that delivers a lot of good for Humanity and they're really great with that actually that's really interesting thank you for sharing that okay I think we want to move a little bit to your some of your experiences you have had a lot of interesting experience so for example you were head of the displayed division at Google X which is alphabets kind of moonshot factory for developing innovative ideas such as the self-driving car for example so keen tells me a bit about your experience at Google X and and really how did like innovation work there and how is it different than I started unlimited money that's helpful it's not I actually think the data says otherwise the unlimited money means a lack of discipline and Bell Labs is the exception to the rule not the rule if you look at these places Xerox PARC interval research you know I don't want to ever diss my former employer but if you look at the impact of the venture capital funding model versus this big corporate Labs it's undeniable with the exception being bailed out historically but at that time it really wasn't much PC when that was really inventing the transistor and all this elapsed was that the Google ever a Google of its day that just basically printed money from it was a monopoly and actually got killed for being a monopoly I don't know how much your background but like so they had they had an amazing orange a legendary R&D efforts with lots and lots of nobel prizes and incredible work that has had wide-ranging impact but i would say i'm actually more comfortable and in executing something that can change things and for part of that you do need this discipline mm-hmm rather than and and I think it's Google X on some level was about Google now called the mother company it's now part of as you said alphabet cuz it was in Google but yeah it's called alphabet now we don't have to go through that transition um I think it was about Google alphabet getting good at hardware and so attracting extraordinary talent in hardware by letting them do these audacious moonshot projects to beef up the talent but part of it was Google learning how to get good at hardware they were good at but you know datacenters but the hardware and stuff that we're talking consumer electronics cars stuff like that has taken longer and it's a large organization of getting good at that I think there's another value yeah but I've I found it way easier to have impact working through a VC structure yeah it kind of reminds me how sometimes startups can thrive when they actually put on more constraints on their project right so is that kind of the discipline that you're referring to of they have so much money so they can kind of do anything so there's nothing to constrain them to actually focus on different but the physics has to win not just you know like I just actually it's not even that it's the the like they're really our equations and you can really write them on the board I need and even though everybody doesn't know what the five syllable words mean there aren't like the notion of generalist and the flexible computer scientist is very very powerful in software startups but that's not going to you know make the new car engine like or the like there are the a bunch of different things that you have to know about to drive what the correct direction is and I'm sorry like there's just there's a lot of detail in it yes you have to be generalist but you have to have this deep expertise and the stuff I was doing in optics and physics and electronics to lead you to the correct direction and I think it was by nature I think in the big software ate the world right so the decisions are made by people who have made the most successful businesses pick a time and certainly last hundred fifty years whatever and so they're sure they're right but you know actually what they're really good at is something else and so I just would rather I made the math and science have to lead on the decision-making from what's doable or isn't because it can take you three years to make prototype you can just at Facebook like literally somebody changes two lines approach ships it out a million people if it doesn't break anything that's out to a couple billion people to the end of the week old school maybe it's different now I'm not like you know like you can't do that with hardware because there's this fundamental thing about hardware it seems obvious when I say it you can't change it after you ship it can't and that means the way you structure the design and development quite different and so that I think is a hard thing for that so I mean they're great great time there it was break you know it's really nice after all those tough days oh great but yeah for me it's better and more entrepreneurial yeah I'm Lauren Street Fighter and that's also like you know every so Google II and I don't know I tried but you know it's okay like it's okay if you're entrepreneurial um I like it when the big company buys my company and then I'm there for a couple years to hand it over and then I go back to be entrepreneurial it's more uncomfortable and it just depends different people are good at different things and it's fine we need all different types of people so you mentioned Facebook so maybe we should just jump to talking about them so yeah you worked at Facebook as well and you were the executive director of oculus at Facebook of dread of engineering so yeah so maybe how was the culture like oculus and you know VR and AR has notoriously been kind of a small market since it's been around what is the future of VR and AR right um the biggest moneymaker in entertainment is first-person shooter games um as I mentioned I grew up with guns so now I was working with people that every night what they did for fun is go home and virtually shoot the crap out of each other so it wasn't really the culture for me I'm just gonna say so like I was not you know fine like a teenager but like I just you know like I was interested in other things and yeah so what did what um so VR na are like what's happening with it in some level I've been working on it since the 80s and holography for things with surgery air traffic control be anywhere with anyone at anytime is what it can enable but there are four major problems that are preventing the mass adaptation of vrn AR and one is the the headset or whether it's telepathic or contact lens or an implant or you know the one thing that's acceptable to wear in your face and this really has to be this form factor not a shoe box that's one two is the the space the mapping of the space and when they touch this chair my finger hits the chair not an inch above not an inch below that's the mapping of the space three is how you interact like voice yes voice has gotten so much better maybe that's the thing gesture you know it's no longer keyboard and mouse or touch screen that doesn't make any sense in VR so there's that making that interaction as natural as our interaction is if it's a lot of gestures and body language that needs to be subtly caught and then for what is the content that passes sorry Larry Page CEO of alphabet has this rule when you pitch product to them has to pass the the toothbrush test which means people have to use it once there hopefully twice a day and so what is the content that's gonna get people in to the RNA are in a way that they love it and need it the way you use toothbrush or more that's at least six minutes a day of oral care you're following dental guidelines I think maybe it's more sorry flossing and the whole thing right so what it what is that and so those are four really hard problems and there's a lot of a lot of effort on it but it's gotten a lot better but I'll given the tens of billions of dollars of investments people are calling it VRA are winter right now companies are I saw another company on name escapes me went out of business this week but they're nobody's really executed on them the big companies may keep happy on because you know they if apples doing it Google has to do it and Facebook has to do and Microsoft has to do it because they don't want somebody else to get it so you know there's a lot of talent working on on the long term efforts and so some things can come out there's certainly great in each stuff yeah fantastic niche stuff or a lot of stuff in hospitals it's reading burn victims treating you know people say psychiatric stuff there's there's ton tons and tons of stuff like that that's really useful though it takes a long time to get through FDA but the big companies can have they have the the reserves to get through it the question is you know how do how do you solve all four of those problems the thing that I observed at Facebook was that the 3d sensing stuff that's now in every iPhone and most other smartphones was going to give does give it's like coming a few years ago an opportunity for something I thought was much more interesting than VR and AR and you know honestly it's because I've been thinking about VR and AR for 30 years and you know if you ever get like that know the young people like it's all magical of them like switch fields like help you are you paper like you know like it's new for somebody else and maybe they can find it but like maybe you need to go do something new cuz you know like yet another young twentysomething would come into my office and tell me you know gasping about what the future was like yeah yeah that was Jamie I could tell you every you know paper from the 70s and the 80s and the 90s and and and here were the five problems then and how are you gonna solve these five problems like you know let them go and do it but I noticed that these camera chips are coming out with very very high efficacy in the near-infrared light and your bodies were translucent to near-infrared light and what was cool about these camera tips since they had pixels the size of the wavelength of light and I thought that could be incredibly disruptive to allow us to see inside of our bodies and brains and telepathically communicate and diagnose cancer heart disease my life was saved by an MRI and nearly didn't have it because it's too expensive I didn't know I needed it but somebody sprung for the cost of it so I got to live a brain tumor I mentioned before was family and the cost of MRI hasn't changed in the 25 years since my brain tumor was diagnosed and I nearly died I dropped out of my PhD in physics to go home to die I was living in a wheelchair slipping 20 hours a day body full of sores on and on around anyway so it's still expensive and I thought wow you know the number of people working on VR and AR is not a problem they don't really need me like I'm in X - yeah I got some expertise but you know nobody sees this thing so if I went off and said huh what can we do with this manufacturing process development that tens of billions of dollars were spent to make these manufacturing process improvements to make these camera chips with very small pixels and high it's called quantum efficiency light - electrons you want photons converted to electrons at a high rate that's called quantum efficiency and they're in they cost a buck and they're in your iPhone and what can we do to to basically rethink medical imaging and also seen thoughts using these chips and we've now architected new chips and we're well on our way but I just sort of you know it becomes like it's pretty crowded and I think that's the problem yeah I think I'm real so I like to go off in these new spaces so yeah let's talk about open water so yeah so you recognize that personally the fMRI can have a big impact and can save lives yeah and then you also recognize this technology that maybe could be used for this yeah so when did you recognize that this was something that you want to work on and yeah oh it's this I didn't know with infrared but this is what I pitched for my professor job and MIT in 2005 and then I started and like you know I get the hundred all your laptop to work faster it's what I pitched to Sergey that got him to aqua hire and my company was pitching you know let's do brain computer communication non-invasively and i this idea and he hey Akwa hired my company and I show up and like great we're gonna do this he's like no no no I just consumer electronics people are kind of boring and I wanted to make sure you were creative but I need you to do this other stuff it was great I was happy to do this other stuff I can tell you about it too but like um but then um Mark Zuckerberg really wanted to meet and somebody happen to googled it and it's kind of angry at cuz I'm so loyal and then like no like okay I'll have dinner and then Mark somehow figure out my comp pact and put a zero a 10x on my compensation I thought Google paid really well kind of buying me as a person only and I started to tell mark about brain computer communication and I swear his feet didn't touch the ground for the rest of the dinner I'm going and you made me text Sergey right there like so I did like no you're good I'm doing it so um but then I started he's like look you know we really are spending a lot of money on VR and AR you know nobody's relationship to anything we need you know somebody this missus ship consumer electronics it's distinguished by the optics and the displays so I that's what Facebook needed me to do so you need starts with these ideas but then the reality of economics and I am very happy to help but it just there's so many people coming into it I thought I should go over here and my kids be more good over here and it may fail so I spent a year working alone because I didn't know if it had legs and then I got it and then you know the company a year by myself two years with with people and we're now you can look at our website we have images that rival MRI and we've shown I showed live on stage at Ted focusing through skull and brain to the diameter of a neuron where we could read and potentially write in Iran states as well with this non-invasively no surgery need I've had brain surgery hardest thing I did in my life I know I go to this brain computer interface conferences and everybody's cracking up in the sky hey man I'm like you know I don't think it's a big market when he actually comes to it you're gonna do it you're gonna die but otherwise you're gonna wait for a later generation pretty sure so non-invasive plus is the privacy issue of never being able to take it out of your brain and again I've been at Facebook they had some privacy issues makes those seems small let me think about your innermost thoughts and that last bastion of privacy so I think there's so anyway so working on that and really what that also enables us we use focused ultrasonic pings as well and it turns out if we focused these ultrasonic things for longer we can do surgery about the 9th we could cure diabetes we could fix broken bones instantly we can go through the blood-brain barrier we can deliver chemotherapy doses at the correct dose but with a hundred X lower amount of chemo waving through your system because we can ultrasonically burst them so what we're talking about is actually ultimately a hospital in the box it's sort of like if you think of space acts as an innovator they're going to Mars not dying on impact but you know they're making the money launching satellites so we're starting with medical imaging but our Mars is the whole thing like brain computer interface surgery without the knife all of that but starting with the thing I think three-quarters of humanity lacks access to which is how we diagnose diseases we diagnose them later it there's more it's more expensive more pain and suffering less good outcomes so getting earlier lower cost medical imaging without radiation that's what we're starting on first for products so what are some think we you know what are some what challenges that you have been moving forward because this you know sounds like an awesome startup and I know that you're you're growing what are some yeah we have some challenges that you're working on right now well the biggest challenge that emerged this summer was the laser kind of the specs on that we use basically three three major new components we've developed a laser and you're kind of camera chip and any kind of ultrasonic chip the ultrasonic and camera chips can be made in the silicon fabs of Asia the laser ultimately can be but it was getting pretty expensive pretty big so we beefed up the lazer team we've got this extraordinary lazer team even have like AI Nobel Prize winner and laser physics as an advisor we've got a bunch of and we've worked on lowering the cost and a several different laser approaches because one of the things about the laser is nice to have it's a pulse laser so it pulses low most like a flash and a flash camera in here when you're at night and so it also has to have a very very very fine color or what's called line width and so we've spent a lot of effort on that and made some huge progress from a systems perspective in reducing the difficult specs for the laser in ingenious ways and these are part these patents aren't mine there's my incredible incredible people that we have come together to make open water that I get to work with every day who are just I mean it's just it's just astonishing to walk in here the ideas I was working in the lab this afternoon and got to hear about even a new invention that like there's a guy that started last week and it's just so interesting to see how we come together in this multidisciplinary team to to sort of solve the problem basically we're cost downing and shrinking it right now cause down sorry that's my chinese-english but lowering the cost profile even of the prototypes so we'll have alpha kits this year we're scanning live rats on these this back half of the year and we're working on the the claw stem and laser those are the three challenges in front of us and then we're looking at development partners who know more about it's like the balkanization of the healthcare industry like everybody goes to the same medical imaging suite in the hospital but all the departments are based on body part like knee or breast or heart or head or nose or ear you know like literally it's a whole set of different doctors for each body part it's amazing so you know knowing the ins and outs of end to end facts and you know how the nurses are using it how the reimbursement happens how it blah blah blah blah blah so we're working and attracting companies who were working on development without great well thank you so much I think we have some students that will want to ask some questions yeah I mean I think Mary Lou will answer almost any question so I would love to actually see if there any questions in the back we usually start in the front so I'll let you all think a little bit yeah fantastic coming over there I only have one microphone but if you would just state your name and and what you're focused on in terms of academics or not hi my name is Linus Lee I'm studying CS as an undergrad you mentioned Bell Labs at some point in the middle of the session and you've also worked out at Google X and these other sort of researching but also focused on like investing a lot of capital a lot of resources into bringing new technologies forward what do you think is the thing that set Bell Labs apart in its ability to like create basically all the infrastructure that underlies technology today versus the amazing but not quite incredible things that X and these other laboratories are doing because we see didn't exist like there was no other I guess there was IBM research but it was it was they were pouring money into the best brains they could got there was this they had this this structure I think has been replicated but I think I had to do with the time and that nobody else was pouring money but there are people that in this room that I'm looking at the know way more about their example but I that's my in summary I think it was the time where Xerox PARC tried to do it but you know Steve Jobs got to visit and stole them out like it's very there's this famous book CRX part fumbling the future how they invented all this stuff for personal computing revolution refused to ship a ship at because you know there's also this tendency of that so I I can talk to you more about it later and recommend a few books but not my area of expertise sorry maybe it's yours no thank you hi I'm oh my name is Noah I'm from Paris I'm doing grad studies in entrepreneurship at Berkeley and I was wondering if like what's your take maybe like to have would you see the future of medical imagery being in holography since you have been working in holography would you like see some pretty good advantages to having holographic medical images and using them sure what we're doing it's interesting in Bell Labs dennis gabor invented holography at Bell Labs but it was an information theory thing not just capturing the intensity of light but the phase of light because you can view light as a wave and the interferes and by capturing the interference you have more information and that's what we're using with near-infrared light where there's a hundred years of predicate products using near-infrared light to see inside of the body approved by the FDA it's a really really lousy resolution people use something called ballistic light which is the light that doesn't get scattered but here's the problem x-rays go through your body gamma rays 2-ton magnetic fields and near-infrared light and red light actually if you take your camera out turn on the flashlight and put it over your finger you're gonna see red light going straight through you can just do it right now guess what switch is far cheaper the red light the problem is no one could figure out how to de scatter the light and when I saw what was coming down the pike for 3d sensing for VR and AR weed micron sized pixels that's the size of the wavelength of white oh it's just like oh oh my god like you could record a hologram and then mathematically discover the light with Fourier transform so sorry like with like um just mathematically decode that image of the interference structures from an information theory yes of course we can do it in 3d we can throw it in the air Anu yeah yeah I've been doing 3d for like 30 years yeah yeah but the hard part is that an MRI still cost more than a thousand dollars and you know the cost structure would take this full stage it's the most expensive room in the hospital if take a CT scan you can only have 10 of them or your chance of cancer goes up to 6% from the CT scan itself and you know like we could actually treat disease is much more differently for example the most expensive disease for every country of the world is brain disease and we use a subjective measure of brain disease like you basically answer these questions it's called DSM depressions a huge one you use typical depressed person loses 12 years of employment for depression and they answer these questions subjective questions are you eating a lot have you gained weight are you sleeping a lot do you have thoughts of suicide if you answer yes to a bat and a litany of questions that's the definition of clinical depression and you're out of it when you stop answering yes and instead if we can MRI them we can look at a pattern what type of depression how the therapy is working and how it's getting better and worse but you can't do that right now because it's too expensive for example breast imaging we use mammography half of women have dense breast tissue and you can't diagnose until stage 3 typically so that means the woman takes a year off from work goes through chemo fog it's really expensive why don't we just like do an MRI we know we would save the death rate would go down in half we don't do it because it's too expensive it's only the single reason it's how we diagnose all kinds of cancer and diseases by seeing inside of her bodies so it's just seems I don't know yeah we can put it in 3d you know the radiologists love to see all the noise the surgeons love the 3d it's okay like they can all have the version software like we can give them whatever they want they should be happy and you know the machine learning is better than the radiologists it's a coding it but we like radiologists we want everybody like let's get the tools to everybody but yeah I mean it's it's really it's really interesting to see if we can get these tools out to all the people that can use them faster keeps me hi miss Jepsen my name is Vishal I'm a first-year studying computer science and one of the questions I had for you is when you're doing like social good projects or sorry when you're doing social good projects or startups there's a lot of emphasis on impact so it's wondering like how do you measure your impact and then also kind of relate it to that I think you mentioned that open waters you know you're like grand idea is to like be able to like you're like final solution is not what you're currently implementing like right now you have you're like imaging business which is mainly funding the company so I was wondering like are you guys like still are you guys mainly funded by that business or by like a VC funding or yeah are we getting sorry are we getting what by what it's just um eat the mic yes sir okay that's better yeah so basically my question was like how do you measure like your impact like your social startups and projects and then also for example in open waters you're mentioning how you have like an imaging business that's mainly funding the company so I was wondering like are you sorry mainly funded by VC funding all right we're we don't have a product yet so we're we're pre-revenue meaning we're just spending money the VC invest in us but the the fastest way we can start the way I measure impact is is is in this case diagnosing conditions of people in the case of oval PC was getting the laptops with the internet to the kids we went a lot of wards the big reward by far was getting the laptops to kids I remember the first kid that wrote to me his name was badness he was in Nigeria he got a prototype laptop and he wrote to me and he said I love my laptop more than my life no I wrote back to that no cuz I'm like that's kind of screwed up right and then I wrote to badness and he was a poor kid he wasn't we didn't how the school fees or the uniform but he swept up in the in the in the effort and he wasn't allowed to be a full student but they gave him a laptop anyway and actually in bad mrs. situation totally healthy response I thought so we became a pen palette with badness who's now you know in college actually and so here's the thing is like the impact is like on on the lives change to transformed in a positive way um no yeah PC wants to get their money back and you know if there was any innovation in medical imaging there was this would actually be hard but hasn't changed in five years could you imagine them consumer electronics the price and size of something the same is like 1995 like that would be nuts so that that's how we measure impact there's lots of studies to measure impact but for me that's that's the thing that really means the most to me is is is the human change oh and by the way and it's it's really I should say the life cycle and particularly as we enable brain computer communication I just want to point out we're not the only living things with brains on the planet and we might start collaborating with them and stop eating them it's possible maybe one will get into Berkeley how long will it take I mean seriously it's it's in reach can we make that faster think of diversity then Berkeley could lead on go bears right first of all thank you for sharing your story my name is Yura studying economics at Berkeley what makes you keep motivated after undergoing so many difficulties and success well I think that I as I mentioned quite honestly I have to take a dozen medications a day or I die and I don't always think about this but sometimes it's really hard to get them and sometimes they look I put them all in the same bottle because it's easy to carry around I look down like you know if I don't take these I die so what do you want we're alive now what do you want to do when you're alive and so I actually have to face that more often than most people but in fact any of us could walk out I hope this doesn't happen get run over by bus like right tonight like it could happen if we somehow forget that and the big secret which shouldn't be such a secret is every single one of us is gonna die we just don't know when so what do you want to do now because now it's the moment so that's that's what I try to focus on but yeah there are tough days and really tough days and and you know sometimes I have a couple of glasses of wine and watch trash TV like try to chill and try to figure out and sleep on it and then it can maybe solve the problem but you know especially the people's stuff can be hard when people are kind of dissing you the ways that aren't you don't perceive to be fair you know there's really you know there's a lot of stuff there's a lot of pain but you know you try to focus on what you can get done and get this the people that can support you and like you know like who can run with you to try to to if you're doing a big enough goal you can bring people around you that are way more fun to hang out with and all the naysayers that you have to walk through or all the people that keep resources from you or bully or all this stuff yeah there's a lot of it curious what's trash TV for Mary Lou Jack we just watched as good as the spy was about agent 88 Israeli who infiltrated the Syrian government and became in the assistant deputy of Defense Minister it's crazy it was interesting I didn't know that would happen it was a true story kind of was awesome it's on Netflix binge watch hi hello my name is Fabiola I'm studying a one-year program on entrepreneurship and I wanted to ask like what would be the advice or what was the hardest thing ah I like for changing pads for for example you being a professor and then changing to entrepreneurship oh right so I did my first startup I I only got my PhD because I was such you know holography is there are no jobs for ads for holography like basically I'd have to convince some boss to fund something and then when the money got tight you know guess what got cut first holography and I just thought I would die if I couldn't make Holograms and I think it's also an entrepreneurship I feel like I would die if I don't part of me would die and so I guess um I only got my PhD because at that time I'm older than I think a lot of you I just thought it was a union card for being a woman in technology like the amount of crap you had to put up with with a PhD was less than without a PhD and I just thought it was a faster path and so really it's like oh yeah I got that PhD handy I could be a professor because I have the union card and I was just using it as a way to do interesting work rather than caring what the format was like how do I find interesting work and at the time this the computer graphics stuff I was too in Australia for example or the Media Lab I done my graduate degree at the media them MIT Media Lab it just seemed like a really great platform to do interesting work and so that that's why I did it but it in that obviously the students are the coolest part about being a professor and I had no idea what I thought being a professor was like gonna be like being grad school it's not it's really like a lot of meetings and the grad students get to do all the cool work well I don't know what do you think I think it's fun it's great but like the best part about being a professor is getting to hang out with the students so I think and so that was awesome but I just you know like what do you do you like when you create a billion dollar not-for-profit catalyzing like the fastest growing consumer electronic category ever recorded you kind of have to look at like you know maybe I could help more here and here there's a lot of professors maybe I should go over here maybe I could do more value or deliver more values how I think of it but I didn't really I just really liked holography and I tried to finally snitch away from kind of what felt to me like bullying we haven't talked about gender much but there were even less women and so I just found this space that was comfortable like in holography it was like half artist half scientists and it was really interesting because good Holograms have to have really good signal-to-noise ratio sounds technical but it's not high signal noises bad signal is good guess who made nicer Holograms with better signal noise ratio the scientists are the artists the artists because they were sewing it and they wanted no noise in their Holograms so in the conference says they're like 5050 men and women in the 80s and so it was like a really kind of healthy environment and I really I really loved the people and I loved the work and it was just a really nice kind of nurturing place to be for a while and grow and so I just really wanted to keep staying in that environment unfortunately there are no jobs and especially after my brain tumor I had to sell out and go flat because I really need the health insurance so I started working on 2d displays so I could get health insurance we're so glad you started and continued working and continued doing so many different things I can't wait to see what open water is going to do for the world frankly and I thank you for coming I know students will want to come up and talk to you later which is why I'm cutting the questions a little bit short I think they want to get a little bit closer I want to thank everybody for their attention and most of all Keith and Mary Lou thank you so much [Applause]
