 [Music] [Music] hello my friends today we are going to discuss about the ultrasonic inspections so last couple of lectures just we are discussing about the different types of non-destructive testing methods so ultrasonic inspections is one of them so basically the ultrasonic inspections it's also a non-destructive testing that means we are not going to harm our materials or maybe that we are not going to destroy our materials and here from the name itself you can understand that we are using the ultrasonic waves to conduct the examinations and make the measurements so generally the ultrasonic inspections can be used for the floor detections or maybe the evaluations dimensional measurements that what is the sample width or maybe the height or maybe the thickness material characterizations and other move then what is the ultrasonic wave underserving waves are high frequency sound waves so when I am talking about this particular chart so you can see that below 20 Hertz generally you are calling it as a infrasound so from 20 Hertz to 20 kilo Hertz generally it is called the acoustic generally within this range our ear can hear all the sounds over there and if that sound in frequency is more than 20 kilohertz that time we are calling it as a ultrasound and generally that frequency we are using for the non-destructive testing properties of ultrasonic waves so ultrasonic waves are no different from normal sound in its physical properties except in that humans cannot hear it so it is beyond our audible capacity they have the following properties what are those ultrasonic waves cannot travel through the vacuum so always it needs some media these waves trouble with speed of sound in a given medium their velocity remains constant in homogeneous media they are reflected and refracted just like the light waves that means if I pass any kind of ultrasonic waves and if I am having one certain materials so it will come and it will be reflected or maybe the refracted through that particular surface their velocity mainly depends on the density and young modulus of materials speed of ultrasonic waves is more in more dense media like so in this case you can see that velocity of solid is the maximum than the liquid and then liquid is maximum than the gas examples for air the velocity is 330 meter per seconds for water it is 14 80 meter per seconds and for still it is 5920 meter per seconds so in this case you can see that when you are talking about the solid that is like steel the ultrasonic waves velocity is moved now principle of the ultrasonic inspections first is called the acoustic impedance what is that acoustic impedance Jade of a material is defined as the product of its density Rho and the acoustic velocity V so simple generally we are calling acoustic impedance Jade is equal to Rho and V ultrasound troubles in a very straight line and get reflected when it strikes an interface between materials with different speeds of sound acoustic impedance and interface between materials with a larger difference in acoustic impedance reflex ultrasonic waves more strongly so in this particular case you can see we are having one medium and we are having another medium like medium 1 and medium 2 so some incoming waves are coming some is reflected and some is transmitted so generally we are calling it as a wave propagation at an interface interface with smaller difference in acoustic impedance reflects them less strongly and let's part of them trouble through the fraction of the incident wave intensity that is reflected can be calculated as capital R is equal to Z 2 minus Z 1 by Z 2 plus Z 1 whole square where Z 1 and Z 2 are the acoustic impedance of me 1 & 2 respectively now how it works basically the working mechanism so a pulsar or receiver is an electronic device that is used to produce high voltage electrical pulses driven by the pulsar that transducer generates high frequency ultrasonic energy so simple I am having one probe so simple I am giving the current over there and then after that it is creating the ultrasonic pulse or maybe the energy the sound energy introduced and propagates through the material in the form of waves when there is a discontinuity such as a crack in the way path part of the energy will be reflected back from the flow surface otherwise it will go through the substance itself plots of the electrical signal versus time so if you see that electrical signals that means volts in the y-axis and time into the x-axis signal travel time can be directly related to the distance that the signal troubled so initial pulse we have started and then it is coming down when the time is increasing then tracks echo is taking place back surface echo is taking place so like this way so now you can get or we easily correlate this plot with this image so when there is no crack so directly it is coming at the bottom of that surface and then it is reflecting and if there is any crack present in between the thickness or maybe in between the surface two surfaces so automatically the waves are coming and it is reflecting from that particular point so now if you calculate the time that how much time is required so automatically can calculate that what is the depth of your particular cracks are present ultrasonic transducers they are also called the probe or search unit we generate and receive ultrasound of all frequencies and intensity sometimes we are calling it as a probe or maybe the horn also transducers for floor detection come in a wide variety of sizes frequencies and case tiles must most have a common in internal structure in selecting a transducer for a given application it is important to choose the desired frequency bandwidth size in some cases focusing which optimizes the inspection capabilities yes suppose you are going to check the simple ship or maybe some complex shapes different depending upon that you can choose your different size and types of your room use of coupling materials coupling materials usually liquid is used to facilitate the transmission of ultrasonic energy from the transducer into the test specimen it is necessary because the acoustic impedance mismatch between air and test specimen is large so that's why nowadays you can see that this ultrasonic we are using heavily for the medical purposes right we are doing the ultrasound testing and if you see properly that when we are doing that kind of testing so we are having that probe and then which body part generally we are going to test simple we are rubbing that probe onto that surface but not into the dry conditions because as I told already ultrasonic wave propagation is only required some media so in that case what you are using we are using some kind of gel kind of materials so that simple the ultrasonic wave directly through that gel it should pass your body so the coupling displaces the air and makes it possible to get some sound energy into the test specimens so that a useable ultrasonic signal can be obtained so now it is clear to us that what kind of medium generally we are using working principle of the transducers the active element of the transducers is a thin disc of piezoelectric ceramics or peejoe composite that works on the phenomenon of pgo electricity so generally we are using some kind of crystal kind of things over there what is PGA electricity or maybe the piezoelectric effect when crystals of some materials are subjected to a mechanical pressure in a certain direction charges of opposite sign developed to their faces normal to the direction of the applied pressure the phenomenon is known as the piezoelectric effect it is a reversible process means electrical signals can be converted into the mechanical vibrations simple so we are having some kind of crystals some crystals are naturally available some crystals generally we are synthesizing in our lab itself so these kind of crystals is having certain properties that in a particular certain side or certain positions if we give them the electrical energy it will generate the mechanical vibrations or maybe if we give the mechanical vibrations it will generate the electrical intensity or maybe the current what causes the piezoelectric effect this effect works because of the movement of the atoms in the crystal molecules simple the atoms will vibrate within its lattice parameter piezoelectric crystals are composed of positive and negative ions in an alternating fashion tensions and compressions push and pull these positive and negative away from either other creating an energy gradient across the crystal and allowing an electric current to flow so in this particular case you can see this is very very compactly bonded so there is no trace stress so when we are giving the tension over there so we are giving the current so and then that time its atom is changing its place so automatically it is generating the current at the time of tension and as well as the in the case of compression also now how we are generating the ultrasound with transducers a piezoelectric element in the transducers convert the electrical energy into the mechanical vibrations that already I have described so piezoelectric crystals it's like a quartz so now I am connecting with this one with the battery and then the effect of the inverse with the charging the polarity and you can see an alternating voltage generates the crystal vibrations so when we are giving the current so automatically the vibration is taking place inside the crystal now come to the ultrasonic wave propagation ultrasonic wave propagate through a medium due to vibrate or oscillating motions of its particles in solids molecules can shape or vibrations in multiple directions hence a number of modes are possible as I told already when the atom or maybe the molecules will try to vibrate so it will vibrate either maybe the longitudinal directions or maybe the horizontal directions or maybe in any other directions two predominant types of waves or modes generated within a material with ultrasonic waves are longitudinal waves generally in short we are calling it as L waves and another one is called the CR waves in short general you are calling it as a S waves so L waves compress and decompress the material in the direction of motion much like sound waves in air they propagate in all kind of materials so this is known as the longitudinal wave so this is the direct up propagation direction of propagation and here is the direction of oscillations so you can see that it is going say suppose I am giving the current over there and then it is deflecting in this particular manner okay and one is the shear waves S waves vibrate particles at right angles compared to the motions of the ultrasonic wave so simple if I give the current the atoms will vibrate in two horizontal directions over there so direction of propagation is in this way and the direction of oscillations is in this way so automatically it is create the 90-degree or maybe the perpendicular to each other the only propagate in solid bodies the velocity of CR waves through a material is approximately half that of the longitudinal waves so that means the efficiency in the terms of longitudinal waves are more than the shear waves now ultrasonic wave mode conversion the angle in which the ultrasonic wave enters the material determines whether the longitudinal shear or both waves are produced example ultrasonic transducer transmits an ultrasonic wave through water into a block of steel so when the direction of the ultrasonic wave is at ninety degree angle with the surface of the steel block no reflection occurs and the L wave is preserved so in this particular case you can see that from top simple the longitudinal waves are coming and then up to the bottom and then it is reflecting back and again it is coming to the transducer itself or maybe that detector itself when the transducer is rotated at an angle five degree in this case so what is happening the longitudinal form of the transducers is converted into two modes one is the longitudinal another one is the sear both wave modes are refracted so one it will come straight another it will come into some angle so one is the L and other one is the S wave over there so if it is become no angle over there but when we are giving a angle over there so automatically that this will also be deflected so one will come in these directions and other will come into the these directions so one is called the L web and other one is called the Israel LOF sand s waves have different angles of refraction because they have dissimilar relative velocities within the same material angles that create two wave modes are not appropriate because they cause the ultrasonic transducer to receive multiple echos making it difficult to analyze the data means there is a chance of the cross sensitivity or maybe the overlapping of the signals so that time it is really difficult to segregate those now come to the critical angle critical angle is one of the parameter that used to avoid the problem of two wave mode generation first is called the first critical angle as the angle of the ultrasonic transducer continues to increases LS move closer to the surface of the test specimen the angle at which the LM is parallel with the surface of the test specimen is referred to as the first critical angle so you see when we are giving that incident beam over there now it is reflecting in this way and some waves are passing at that just the surface of your particular materials so that is known as the first critical angle so if again we are going to increase/decrease this particular angle so automatically these will come up to these positions this angle is useful for two reasons only one wave mode is a code to the transducer make it II make it is easy making it easy to interpret the data also these angles gives the test Besame system the ability to look at surfaces that are not parallel to the front surface such as winds now come to the second critical angle the second critical angle is an incident angle that makes the angle of refraction for the shear wave 90 degree at this point all the wave energy is reflected or maybe the refracted into a surface following shear wave or shear trip so you see that L is coming in this particular case L wave but shear wave is passing through the system itself now classification of the transducers or maybe the probe or as I told may be the horn piezoelectric transducers can be classified on the basis of coupling mechanism the beam orientations the environment were used and in other ways some of the most common classification types are first one is called on the basis of coupling mechanisms like contact immersion or maybe the air coupled on the basis of beam orientations either it may be the normal beam or may be the angle D beam on the basis of number of elements like single element and the dual element classification of transducers on the basis of coupling mechanisms so first is called the contact transducers they appear to come into direct contact with the test specimens so in this case you are having the transducers and you are directly touching with your test surface or maybe the test specimen they require some form of liquid or dry coupling to adequately couple the ultrasound to and from the pasted specimen itself next one is called the immersion transducers immersion transducers operate in a scanning tank where the specimen and the transducers are fully immersed with into the fluid typically into the water so in this particular case it is filled with the water itself so now what is happening so your ultra sonic motion is coming it is passing through the water and then it is going inside your test specimen next one is called the air coupled transducers air coupled transducers require a special layer of material that is impedance matching layer to help send a pulse through air to the sample itself this layer should have an impedance that is intermediate between the acoustic impedance of the transducers and the air itself so in this particular case you can see that we are having that where we are having that case with the acoustic insulator we are having the PG atticus crystals we are having the backing materials and this is the matching layer over there and whole thing is called the electrical sealed so this is called the air coupled transducers classification of transducers on the basis of beam orientations first one is called the normal beam transducers normal beam transducers transmit a wave normal to the face of the transducer itself so in this particular case you can see that beams are coming in to these directions so this is the face of the transducers next one is called the angle beam transducers so angle beam transducers transmitted wave at an angle not normal to the face of the transducers itself so now we are having one wage and the sound path it is coming in to these directions not like that normal so it is creating certain angle over there angle beam of or refracting transducers are usually just longitudinal normal beam transducers attached to a which often made of plastic wage angles are designed to operate between the first and second critical angle to create only a mode converted the shear wave next one is called the classification of transducers on the basis of number of elements first one is called the single element transducers what is that single element transducers contain one active ceramic element these often results in reduced cost and simplicity in design yes of course if you want to increase the crystals number so automatically the cost will increase and not only that the machine will not be or maybe the probe will not be the simple one it will become that complex one is called the dual elements transducers dual element transducers contains separate transmitter and receiver elements housed in a common case so in this case we are having two crystals so one will be the transmitting crystals another one is called the receiving crystals so automatically in this particular case your chances of getting the results more accurately is high this arrangement improves near surface resolutions because the second transducer does not need to complete a transmit functions before listening for echos dual elements are commonly employed in thickness gauging of thin materials next basic test techniques ultrasonic testing is a very versatile inspection method and inspections can be accomplished in a number of different ways it depends on the nature of product manufacturing process surface conditions geometry and accessibility of the scanning area classification of test techniques ultrasonic inspection techniques are commonly divided into three primary classifications as follows pulse eco and through transmission technique relates to whether reflected or transmitted energy is used contact and immersion technique relates to the method of coupling the transducer to the taste articles and the third one normal beam and the angle beam technique relates to the angle that the sound energy enters the test article or maybe the specimen first one is called the pulse echo technique so pulses of ultrasonic waves by the transducers are transmitted into the material under test reflected waves or equal by discontinuities are received by the same or other transducers and displayed on the CRT screen so in this case you can see that pulse are coming and then it is reflecting from the bottom if there is no crack if there is certain cracks so automatically it will be reflecting from that particular crack point the relative size and depth of the discontinuity in terms of amplitude and approximate appropriately calibrated forms displaced on the CRT screen the pulse eco techniques allows testing when access to only one side of the material is possible through transmission technique two transducers located on the opposite sides of the test specimens are used one transducers acts as transmitter and others as receiver through transmissions is useful in detecting discontinuities that are not good reflectors and when signal strength is very very weak next contact mode testing in contact mode of testing the transducers has kept in contact with the test object with a coupled a thin cream of oil glycerin or water is generally used as coupling between the transducers and the test surface it is commonly used for the manual inspection so in this particular case you can see that we are having that direct contact single element probe over there we are having that taste specimen so it is a single crystal in this case we are using the dual crystal one is the transmitter another one is the receiver next one is called the immersion technique in immerse antistick the specimen and the transducers are immersed in a water bath this arrangement allows better movement of the transducer while maintaining consistent coupling that is water immersion testing is employed to achieve high-speed and automatic scanning with enhanced floor detection efficiency so you see this is our probe having the single crystals now the whole systems we have dipped into the water and there is no direct contact in between your transducers and your materials or maybe the specimen so simply you are generating the ultrasonic wave from here and through the water it is coming inside the materials and reflecting back now come to the normal beam inspections in normal beam testing the sound beam is introduced into the test article at ninety degree to the surface itself location of a discontinuity in a part of our structure is found by accurately measuring the transit time of the ultrasonic pulses as I told already the results are expressed by using the following well-known relationship what is that that is the famous relationship that is called the small D is equal to small B into T by 2 where D is the distance from the surface of the discontinuity in the test space so here you can see this is the D V is the velocity of the sound waves in the material itself T is the measured round-trip transit time so what time its requires to go back angle beam inspections in angle beam testing the sound beam is introduced into the test article at some angles other than 90 degree these technique is typically used to introduce a refracted shear wave into the test material an angle sound path allow is the sound beam to come in form of the sight thereby improving detectability of flaws in and around the welded parts now come to the angle beam inspection calculations so this is the case over there so first let us know about the nodes surface points where sound waves reflects that is called the nodes skip distance surface distance of two successive nodes leg one or maybe the capital L one sound path in material to first node lake two or maybe the L 2 sound path in material from first to second node theta our angle of refraction and T is the material thickness so now in this case we are having one leg one so when it is coming and then deflecting it is the leg two so this is the Skip distance over there so what is the Skip distance that is equal to into capital T into 10 for theta R so this is the angle is the theta R that is the incident angle over there and what is that capital T that is the thickness of your particular material now flow locations for the first lake surface distance sine theta R into l1 depth cos theta R into l2 so this is the surface distance over there so you can by trigonometric calculations you can easily calculate that what is the distance and how much is the depth flaw detection for the second leg so in this particular case it is coming over there and then there is certain cracks is generated over there so sine theta R into n1 plus n2 depth to the minus cos theta R into n1 plus n2 so by this case also you can easily calculate the actual point now data presentations information forms ultrasonic testing can be presented in a number of deflecting or may be the differing formats the three most common formats are a scan presentations B scan presentations and the C scan presentations data presentations for a scan a scan presentation displays the amount of received ultrasonic energy as a function of time the relative amount of received energy is plotted along the vertical axis and the elapsed time is displayed along the horizontal axis relative discontinuity size can be estimated by comparing the signal amplitude to that from a known reflector reflector depth can be determined by the position of the single on the horizontal sweep examples so now we are having on transducers here that is transmitted another one we are having the receiver initial pulses generated by the transducers is represented by the signal IP which is near time zero as transducers is scanned along the surface of part for other signals are likely to appear at different times on the skill in itself so that is for the IP when it is directly coming at the bottom then Jade Y X and the B W that is nothing but called the back wall signal so one it will come and then back wall signal and then it is about the Y it is about the Jade it is about the X and another one is coming to the back wall signal so one will be reflected from here that is known as the IP one will be reflected from here that is known as the b/w data presentations beasts can be scanned presentations in a profile view cross-sectional of a test space so in the bee scan the time of flight travel time of the sound energy is displayed along the vertical axis and the linear positions of the transducers is displayed along the horizontal axis from the bee scan depth of the reflector and it's approved summate linear dimensions in the scan deflection direction can be determined it almost represents a photographic type of image of the defect scanning procedure the bee scan is typically produced by establishing a trigger gate on the a scan whenever the signal intensity is great enough to trigger the gate a point is produced on the B scan itself so now you can see in the x-axis we are giving the scan distance and in the y-axis we are giving the time by depth so now we are having that XY and Jade and the IP point and this one is the back wall so here the situation's is looks like this and you are getting the information in this way example in the given B scan line X is produced as the transducer is scanned over the reduced thickness portions of the specimen when transducer moves to the right of this section the back wall line BW is produced when transducers is over flows Y and jade lines that are similar to length of floss and at similar depths within the material are drawn on B scan data presentations C scan it displays a plan type view of the test specimens and discontinuities by mechanically or electrically scanning a XY plane C scan presentations are produced with an automated data acquisition system such as an in immersion scanning use of a scan in conjunction with C scan is necessary when depth determinations is desired scanning procedure typically a data collection gate is established on the a scan and amplitude of the signal is recorded at angular regular intervals as transducers is scanned over the test species so now this is your transducer this is your test piece and defects are present over there so now from the top B we are seeing that this is the trans and this is your crack or maybe the defects relative signal amplitude is displayed as a set of gray or a color for each of the positions where the data was recorded see scan presentation provides an image of the features that reflect and scatter sound we beam and on surface of that test piece next come to the data presentations disk and it displays the through thickness view showing a cross-section of the test object perpendicular to the scanning surface the D scan is similar to the Siskin but the echo time of the flight in relation to the propositions is recorded actually the disc an is a 3d visualization of the object so by this can type you can get the more accurate your result so probe movement is taking place in these directions and the disc and presentation the result will come in this manner so this is the difference of the C scan and the disk and C and D scan image of the membrane tested in a immersion techniques next calibration standards calibration is the operation of configuring the ultrasonic test equipment to the known values this provides the inspector with a means of comparing test signals to known measurements calibration standards are typically manufactured from materials or the same acoustic properties as those of the taste articles purpose of the calibrations to ensure consistent performance of ultrasonic testing instrument to check the sensitivity resolution and characteristics of the ultrasonic probe to evaluate the discontinuities for their size and locations to provide a common basis for expressing the test result next calibration standards ultrasonic reference blocks calibration blocks are parallel for parallel inspection first one is called the thickness calibration standards thickness calibration standards may be flat or curved for pipe and tubing applications consisting of simple variations in the material thickness here you can see step and tap at calibration wedges so simple we are having that known time for that particular materials so when you are using that probe after certain time we need to recalibrate it or check that whether it is giving the exact result or not so that is why after a certain time regular basis or maybe the regular interval we need the calibration testing second distance and area amplitude standards distance or area amplitude standards utilize flat bottom holes or side drilled holes to establish known reflector size which changes in sound path from the entry surface over there here you can see ASTM distance and area amplitude standards so many third one is called that nap ships test block used for distance amplitude correction sensitivity levels and the floor depth information so this is known as the nap sips test block calibration blocks for the non parallel inspections there are also calibration standards for using angle beam inspections when flaws are not parallel to the entry surface these standards utilize side drilled holes not chase and the geometric configuration to establish time distance and amplitude relationships here you can see that we have given so many examples of different calibration blocks for some kind of abnormal surfaces or maybe the irregular surfaces now come to the qualification standards qualification standards are used to assess the proficiency or maybe the qualification of equipment or NDT personnel for specific codes are standard specific codes and standards first one is called the iOW beam profile block so this is the iOW beam profile used for beam profile measurement of angle beam transducers and measurement of transducer angles second one is called the a double resolution block so this is the AWA ssin resolution block used for checking resolution capabilities of angle beam transducers third one is called the D aced test block used to check the horizontal linearity and that DB frequency as per requirements of the AWS DB is nothing but the unit of the sound that is the the boon applications application for which ultrasonic testing is employed include flow detections like cracks inclusions porosity erosion or maybe the corrosion thickness gauging assessment of bond integrating adhesively joined and the best components say suppose I am doing the coating or maybe I am sticking on materials and top of that so what is the positions of the interface if there is any bubble formations or cracks are present or maybe there is some kind of denominations so this kind of loss generally we can measure by these particular techniques estimations of void content in composites and the plastics measurement of case hardening depth in Steel's estimation of grain size in metals so like this way we are doing the railway track inspections if inside that path if there is any cracks has been generated or not weld inspections we are doing testing of composite structures for laminar flaws we are doing ultrasonic testing of the metal bars and nowadays widely we are using it for the medical purposes now what are the advantages and limitations of ultrasonic testing advantages are sensitive to small discontinuities both surface and the internal depth of penetration for flaw detection or measurement is superior to other methods only single sided access is needed when pulse eco techniques is used high accuracy in determining reflector positions and estimating size and shape volumetric scanning ability of objects electronic equipment provides instantaneous results detailed images can be produced with automated systems ultrasonic inspection can be caused to know not only that a flow exists but also the severity of the damage itself but of course there is certain limitations what are those surface must be accessible to translate ultrasound transmit ultrasound skill and training is more extensive than the or maybe then with some other methods normally requires a coupling medium to promote transfer of sound energy into test specimen materials that are rough irregular in shape very small exceptional thin or not homogeneous are difficult to inspect cast iron and other coarse grain materials are difficult to inspect due to low sound transmission and high signal noise linear defects oriented parallel to the sound beam may go undetected so now we have come to the last light of this particular lecture so in summary we can say that ultra sonic testing uses the high frequency sound energy to conduct the examinations and make measurements that already we have gone through the sound energy reflected due to any discontinuity is detected and accordingly its position shape and size is determined that also we have taken into consideration that how we can calculate how you can get the informations a typical ultrasonic testing inspection systems consists of pulsar oblique receiver transducers and the display device CRT screen transducers is used to convert electrical energy into mechanical energy vibrational energy and vice versa computers can be programmed to inspect large complex shaped components with one or more multiple transducers collecting informations thank you [Music]
