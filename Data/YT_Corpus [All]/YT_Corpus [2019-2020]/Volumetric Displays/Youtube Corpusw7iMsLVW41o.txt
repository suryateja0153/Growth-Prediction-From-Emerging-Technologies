 we are absolutely pleased to have a chance to engage with a founding member company Motors Corporation best with the very best people they have Steve I think he used to be his principal scientist and Motors Corporation and separations R&D group he received his PhD in analytical chemistry from University of New Hampshire his theses were focused on protein purification and characterization he completed the postdoc at the center your State Department of Health in Albany New York characterizing glycan structures by NMR and a second postdoc at the Whitehead Institute just at the time that the human genome has been sequenced he was working with other important things at the time over in the group of full muscle viana doing protein sequencing by mass spectrometry prior to joining the genetics Institute in 1998 he was a human genome project he thought you have to was hired as a lead separation scientist at salera in the newly formed proteomics department and since then has spent 20 years working on the interface between separation science and mass spectrometry and applied Biosystems a single operation work is assigned to the global mass spec imaging research team his efforts at waters have been in aid of heartburn movements disruption electrospray ionization sources as AI sources and we'll hear a lot more about it today yes thank you thank you it's a pleasure to be here it's a pleasure to be representing waters and to be representing the global imaging team which I'm very fortunate to be a member of so title of my talk mass spect imaging interrogating surfaces using molecular maps that's what mass spec imaging does however this is not new first paper was published in around 1997 by dr. Richard Caprio Lee and since then the the technique has done wonders in the area of biomedical research it has grown in his practitioners to now there's groups societies whole conferences dedicated just to this topic but what is new and exciting is that to see in certain instances the technique going from the research and discovery phase to really be on the doorstep or the threshold of being common practice in data collection and data interpretation in areas of health and disease and I'm gonna show you a few examples of that today there's a lot of ways to make molecular app maps using mass spectrometry and we're gonna talk primarily today about one of them desorption electrospray ionisation desi desi is being developed by waters as a technique and it is a good one but we're gonna start first with a overview of mass spec imaging in general what it is why people do it and how it's done and then we'll take a closer look at desi the improvements we're trying to make to this technique waters and then we'll look at some applications and then kind of just generally go over the future of imaging mass spectrometry and only for desi but they the bright future for the the techniques in general okay big picture maps very useful things they show shape form they can show spatial relationships between objects connectivity they can be made to show terrain and geography and they can also be made to show distribution of a single compound or a single component in intensity I hope to show you today that mass spect imaging can do all of these things but currently at least for desi and many mass spectrometry techniques this is done at the cellular scale the micron scale the low micron scale now that is not a molecular image as an auto molecular map that is a silicon wafer that's been etched with amazingly 270,000 some odd names they're not etched randomly they're etched to show form and function just like the building itself the pillars have a function the roof has a function so can you imagine instead of these names being etched on there they were somehow imprinted with a typical er type of molecule the columns the roof different molecules if that were the case the potential you could raster this surface using an ionization technique in a mass spectrometer and see where those molecules reside from where they reside maybe get a glimpse into their function their purpose that's what mass spec imaging does for you shows you spatial relations intensity of where molecules reside in a tissue or on a surface so why use it why do it really since the the advent of large-scale commercialization of mass spectrometry it's been coupled with LC and GC to unravel just complex systems in biology and medicine and it's done so with with great effect but one of the prerequisites to doing an LC certainly the tissue doing lc/ms experiments is that sample must be homogenized generally separated components identified and even quantified serially in the mass spectrometer but when you do that you lose those molecular spacial relations in that parent tissue where do they reside from one another what parts and why you also lose in any one given component its kind of distribution its concentration how its distributed in that tissue what comes up as a very small peak in a chromatogram in an lc/ms experiment might be a very bright spot in a tissue if all that materials concentrated in a single location how does it work how do you do mass spec imaging basically you get four tissues now we're gonna concentrate the concentration on my talk will be on on tissue imaging but I'll give some of other examples of just general surface analysis so for tissue these tissues are thinly sliced out of microtome generally 20 microns and under placed on a microscope slide and then they're analyzed by an ionization source now when desi this is a charged liquid stream it's an electrospray but there's other embodiments of the technique that use lasers and ion beams point is this surface is in pinch at a very specific location and a mass spectrum is is collected at that location and then generally the stage moves underneath and another mass spectrum is taken pixel by pixel across that surface until it's fully covered and then those all those spectra are compiled together and they can be queried any particular mass say this blue mass can be queried where does it reside amongst all those spectra and it'll give you the distribution and the intensity of that ion likewise for other ions but I want to impress upon you that's what I put this spectrum up here this is actually a desi spectrum from a pork liver these spectrum are complex hundreds easily hundreds potentially thousands of different components we're gonna talk primarily about tissue imaging but really mass spectrometry imaging is just surface analysis whatever that surface is if you can get it under that ionization source you can see what the molecules that reside there are here's an example of a common cell phone put underneath to reveal fingerprints common potentially industrial process where they're testing different washing mechanisms to see their effectiveness looking at a plant root this case jin-sang to see where those active components are the components of interest when you harvest and do what you do with ginseng make tea and this is a drug implant seeing how that drug is distributed within that within that device but these are not pretty pictures these are molecular maps which can reveal fascinating biology that we put to good use or it can be used to alter formulations and affect delivery of therapeutic treatments now the challenge for an instrumentation company and instrumentation in general is to take good ideas good concepts breadboard designs and turn them into pieces of equipment that can be used reliably analysis - analysis lab to lab instrument to instrument and that's challenge and waters has currently has a desi source it's pictured right here and most of the data you'll see today was gathered on a source just like this one but just like there's improvements and televisions and cell phones Waters is committed to improving this technique - making it more robust it's improving the spatial resolution user friendliness and that's what some of the discussion will be today going through that hardware you see here on the left this is our prototype desi sprayer so we're gonna take a look now a little more closely at at the hardware at the desi source so looking so there's there's a desi sort this this is a it's a modular ion ionization source it's about the size of a shoebox and it and it attaches to the front of any one of our any number of our analyzers here it's shown on our synapse system this is our higher end research grade system a lot of functionality in that mass spectrometer but it can go on other mass spectrometers as well that are more simpler and more fit for purpose depending on the needs of the experimenter and that source can be interchanged on this instrument all the other instruments with several other types of ionization sources so I'm going to look down inside the box here and okay again this is the sprayer select row spray this is where coming in from a from a pump through a capillary down into the top of the sprayer voltages applied to charge that liquid and gas is also applied to create a nebulized electrospray what you see in the photograph on the right that spray interacts with the surface and is pulled into the mass spectrometer by a mass spec inlet tube which is shown here you go to a cartoon of desi here are these charged droplets you know alluding from the capillary they're charged due to the voltage applied gas she's that nebulizers it forms droplets they come down impact that surface and in doing so interact with the molecules that are on that surface and they can extract some due to the impact as well as the pressure drop this is the atmospheric pressure the mass spec operates at a vacuum so there's a natural pull of the atmosphere surrounding this Inlet tube draws the that draws this solution these secondary droplets into the mass spectrometer where they dissolve the dissolved dissolve 8 into their constituent ions get manipulated toward the detector and are detected as a function of their master charge ratio okay little diagram of electro spray just to set the stage as to what we did to the to the sprayer again charged liquid stream gas sheathing around this nebulizers it forms charged droplets they were attracted now this is in the electro spray and then to the front end of the mass spectrometer due to the counter electrode that's there as well as the draw of the vacuum pulled into the mass spectrometer where they dissolve 8 detected as a function of their mass to charge ratio now in our current embodiment of our desi source we're basically taking this instead of aiming at the mass spectrometer we're turning it down at the surface and here's our current sprayer there is a glass capillary just like is often used in in electro spray that a that extends out beyond the the head of our sprayer nozzle I'm gonna go back you can see it here yeah okay so one of the assignments our engineering team was given was to make this more robust that tip can break you can scratch another assignment was to see if we could make that beam the electrospray beam tighter and more collimated release tunable so we get higher resolution the resolution you get on that surface is largely dictated by the the size of that beam how much surface area are analysing at one given time so to combat this we came up with the model that's shown below or to address this so the first thing was we switched from a glass capillary to a stainless steel capillary now this stainless steel capillary is something that waters was familiar with its own in another one of our products so that was an easy an easy win but second thing we did was recessed that capillary instead of having an extend out in front of the sprayer nozzle we brought it behind the sprayer nozzle and we grounded that sprayer nozzle and that was done for a couple of reasons for one you're not you know stuck with the constraints of having a an outlet here that has to fit the nozzle that has to fit the emitter tip through it so we can adjust the size lower the size of that critical orifice where the gas and solution come out secondly in desie we're pointing our emitter down toward a surface and we losing that that that fixed field that's up that's supplied by the counter electrode in the electrospray system now we're pointing it down at a surface essentially a grounded surface but a surface that can be variable and changing by grounding the the nozzle tip we're fixing that field and by bringing that those two electrodes much closer to one another we're able to that strengths and strengths and strengthens that electrical field and allows us to operate at a much lower voltage and we get a jetting effect from the gas as it comes around and mixes with the solvent inside that the sprayer nozzle now instead of outside the sprayer nozzle in the old designer in the current design with that design complete some modeling was done just to see the air for the gas flow would this design be capable of creating a nice jetting spray and it was to our excitement just looking for turbulences or major instabilities you can see here this red section we get a nice jetting flow coming out of that I think the maximum velocity of that was way it'll tell you afterward about 40 meters a second so what there's the model made we decided to build it here's a cutaway from a CAD drawing there's our stainless steel emitter recessed behind our our sprayer cap and in this diagram there's the the sprayer assembly right there and this optical bench was outfitted with two lasers and a camera so we can actually visualize the spray came out of our sprayer we knew what we were looking for we knew what we wanted we're in a collimated concentric narrow beam we wanted to beam most importantly that was robust think we relied upon we knew what the parameters were to get that beam the voltage the gas flow the liquid flow the orifice size so we iterated through these in order to find the sweet spot to find where we can generate that beam we also knew what instability looked like we went outside of those operational parameters the beam became unstable we could see that but however we knew studying on the bench that if we came back inside those parameters our spray would readjust itself no hysteresis effects so empirically buts very systematically we march through all the all the variables and created the operational ranges for these two nozzles as you can see we can get a beam of about 25 microns out to about a millimeter and a half away from our nozzle head on the on the 200 micron critic with a 200 micron critical orifice and that beamed expands from that point but this is not a negative quality I mean this can be used to tune your spot size this can be used to tune and there might be instances where you just want to raster collect more data and get across a sample quickly there might be instances when you move in closely and and and analyze a sample at higher resolution now these two sprayers are we're currently using them in our lab and we have them out at a few beta sites that data you're going to see today was not even generated with these two systems or these two sprayers we looked at usability it's very important we ran user friendliness you can see why I mean we're getting very close to tissues analyzing for long periods of time the the front of that emitter or the front of that sprayer can get contaminated so it was smartly designed by weight lavallee sitting right over there that this be a removable cap just a simple twist then it comes off and it can be easily cleaned and when that cap comes off our stainless steels emitter is housed in a little cartridge that's spring-loaded just like a ballpoint pen and that spray or that the emitter head gets protected not only protected from you bending it but it's sticking into your finger another area we sought to investigate to improve signal intensity was in our ms inlet tube again I'll show you the picture of it here so you see where it's located it was known and it just basically on the on the electrospray phenomenon itself that in order to get to detect ions they have to be fully dissolve ated and to do that in the mass spectrometer there's a vacuum so so things will naturally dis solvate but often heat is an employed to expedite that process so and there was some precedent that said that adding heat to this MS Inlet tube would also expedite that process and in and boost signal so although this seems simple enough to just add heat to that tube the engineers wanted about it very systematically carving that up into sections applying heat differentially to those sections and really studying where the heat needed to be applied and what the effect was some simple experimentation here shows that really a critical area to add heat is around that bend and the the impact of that is tremendous we get it almost you know one order one order of magnitude increase in signal from doing that it's a lot of temperature it's a lot of heat though this is heated up to 450 degrees see this tube and adding that much energy is not without consequence some more labile compounds can fragment but this is now a tunable parameter you don't have to add heat you can add up to up to 500 degrees C but it really remains an engineering challenge like I said on paper it seems easy enough to add heat but that's a lot of heat and it has to heat quickly cool quickly so it's not an impediment to doing experiments we need consistent and reliable feedback how do you put how do you apply that heat on there and also the tube needs to be cleanable so these elect canonic parts need to we need to be aware of that that the stupa needs to be detached and cleaned between experiments so this is an ongoing area of research and a good example of how waters and potentially MIT can collaborate they actually the the bench work of visualizing the laser beam was done primarily by a co-op in our lab from Northeastern and now he sees an employee of ours a good another good area where demonstration of how we could potentially collaborate with one another going forward just a pictorial view of what the heat does for you these are four different slices of pork liver analyzed and then in a plot of a particular lipid here starting at ambient temperature 100 200 400 degrees C you can clearly see the increase in intensity okay some examples now we're gonna move on to to why people use desi and where it's it's it's finding its application for one or for several reasons it's it's it's being used it has several benefits over some of its competitive techniques one there's very limited sample preparation you can slice a tissue you don't even have to slice a tissue right that the it can be a three-dimensional object basically you've got to get that your sample underneath your ionization source and you can generate ions you can generate signal using this technique it requires no chemical additives it's got functionality in the in that mode that you use that the the voltage applied can be positive or negative and get different components coming off as a result of that the solvent you use are tunable you can tune those to the analytes of interest and very importantly it's it's by and by a non-destructive technique obviously you're removing some surface molecules but in examples I'll show you this analysis can be done and then tissue samples can go on and have further tests done to them like histopathology staining doesn't destroy the sample and I'll show you as well it has excellent potential for analytical speed and high-throughput analyses but first what are you actually measuring when you look down at a tissue with with with the desi technique to sorption electrospray ionisation you're looking primarily at small molecules and lipids lipids or generally a you know huge class of molecules generally characterized as being insoluble oops sorry they're characterized generally insoluble they have a polar head group and long aliphatic chains they make up cell membranes so when you scan across that surface that biological surface with the desease preyere you know we're using high organic like eighty ninety eight percent to 95 percent methanol it dissolves these membranes and that's what you're looking at ease lipids ionized and you see them quite readily you also see fatty acids small metabolites and molecules exogenously cools that that that are added to that sample and what this is is a fingerprint a signature the types of cells that are underneath that spray at the time that that sample was taken and in that location and that fingerprint can be used to compare against other cells and identify these cells and distinguish them from others from other cells or to investigate what happens to them as they're exposed to some internal or external force so it's a little sample of that these slides came from pressure Osmond re Columbia University who's studying oncology she's in the in studying drug discovery and what you're looking at here each slide is a different Mouse it's a four different mice each one of these mice is has a tumor implanted into its liver and there's been some genetic modification to allow that tumor to proliferate they've added a drug therapeutic that they're studying I just call it drug candidate just to be generic but it's mass is 463 Dalton's as you see there they dose each one of these mice with different concentrations this is the vehicle here is just the dosing formulation no drug and then increase in concentrations of drug they do that at the same time after a certain amount of time they sacrifice all these animals they go in and analyze the the tissue what they're looking for in this particular experiment is is that therapeutic is their compound of interest making its way into that tumor is it finding its target as you can see here it clearly is and doing so roughly in accordance to the concentration that it was dosed in but as collateral as a in addition to looking at the compound of interest they get the whole mass spectrum they get all the lipids they got everything else that's in there they can take that data and compare the spectrum though that it's produced on the tumor with that that's produced in the in the normal liver so sorry should it showed you this a little more carefully the green trace in each sample outlines the tumor the red trace in each sample outlines the normal liver sample so by comparing the profile of the cells on the tumor with the profile the cells in the normal liver they're able to distinguish a couple of features that can be used to distinguish these two these two different pieces of tissue and one of those features it was a lipid mass 682 shown here you can see that lipid is much more prevalent in the tumor than in the normal liver sample and you can also see to their excitement that this this particular liberabit lipid underwent a decrease in intensity with an increase in dosage of their candidate molecule the drug candidate molecule so what they have here is a pharmacodynamic marker not only do they know their drugs making it into the tumor they know they're changing the biology of that tumor now what's going on what pathways are being m''d how that's ultimately gonna impact that tumor it's still under study but these are the types of experiments that people use tissue imaging for to give them information about about their system here's another exciting example of where mass spec imaging could potentially have an impact on health and disease these slides come from Rachel to Hoag from Libya abalones group and at University of Texas Austin and they're studying thyroid cancer you can see here 56 new thousand thousand new cases of thyroid cancer in the United States alone annually thyroid cancer is typically detected or not cancer but thyroid malady is typically detected by a palpable nodule felt on the thyroid gland and the neck and the procedure for investigating what if whether that nodule is benign or malignant is to go in and take a fine needle aspirate that put a needle and pull out some cells smear them on a slide stain them and then that slide is read by a pathologist looks at the morphology of those cells makes a determination as to what the what the status of that nodule is now unfortunately currently 20% of the time a clear reading cannot be made and in those cases the patient has to undergo a surgery they have to go in a resect a section of that thyroid pull it out so further testing can be done to clearly identify the status of that of that nodule and in 80% of those cases it turns out that that nodule is benign so four out of five times that surgery potentially could have been avoided but the Everland group is hoping to improve those statistics by applying Dezi same procedure a fine needle aspirate is taken spread out on a slide but this time prior to staining they they image that slide they just image the surface using dezzie looking for the cellular profiles trying to determine if they can tell based on the mass spectrum that they get whether or not those cells are been malignant or benign for that to be effective you first have to build a model they did this by using tissues that have been annotated by a pathologist as normal benign or malignant thyroid tissue it took over a hundred thousand spectra built the model library and got consensus as to what what features constitute a normal-looking thyroid tissue a benign and a malignant thyroid tissue and then they challenged that data or challenged that model with unknowns with fine needle aspirates that were taken from patients they just did this in imaging mode and maintained the spatial resolution of the sample that sample was then stained and read in normal fashion by a pathologist it was non-destructive so that enabled that tech that to take place and the diagnostic molecules that they were looking at they could get signal decent signal from his smallest one of clusters of twenty cells now I remember I said this was done on our old source our old source that the the the spray path is by and by in the area of 200 microns with our new desi sprayer we hope to get much lower than that routinely and you could see where that could be by big benefit here where this cluster of cells here 20 cells that could be no more than a hundred microns across and with a larger beam that can get confounded in with the other material but the smaller beam we might really be able to detect those cells cleanly and make these identifications yeah just more more probable but even so as things are the accuracy of their results on this study we're eighty-nine percent 10 percent better than what's currently being done with a specificity for the benign sample of 88 percent and a hundred percent sensitivity for the malignant samples so no false negatives taking the same idea step further Zoltan and taka says group the Imperial College in London is looking at micro tissues or a tissue arrays that have been formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded as well as fresh frozen now as a matter of course when when tissue is biopsied when when gross or biopsied they are formalin either formalin-fixed or fresh frozen or both stained and read by a pathologist to determine if it's cancerous the grade of the cancer etc once this analysis is done these tissues are stored so the Takas group is taking these stored tissues and working out protocols for their analysis by desi the same kind of vision as as the Eberlin group to build a database of all of these different annotated pathologically annotated samples that then unknowns can be taken compared against and predictions can be made as to what it is on the mass spec fingerprints alone and you can see where this really you know it's not going to take the place of a pathologist but that information can be very valuable in cases of ambiguity and that really brings us to the phenomenon of digital pathology which is really nothing more I mean in my mind then a transformation and how pathology is done it's gone from a section being stained and put inside a microscope and having one individual look down at that slide and make an assessment to a microscope now that probably focuses itself and takes loads of pictures uploads them to a computer and the passat then that pathologist then he or she can look at that computer screen and expand and look at different views and annotate it right there in their computer screen remotely or on site and that data can be shared now easily shared amongst many pathologists and consensus can be drawn and with the advent of machine learning and artificial intelligence scripts can be written that allow the computer now to take that knowledge and incorporate it and then be have a go algorithms written so the computer can make its own predictions and this is actually this is happening and it's being endorsed by the by the FDA and it's known as pilot scales but the results of this are very encouraging and they're increasing the statistics in terms of accurate assessments now a perfect extension to this would be a layer another layer of information to add to cell morphology and specificity and staining and that would be mass spectrometry adding cellular profiles molecular information on top of this this is not me I fully endorse this but there's not much you know coming from me this is coming from leaders in the field like dr. Caprio Lee and Ron Herron and from some members of the medical community what that work workflow might look like is something that the Caprio Lee Lab has generated some software to do like I mentioned that your pathology now slices are taken stained image in a microscope and those imagers are sent to a pathologist potentially to a remote place who can look down at that image and mark out specific regions of interest and then taking the a very adjacent piece of tissue that pathologists that that adjacent piece of tissue can be Co registered and those various sections can be analyzed in a mass spectrometer to get molecular information and that information can be mapped back onto the morphology of the cells and the histopathology to create just a very informative and conclusive diagnosis as to what's going on another area of interest in another area that's you know in the research phase is using mass spectrometry interoperative ly now often during a tumor resection x' sections are taken cut stained or fixed formalin-fixed to be read postoperatively by a pathologist but often or sometimes they're this is actually actually actually done on-site especially in cases where there's a there's concern about the aggressiveness of a tumor so in these cases the sections taken stained red by a pathologist and fed back to the surgeon real-time who makes decisions as to what to do to continue resecting or to stop so here is a is a situation where mass spec can play a role dezzy in particular due to lack of sample preparation these can be these slides can be made analyzed very quickly and with reliable database reliable spectral matching features can be detected that can be informative informative as to the nature of that tissue its aggressiveness its tumor type and that can be fed back to the surgeon in real time and like I said this is going on now in research not only for its sections but also for tissue spears in particular when you know I guess all samples pressures but brain sample brain tumors where you really don't want to resect any extra tissue so if mass spectrometry is going to be incorporated into into the routine workflow of pathology it will need to be a walkaway system highly robust and reliable same with those operating conditions it's got to be reliable to make its way into those theaters and we're really at the point of that now at our lab in milford as well as our lab and milton Wilmslow england we've adopted auto slide loaders that can house up to 200 slides that were made for the microscope industry but we've just incorporated them and they're now loading our or mass spectrometer that data that it automatically picks out where those tissues are does the scans based on input from the operator but in terms of your resolution and mass range and collects that data and when you start running data or running samples with that amount of throughput you can envision creating 3d structures taking these 2d Maps Co registering them and building 3d structures of organs and tissues molecular atlases as well as running large cohorts of printed clinical and preclinical samples for tissue classification there's a video showing you this this is our automatic robotic arm it's gonna grab a slide it'll put it into a little house you know a little chamber where it's photographed and based on biofluorescence or bioluminescence it's enabled it to pick where the tissue is it loads it on the on the desi stage and it's scanned these these some of these tissues have been pre I've been classified so it knows by the spectrum what type of tissue it is and it'll call that up in real time so let's talk about speed for a second that's an important parameter and one you have control over these are two adjacent kidney slices from a mouse the first case was done in a very you know we would say on a higher resolution end for desi 20 by 20 micron pixels you can see there some of the representative lipids and how they're distributed in that kidney that's a beautiful image took about four hours to get that image second slice just opened up the pixel size so now you're getting a lower resolution image you got to ask yourself and has an experimenter what are you after in that in that experiment do you want to see whether something's present or not do you want to see generally speaking where it's localized you can get can you get that information from a five-minute scan and you have anywhere in between there this is a mouse our colleague Emrys Jones cat caught it he brought it into work and he he sectioned it section about half a millimeter pitch right through that whole animal and you can see these sections 200 200 micron pixels about 20 minutes per section it's one in the head region one of them gut region one in the tail region right through that animal hundred and seventeen cross sections and then subjected those spectra to unsupervised spectral matching basically there's an algorithm we'll take two adjacent spectra and see whether or not they align with one another statistically by some cutoff if they're aligned it'll give it a color if they don't align give it a different color by that method was able to really reconstruct and find all the major organs in that animal this is just an example this is a low-resolution example well it took a day to do this just gives you an idea of where this this field is going and the potential it has to really just change the way tissues are viewed by making molecular maps 3d molecular maps the applications abound - they really do focused on biology focused on tissue here's another very exciting example though taking and looking at bacterial colonies for natural product drug discovery the World Health Organization quotes the number one threat to mankind is the spread of bacteria or antibiotic resistant bacteria so bacteria here can be analyzed underneath the dezzy for identification text taxonomical designation but you could also look at the molecules they're producing how they change it doesn't kill the colonies and the real excitement is how these colonies communicate with one another certainly different colonies how they attack and defend one another and this is a real area of mining for bacterial bacterial antagonists bacterial fungal intent agonist fungal fungal antagonists for looking for new classes of molecules that disturb till can serve as pharmaceuticals again these are complex spectra thousands of different components so I've hope I've been able to impress on you today that the things we're working on the things we're trying to improve reproducibility of our equipment quantification of our samples you know grasping and being able to handle the data complexity molecular coverage can really turn today's struggles if we can meet these challenges and turn it into a just a brilliant future in a different future of the way of the way things get get analyzed and diagnosed in the future large data bases quick easy access small sample sizes that can make you know very an array of different predictions as the state of health and disease we are here to work together we hope to waters is invested in the MIT nano Center to collaborate we want to work together we just opened up a water and imaging an ambient ionization lab in our milford site as you can see here it's filled with friendly people we're looking to collaborate not only on applications and tissue analysis but data analysis hardware design anything we can do to improve the technology and push it forward also in just a few months time we'll be opening up a an innovation hub we call it here in Cambridge just a few blocks away this is going to be a very open creative space and be filled with equipment and analysts the function of which is to take on or to interact with the community the scientific community if you got something you want to try something you want to see an idea you'd be welcome to go to this hub or make a call and make an appointment to go to this hub and see what waters can do to help you and what you can do to help us again and the effort and the name of pushing the technology forward and making a difference I'd like to thank pressure Osmond re-and and Brandon Fowler from Columbia University Rachel de hog and the Libby Evelyn group from the University of Texas the zoltán tacos group from Imperial College in London for help with this presentation like I said at the beginning I am very honored to be on a member of the waters global mass spect imaging team as well as to honor to be an employee of waters there's a lot of awesome people here a lot of awesome people went into all the work of this presentation and a lot of them are here today Greg and waiter here bin dashes here Jim and Steve Martin are here so we'll be around for another hour all right there's a reception please stay talk with us and think about us in the future when you when you have an idea you'll want to spin or you want to come visit and see a piece of equipment please know that we're extremely open to this and we're looking forward to it thank you for your time and attention and yeah [Applause] any questions let me start by asking is your duty analysis how do you prevent the molecules or cells refine fashion observe no it's a very soft ionization technique we don't get fragmentation Sims things like that loads of fragmentation that the fragmentation I showed was primarily due to the heat we put a 450 degrees C on that too so some more labile things can fragment in that environment but yeah generally it's a very soft extraction it's a very soft ionization technique so yeah I mean you can if you put it in a top top you can fragment them I mean they that mass spectrometer can do that for you and that's that's often done for good reason to get structural information yeah so but just as a course of the ionization and then no it's very soft one of the softest that I would say no no I mean I know if there is I don't know of it yeah no it's really up to what you want to get out of that sample all right so you can tune that if you know what your molecule is that you're interested in you could tune the voltages you can tune the the solvents to extract it you know so those are parameters that you have at your disposal to play with it know you know I uh I don't I don't think there's any I'm not that we've tried them all but I don't think there's any limitations to the solvents you can use lower yes yeah the spatial resolution that's a that's a that's a you know that's a parameter that you set so we have some at twenty the kidney one this was a xx this is bit twenty is about our threshold in terms of low-end threshold okay that this was done at two hundred so basically that's how you know that how finally your rastering across your sample and and how often your your you're taking and and assigning a mass spectrum to that real-estate up sorry going the wrong way this was done at 20 by 20 so that that's kind of the that's where we are in terms of you know state-of-the-art with our sprayer this one is 60 by 60 so you're just not scanning as finally like you're just reading a book with a larger print there's something like this right saves you a lot of time and you can envision like mixing this up you can make initially going at it at a few hundred microns until you see something and then I stopped look here it is let's let's zoom into that area and go more finely I mean all these things are possible does that answer your question yes no we don't at the time that's on discussion should we coat that should we we haven't seen any you know we don't really see much fragmentation even in that metal tube we see much greater signal correct yes I got you we don't at the time it's definitely a concern or a it's a you know a flag that we're gonna look into we have a you know whole coatings department that coach things so we're you know yeah excellent excellent question yeah good question as well I mean we're we're I don't have an answer for you yeah that the the the emitter tip that I showed you that was all dirtied up that was after a long time it was just like should we clean this I was actually what I was doing I was running yeah that was after a long time we need depends on what your sample is depends on how close you have it to the sample depends on there's there's there's factors involved there but we can run we've run for weeks at a time without intervention collecting very good images so I think that it's it's a robust system if you're if you were switching projects or switch that's when people tend to for the multiple users coming with us and that's when you would say I'm gonna clean this just to make sure I'm getting signal from my sample type of thing yeah good question yes sir are there any competitors don't think so other than homemade ones no yeah yeah there's a lot of engineering that has gone I'm being a lot of a lot of a smart engineering let's stop here we will continue to discussion over a little bit of snack and 26 more so but before we beat at that plate let's take c15 thank the team thank you
