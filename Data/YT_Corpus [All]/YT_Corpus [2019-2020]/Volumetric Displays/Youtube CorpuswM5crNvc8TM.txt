 [Music] good morning everyone it's a pleasure to be here to present some of the recent research that we have been doing at the University of Illinois as part of the SCC 80 consortium and the men name is Janna family young I'm a faculty member at the University no one we have heard a lot about next discussion this morning and then I appreciate the organizers for making this event possible despite what they are things about going on at this CCAT I'm sure everybody has been very much aware of the wonderful work that's going on in many aspects particularly regarding the vehicle and then the vehicle instrumentation and human factors but then way at the Illinois now have been looking at the slightly different but also very important aspect of autonomous and connected vehicles particularly related to infrastructure that are supporting the development of freight develop movement we focus on Freight first of all because it's not only because it's important to the to the nation's economy but also because it's projected to continue to increase sharply in the next 30 years when report and forecast actually afraid is going to continue to increase by 50 percent by 2045 and also we are interested in free also because Illinois as our reaching stance is at the freight hub of the nation we have Rio and and truck corridors passing sweetly known so we also want to address that in particular the the emerging trend with autonomous and panicky vehicles autonomous and kinetic trucks as well as actually the emergence of e-commerce which have been largely shifting present or travel for freight and shopping to freight deliveries and especially nowadays with a virus going on I think this trend has been more prominent as ever so so this is why we look for this topic and then those of you who are familiar with a freight logistics supply systems Nodine actually free systems normally actually depict a hierarchical system structure a topology where we have online hope backbones that actually provide high efficiency large volume shipments and we have local last mile problems where we need flexibility so and actually as the technology continued to develop new opportunities keep emerging in particular the commercial autonomous vehicles and connected vehicles and in in particular for for trucks have been emerging in I've been tested actually in some of the states for lying and the backbone transportation and then the the other side commercial UAVs or commonly called drones have been used in the last mile delivery as well so the freight industry has been seen a revolution that's coming up in the next decade or so and then we are quite interested in understanding how these revolutions is gonna change the landscape of our freight shipments in particular how are we prepared for such revolutions so so what we are part of this consortium we have been working diligently on addressing this aspect of freight transportation systems in particular we are looking at one of the very important implications of free system in terms of the the impact not only on efficiency not only to energy but also in terms of the physical infrastructure our nation's vas transportation infrastructure such as payment and bridges and then we all know from from transportation infrastructure 101 then actually the the impact of a vehicle on the pavement is proportional to the fourth power approximately of the vehicle weight and then a one truck actually a fully loaded truck is actually equivalent to 16,000 passenger vehicles are in terms of damage to the payment so so it's it's actually probably important when we are talking about the freight system and in a moment I'm gonna tell you why we particularly worry about the connected and and and autonomous trucks in particular but then in general when we are planning free systems we should we should understand actually there are many aspects of impacts one aspect is actually the the movement of trucks where we they are traveling around the whole network of transportation systems they not only affect the congestion in only they not only affect the other traffic the general public but also they they actually change the load of heavy heavy vehicles or they change the loading the damage to our payment infrastructures and then this request changes the condition of the payment and actually requires the agencies to go ahead and actually to repair them differently and it is very often other major complaints from from our local jurisdictions I I was at actually one of the local meetings in Illinois in year near the thousand Illinois in her term intermodal terminals actually the local governments complained a lot about how their payments have damaged by all the truck traffic going around so so but then understand - the payment damage is not not a simple thing it actually affects again how traffic is gonna be distributed in the network and also affects the efficiency of the of the of the freight system as well so essentially these forms are actually all closed loop and then then then all these things all these externalities and everything of freight movements actually in general affects not only in the economy obviously but also affects our energy and sustainability as well as particularly the state of with the repair the last one is actually particularly important when we talk about the future because actually the the evolution and the emergence of the autonomous and then finally vehicles have a huge impact on those aspects let me explain why so before I go there I want to mention a little bit actually the our group of faculty members at Illinois recognize this huge challenge where I'm gonna talk about in a moment and try to understand how the freight systems will be influenced by the by the autonomous and connected trucks this faculty member actually some of us come from the system's background some of us come from the infrastructure and payment background and we work together to try to address some of these questions so the first part of my presentation will be focusing on the the backbone line whole part of freight shipments in particular say on freeways how large volume shipments can be done by by trucks and in particular we're gonna talk about how we model the pavements and how a mode of the truck configuration the platooning in particular and so as to balance the cost in between the payment damage and the fuel consumption let me explain why so we all know about truck plan to lean chocolate Unni is actually everywhere nowadays in news media and then in technical reports so I'm not gonna explain it but basically two features of a truck platoon is actually trucks are going to be on line and then the trucks are usually gonna be traveling closely to each other in spacing and at higher speeds this is a this is a particularly gonna be a physical thing to do when autonomous and connected the technology becomes mature and then because we can have precise control of the location as compared to human drivers women ravished sort of do whatever they want within the lane at least so this is essentially the one of the changes that this brings obviously there are a lot of advantages of a truck platooning I don't really need to mention them but and there are safety implications there are actually efficiency implications because we regulate traffic and then we make vehicles more compact and travel higher speeds overcome the fear of human drivers what we actually allow safety to be improved obviously I mentioned also by aligning the trucks together we actually allow the aerodynamic resistance to be reduced because the trucks essentially become a convoy or you essentially can imagine they become a train on the freeway and actually the Air drag would actually be much reduced there has been Studies on this and then when energy consumption gets reduced and there's less emissions and everything seems to be on the bright side but we also recognize in actually not only the there are bright and the positive sides of the of the truck a platooning there are also a lot of downsides in particular when the wave phase or these payment damages comes from these heavy trucks then essentially that the trucks are now going to be perfectly aligned if we choose to do so and then they are going to be closely aligned to each other and they're going to be traveling at higher speeds so they change the frequency and the the the the the the location of the loading onto the payment and actually very often when direct consequences actually payment deteriorates much faster and actually this would cost higher societal costs to the local jurisdictions so this this needs to be somehow balanced so we were trying to understand this a little bit better so just a little bit further on this I think this is probably already understood so far the actual when we align trucks into plan tuning as we see in the next five to ten years for example imagine all the trucks heavy trucks aren't perfectly aligned if we don't pay attention to how they're damaged in the payments we're gonna have the payments damaged in fairly quickly requiring the local agencies to do frequent maintenance ease and a lot of investment in there and also the the damage also causes the vehicles to wear and tear much faster and then so HSN user cost post increases and then the payment life cycle gets it's less attractive so but then alternatively what we were actually doing here in our in our study here within CCAT is patty Lee we are thinking that maybe we should be a little bit smarter when we are actually considering the future we should actually proactively consider the opportunity of actually of controlling the trucks imprecision but then we actually try to avoid this overloading on to the payment and by actually purposefully this place attracts laterally along the freeway and hopefully this is gonna slow down the damage of the payment and actually has all the potential benefits but I want to mention one thing that actually by laterally displacing the trucks we are not only actually slowing down that the damage to the payment potentially by replacing the the trucks we may actually change the strain and the stress underneath the payment and potentially changing it from attention to to a compression and essentially actually we may be able to help payment improve itself over time so essentially by strategically displacing payments we change the loading pattern on the payment laterally and actually we can actually potentially improve payments as a payment the maintenance strategy so these are actually putting potentially the the benefit we may obtain from autonomous vehicles if we turn the turn the tide around so essentially here we are hoping to reduce the payment cost or even improve the pavement by strategically platooned of trucks but also at the same time we understand there's a reason that we want to platoon the trucks in its perfect align the fashion because there's air drag reduction and so on so what is actually the best trade-off how do we plan the whole platoon with the trucks to move around such as we reduce the overall societal cost so this is essentially the the topic we have we're trying to address here okay so so with this we we just to have a recap either national wave are trying to optimize that the platoon configuration we are trying to find the trade-off between payment we're gonna actually make fundamental contributions to the to the way the payments are actually designed and analyzed we're actually going to consider the platoon in the other extent externalities to the economy to to to uh to the energy consumption and an efficient system we put them into one integrated optimization framework and then we try to again imbalance between payment damaged infrastructure damage and also fuel efficiency and I will hopefully the go is ultimately we can achieve a more sustainable freight transportation system in the world so so but then this is a very nice vision but then the challenge lies ahead of us we need a lot of a new methodologies and I'm speaking now I'm actually a systems engineer by training but I'm not pretending that I know about payments so speaking on behalf of my payment colleagues so what one of the biggest gap in in the literature is regarding the way that Asha payments are designed and analyzed the payments were designed without the foreknowledge of the autonomous vehicles okay there's no anticipation if when the guidelines are developed so there were no consideration of our lateral position wheel as explicit inputs the payment design guideline do us consider the wandering of the payment of the trucks but then they considered as a random wander where actually drivers they anticipate the drivers will be ran displaced laterally on inner land but then there's no explicit address meant I'm sorry explicit consideration of a press precise control of the lateral position there's no consideration of language of utilizing the full width of the land there's no quantification of the rest period remember that the Wis platooning the trucks actually provide a load more frequently and then and at the same point so essentially payments especially as for payments are actually viscoelastic and then there's the the duration of the interval in between loading would have a significant impact on the payment durability so none of these are being considered in the current so payment design guidelines so this needs to be addressed and also we want to again mention that we're trying to address the mix the traffic we're trying to address that the trade-off between energy efficiency and and infrastructure so this is sort of there are a lot of instances to be done so we're making progress in the in all these fronts okay and then one of the the challenge we try to precisely address is actually actually now we we have the capability hopefully with all the communication technology and autonomy that we are able to precisely control the lateral movements or lateral displacement I should say all of the tires within Lynne even for now and then and then and then we actually use this as our you know I've already suppose oh and I try to use this to understand how the loads as you can see the curve here is actually the tension string I feel how to how the load how the stress and the string is gonna be distributed as a tire move around and if we actually strategically are all the tires to move around how actually the the history of the loading is gonna have an impact on the pavement so this is nothing that we have been working on over the past years and we also particularly address how the viscoelastic payment is gonna respond to repeat the loading when the actually interval between time and space between the the tire loading is gonna actually be controlled we can actually control the speed and the spacing between tracks in a platoon so as to actually precisely change the loading and the damage to the pavement then this is done particular 3d finite element models not to understand multi axial loading on asphalt concrete and then with this actually we are able to use models to develop the sort of mimic how the how the strain which is actually major source of payment damage such as cracking and rutting develop over time as we have a truckload passing okay and then and then we are able to precisely model that and actually have very good precision prediction models on that and then we are able to further model how if we were to do track platooning at different configurations or platoon at different ways of managing the traffic we are able to control whether actually loading would be repeated at very high frequency and then actually essentially the strain whether you know if we actually have separate loadings then you can see the string actually dissipates over time sort of the payment is actually of soluble consider it's the same eye liquid right it's a viscoelastic you actually recover but then if you do repeat the loading over over over a short period of time actually that the payment is still actually having a high strain and you superimpose another strain on it so have models to fully understand actually have been having a tandem vehicles tandem axles actually going around at the payment how actually that the payment is gonna respond to it and how damage is made develop a strain continue to increase higher so essentially all these different things are done by models not only with two models we also try to do experiments this is our strengths here we have a very well-established testing facilities here that we actually design the common payment mixes and now we trying to design the mixes and actually test that the the that the mix under repeated loading at different frequencies at different speeds and different loads and so on and try to see how the payment respond to to loading and mimicking how a platoon with trucks is going to do to the payment so this actually helps us to actually to validate what we were developing from finite element models and then an end the result actually turned out to be very promising where I able to very well address the the the situation we are able to show Chris nicely predict how the the payment strain is going to accumulate as we have repeated loadings and we can control the different environment conditions we can control how frequently we are gonna have loads coming and how much of the time interval is there in between the loads so essentially just in a nutshell we were able to understand how exactly under different truck platoon situations then that the payment is going to be humidity damage if if if we don't do anything about it okay so then the next step of course is to try to figure out a way to to improve the platoon but before we do that we should also take into consideration many other things for example earlier in the in a panel we heard that actually autonomous and connected vehicles needs to be reliable and under all weather conditions there's just no and where there's there's other other worse weather conditions and that's also another sort of related effort sort of a parallel to what we were doing earlier is actually to develop more a sort of smart and and more communicative sort of payments with a new materials and actually could help improve the communication between the vehicles and the infrastructure and in particularly we'll use some pavement signatures actually the series can't be fine so this will help the GPS and the vision based sensors to try to navigate the vehicles so this is actually also related and then essentially we basically try to develop particularly electromagnetic signatures inside the concrete pavements so that's actually to help the communications this is a video regarding how in our actual apps how the signature can be detected so so so some of the preliminary results we found actually was an actually we do have the capabilities of actually improving a developing essentially new types of payments to help the sea AV systems to communicate and actually allow the signals to be communicated among the among the vehicles and the DIA the payment so there have been guiding the the the trucks and also in addition to the ad world in addition to modeling the damage to him and in addition to developing the new types of payments but also we are also developing as we mentioned that the the model to understand the fuel efficiency of track platooning so this truck platooning essentially as we are i the trucks together then there will be less air drag and if we place more displacement among the trucks and then there will be more air drag as you can imagine so we develop finite element methods in the air space to try to understand the air drag and then we have developed this models to try to understand how you know the the energy consumption essentially from air drag is gonna change as we displace trucks and actually that the air air drag is dependent not only not only on the air and on the speed on the spacing essentially how much spacing we have special gabbi's it also depend obviously to the speed of the tracks and so on so this overall system we build a model to try to understand the impacts okay so with this and we put everything together the agency cost of the user cost I'm not gonna go into the details but just to say that we put everything together to address the the several issues that we put everything into a life cycle cost assessment sort of a platform waste consideration of the user cost the the carrier's the the shippers in terms of the air drag in terms of energy consumption in Hamas of the economy in terms of the throughput of the freeway and we also consider the user cost in terms of the vehicle wear and tear due to the roughness development of the of the payment we have a precise model to understand the the deterioration of the payment condition okay and then we also consider we have optimization model to try to understand how agency needs to go out and actually provide the maintenance and the repairs for the pavement that's needed so essentially everything is a coherent sort of a model integrated model to help us actually boil down everything back into the into the cost societal cost of the whole system and a way everything is regarding how the platoon needs to be optimized so so I'm not gonna spend too much time here but just quickly say that we have done some preliminary case study on a simple corridor and and essentially the the benefit is significant that we are able to achieve more than sort of double-digit percentage in savings in terms of both agency and that the user cost in terms of air drag and also the payment damage and so on in the lifecycle okay so with this I I'm moving to the next topic now regarding the the last mile I'll be really quick then essentially the we also have been doing some work regarding how the last mile is being revolutionized particularly with drones and we all know the industry has been testing John track integrated deliveries and then essentially even Amazon is getting away from trucks and actually using the floating warehouses to try to provide the the backbone line whole part of the travel but then but then the using Jones to the last mile delivery so I've been doing a lot of work about actually what is optimum the delivery system and then particularly how the trucks or the fly flying warehouses should be routed to strap the city okay for example how other how we should actually come to the movement of those line for vehicles on the backbone system and how the drones should be dispatched from each of the dispatch launching sites and then we have done a lot of work about again we we are able to describe the traffic especially under country congestion when this systems becomes commercially viable you can imagine a lot of a lot of the congestion and efficiency issues is gonna be transferred from the ground to the air okay so we were building a lot of models to try to understand how the the the drones may actually interfere with one another when they are shift when they are traveling as this shows a little bit about how for example in the Amazon floating warehouses case how the traffic should be optimized and then what is the best the the drums should not travel in straight lines anymore because actually there may be over congestion in the air so we actually try to figure out what is optimal configuration what is the efficiency and one of the energy implications and efficacy implications have done all the work on that and the way came up with actually optimal spatial partitions about each launch inside under different considerations then how should be the drones each time you launch a bank batch of drones how they should cover the space such a so we had come up with mathematical proofs for all these things of optimality and then some of the recent work this is last slide essentially we are actually considering how if if the the drones are dispatched as the trucks move along the way the trucks keep moving and then actually solovar sweeping through the city how the the drones can be dispatched along the way without stop stopping any vehicles and I should come back to the come back to the to the track for example and then under different situation maybe trucks can cover local deliveries in a certain neighborhoods and actually the drones covered the father'll out areas and then actually when there's congestion then we even consider how the drones should be actually of course again travel in curves so as to avoid congestion patterns this is actually showing that the drone passes optimum time passes unnecessary so so we have been still doing this type of work to try to understand the next generation of freight systems both this is actually now again regarding the last miles ok so with this I I think I'll stop here this is just a quick overview about some of the work my colleagues and I have been doing here at Illinois I'll be happy to take any questions if there's any thank you [Music]
