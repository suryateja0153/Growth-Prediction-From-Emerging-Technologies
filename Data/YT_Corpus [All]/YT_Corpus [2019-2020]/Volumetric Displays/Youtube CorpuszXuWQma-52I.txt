  I'm Stephanie Essin, and this is IDZ Weekly. In this episode, we look at building a motor defect detector. Being able to monitor equipment to prevent faults is important for any industrial process and it's a precursor to predictive maintenance. This reference implementation provided on the Intel Developer Zone lays out everything you need to know to get started. You'll learn several mathematical techniques in machine learning, starting with basic Fast Fourier transform to a more complex Gaussian mixture model. These techniques can be reused, with minor modifications, on different data streams and don't require a lot of known previously classified data. You'll also gain insight into logistic regression, K-Means clustering, and industrial market IoT solutions. You'll need the IEI Tank AIOT Developer Kit, Ubuntu bunch 16.04, and Python 3.5 with these libraries. You can reuse the skills learned in this reference implementation to develop similar IoT solutions. Follow the links to start building, and I'll see you next Monday. [CLOSING SOUND EFFECTS]
