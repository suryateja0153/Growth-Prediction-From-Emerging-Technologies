 [Music] we introduce a haptic augmentation technique for modulating the feel of a real physical button by providing additional vibro tactile feedback when the user presses the button an actuator generates a vibration signal and it is added to the original force response of the button and presented to the user this simple technology can give a variety of distinct and programmable feels to one physical button the contributions of this work are with the structured and detailed analysis results on the perceptual attributes of vibration augmented physical buttons
