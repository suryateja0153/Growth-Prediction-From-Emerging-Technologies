 this is the VX1 from Voxen! today we're going  to have a quick look at it using some models   that I've created. it's a volumetric display or  like a hologram. this technology could be used   to review models that are being  made for cnc machining 3d printing   civil engineering or any kind of engineering  really education maker spaces there's really a lot   of applications for this technology some people  might say it's a competitor to virtual reality   but I think it's complementary and anyone looking  at either of these should probably consider both   so we're also going to have a look at some  models that I've got from Thingiverse and I'll   give a shout out to the people whose models  that I've used all right let's have a look   okay so the first thing you'll notice is  there's a really nice graphical user interface   that displays all the files and folders and all  you have to do to access your files and folders   with the usb is plug it in and then it displays  them on the screen therefore so yeah as you can   see I've changed it to monochrome so you can  have a look at blue and green and what we're   looking at here is the CNC machine so there's  a build log I've done a few videos on that now   and here is the part that I'm going  to put on the machine as an air duct   so that goes from a 120mm fan onto the  side of the enclosure for the electrical   and inspecting it now we can see the different  faces and three-dimensional cross-sectional areas   it's really nice to inspect how that's going  to look as a 3d print when it's finished okay first up we've got alpha legion biker gang  from iml for us it's cool looking futuristic bike and next we've got cute dragon from sebastian  v650 it's quite a popular one this one and this one is aeronautica orc vehicles and  flyers there's a few files in this package this   one's from Jim Jim Jimmy Jim thanks thanks for  that all right this one is a cellular lamp by   nervous system it's quite nice  looking. over 27 000 likes digital sundial by emerge optics   this one was quite famous when it came out I had  people sending me links and videos to this one gravity captain bundle and builder by Chernabog  another one from Jim Jim Jimmy Jim very nice 616.
