 Morning everybody As it says on the tin, I'm Chris and I'm at ultra leap for those that don't recognize the name Immediately, we recently rebranded about a month ago. We were ultra haptics and Then post an acquisition of leap motion In May we we rebranded - to ultra leap So although the two significant technologies the the theory is reasonably simple the the idea is that we're moving the the sort of the computer the human-computer interface is moving from Mainframe computers if you're looking over a time line mainframe computers Large laptops - mobile phones tablets and the next You know iteration of that will be spatial computing If you believe if you believe that trend and you know, most of the analysts M&A activity shows that to be the case Our belief is that we have to - of the core technologies in that area. So one is The on the ultra on the haptic side we create touch in midair So what that means is if you take ultrasound and you emit ultrasound in a very specific manner You can create a tactile haptic feedback in midair So not on your tablets that we've all got haptics on our phones anything in midair that's sits in our realm on the other side a core technology is the tracking so you need very very very Accurate hand tracking - to operate in this spatial area So in that spatial interaction Your core technologies are going to be voice their voice user interface the haptics You know non wearable genuine haptics in midair and this a very accurate tracking Hand tracking we have the two Best and leading technologies in the world in two of those three core fundamental spaces so the plan the vision is to be the epicenter of that move that technology shift a Little bit more on the two technologies So we have hundreds of patents on both sides of the company on both of those two core technologies On there. We'll start on the left on the hand tracking side The development has taken ten years over a hundred million dollars and they're now 350 thousand developers working on that technology to accelerate it on the haptic side on the touch side We've got again hundreds of patents down to the absolute core fundamental physics and we have Over 80 universities now working on top of our platform to create the technologies and the interfaces of the future So, what does this mean market wise and in economic terms So we are there are a multitude of markets that we can go after I've listed four here. These are the four we have commercial engagement with we have license royalty agreements in and those are the four that I'm Focusing our sales team and BD team on at the moment There are a multitude of other markets that we can go after however The concern is obviously sort of magpie syndrome and they just chase the newest shiniest Little toy and so we're focusing on the youthful markets executing on these four markets and then thereafter we can go after medical devices industrial applications that multitude of others that are available to us, so Often I get a question You know, so what why is this important? It's important because in each of these markets that we're going after There are very real drivers and very real value drivers starting at digital out of home advertising You know, you mean a big driver in those markets is ad recall and retention rate We have you know that there are there are a multitude of statistics from our customers that show that we are a step change in That recall and retention rate over existing technologies to have a more immersive engaging experience is highly value also advertisers looking in the automotive sector If you have a you know, most of the cars were a lot of the cars these days have your beautiful flat screen You know touch paths that you engage with the problem with that is your only feedback Really is to go is to actually look at it when you're engaging with that which is not particularly safe So there's a very big safety angle in automotive clearly if you're looking at the tap screen and you're not I always think to my Go back 20 years and you've got the 3-series BMW II grabbed the volume But then you turned it up If you're if you don't have something that gives you that tactile feedback, you have to look at it to know what your engagement is With the button in midair when you stick your hand up button hits into your hand and you can turn up the volume You can play with the set now If you can work on the heating with different tactile sensations It means that you're watching the road at 70 miles an hour and not watching the screen so big safety angle in automotive And then in your AR vr gaming space The problem those markets have had to date is that the technology just hasn't? lived up to the human natural experience that we expect our technology in that space is the only technology in the world that can give you a Latency of less than 20 milliseconds which is where it's imperceptible to the human human interaction, so Very big drivers in each of the markets yeah a Little history lesson on ultra leap We have we've raised 60 million 65 million today to sterling that excludes the cash that leap motion raised prior to our acquisition We have numerous awards and now have a team of 155 people On top of that the 155 employees. We've got a I believe a very strong adviser base around us Two notable ones on our on non execs. We have 2x 40 to 50 CEOs on our on our borders not execs The as are saying that the technology now is caught up and the markets are maturing so in the last six months we've seen a noticeable step change in the way in which we're a to apply the commercialization of our technology and so You can see, you know, neatly. So top right of the screen there are numerous new deals that we've executed on certainly in the last six months and Accelerating much more rapidly even over the last six weeks To give you a little bit of a snapshot of the numbers again on that six-month timeline if you look bottom left, it just shows the Transition the maturity and transition of the business model we've able to accelerate attempt to restructure the business model to be far more recurring revenue based in certainly over the last six months even And that's driven by our sort of predominantly license royalty model in in most of our markets Revenues in a clearly that's easy on a low revenue base revenues a you know, tear up and your Ubiquitous unexpected hockey-stick The comfort I have as the CFO on those numbers is at the moment We've really signed or are in legals for to have secured the majority of our revenues for next year so that the you know the uptick the dramatic the uptick is Israel and and Absolutely as if executable if you like On the commercial path today we've had lots of we've done lots of development work with numerous partners Big name partners and we're now able to Convert those into commercial licenses and royalties the most recent of which announced a couple weeks ago is our deal with Vario who have In the market the world's top VR headset Thanks
