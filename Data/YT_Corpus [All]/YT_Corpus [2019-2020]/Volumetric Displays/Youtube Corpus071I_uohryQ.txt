 hi everyone my name is Dylan here's an example of spherical fpv our display called KO globe was exhibited at SIGGRAPH last year it features multiple projectors and a curved projection surface that can render a contained virtual environment in a physical space here's some first-person video of the display exhibiting a fishbowl scene users may walk completely around the display while the content is rendered securely inside there's two important depth cues that contribute to the 3d fidelity of these displays motion parallax is the perception that while you're moving objects closer to you seem to move faster than objects farther away this depth cue can be implemented with head tracking and perspective corrected rendering and is a basic requirement of FPD are a stereopsis or stereo for short is the perception of depth through binocular disparity this depth cue can be implemented by rendering a distinct image to each eye doing so can be expensive or technologically challenging so it's not always included in fpv our displays early user studies that use the single CRT monitor showed a surprising result even though stereo was thought to be the strongest depth cue motion parallax alone resulted in better performance than stereo loan for 3d perception tasks it's important to note that for these early displays users would remain seated in front of the display and would benefit from motion parallax by moving their head back and forth mislead many this led to many follow-on FTB our displays especially multi-screen displays like the spiri QB and tele human to drop stereo all together for a glasses-free 3d experience it was thought that by allowing users to stand up and walk around the displays there would be even more of a benefit from and parallax because of these differences research on the relative importance of stereo and motion parallax within single screen F TVR may lack validity for multi-screen fpv on another important contributor a three-d fidelity is view point calibration F TV are displays require careful calibration of the users view point to the rendered perspective of the scene and bad calibration can cause noticeable visual artifacts visual distortion caused by viewing from the wrong perspective can be minimized to the process of viewpoint calibration in this example the lines that make up the color grid should be straight but can be a bent when viewed from the wrong perspective like in the image on the left this led us to two research questions similar to previous research with F TVR we wanted to know how important inclusion of stereo is with regards to users performance and 3d tasks and their subjective preference we were also interested in gathering accuracy requirements for viewpoint calibration the building spherical displays is challenging and they sell a variety of fidelity problems which could impact the perceptual study stereo technology has improved a lot since the days of CRT displays however using shutter glasses still caused a noticeable reduction in display brightness it was also challenging to find the stereo that did not interfere with our head tracking technology and that could be toggled on and off at the same time as the display another issue was with calibration error and latency the displays we had access to were still in the prototype stage they had noticeable errors in pixel position and noticeable latency with regards to head movements especially as a user got closer so to get around these limitations we created a simulated spherical ft VR with in VR and conducted the entire study in immersive VR so here's an example of the same fishbowl scene that you saw in the first video but from within our VR environment on a virtual ft VR display using a VR headset all the display components like projectors tracking systems display surface and stereo capabilities were simulated and provided a higher 3d fidelity experience than the physical display that it was modeled on so using this virtual assistant Menten we could get extremely low latency head tracking from the VR headset and provide a perfectly calibrated spherical fpv our display it also allowed us to easily toggle the stereo rendering of the display without affecting brightness or requiring the user to change equipment now that we had a controlled environment we ran a user study in Viana designed to answer our research questions about stereo and its effect on calibration accuracy user preference and user performance feature 21 participants single factor 3 experiments including a pattern alignment task featuring a recently proposed perceptual calibration technique a subjective preference test that had users select their preferred condition and finally a set of 3d point cloud tasks to measure user performance we also performed a stereo acuity test in VR which we used to exclude some participants data and monitored motion sickness using a virtual reality sickness questionnaire so the single factor we controlled was viewing condition in the stereo viewing condition the F TV our display and VR headset rendered distinct images for each eye this represents the use case of multi screen FD VR with stereo in the non stereo viewing condition the FT VR display only renders one image to the midpoint of the eyes while the headsets renders both eyes this represents the typical use case of multi-screen ftv are without stereo the environment still provides a binocular disparity however the display does not and in monocular the FGB our display and headset render one image to one eye this represents the use case of user closing one eye to look at the display this is sometimes done to increase the accuracy of the rendering so when the first task a pattern was rendered to a fixed point in space and the participant aligned their viewpoint to that point as closely as possible the pattern was designed to guide the user to the correct location through interpretation of the visible distortions the distortions appears bent lines and squished circles if the participant aligns their view to the correct location then the pattern appears on distorted BET lines become straight and squished circles become perfect circles so we found no significant difference in time on the left but on the right hand side note the red line labeled initial error this is how far away the rendering of the pattern started at so stereo in red had a thick black border indicating that it was the significant best-conditioned and the dashed lines indicate there was a significant difference between stereo and the other two conditions this TAS showed a strong effect of viewing condition on calibration accuracy in the next experiment participants were instructed to inspect the scene and condition a and then condition B and then choose their preference they repeated this for all possible pairs of conditions we enforced a minimum amount of movement button by requiring users to cross the red bar in each condition we asked the participants to choose the condition that appeared the most 3d and the one where the statue seemed to move around the least the statute is fixed inside the display however it is possible in non stereo that users may perceive movement as they move around the effect is caused by the fact that perspective corrected images cannot be rendered to both eyes so they'll be viewed from a slightly incorrect position we found no significant effects using pairwise comparisons when we aggregated them the data show that stereo and non stereo maybe slightly preferred over monocular we expected stereo to be strongly preferred because it would have no visual artifacts unlike non stereo for the discomfort of closing one eye like monocular but we found no significant agreement between participants for our preferences in the last experiment participants completed three performance tasks with 3d point clouds adapted from previous AR research in this first task participants were asked to judge which pair of points red or yellow had the smallest distance between them this task relied on a user's perception of the 3d content alone so in the conditions that lacked stereo depth cues we expected participants to rely more on motion parallax by moving their head around a lot more and the second task participants were asked to select four target points that were highlighted red and in the last performance task participants were asked to align a semi-transparent cutting plane to intersect three red three clusters of red points which turned blue when they were intersected so for performance results were much clearer stereo improved time and accuracy and most of the tasks we tested we're as non stereo was detrimental to performance we found no change in accuracy for the manipulation task which was similar to that of the original augmented reality study using this task this may be due to the high difficulty of the task particularly for novice VR users so during our performance tasks we also recorded head movement of participants using the tracking system of the VR headset that we hypothesized that users would use a motion parallax more in conditions without stereo however that wasn't the case even when instructed that motion parallax may be beneficial it was an underutilized depth cue we also noticed during the pattern alignment task that users would rather stand comfortably and submit a measurement with noticeable error the crouched down for better accuracy so user comfort may be a priority in these displays with spherical ftv our users didn't have a strong preference for stereo nor even really notice the visual artifacts present without stereo but they consistently perform better the stereo therefore a design recommendation for such displays is that glasses free non stereo is fine for casual use and should be calibrated to within six and a half centimeters but stereo should be included if used for 3d tasks and calibrated within three centimeters VR is an excellent testbed for prototyping and evaluating 3d display design because the physical properties of display can be simulated and their efficacy can be evaluated for different designs and for different degrees of fidelity for example you who control calibration accuracy tracker latency display latency displays brightness or even the stereo capabilities of this place [Applause] I'm gonna bring it over Steve finer Columbia University thanks for the talk this is really interesting work one thing that you get out of actual physical display is virgins accommodation match and I was wondering since you don't have the ability to change accommodation and you are looking at something it's a relatively close to which accommodation really is quite important what your feelings are about not having it that's something we looked at with the physical displays then yeah people get to focus on their eyes focus on the display that's quite far away and then the content doesn't very in-depth very much because the sphere is only so big so it works quite well but in VR you're focused on the screens right in front of your eyes so it's not an issue that we looked at in this particular research but I think it's something that would definitely be good to think about thank you hi I'm Juliana France from the house University so we've done this as well as using VR environments to simulate real environments in order to run or to experiments one thing that I have to ask you think the selection technique that you use it might have bias your results because we asked many times should we using ray casting should be using something different yeah I know they're for precision or human performance tasks in VR yeah that's a great question that's there's so many different selection techniques in 3d which one to use we just selected the one that had accessibility for the display we could just render the Ray inside the display like we could in a physical display because in VR you can do a lot of different selection techniques but we were limited to the ones that we could actually implement on a physical display and so I think that's one where in non stereo specially people struggled with because they couldn't tell where the race started and where it ended so I'd love to look at different selection techniques this is Mike MacGuffin I found it interesting that you you found the motion parallax was underutilized and I'm thinking if the user could rotate the the display with their hand maybe with a mouse or something like that maybe that would be easier than rotating their head around it and so maybe that would maybe we'd see the user making more use of motion parallax in that case so then I have a question based on the literature you you looked at and your own data do you have a feeling for the minimum angle of rotation where we could say yes the user is making use of motion parallax that's a great question thank you previously I do know in the CRT displays they looked a lot at motion parallax and instead of having the user move the head around they said why don't we move the content like you described and so they would rotate it back and forth five or ten degrees or something but sometimes that you can't really do that with the content especially if you're trying to make it physically situate it and you don't want it to move because it's supposed to be in your physical environment so why is it rotating but that's definitely an approach as far as the actual degrees I think it's quite small it's not like massive head movements that you could probably get a lot of information just from a small amount of head movements okay thanks hi my name is Ari I'm from the MIT Media Lab and I my question is similar and I'm wondering if you think that discomfort was being in a headset is the reason people don't make use of motion parallax sort of like when people put on a headset this frees because yeah until I can move around yeah that's that's a great question we had a couple participants after the study mentioned that that may have been a reason that they didn't move around as much as because they were in a VR headset and one person said I didn't want to break it because I thought it was expensive and so that was like that's a great great thing I think once the displays get a little bit better we can just run the study right on that the physical display and see the difference
