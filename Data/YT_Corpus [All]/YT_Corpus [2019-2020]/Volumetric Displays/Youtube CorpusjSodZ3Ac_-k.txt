 She saw on my Lifeline that I was playing media a lot and she asked me what it was and it was because I had installed one of those farming games, and then she installed it, and now we're both playing. Last night I didn't feel like cooking, so I decided to order outside. I estimated she would be arriving with this pattern, I knew she was going to arrive in about one hour and actually, she was at the door with the delivery guy That was pretty neat. I think in this sense Lifelines is...  instead of enhancing the communication, in my perception, it decreases the communication, because we're communicating less. I think we're in this transition of learning how to use the app and what it's polite in a way, what are the best practices for a using the app. It's not that because you're using the app you don't have to send a message. So, generally I see these gaps in the Lifeline but when she's using the phone I don't see any gaps I see a full line, and I know what is happening, she's fine, She's having a peaceful time. The kids are not doing anything strange nobody's running to the hospital or something like that I saw in the app that he listened to something until like 3:00 a.m. and I was like "oh you didn't sleep very well, did you?" because I had all the information on the app Otherwise, I wouldn't have known or I wouldn't have even been as patient with him without knowing that he didn't sleep well and he's not rested and he can't function as well as normally, so this helped me managing my expectations. Definitely.
