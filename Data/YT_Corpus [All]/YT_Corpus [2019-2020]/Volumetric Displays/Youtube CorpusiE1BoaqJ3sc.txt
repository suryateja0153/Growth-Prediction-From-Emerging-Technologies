 [   ]  WE HAVE TAKEN TREMENDOUS STEPS. WE HAVE ACHIEVED THE BREATH TAKING, THE EARTH SHAKING, THE GROUND BREAKING, AND LEFT THE MARK IN THE HEAVENS. OUR SUCCESSES BUILD ONE UPON ANOTHER AND AMPLIFY WHAT IS POSSIBLE. IT'S TIME WE TAKE THE NEXT GREAT LEAP. WE'RE BUILDING THE NEXT CHAPTER OF AMERICAN EXPLORATION, RETURNING TO THE MOON TO STAY SO WE CAN GO BEYOND, TO MARS, TO EXPAND WHAT'S POSSIBLE AND FURTHER OUR UNDERSTANDING. THE ARCHITECTURE FOR THESE MISSIONS IS ALREADY TAKING SHAPE. WE WILL GO WITH NEW SYSTEMS, BOLD DESIGN, AND A SUSTAINABLE MISSION. YOU CAN SEE IT, TOUCH IT, TASTE IT. WE ARE PRESSING OUR PIONEER SPIRIT INTO EVERY COMPONENT, DESIGNING OUR RESOLVE INTO EVERY LINE OF CODE, SECURING OUR SUCCESS WITH EVERY WELCOMED PARTNERSHIP. THIS IS NOT HYPOTHETICAL, THIS IS ABOUT SCIENCE AND FEEDING FORWARD THE ADVANCE OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT BECAUSE WE ARE THE PIONEERS, THE STAR SAILORS, THE THINKERS, THE VISIONARIES, THE DOERS. AND BECAUSE WE STAND ON THE SHOULDERS OF GIANTS TO GO FARTHER THAN HUMANITY HAS EVER BEEN, WE WILL ADD OUR NAMES TO THE ROLLS OF THE GREATEST ADVENTURERS IN HISTORY, EVERY DAY, EVERY MISSION, WE ADVANCE THIS CALL. WE ARE NASA. AND AFTER 60 YEARS, WE'RE JUST GETTING STARTED. [Applause]  ALL RIGHT. MAN, THOSE VIDEOS ARE A TOUGH ACT TO FOLLOW. THEY ARE OUTSTANDING. WELL, GOOD AFTERNOON AND WELCOME TO THE KENNEDY SPACE CENTER AND THE DAWN OF A NEW ERA IN THE EXPLORATION OF THE SPACE CENTER AND MARS. I AM PLEASED TO WELCOME YOU ALL, DISTINGUISHED GUESTS, NASA'S VALUED EMPLOYEES WATCHING FROM ACROSS THE NATION, AND OUR GUESTS HERE AND BROAD. IT WAS 50 YEARS AGO THIS JULY THAT KSC WAS THE LAUNCH SITE FOR THAT HISTORIC APOLLO 11 MISSION, WHEN PRESIDENT KENNEDY STOOD BEFORE A JOINT SESSION OF CONGRESS, AND HE ANNOUNCED HIS AMBITIOUS GOAL OF SENDING HUMANS TO THE MOON AND RETURNING THEM SAFELY. WE STILL HAD TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE THAT WORK. WE QUICKLY RAMPED UP OPERATIONS HERE AT KSC. WE HAD THE MERCURY 7 CREW HERE. WE HOSTED THEM, WE WORKED HARD ON THE GEMINI, WORKING ON EVERYTHING WE NEEDED TO TO GET THE FIRST HUMANS ON THE MOON TO MAKE THE FIRST STEPS ON THE LUNAR SURFACE 50 YEARS AGO. WE'LL BE TAKING SIMILAR STEPS AS WE BUILD A SUSTAINABLE ARCHITECTURE. THE KENNEDY SPACE CENTER IS UP TO THE CHALLENGE AND WE CAN'T WAIT TO SEE ROCKETS ON THOSE LAUNCH PADS TAKING HUMANS BACK TO THE MOON AND EVENTUALLY ONTO MARS. IT'S MY PLEASURE TO INTRODUCE TIM BRIDENSTINE. TIM CAME ON BOARD ABOUT THE TIME THE PRESIDENT SIGNED SPACE POLICY DIRECTIVE ONE THAT DIRECTED US TO SEND HUMANS TO THE MOON FOR LONG-TERM EXPLORATION AND UTILIZATION, FOLLOWED BY MISSIONS TO MARS. HIS PASSION FOR FLIGHT AND SPACE EXPLORATION SERVED HIM WELL ON THE ARMED FORCES COMMITTEE AND THE TECHNOLOGY SPACE AND SCIENCE COMMITTEE IN CONGRESS. AND TODAY, THAT PASSION IS INSPIRING THE NASA WORKFORCE AND THE PUBLIC ON A NEW MISSION OF EXPLORATION. PLEASE WELCOME OUR 13th ADMINISTRATOR, JIM BRIDENSTINE. [Applause]  WELL, BOB, THANK YOU FOR THAT INTRODUCTION AND THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE ON A DAY THAT WE THINK IS EXCITING. TODAY, WE ARE ROLLING OUT THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET REQUEST FOR NASA, AND I'M VERY HAPPY TO TELL YOU THAT NASA'S BUDGET REQUEST FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS STRONG, AND WE HAVE STRONG BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IN BOTH CHAMBERS OF CONGRESS. [Applause]  I'M GOING TO SPEND A FEW MINUTES TALKING ABOUT A MISSION THAT I THINK IS A LOT OF FUN, VERY EXCITING, AND TRANSFORMATIVE, AS A MATTER OF FACT, OF THE WAY WE FLY IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. WE HAVE BEEN FLYING THROUGH THE ATMOSPHERE AT .6 MACH FOR 50 YEARS, AND I THINK IT'S TIME WE CHANGE THAT. THE X-59 AND THE AIR FORCE MISSION DIRECTORATE IS FUNDED AT A VERY STRONG LEVEL. I WANT TO TALK FOR A SECOND ABOUT WHAT THIS MEANS. LAST YEAR, WE SAW OVER GALVESTON WHAT A SONIC BOOM WILL DO TO COMMUNITIES, FROM AN ANNOYANCE PERSPECTIVE AND FROM AN INFRASTRUCTURE PERSPECTIVE. WHEN WE SAW THAT, WE WERE ABLE TO MAKE DETERMINATIONS AS TO WHAT THE LEVEL OF TOLERANCE WOULD BE FOR A SONIC BOOM. IT HAS BEEN BANNED BY A LONG TIME BY THE F.A.A. TO FLY OVER THE UNITED STATES AS SUPER SONIC AIR SPEEDS BECAUSE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH DISTURBANCE TO INFRASTRUCTURE. WE AS NASA HAVE BEEN WORKING FOR A LONG TIME TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE, WE ARE ASSESSING WHAT IS THE TOLERANCE FOR A LOW BOOM, AND WE'RE IMAGING IT. IN FACT JUST THE OTHER DAY, WE HAD A BEECHCRAFT 200 FLY WITH A BRAND-NEW CAMERA AND LOOK AT TWO T-38s FLYING BELOW IT AT SUPER SONIC SPEEDS AND LOOKING AT THAT PRESSURE WAVE. NOT JUST AT THE BOW BUT AT ALL THOSE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE T-38s BUT WHEN THEY COMBINE. BECAUSE WHEN THOSE PRESSURE COMBINES, THAT'S WHEN WE GET THE SUPER SONIC BOOM AND THAT'S WHAT CAN BE TROUBLING FOR INFRASTRUCTURE. SO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS TAKE WHAT WE LEARNED FROM THESE EXPERIMENTS AND TAKE THE X-59 THAT'S GOING TO BE FLOWN IN THE YEAR 2021 SO FOR THE FIRST TIME WE CAN GET REGULATIONS ON THE BOOKS IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA THAT SAY YOU CAN FLY SUPER SONIC. THE X-59 IS GOING TO FLY AT MACH 1.4 AT 55,000 FEET. WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO GO FROM ONE SIDE OF THE UNITED STATES TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE UNITED STATES IN A COUPLE OF HOURS INSTEAD OF FIVE OR SIX HOURS, DEPENDING ON THE WINDS. THIS IS TRANSFORMATIVE TO BE ABLE TO GET TO ONE SIDE OF THE COUNTRY FROM THE OTHER AND TRAVEL IN THE COUNTRY. JUST THAT MISSION IS THE X-57 MAXWELL, THE FIRST ALL ELECTRIC TRANSPORT AIRCRAFT CAPABLE OF CARRYING PASSENGERS AND CARGO, ALL ELECTRIC. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? THAT MEANS WE CAN DRIVE DOWN THE COST OF TRANSPORTING PEOPLE AND CARGO FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER BY UP TO AND EVEN IN SOME CASES OVER 60%. WELL, IF WE CAN DRIVE DOWN THE COST BY THAT AMOUNT, THAT MEANS WE'RE GOING TO HAVE POTENTIALLY COMMERCIAL FLIGHTS GOING TO MORE DESTINATIONS THAN EVER BEFORE. WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO SERVE COMMUNITIES WITH AIR TRAVEL THAT HISTORICALLY HAVE NOT BEEN SERVED WITH AIR TRAVEL. I WANT TO BE CLEAR, WE ARE NOT THERE YET. BUT THE X-57 MAXWELL IS THE TOOL BY WHICH WE WILL BE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH THESE OBJECTIVES, AND DRIVING DOWN COST AND INCREASING ACCESS TO AIR TRAVEL IS THE WAY THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO INCREASE THE STANDARD OF LIVING FOR EVERY AMERICAN, AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT NASA IS ALL ABOUT, ELEVATING THE HUMAN CONDITION, AND THE X-57 IS A TOOL TO ACCOMPLISH THAT. ONE OTHER VERY EXCITING MISSION WITHIN THE AIR FORCE RESEARCH DIRECTORATE THAT I'M REALLY KIND OF INTRIGUED BY IS URBAN AIR MOBILITY. THE IDEA THAT YOU CAN FLY ON AN UNMANNED, I SHOULD SAY, UNCREWED CRAFT, NO PILOT, LET'S SAY THAT, FROM ONE SIDE OF THE CITY TO ANOTHER SIDE OF THE CITY JUST LIKE YOU WOULD DRIVE A CAR. NOW, AGAIN, WE'RE NOT THERE YET, BUT IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THAT, WE FIRST START WITH CARGO, AND THERE IS INDUSTRY IN THE UNITED STATES RIGHT NOW VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT EVENTUALITY. WHY? BECAUSE IT WILL HELP THEM GET PACKAGES TO YOUR DOORSTEP FASTER AND MORE EFFICIENTLY THAN EVER BEFORE. ONCE WE DO THAT, THERE IS NO LIMIT TO WHAT WE CAN DO WITH HUMANS IN THE FUTURE. BUT TO DO THAT, WE HAVE TO INTEGRATE UNMANNED SYSTEMS INTO THE NATIONAL AIR SPACE SYSTEM. THAT'S NOT AN EASY FEAT. WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT DOING THAT IN URBAN ENVIRONMENTS, THERE'S A WHOLE LEVEL OF SAFETY THAT HAS TO COME INTO PLAY. WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WORKING ON THOSE VERY CHALLENGING PROBLEMS SO THAT ONE DAY, WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DELIVER PACKAGES TO YOUR DOORSTEP IN A VEHICLE THAT FLIES IN THE SKY OVER POPULATED CENTERS MORE EFFICIENTLY AND EVEN FLY HUMANS FROM ONE SIDE OF THE CITY TO THE OTHER. SO THESE ARE ALL VERY EXCITED THINGS WITHIN THE AERONAUTICS MISSION DIRECTORATE, AND I WANTED TO MAKE SURE I STARTED THE SPEECH TODAY TALKING ABOUT THAT PART OF THE BUDGET BECAUSE AS A NAVY PILOT, I LIKE THE IDEA OF EVERYBODY BEING ABLE TO FLY SUPER SONIC AND OF COURSE EVERYBODY BEING ABLE TO FLY IN GENERAL AND EVENTUALLY EVERYBODY BEING ABLE TO FLY FROM ONE SIDE OF THE CITY TO ANOTHER SIDE OF THE CITY. SO LET'S TAKE IT UP A NOTCH FROM AERONAUTICS TO SPACE. WE HAVE SEEN WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE AS NASA IN LOW-EARTH ORBIT, WE BECOME ONE CUSTOMER OF MANY CUSTOMERS IN A ROBUST COMMERCIAL MARKETPLACE IN LOW-EARTH ORBIT. WE JUST SAW A SPACEX CREW DRAGON DOCK WITH THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION DELIVER FROM CARGO, A LITTLE EARTH HUMANOID, ULTIMATELY DO A LOT OF TESTS, UNDOCK, FLY HOME, AND LAND SAFELY. THAT IS A FIRST STEP IN A MUCH LONGER MISSION FOR NASA TO BECOME ONE CUSTOMER OF MANY CUSTOMERS IN LOW-EARTH ORBIT IN A ROBUST COMMERCIAL MARKETPLACE. AND AT THE SAME TIME, HAVING NUMEROUS PROVIDERS THAT ARE COMPETING ON COST AND INNOVATION. WHY IS THAT SO IMPORTANT? BECAUSE WE NEED TO DRIVE DOWN COSTS, WE NEED TO INCREASE ACCESS, WE NEED TO MAKE SPACE FLIGHT MORE AVAILABLE TO MORE PEOPLE. THAT INCLUDES COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MANUFACTURING, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TOURISM, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PHARMACEUTICALS, MAYBE FIBEROPTICS. WE NEED TO DEVELOP THAT VERY ROBUST COMMERCIAL MARKETPLACE IN LOW-EARTH ORBIT. IT STARTS WITH CARGO. IT IS NOW STARTING TO GET TO THE POINT WHERE WE'RE GOING TO BE LAUNCHING CREW. BY THE WAY, WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT IN 2019. [Applause]  AND EVENTUALLY, WE'RE GOING TO GET TO A DAY WHERE LOW-EARTH ORBIT IN HABITATION WILL BE GENERALIZED. IN OTHER WORDS, NASA WILL BE A CUSTOMER FOR MANY CUSTOMERS, COMPETING ON COST AND INNOVATION, NOT JUST FOR RESUPPLY, NOT JUST FOR CREW, BUT FOR SCIENCE, HABITATION, CAPABILITY, AND LOW-EARTH ORBIT. LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT. WHY DOES NASA WANT TO COMMERCIALIZE LOW-EARTH ORBIT. IT IS IN OUR INTERESTS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF MARKETPLACES WHERE THEY EXIST BECAUSE COST GOES DOWN, AND THEN WE CAN USE THE AMERICAN TAX DOLLARS, THE RESOURCES WE ARE GIVEN BY THE AMERICAN TAXPAYER TO GO FURTHER THAN WE'VE EVER DONE BEFORE. THAT'S WHAT WE DO. THE PRESIDENT HAS GIVEN US SPACE POLICY DIRECTIVE ONE WHICH SAYS GO BACK TO THE MOON, AND WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT IN SHORT ORDER, MAYBE EVEN IN 2019, BUT AT LEAST BY 2020 WITH COMMERCIAL LUNAR PAY LOAD SERVICES THAT ARE GOING TO BE FUNDED THROUGH THE SCIENCE MISSION DIRECTORATE, AND ALL OF THIS IS GOING TO BE POSSIBLE BECAUSE WE'RE LOOKING AT GOING FAST. THERE'S TWO THINGS WHEN WE TALK ABOUT COMMERCIAL LUNAR PAY LOAD SERVICES THAT ARE IMPORTANT. NUMBER ONE, IT'S COMMERCIAL. WE WANT COMPETITION ON BOTH COST AND INNOVATION. AND NUMBER TWO, IT'S GOING TO BE FAST. NASA IS NOT GOING TO BE THE LONG POLE IN THE TENT. NASA -- WE'VE ALREADY PROVIDED TEN DIFFERENT PAY LOADS THAT ARE READY TO GO TO THE MOON. AND VERY SOON, WE'RE GOING TO BE ISSUING CONTRACTS TO COMPANIES TO DELIVER THOSE PAY LOADS. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SMALL SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS TO THE SURFACE OF THE MOON. NOW IT'S NOT TALK ABOUT DELIVERING SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS TO THE SURFACE OF THE MOON, IT'S ABOUT HAVING A SUSTAINABLE PRESENCE ON AND AROUND THE MOON. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THAT DIRECTIVE, WE NEED A PERMANENT COMMAND AND SERVICE MODULE IN ORBIT AROUND THE MOON. WE CALL IT GATEWAY, AND THAT'S FULLY FUNDED IN THIS PRESIDENT'S BUDGET REQUEST. [Applause]  I HEAR PEOPLE SOMETIMES SAY WELL, YOU KNOW, GATEWAY IS NOT A SPACE STATION. IT IS NOT, IT IS A COMMAND AND A SURFACE MODULE, BUT IT WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE CREW. THE OTHER THING THAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT GATEWAY IS IT'S GOING TO UTILIZE SOLAR ELECTRIC PROPULLTION TO BE MANEUVERABLE. WHEN WE GO BACK TO APOLLO, WE LANDED THREE ASTRONAUTS ON THE SURFACE OF THE MOON, 1961 TO 1972. BECAUSE OF THAT, WE NEVER WENT TO THE POLES. WELL, THERE'S A LOT OF VALUABLE MATERIAL AT THE POLES, NAMELY, WATER ICE. WE DISCOVERED IT IN 2009 IN MASSIVE QUANTITIES, HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF TONS OF WATER ICE AT THE POLES OF THE MOON. WELL WHAT GATEWAY REPRESENTS IS NOT JUST AN OPPORTUNITY TO GO TO THE MOON OVER AND OVER AGAIN IN A SUSTAINABLE ARCHITECTURE, BUT IT REPRESENTS AN OPPORTUNITY TO GO TO MORE PARTS OF THE MOON THAN EVER BEFORE. OUR GOAL IS NOT JUST TO LAND IN ONE SPOT OF THE MOON AND LEARN A WHOLE LOT ABOUT ALL OF THE THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING IN ONE KILOMETER AROUND THAT ONE SPOT. WE'RE INTERESTED IN LEARNING ABOUT THE WHOLE MOON. GATEWAY IS GOING TO ALLOW US WITH THIS REUSABLE SERVICE MODULE, WITH THAT COMMAND SERVICE, IT'S ALSO GOING TO GO TO THE POLES OF THE MOON, IT CAN GO TO THE SOUTH, L-1 AND L-1, GIVER ROVERS AND HUMANS MORE ACCESS TO THE MOON THAN EVER BEFORE. WE DON'T WANT TO MISS ANYTHING. THERE'S A LOT TO LEARN, AND THIS IS ABOUT SUSTAINABILITY. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SUSTAINABILITY, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? THAT MEANS WE'RE ABLE TO LAUNCH MASS PAY LOADS OFF THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH. WE NEED THE SLS, AND WE NEED THE ORION SERVICE MODULE. WHEN THE PRESIDENT SAYS GO TO THE MOON, AND HE SAYS GO SUSTAINABLY, IN OTHER WORDS, WHEN YOU GO THIS TIME, YOU NEED TO STAY. WHEN THE PRESIDENT SAYS THAT, WHAT DOES IT MEAN? IT MEANS WE NEED REUSABLE. WE'VE SEEN WHAT HAPPENED IN LOW EARTH ORBITS, WHEN WE HAVE LOW USE ROCKETS. THE PRODUCTIBLITY GOES UP, AND THE COST GOES DOWN. EVERYTHING NEEDS TO BE REUSABLE BUILT INTO THE ARCHITECTURE, AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT SPACE POLICY DIRECTIVE ONE IS ALL ABOUT, A SUSTAINABLE RETURN TO THE MOON. BUT I HAVE HEARD CRITICISM THAT MAYBE WHEN WITH YOU TALK ABOUT SUSTAIN -- WE TALK ABOUT SUSTAINABLE AND REUSABLE, WHY DO WE BUILD SLS AND ORION? IT'S GOING TO HAVE A LOT OF COMPONENTS THAT ARE REUSABLE. WE'RE WORKING WITH OUR PARTNERS AT LOCKHEED MARTIN. WE COULD BE REUSING THE PRESSURE VESSEL OF ORION IN THE NEAR FUTURE. THAT'S GOING TO HELP US BUILD REUSABLITY AND SUSTAINABILITY INTO THE PROJECT. WHEN IT COMES TO SLS, AND ON THIS POINT, I WANT TO BE CRYSTAL CLEAR. SLS IS NOT REUSABLE, BUT IT IS A CRITICAL PIECE OF THE ARCHITECTURE THAT ENABLES US TO DELIVERY USABILITY TO THE MOON. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LAUNCHING GATEWAY AND ORION AND THE EUROPEAN SERVICE MODULE. ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE PART OF A REUSABLE ARCHITECTURE. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A ROCKET THAT'S BIGGER THAN ANY ROCKET THAT'S EVER BEEN BUILT IN HUMAN HISTORY, WITH A PAY LOAD FAIRING CAPABLE OF CARRYING VOLUMES THAT WE'VE EVER SEEN BEFORE, TALLEN ER -- TALLER THAN THE STATUE OF LIBERTY. THIS IS A TRANSFORMATIONAL STRATEGIC CAPABLITY FOR THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION COMMERCIAL CREW COMMERCIAL RESUPPLY AND COMMERCIAL SUPPLY FOR REHABITATION, ALL OF THIS IS VERY STRONG IN THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET REQUEST, AND WE ARE THRILLED THAT HE IS BACKING IT UP NOT JUST WITH SPACE DIRECTORATIVE ONE, BUT WITH THE BUDGET, HE'S GOING TO BUILD UP SUSTAINABLE RETURN TO THE MOON. [Applause]  ONE OTHER VERY EXCITING THING I NEED TO MAKE SURE EVERYBODY IS AWARE OF WHEN WE TALK ABOUT OUR MOON ACTIVITIES. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN OVER TEN YEARS, WE HAVE MONEY IN THIS BUDGET FOR A RETURN TO THE MOON WITH HUMANS. I'M TALKING ABOUT HUMAN RATED LANDERS COMPATIBLE WITH GATEWAY THAT CAN GO BACK AND FORTH TO THE SURFACE OF THE MOON. WE ARE FUNDING HUMAN RATED LANDERS TO GO TO THE MOON FOR THE FIRST TIME IN OVER TEN YEARS. [Applause]  OKAY. SO WE HAVE A REALLY SPECIAL OPPORTUNITY. I'D LIKE TO LET EVERYBODY KNOW THAT WE'RE GOING TO GO LIVE FROM THE JOHNSON SPATE CENTER WHERE WE'RE GOING TO MEET ASTRONAUT KAREN NYEBERG. SHE'S GOING TO TAKE US ON A TOUR OF A MOCKUP THAT ASTRONAUTS WILL USE TO GO TO THE MOON.  I'M HERE AT THE JOHNSON SPACE CENTER INSIDE A TEST VERSION OF THE ORION CAPSULE. OVER AT KSC YOU OF COURSE ARE SEEING THE REAL HARDWARE, WHAT WE'RE GOING TO USE TO FLY CREWS TO SPACE, TO THE VICINITY OF THE MOON. THIS IS ACTUALLY A VOLUMETRIC MOCKUP, THE SAME SIZE WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT THE ORION IS. YOU REALLY GET A SENSE WHEN YOU'RE SITTING IN HERE, WHEN YOU GET INSIDE, WHAT IT'S GOING TO BE LIKE FOR THE CREW WHEN WE ACTUALLY START TAKING IT TO THE VICINITY OF THE MOON. I'M SITTING HERE NEXT TO THE COMMANDER SEAT. THE COMMANDER WOULD BE SITTING HERE TO MY LEFT, AND IN FRONT OF US ARE THE DISPLAYS. WE HAVE THREE SCREENS WE CAN SWITCH, DEPENDING ON WHAT PHASE OF FLIGHT WE'RE IN. HERE WE MONITOR ALL OF OUR SYSTEMS, COMMUNICATIONS, PROP, ELECTRICAL SYSTEM. WE CAN MONITOR OUR POSITION IN SPACE AND OUR TRAJECTORIES. HERE IS A WINDOW, WHICH I THINK IS A KEY COMPONENT FOR ANYTHING THAT'S GOING TO CARRY PEOPLE, AND I'M SURE THIS IS GOING TO PROVIDE A GREAT VIEW OF THE MOON FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE GETTING NEAR. IT'S A GREAT TIME FOR NASA NOW. NOT ONLY ARE WE BUILDING ORION AND SLS, BUT WE'RE CONTINUING TO LIVE ON BOARD THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION FOR INVESTIGATORS ALL OVER THE WORLD. WE'RE ALSO DEMONSTRATING SOME HARDWARE ON THE SPACE STATION AND OF COURSE FOSTERING THE COMMERCIAL PARTICIPATION IN SPACE TRAVEL. AND AT THE SAME TIME GETTING READY IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF GATEWAY AND THE LUNAR LANDERS AND ALL OF THE SCIENCE PAY LOADS THAT ARE REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH THAT -- THAT PRESENCE THERE. IT'S REALLY, REALLY EXCITING FOR ALL OF US. I HAVE WITH ME HERE -- TO SHOW THIS IS A LUNAR SAMPLE THAT WAS ACTUALLY BROUGHT BACK FROM ONE OF THE APOLLO MISSIONS, AND THIS ONE ACTUALLY FLEW ON A SPACE SHUTTLE TO THE SPACE STATION. WE'RE REALLY EXCITED AS CREW TO BRING BACK SAMPLES LIKE THIS FOR SCIENTISTS TO STUDY AGAIN. AND EVENTUALLY, SAMPLES FROM MARS. BACK TO YOU, ADMINISTRATOR BRIDENSTINE.  WELL, KAREN, THANK YOU FOR THAT BRIEF AND THAT UPDATE. CAN YOU SHARE WITH US AS AN ASTRONAUT, AND I KNOW YOU'RE WORKING WITH THE ASTRONAUT CORPS ALL THE TIME, WITH ALL OF THESE DEVELOPMENTS UNDERWAY AND TESTING -- OF COURSE WE'VE GOT THE DRAGON, THE STAR LINER, AND NOW WE'VE GOT ORION, DO THE ASTRONAUTS FLY -- FIGHT OVER WHO'S GOING TO FLY WHICH VEHICLE?  I THINK EVERYBODY HAS IN THEIR MIND THAT THEY WANT TO FLY SOMETHING. I THINK WE'RE IN A UNIQUE POSITION THAT WE CAN SUPPLY SOMETHING, AND I THINK EVERYONE IS JUST HAPPY TO GET A FLIGHT ASSIGNMENT.  WELL, KAREN, THANK YOU FOR THAT. I'M GOING TO TALK JUST FOR A SECOND ABOUT THAT LUNAR SAMPLE THAT YOU HAVE IN YOUR HAND. WE HAVE A SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT TODAY. WE HAVE THREE LUNAR SAMPLES THAT HAVE COME BACK FROM THE MOON THAT HAVE NEVER BEEN OPENED. WE'RE GOING BACK TO OUR MISSIONS FROM 1969 TO 1972, THREE MISSION SAMPLES THAT HAVE NEVER BEEN OPENED. AND IN THIS PARTICULAR BUDGET AND THIS PARTICULAR YEAR, WE ARE VERY MUCH LOOKING FORWARD TO CONTRACTING WITH NINE DIFFERENT COMPANIES TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO USE THE TECHNOLOGY WE HAVE TODAY TO STUDY THOSE VERY PRISTINE SIMPLES THAT HAVE NEVER BEEN OPENED. NOW I WANT TO BE CLEAR. HERE'S A CRITICALLY IMPORTANT PIECE OF KNOWLEDGE THAT WE NEED TO UNDER. WHEN THE PREVIOUS GENERATIONS DID APOLLO, THEY KNEW THAT THE TECHNOLOGY THAT THEY HAD IN THAT DAY WAS NOT THE TECHNOLOGY THAT WE WOULD HAVE IN THIS DAY, SO THEY MADE A DETERMINATION THAT THEY WERE GOING TO PRESERVE SAMPLES BECAUSE THEY KNEW THERE WOULD BE A DAY WHEN BETTER TECHNOLOGY WOULD BE ABLE TO BETTER ASSESS ALL OF THE DIFFERENT -- THE HISTORY OF THE MOON FROM ULTIMATELY THE TECHNOLOGY THAT WE HAVE TODAY. SO TODAY, WE HAVE THIS VERY SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT THAT WE HAVE NINE TEAMS THAT WILL BE EXAMINING NINE UNOPENED SAMPLES THAT HAVE COME BACK FROM THE MOON, AND WE FEEL LIKE WE CAN DO THAT BECAUSE THERE ARE MORE LUNAR SAMPLES ON THE HORIZON WHERE WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT WE'VE EVER LEARNED ABOUT THE MOON BEFORE. SO I'D LIKE TO THANK, IF IT'S OKAY, THE APOLLO GENERATION FOR PRESERVING THESE SAMPLES -- [Applause]  -- SO THAT OUR GENERATION COULD HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY. KAREN, THANK YOU FOR YOUR GREAT -- GREAT FEEDBACK ON WHAT'S HAPPENING THERE AT THE JOHNSON SPACE CENTER. I WANT TO TALK FOR A SECOND -- OH, YES, PLEASE. [Applause]  I WANT TO TALK FOR A SECOND ABOUT THE GATEWAY. ONE OF THE VALUABLE CAPABILITIES THAT THE GATEWAY IS GOING TO BRING IS A PLUS UP IN SOLAR ELECTRIC PROPULLTION. NOW, THE GATEWAY IS NOT AN ELECTRIC SPACE STATION. WE WANT IT TO BE MANEUVER AROUND TO GO TO ALL PARTS OF THE MOON. AND IN ORDER TO DO THAT, CAN CAN'T GROW TOO BIG. THE MASS CAN'T BE TOO BIG, SO WE CAN USE SOLAR PROPULSION, TO BE ABLE TO GO AGAIN TO THE POLES, BOTH THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH POLE OF THE MOON. COULD WE BRING UP A PICTURE OF THE GATEWAY? SO WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE GATEWAY, I JUST WANT TO SHOW YOU -- THIS IS KIND OF AN ASPIRATIONAL VISION OF THE GATEWAY. THIS IS NOT WHAT IT IS TODAY, THIS IS ASPIRATIONAL. I CAN TELL YOU JUST THIS MORNING, I GOT OFF THE PHONE WITH ALL OF OUR PARTNERS ON THE I.S.S. AND OTHERS, AND THEY ARE VERY EXCITED ABOUT PARTNERING WITH US ONGOING TO THE MOON. COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO, WE ANNOUNCED THAT CANADA IS PARTNERING WITH US ON THE CREW THAT'S GOING TO THE MOON ON THE GATEWAY. NOW, THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE MANNED 24-7, SO ROBOTICS IS GOING TO BE A BIG PIECE OF IT. OF COURSE CANADA COMING ON FOR THE GATEWAY, WE'RE VERY EXCITED, AND WE HAVE OTHER AGENCIES AROUND THE WORLD EXCITED ABOUT PARTNERING WITH GATEWAY. HERE'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT. NASA IS VERY UNIQUE IN ALL OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. WE'RE ABLE TO HAVE PARTNERSHIPS WITH COUNTRIES THAT IN SOME CASES WE WOULDN'T NORMALLY BE ABLE TO PARTNER WITH. YOU CAN SEE ON THIS ROSCOSMOS. THE RELATIONSHIP WITH UNITED STATES AND RUSSIA IS STRAINED TERRESTRIALLY. BUT SINCE THE HEIGHT OF THE COLD WAR, WE'VE PARTNERED WITH RUSSIA. THE SOYUZ PROGRAM, THE MIR SHUTTLE PROGRAM, AND THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. BUT IT'S NOT JUST WITH THEM, IT'S THE EUROPEAN SPACE AGENCY, IT'S THE JAPANESE SPACE AGENCY. WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE GATEWAY, IT'S NOT THE END STATE, IT'S A PIECE. THE END STATE IS ALL OF THE ABOVE. ACCESS TO SPACE, NOT JUST LOW EARTH, BUT DEEP SPACE. THE GATEWAY. WHICH IS THIS COMMAND AND REUSABLE VEHICLE THAT CAN GO TO THE MOON, THAT CAN TAKE HUMANS BACK AND FORTH TO THE SURFACE OF THE MOON REUSABLELY, BUT ALSO LANDERS AND ROVERS. WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THIS ARCHITECTURE IN THE FUTURE, WE DON'T WANT TO CONSTRAIN OURSELVES TO THE TRADITIONAL INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION PARTNERS, THEY ARE GOING TO BE WITH US, AND WE ARE THRILLED TO HAVE THEIR SUPPORT. BUT THERE ARE MORE SPACE AGENCIES ALL-AROUND THE WORLD THAN EVER BEFORE IN HUMAN HISTORY. AND OF COURSE AS WE ARE NOW STARTING TO SEE IN A MORE ROBUST WAY, WE HAVE COMMERCIAL PARTNERS THAT ARE BRINGING CAPABLITY TO US, AS WELL. SO THIS IS JUST A SNAPSHOT OF THE FUTURE. IT'S NOT WHERE IT IS RIGHT NOW, BUT I BELIEVE IN THE FUTURE, IT'LL LOOK SOMETHING LIKE THIS. AND IN ORDER TO TALK MORE ABOUT THE GATEWAY, I'D LIKE TO GO TO THE GLENN RESEARCH CENTER, WE WE HAVE DEB WATERS AND DAVE JACOBSON. DAVE IS THE CHIEF OF ELECTRIC PROPULSION OPERATIONS, AND DEB IS A MANAGER THERE AT GLENN. I'D LIKE YOU TO SHARE WITH US FOR A FEW MINUTES WITH WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH SOLAR ELECTRIC PROPULSION.  HI. I'M STANDING HERE IN THE HIGH BAY OF THE SOLAR AND ELECTRIC PROPULSION LABORATORY WHERE WE'RE DEVELOPING PECULIAR NOLG THAT WILL TAKE US TO THE MOON. WE'VE BEEN CONDUCTING RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, AND EXPERIMENTAL TESTING IN OUR FACILITIES FOR OVER 60 YEARS. RIGHT NOW, WE'RE GETTING READY TO TEST A TYPE OF SYSTEM THAT WILL TAKE US FORWARD WITH THE GATEWAY, THE NEW SPACE CRAFT THAT WILL BE IN ORBIT AROUND THE MOON. MY COLLEAGUE DAVE HERE IS AN EXPERT IN ELECTRIC PROPULSION.  A TEAM HERE AT GLENN'S RESEARCH CENTER IS WORKING WITH PARTNERS AT THE JET PROPULSION LABORATORY. THE INTENDED APPLICATION FOR THIS TECHNOLOGY IS THE GATEWAY THAT DEB AND OTHERS HAVE REFERRED TO TODAY. THE GATEWAY WILL ENABLE CREW TO LIVE AND WORK IN DEEP SPACE FOR MONTHS AT A TIME AND SERVE AS AN OUTPOST FOR HUMAN MISSIONS TO THE LUNAR SERVICE. THE POWER AND PROPULSION WILL BE THE FIRST PART OF THE GATEWAY. GATEWAY WILL UTILIZE SOLAR ELECTRIC PROPULSION TO MAINTAIN ITS POSITION AND MAINTAIN BETWEEN LUNAR ORBITS. A HALL THRUSTER IONIZES IN AND OUT -- THE POWER PROCESSES UNIT TAKES POWER FROM THE SOLAR ARRAY AND IT CONVERTS IT TO THE CURRENTS AND VOTAGES NECESSARY TO OPERATE THE THRUSTER. TODAY WE'RE PREPARING TO TEST A PROPULSION THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR GATEWAY. LET'S GO INSIDE THE VACUUM CHAMBER NOW WITH DEB.  RIGHT NOW, WE'RE INSIDE THE F-6. THIS IS ACTUALLY THE LARGEST CHAMBER AT LEWIS FIELD VACUUM CHAMBER AT LEWIS FIELD. BEHIND ME IS A THRUSTER. AROUND IT IS A THERMAL SHROUD. WE'RE GOING TO BE WORKING ON THE VARIOUS PROBES BEFORE THE FLIGHT MODEL COMES SOMETIME IN MAY. BEFORE WE CAN RUN THE THRUSTER, WE HAVE TO BUTTON UP OUR FACILITY AND VACUUM OUT THE AIR. THE CHAMBER WALLS CAN BE ACTUALLY CHILLED DOWN TO -320° FAHRENHEIT, AND YOU CAN SEE THAT THE CHAMBER'S ACTUALLY LINED IN GRAPHITE. THE REASON FOR THAT IS IT'S AN ELECTRIC PROPULSION CHAMBER. THE GRAPHITE MINIMIZES THE DAMAGE DONE TO THE CHAMBER AS WELL AS THAT CHAMBER MATERIAL COMING BACK AND LANDING ON THE THRUSTER ITSELF, SO IT MINIMIZES THE DAMAGE DONE. IN ORDER TO CREATE A SPACE ENVIRONMENT SUCH AS THIS, WE TRY TO DO ALL THE THINGS TO THE FACILITY TO CREATE THE ENVIRONMENT THAT YOU WOULD SEE ON THE MOON, MARS, AND BEYOND. THIS IS JUST ONE OF 26 SPACE FACILITY CHAMBERS WE HAVE HERE AT GLENN. WE'RE VERY FORTUNATE WE GET TO TEST THESE DIFFERENT TYPES OF POWER AND PROPULSION SYSTEMS AS WE'RE GETTING READY TO FLY. IT'LL BE GREAT TO BE ABLE TO SEE THIS RUNNING NEXT WEEK, RIGHT, DAVE?  THAT'S RIGHT. AT NASA, WE LIKE TO SAY THAT TECHNOLOGY DRIVES EXPLORATION. HERE AT THE GLENN RESEARCH CENTER, WE'RE VERY EXCITED THAT PROPULSION IS A PART OF OUR DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION MISSIONS. WE LOOK FORWARD TO APPLYING OUR EXPERTISE TO HUMAN AND ROBOTIC MISSIONS TO THE MOON AND BEYOND.  WITH BACK TO YOU, ADMINISTRATOR BRIDENSTINE.  NICE WORK, DAVE AND DEB. YOU'RE GETTING APPLAUSE, IF YOU CAN'T HEAR IT. [Applause]  I GOT A QUESTION FOR YOU, GUYS, JUST REAL QUICK BEFORE YOU LEAVE. WHAT'S THE NEXT MILESTONE IN THIS PROPULSION DEVELOPMENT?  SURE. SO THE HARDWARE I SHOWED YOU EARLIER WAS DESIGNED AND BUILD BY THE GLENN AND J.P.L. TEAM. IN 2016, WE SELECTED AN INDUSTRY PARTNER WHO IS FINISHING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SYSTEM AND ALSO QUALIFICATION FOR GATEWAY. IN THE MAY TIME FRAME, I THINK DEB MIGHT HAVE REFERRED TO THAT HARDWARE, WE'LL BE RECEIVING THE FIRST TECHNOLOGY UNITS AND WE'LL BE CONDUCTING THE FIRST TESTING ALL IN SUPPORT OF THE GATEWAY.  AWESOME. LAST QUESTION. WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE NEXT HUMAN OUTPOST IN SPACE, IN ORBIT AROUND THE MOON, IT'S STARTING IN CLEVELAND. HOW DO THE FOLKS IN CLEVELAND FEEL AT BEING AT THE FOREFRONT OF THIS OPPORTUNITY.  I THINK I'LL SPEAK FOR THE ENTIRE TEAM AT THE GLENN RESEARCH CENTER. FOLKS HAVE WORKED IN THIS AREA LITERALLY FOR DECADES. THIS CHAMBER WAS PUT HERE IN 1961, SO YEAH, WE'RE BEYOND EXCITED TO BRING THAT EXPERTISE TO BEAR FOR SUCH AN IMPORTANT THING FOR NASA.  WELL, DAVE AND DEB, THANK YOU FOR YOUR GREAT WORK. MAKE SURE EVERYBODY THERE KNOWS HOW GRATEFUL WE ARE, AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO MAKING THIS A WINNING ACHIEVEMENT, AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR GOOD WORK.  THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. [Applause] .  SO WE'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT THE MOON, TO GO TO THE MOON, SUSTAINABLY, WITH INTERNATIONAL PARTNERS AND COMMERCIAL PARTNERS, TO UTILIZE THE RESOURCES OF THE MOON, IN OTHER WORDS, THE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF TONS OF WATER ICE THAT WE'RE ALREADY DISCOVERED. WATER ICE IS AIR DEBRIS, IT'S WATER TO DRINK. IT IS IN FACT PROPULSION, AND IT'S AVAILABLE IN HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF TONS ON THE SURFACE OF THE MOON. BUT IT'S ABOUT MORE THAN JUST THOSE THINGS. THE LAST PART OF HIS FIRST SPACE POLICY DIRECTIVE SAYS TO TAPE THESE -- TAKE THESE CAPABLITIES FOR AN EVENTUAL MISSION TO MARS. SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS REDUCE RISK, MAKE SURE WHAT WE'RE DOING IS NOT A DEAD END AND IN FACT HAS CAPABLITIES OF BEING UTILIZED ON ANOTHER WORLD, THAT OTHER WORLD BEING MARS. LET'S TALK FOR A SECOND ABOUT MARS. BY THE WAY, WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MARS, LET'S TALK ABOUT THE SCIENCE MISSION DIRECTORATE, THE PLANETARY MISSION OF THE SCIENCE MISSION DIRECTORATE. HERE'S WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT MARS. BECAUSE OF THE SCIENCE MISSION DIRECTORATE, WE NOW KNOW IT WAS COVERED WITH WATER. AND IN FACT, THERE WAS FLOWING WATER ON MARS BECAUSE OF THE MAVEN ORBITER, WE ULTIMATELY UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT ATMOSPHERE ON MARS. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT AN OCEAN, THAT MEANS YES THERE WAS AN OCEAN, AND THERE WAS A THICK ATMOSPHERE, AND THERE IS A MAGNETOSPHERE PROTECTING MARS FROM THAT DEEP AT MOSS AT -- ATMOSPHERE AND SPACE. ALL OF THIS SUGGESTS THAT AT ONE TIME, IT WAS HABITABLE, AND HERE'S WHAT WE KNOW NOW BECAUSE OF THE CURIOSITY ROVER. WE KNOW THERE ARE COMPLEX ORGANIC MATTER ON THE SURFACE OF MARS. AND THAT WAS JUST IN THE LAST YEAR. WE KNOW NOW THE METHANE CLOCKS OF MARS ARE COMMENSURRATE WITH THE SEASONS OF MARS. THEY ARE THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF LIFE. THE PROBABILITY THAT WE MIGHT FIND LIFE ON ANOTHER WORLD HAS GONE UP. WHEN THE METHANE CYCLES WITH COMMENSURATE WITH THE SEASONS, IT DOESN'T GUARANTEE THERE'S LIFE, BUT THERE'S A POSSIBILITY OF LIFE. I'M NOT TALKING22 ABOUT222222222 BUN22222 Y222222 ROBERT22222 S2222222222222222222222222WS -- BUNNY RABBITS, BUT I'M -- I'M TALKING ABOUT LIFE. ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO POTENTIALLY REACH OUT AND FIND LIFE ON ANOTHER WORLD. [Applause]  SO HOW DO WE DO THAT? THIS BUDGET FULLY FUNDS MARS 2020. THIS IS AN AMAZING CAPABLITY. FOR THE FIRST TIME, WE ARE GOING TO CATCH SAMPLES OF MARS FOR AN EVENTUAL RETURN. WE ARE ALSO GOING TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE USE THE CARBON DIOXIDE OF MARS TO PRODUCE OXYGEN THAT EVENTUALLY HUMANS WILL BE ABLE TO BREATHE? AND EVEN MORE EXCITING, WE ARE GOING TO, FOR THE FIRST TIME, FLY A HELICOPTER ON ANOTHER WORLD WITH THE MARS HELICOPTER. [Applause]  MARS 2020 IS FULLY FUNDED IN THIS BUDGET REQUEST, BUT EVEN MORE, A MARS SAMPLE RETURN IS ALSO FUNDED IN THIS BUDGET REQUEST, WHICH WE ARE VERY EXCITED ABOUT. [Applause]  THE MOON IS THE PROVING GROUND. MARS IS THE HORIZON GOAL, AND IT REQUIRES AN ALL-OF-THE-ABOVE APPROACH. I'M GOING TO ANCHOR ON THE SCIENCE MISSION DIRECTORATE JUST FOR A MINUTE BECAUSE I NEED TO GIVE A LOT OF CREDIT TO A LOT OF PEOPLE. WHEN I WAS HOME FOR CHRISTMAS, OSIRIS REX ENTERED ORBIT AROUND BENU, AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THIS DO A SAMPLE FROM BENU, AN ASTEROID IN DEEP SPACE. AND JUST A FEW DAYS LATER, WE FLEW 4 BILLION MILES AWAY FROM EARTH ON THE OTHER SIDE OF EARTH IN THE KUYPER BELT. AND OF COURSE BEFORE WE DID THIS FLY BY, WE HAD NO IDEA WHAT THIS OBJECT WOULD LOOK LIKE, BUT NOW, WE KNOW, AND WE'RE GETTING VALUABLE SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION. THE PRIORITY IN THIS BUDGET IS FUNDED VERY, VERY WELL, AND MAKES US HEALTHY. IF WE'RE GOING TO FLY HUMANS TO MARS, WHAT OTHER PARTS OF THE SCIENCE MISSION DIRECTORATE DO WE NEED TO FUND AND UNDERSTAND? WELL, IF WE'RE GOING TO TAKE HUMANS THROUGH MARS, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE THEM THROUGH DEEP SPACE. WE NEED TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW THE SUN PUTS RADIATION INTO SPACE. WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO, IN FACT, PREDICT SOLAR FLAIRS AND CORONA MASS EJECTIONS. BECAUSE IF WE'RE NOT ABLE TO PREDICT THAT AND OUR ASTRONAUTS END UP IN THE MIDDLE OF SOMETHING LIKE THAT, IT COULD BE VERY DAMAGING TO THEIR HEALTH. PARKER SOLAR PROBE IS FULLY FUNDED AND WE ARE FOLLOWING THE ADVICE OF THE DECADO -- AND ULTIMATELY BE ABLE TO PREDICT SO WE CAN PROVIDE PROTECTION FOR HUMANS HERE ON EARTH, NOT JUST ON MARS. TO BE CLEAR, I WANT TO BE CLEAR ON THIS, IF WE HAVE A CORONA MASS EJECTION LIKE A CARINGTON EVENT IN THE 1800'S, IT COULD BE VERY DAMAGING FOR HUMAN KIND. IMAGINE NOT HAVING THE POWER GRID OR HAVING YOUR CELL TOWERS WORK, THAT COULD BE EXISTENTIAL, SO WE NEED TO BE VERY GOOD AT PREDICTING WHEN THESE KINDS OF EVENTS WILL OCCUR. WE ARE FUNDING THOSE MISSIONS WITH THE PARKER SOLAR PROBE AND OTHERS, AND THAT TAKES US OUT FROM THE SUN TO THE EARTH. THE PRESIDENT HAS NOW SIGNED NO LAW THE HIGHEST EARTH SCIENCE BUDGET IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES EVERY YEAR THAT HE HAS BEEN THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [Applause]  AND THIS BUDGET REQUEST IS HIGHER THAN FIVE OF THE BUDGETS THAT CAME OUT OF THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION. WHEN I CAME TO NASA, I COMMITTED TO CONGRESS, AND I COMMIT TO YOU NOW THAT THE EARTH SCIENCE DIVISION OF THE SCIENCE MISSION DIRECTORATE WOULD BE STRONG, THAT WE WOULD MOVE FORWARD, NO KIDDING, WITH THE SURVEYS THAT COME FROM THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES IN ALL OF THEIR AGENDA ITEMS STARTING WITH UNDERSTANDING THE INTERACTION WITH THE WATER CYCLE AND THE ENERGY CYCLE, ULTIMATELY BEING ABLE TO PREDICT WEATHER AND AIR QUALITY, UNDERSTANDING NATURAL DISASTERS AND HOW THEY OCCUR. WHEN WE THINK ABOUT ECO SYSTEM CHANGE, WHICH, FRIENDS, IT IS CHANGING. CARBON DIOXIDE IS IN THE ATMOSPHERE IN LEVELS WE HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE. WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT. IT IS A GREENHOUSE GAS. NASA HAS AN OBLIGATION TO CONTINUE STUDYING THESE. WHAT WE DO WHEN WE STUDY THE PLANET, IS WE SENSE THE EARTH IN EVERY PART OF THE ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM, AND WE SHARE IT FOR FREE. WE STUDY THE EARTH, AND AS I COMMITTED FROM THE BEGINNING, WE ARE STUDYING THE EARTH WITH AS STRONG A BUDGET AS WE HAVE SEEN, REALLY, IN A VERY LONG TIME RIGHT NOW, AND THIS BUDGET REQUEST FOR EARTH SCIENCE IS VERY STRONG, AS WELL. [Applause]  LET'S TALK ABOUT ASTROPHYSICS FOR A WHILE. TALK ABOUT SOME EXCITING DISCOVERIES. YOU KNOW, WHAT'S AMAZING IS WE'RE LEARNING MORE ABOUT NOT JUST OUR SOLAR SYSTEM, NOT JUST ABOUT OUR GALAXY, BUT IN FACT ABOUT THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE ALL THE TIME NOWAA. AAA -- THE BEGINNING OF THE UNIVERSITY, WHAT WE CALL COSMIC DAWN, TO SEE THE FIRST LIGHT FROM THE UNIVERSITY. LIGHT FROM STARS, FROM GALAXIES, TO EVEN ASSESS THE EARLIEST BLACK HOLES, AND FRIENDS, WE'RE STARTING TO UNDERSTAND PHYSICS, ASTROPHYSICS IN A WAY THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY ONLY THEORY. IN A WAY, WE'RE PROVING OUT THE THEORY OF RELATIVITY, EINSTEIN, WE'RE SEEING IT FOR THE FIRST TIME. WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THESE MISSIONS, WE TALK ABOUT HUBBLE AND SHONDRA AND KIBLER, WE KNOW THAT IT'S EXPANDING AT AN EVER INCREASING RATE, AND IT IS ACCELERATING, AND THE QUESTION IS WHY. AND WE TALK ABOUT THINGS LIKE DARK MATTER, WHICH WE NOW KNOW IS MOST OF THE MATTER IN THE UNIVERSE. WE CAN'T INTERACT WITH IT. WE CAN'T SEE IT, BUT WE KNOW IT'S THERE BECAUSE WE CAN SEE ITS GRAVITATIONAL EFFECTS. THE UNIVERSE IS ACCELERATING FASTER AND FASTER AWAY FROM THIS POINT, AND SO WE USE WORDS LIKE DARK ENERGY IS CAUSING THIS TO HAPPEN. WELL, IN ORDER TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THIS KIND OF ACTIVITY, WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO SEE TO THE VERY BEGINNINGS. WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO SEE THAT COSMIC DAWN, THE FIRST LIGHT IN THE UNIVERSE. AND I WILL TELL YOU, IT HAS BEEN A CHALLENGE FOR ME AS YOUR NASA ADMINISTRATOR TO GO TO THE HILL AND TALK ABOUT THE JAMES WEBB SPACE TELESCOPE. SOME OF YOU MIGHT HAVE SEEN THOSE HEARINGS, AND THEY'RE NOT FUN. BUT I WILL ALSO TELL YOU THIS: THIS ADMINISTRATION IS COMMITTED TO THE JAMES WEBB SPACE TELESCOPE, AND WE HAVE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT FOR THE JAMES WEBB SPACE TELESCOPE, AND IT IS -- OUR NUMBER ONE AGENDA FOR JAMES WEBB IS SUCCESS. AT THIS POINT, THIS MISSION IS SO IMPORTANT TO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, AND HERE'S WHY: WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ESTABLISHING AMERICA AS THE LEAD IN PHYSICS FOR THE NEXT 30 YEARS. WHEN JAMES WEBB SPACE TELESCOPE IS LAUNCHED AND WE'RE ABLE TO SEE COSMIC DAWN THAT ESTABLISHES THE UNITED STATES AS THE LEADER OF PHYSICS FOR THE NEXT 30 YEARS, BUT IT GOES BEYOND THAT. SURE, WE WANT TO LEAD, BUT WE ALSO WANT TO DISCOVER. WE HAVE MODELS AND IDEAS ABOUT REALLY WHAT THE UNIVERSE LOOKED LIKE IN THOSE DAYS, BUT WE'RE GOING TO KNOW, AND I CAN TELL YOU THIS. HERE'S WHAT WE ALREADY NOW, THE MODELS -- KNOW, THE MODELS AREN'T RIGHT. SO THIS IS AN EXCITING TIME. THE OTHER THING THAT'S IMPORTANT, WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO LOOK AT OTHER STARS, AND NOT ONLY LOOK AT THOSE STARS BUT LOOK AT OTHER PLANETS AROUND THOSE STARS AND CHARACTERIZE THOSE PLANETS AS TO THEIR HABITABILITY. COULD THOSE PLANETS BE ABLE TO HOST LIFE? AND JAMES WEBB IS GOING TO GIVE US AN OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT THE LIGHT AS IT, YOU KNOW, TRANSFERS THROUGH THAT ATMOSPHERE. CERTAIN PART -- CERTAIN PARTS OF THE SPECTRUM ARE NOT GOING TO MAKE IT THROUGH, AND WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DETERMINE THE ATMOSPHERES OF PLANETS AROUND OTHER STARS AND MAKE ASSESSMENTS TO CHARACTERIZE, IF YOU WILL, THE ATMOSPHERES OF THOSE PLANETS. JAMES WEBB IS GOING TO BE AN AMAZING CAPABLITY FOR THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. AS WE'RE ON ASTROPHYSICS, I ALSO WANT TO MAKE ONE LAST STATEMENT THAT I THINK IS IMPORTANT. WE TALKED ABOUT THE GATEWAY AND HOW IT'S GOING TO GIVE US ACCESS TO THE SURFACE OF THE MOON. WE WANT ROBOTS AND LANDERS AND ROVERS. THE GATEWAY IS NOT JUST ABOUT GETTING TO THE MOON, IT'S NOT ABOUT STUDYING THE MOON FROM THE ORBIT OF THE MOON, IT GIVES US AN OPPORTUNITY TO STUDY DEEP SPACE FROM A HUMAN TENDED SPACE STATION WHICH GIVES US A CAPABILITY HERETOFORE WE'VE NEVER SEEN. ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE MOON, IT'S VERY QUIET. WHY? BECAUSE ALL OF THE ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION WE CREATE, IT'S QUIET ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE MOON, SO WE CAN CREATE THINGS IN THE ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM THAT WE CAN'T CURRENTLY IMAGE DEEP SPACE WITH. WE CAN DO ASTROPHYSICS FROM THE SURFACE OF THE MOON WITH VERY THIN WIRE ANTENNAS. NOW THAT'S MAYBE NOT IN THIS BUDGET REQUEST, BUT THE GATEWAY OPENS THE DOOR TO ALL OF THESE CAPABLITIES IN THE FUTURE. SO IN CLOSING, I WANT EVERYBODY TO KNOW THAT NASA'S BUDGET REQUEST IS VERY GOOD, AND WE HAVE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT , WHICH I HAVE BEEN COMMITTED TO FROM THE BEGINNING FOR NASA, NOT JUST IN THE HOUSE BUT IN THE SENATE, AND WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING WE'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH BEFORE WITH BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR US? I JUST TALKED ABOUT HELIO PHYSICS AND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS -- IF WE'RE GOING TO SEND ASTRONAUTS TO MARS, HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO THE LIVES OF THE ASTRONAUTS? HELIO PHYSICS IS A CRITICAL PIECE OF OUR MOON TO MARS PROGRAM. I WAS IN THE HOTEL THIS MORNING, AND I WAS TALKING TO A LADY THAT HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT THE KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, AND SHE SAID ONE OF THE THINGS THAT ARE MOST STRIKING -- THAT WAS MOST STRIKING TO HER, SHE RAN INTO SOMEBODY AT THE KENNEDY SPACE CENTER AND ASKED HIM WHAT HE DID, AND HE SAID WELL, I'M HELPING US GO TO THE MOON AND ONTO MARS. AND THAT WAS HIS ANSWER. AND SHE SAID OKAY, WHAT DO YOU DO? AND HE SAID I'M A CUSTODIAN. FRIENDS, THESE OBJECTIVES ARE AN ALL OF NASA APPROACH. EVERY SENSOR THAT WE OPERATE IS CRITICAL TO THIS MISSION, CRITICAL TO ACHIEVING THESE GOALS, INCLUDING THE DIRECTORATE. WE TALK ABOUT INFRASTRUCTURE, AND IN SOME CASES, INFRASTRUCTURE OFTEN BECOMES A TARGET. BUT FRIENDS WE CAN'T ACCOMPLISH ANY OF THIS WITHOUT THE INFRASTRUCTURE, AS WELL, SO THE DIRECTORATE IS ALSO A CAPABILITY FOR OUR SHARED ACHIEVEMENT IN HEADING TO THE MOON AND ONTO MARS. SO I JUST WANT TO SHARE ONE LAST THING -- FOR ALL THE PEOPLE WATCHING, I SEE SOME T.V. CAMERAS AND MAYBE SOME SOCIAL MEDIA, I WANT TO ENCOURAGE EVERYBODY TO VISIT NASA.GOV/MOONTOMARS. I WANT YOU TO GO TO THE WEBSITE, AND I WANT YOU TO LEARN. FOR THE NASA EMPLOYEES HERE, I WANT YOU TO LEARN HOW YOU CAN COMMUNICATE ALL OF THESE GREAT THINGS THAT WE ARE TRYING TO ACHIEVE TO THE PUBLIC. ENGAGE ON SOCIAL MEDIA. I WANT YOU TO ENGAGE ON SOCIAL MEDIA. IF YOU HAVE TWITTER OR FACEBOOK OR TALK TO YOUR FRIENDS, MAKE SURE YOU LET THEM KNOW WHAT WE ARE DOING AND WHY BECAUSE THIS IS TRANSFORMATIONAL, AND IT'S ONLY GOING TO HAPPEN IF ALL OF AMERICA BUYS IN. THE OTHER DAY, I WENT TO THE WORLD AG EXPO, AND EVERYBODY WAS LIKE WHY IS THE DIRECTOR OF NASA GOING TO THE WORLD AG EXPO? I'LL TELL YOU WHY. BECAUSE WE NEED EVERYBODY TO KNOW HOW WE CHANGED THE WORLD CONDITION. WHO NEEDS THAT? FARMERS SOMETIMES NEED THAT. WE HAVE AN AGREEMENT WITH THE COOPERATIVE EXTENSION OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA WHERE WE'RE TAKING THAT GREAT INFORMATION AND SHARING IT WITH THEM TO THE POINT WHERE THEY ARE ABLE TO INCREASE CROP YIELDS WHILE REDUCING THEIR WATER USAGE BY 25% -- AND BY THE WAY, IN THE DESERT OF CALIFORNIA, THAT IS A BIG DEAL. AND AT THE SAME TIME BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT WATERING SO MUCH, PRESERVING 50% OF THE NITRATES THAT NORMALLY WOULD HAVE ERODED INTO THE WATER SUPPLY. THOSE HELP THE PLANTS GROW, BUT WHEN THEY'RE IN THE WATER SUPPLY, THEY'RE VERY BAD TO HUMANS AND IT COSTS A LOT OF MONEY TO GET THEM OUT OF THE WATER SUPPLY. SO WE'RE INCREASING YIELDS, AND THEY'RE IN THE SOIL WHERE THEY OUGHT TO BE, AND WE'RE ABLE TO ACHIEVE THIS BECAUSE THE SCIENCE MISSION DIRECTORATE IS PROVIDING THIS TO THE UNIVERSITY OF STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA ON A SMALL SCALE. WE WERE ABLE TO PROVIDE THIS TO UGANDA. THEY WERE ABLE TO USE NASA TECHNOLOGY TO DETECT A DROUGHT THAT WAS ON THE WHO ARE SIGH -- HORIZON. BECAUSE OF THAT, INSTEAD OF SPENDING TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS DOING DISASTER RELIEF, WE SPENT A COUPLE OF MILLION MITIGATING THE DISASTER BEFORE IT HAPPENED, SAVING LIVES, SAVING MONEY. BUT FRIENDS, IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT CROPS, ALTHOUGH CROPS ARE A CRITICAL PIECE. THE WAY WE COMMUNICATE, DISH NETWORK, INTERNET BROAD BAND FROM SPACE, SATELLITE RADIO, COMMUNICATIONS BORN FROM THIS LITTLE AGENCY WE CALL NASA, SPACE-BASED COMMUNICATIONS. WE TALK ABOUT HOW WE NAVIGATE WITH GPS, HOW WE PRODUCE FOOD, ENERGY, GEOCARBON AND OTHER EARTH SCIENCE EMISSIONS, MAKING SURE THAT AS WE PRODUCE ENERGY, WE'RE NOT POLLUTING THE ATMOSPHERE. BY THE WAY, THE ENERGY COMPANIES LOVE THAT BECAUSE THEN, THEY DON'T GET FINED, WHICH IS A GOOD THING. THE WAY WE DO WEATHER PREDICTIONS AND UNDERSTAND THE CLIMATE, THE WAY WE DO DISASTER RELIEF AND NATIONAL SECURITY, THE WAY WE DO BANKING -- ALL OF THE BANKING TRANSACTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ARE DEPENDENT ON A TIMING SIGNAL FROM GPS. THE WAY WE REGULATE FLOWS OF ELECTRICITY ON THE POWER GRID, DEPENDENT ON A TIMING SIGNAL FROM GPS. WHEN WE THINK ABOUT HOW WE HAVE ELEVATED THE HUMAN CONDITION, THIS LITTLE AGENCY THAT CONSTITUTES ONE HALF -- LESS THAN ONE HALF OF ONE PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL BUDGET, THIS LITTLE AGENCY HAS ELEVATED THE HUMAN CONDITION IN WAYS THAT MOST PEOPLE DON'T EVEN KNOW. IT'S ON US TO LET THEM KNOW. IT'S ON US AS THE NASA EMPLOYEES, THE NASA CONTRACTORS, AS WELL, TO LET THEM KNOW NOT JUST FOR THE UNITED STATES BUT FOR THE ENTIRE WORLD. THIS IS AN AMAZING AGENCY, AND I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, I AM OVERWHELMINGLY HUMBLED WHEN I GET UP EVERY DAY AND I HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO INTERACT WITH THE AMAZINGLY TALENTED PEOPLE THAT WORK HERE. KNOW THIS. NASA IS GOING TO GET A HEALTHY BUDGET. THE ADMINISTRATION IS SUPPORTING IT. WE'VE GOT BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IN THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE. WHAT WE'VE GOT TO DO IS MAKE SURE WE COMMUNICATE IT TO THE WORLD. AGAIN, NASA.GOV/MOONTOMARS. THANK YOU SO MUCH. IT'S GREAT BEING HERE AT THE KENNEDY SPACE CENTER. [Applause]
