 [Music] blockchain storage is an emerging technology for decentralized data storage blockchain storage technology is transparent verifiable traceable and tamper-proof in understanding how blockchain storage works helps determine if it's right for your organization first the storage system breaks data into shards or smaller more manageable chunks that can be distributed across nodes then this system encrypts or locks each data shard on the local system to ensure no one can access the data shard except the content owner next the blockchain storage system creates a unique hash an encrypted output string based on the shard's data or encryption keys the hash is added to both the ledger and the shard metadata to link transactions to the stored shards the system then replicates each shard a specified number of times to ensure enough copies to prevent data loss next a peer-to-peer network distributes replicated shards to geographically dispersed storage nodes owned by individuals called farmers but the data is still only accessible to the content owner and finally the storage system records all transaction details like shard location and shard hash in the blockchain ledger and syncs that information across all nodes the exact approach to blockchain storage will vary depending on the storage system use cases and how the data storage is managed you
