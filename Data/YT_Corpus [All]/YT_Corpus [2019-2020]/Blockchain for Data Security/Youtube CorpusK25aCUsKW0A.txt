 along with the movement to an agile mindset and cloud-based solutions technologies such as AI machine learning and our PA provide a host of new opportunities for individuals and businesses alike however these rapidly changing areas of innovation also provide new areas of security risks since security architects are responsible for planning and implementing an organization's security policies keeping your security skills up to date is essential do you want to analyze identify mitigate and prevent the theft of valuable data SkillSoft aspire learning journeys are designed to move people forward within their organizations these intentionally designed courses start by providing potential security analysts who may already be proficient in traditional on-premise security practices with foundational knowledge on the planning and implementation of security measures that combat risks associated with cloud AI and machine learning solutions and skilled security analysts can start working on their forensics analyst skills by diving into different methods of discovery collection and remediation from their forensic analysts move into the vulnerability analyst role that focuses more on continual testing and hardening of all security layers and then eventually aspire to become a security architect who brings together all the insights and knowledge acquired throughout their journey to model system security implement governance policies and create secure infrastructure design and self-healing systems let's take a look at what security analyst - security architecture nee will entail the security analyst track is the first step in the journey towards becoming a security architect most network administrator's will have a clear understanding of how to prevent and mitigate risks associated with traditional threats but they may need to gain hands-on experience in securing against new cyber security threats such as crypto jackin and IOT otherwise their companies could be exposed in vital areas your journey will begin with the key concepts of apt defenses na C's and gateways working with subnetting DNS and protocols you'll also cover hardened security topologies how to perform continual infrastructure testing what security governance is and how to use honey pots and pen testing to protect against hackers forensics analysts are typically focused on discovery and analysis track 2 of your journey focuses on anomaly detection digital forensics ethics and privacy issues and performing risk analysis basic cryptology security software assessments security audits and user security awareness and cloud security implementation are also covered to lay the groundwork for moving on to the next track the third step in becoming a security architect is the vulnerability analyst role which deals with applying security concepts to continue the hardening of security in all layers they are actively involved in penetration vulnerability testing and intrusion detection and prevention in the enterprise the training in this track progresses towards the final role of security architect by covering authentication authorization and encryption solutions how to implement secure coding practices tracking incidents and developing security topologies and architectures the fourth and last step to becoming a security architect will bring together key learnings acquired throughout your journey security architects at this stage can take their understanding of security and deepen it by becoming well-versed in the rules of engagement the benefits of ethical hacking intelligent orchestration and regulatory mandates the track completes the training by focusing on creating a notification process implementing automated triage building a unified playbook and performing post attack reviews so where will your journey take you all of our aspire journeys for technology and developer are created based on a proven approach to learning design which takes advantage of multimodal learning tools from videos to books learners have access to a multitude of resources that will orient them to key work functions and daily challenges learners can also apply security concepts and test hardened security measures with hands-on practice labs done virtually using real equipment and applications so that each learner can practice and develop their skills without compromising their own company systems at the end of each track within a journey users must demonstrate their newfound knowledge by passing a rigorous final exam once a journey is fully completed learners can continue their growth and move on to another area of study security architects can move on to the penetration tester to SEC ops engineer or network security specialist to cloud up security architect journeys at their own pace enabling employees to continually learn evolve and develop their skills you
