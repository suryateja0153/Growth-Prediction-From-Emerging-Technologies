 there are now over 6 000 different cryptocurrencies across which luca has mapped more than 27 000 different trading pairs how do you make sense of all that data what is a unique identifier or a view op can blotching data save money on taxes robert matarazzi co-ceo of luca presents his keynote speech on the importance of blockchain data from the cointelegraph crypto traders live event here's what you missed i'm the co-ceo at luca and we're going to overview today um a couple of the challenges that we're we're helping our customers solve specific around data challenges for post-trade operations uh just a little bit about us so we are um a data company and we are focused on blockchain and tokenized asset data and cleaning it up to help support normal typical business operations so we collect data from all the various exchanges or trading venues that people are used to receiving um you know often it's privately held data and not off of an actual blockchain although we do we do accommodate actual blockchain data as well and we we pull it in we normalize all the data so that if kraken uh you know uses xbt to represent bitcoin and and coinbase uses btc um and now you multiply that times the thousands of assets and all the different sources that are out there we have data products that help to clean all that up so that when our customers which are a lot of the big exchanges and institutions that are that are serving this industry um are solving their um their financial requirements um we we cater to those needs and help them close their books if their funds strike nav um pass audits and do all of the other post-trade operations that businesses require and uh so we have a suite of products i'll just touch on this really quickly um we have our luca crypto office product which is really our our main enterprise institutional software it's very feature-rich um it collects all the data and that's the one that that a uh that we offer to a lot of the the businesses that are out there um and then we have two pro referenced or rather two data products that we created to support the software the first is leuco reference data and the second is luca prime and those are the the two topics that we'll cover in in today's presentation um and then additionally we have some tax specific products that are catering to 1040 filing our luca tax diy which is a retail similar to a you know a turbo tax except for your crypto side of things um and then we have luke attacks for professionals which were partnered with cpa.com um which is for tax professionals that are servicing their clients and then we have a thought leadership subscription that talks a lot of the the unique intricacies and uh such as tax treatments but but it's a lot more comprehensive than that so um accounting data challenges and a lot of the other things and it's a content-based subscription so those are some of our retail products at the bottom uh today's focus though we thought most relevant we wanted to cover our our reference data and luca prime products um and the importance of the uh of the challenges that they're solving um and so the the first one you know why is reference data needed and for those of you that aren't familiar i you know i mentioned this a little bit but um there's thousands of crypto assets as everyone are aware um some a lot more common than others um these are offered on various different exchanges or otc desks or other businesses that are offering them to to all the the traders that are out there but all those exchanges those exchanges or trading venues get to pick their own their own tickers and their own ticker symbols so um that creates a lot of complexity when you're combining this particularly when individuals in order to to acquire some uh smaller coin um might need to purchase bitcoin on a large exchange like coinbase that they bought for us dollars transfer it to somewhere like finance to trade for some other coins and then do the reverse all the way back you know to turn it out to cash and when you when you multiply that times all these different exchanges all the different assets it creates a lot of complexities when people are trying to do things that should be very simple like pay their taxes or what a lot of the businesses are accommodating um in financial statements and passing their audits um and today there are no unique identifiers um that are specific across the board so there's no standard setters that are driving this currently um you know there's there's exchanges obviously all over the world that people have access to and so all of these unique challenges really forced us to create a data product so that we could make our software work and uh and that's when reference data was was created we were our first customer at first um and now it's it's very popular among a lot of the large institutions and so um so our reference data is the golden standard of digital asset data so we create this this master listing of tickers um and and really it has so we have over 80 entities so an example of an entity would be coinbase a second one would be kraken and entity could also be a pricing source like coin market cap um and uh we've mapped um over 26 000 assets that create the 5 000 plus unique assets across all those exchanges um over you know over 10 000 unique trading pairs um we have uh additionally we've recently added over 27 000 derivative ticker symbols um to our reference data as well to to accommodate that um and then we can uh so we incorporate this into our software um but also institutions or businesses can uh can license it to us as a direct data feed through something like an api or flat files or all depending on their requirements um and if we uh here's an example of some of the tickers that are that are out there so we create a unique id for each of those assets and then in the background we're mapping it to all those various exchanges so that from the customer's perspective they're just using a single ticker for each one of their assets and they know bitcoin is bitcoin and this is incredibly important when creating tax lots particularly with higher volumes of activities where where you can take advantage of tax strategies by matching your acquisitions potentially that you're trading or acquiring on various exchanges the next product is uh is our luca pricing product um so this one is when you say pricing we mean for for valuation purposes so when you have a a crypto crypto trade so you know bitcoin for ether and often you're charged a a fee that's also in a cryptocurrency it creates some some unique situations where for tax or compliance or financial reporting purposes we need to determine your cost basis or proceeds so the value of that transaction at that point in time so that we can do normal tax or financial calculations and what we uh so what we do is we will bring in a pricing source um uh you know it's very often that services will provide pricing sources such as vwops or average prices but for tax compliance purposes that's that's not considered a best practice and if you're a business and you're complying with uh with gaap or ifrs if you're overseas um it uh explicitly says that you should uh utilize actual executed exchange prices and avoid things like vwops or averages so those are usually for the pre the pre-trade side of things um and so what uh what we have done is we've created luca prime and a number of other pricing products to create flexibility for these businesses so they can select from a menu of different pricing sources they can bring in a v-top v-wap if it's appropriate for what they need um we also have a luca prime product luca prime uses a unique methodology that's designed to be aligned to gaap and ifrs guidelines and what it does is using a bunch of qualitative and quantitative factors it selects a actual executed exchange price based on those factors so for every point in time you're using an actual exchange in price so it's selecting one of them from many exchanges that are out there um and that supports all these tax or audit uh audit use cases um we also do custom pricing so we can create an average based on you know parameters if a customer needs it um or we can feed in third-party pricing data on a case-by-case as well just to create uh flexibility um so that's the end of the the presentation um happy to to answer any questions or dive into anything great um we have we have an immediate question from roger brown who asks why is the luca pricing product superior to those offered by a view op sure and you know and i and i wouldn't uh i wouldn't necessarily use the word superior to be to be tactful i would say that it's more appropriate for audit and tax um use cases so specifically if you're post-trade and you're a financial controller and you're going through your first audit as a business and you need to value your your assets for you know books and record keeping purposes using an executed exchange price aligns to accounting standards in short it's also you know not formal guidance but in the faqs the irs is is stating that you should utilize executed exchange prices um that can be very challenging to do um particularly when you're trading across a bunch of different exchanges and so these are satisfying all of those requirements where the v waps are very logical for other use cases you know in in in market data and other uh pre-trade pre-trade operations so it's just two very different separate uses which one both thanks uh thanks robert i also have a question from my side since you are dealing with taxations i was wondering uh are your customers all u.s companies or also companies based in other countries other jurisdictions no we absolutely do service globally i'd say um we're us-based so we've we have you know the majority of our customers are us-based but we absolutely have have many uh customers overseas um and are happy to work with them um this pricing product for example we did design to accommodate ifrs which is an international accounting standard opposed to u.s gaap so we absolutely cater to uh to companies overseas great we've got another question from the audience this one is coming from wook chewie who asks there are not many trustworthy data oracles which are widely accepted at this time how do you plan to keep the competitive advantage sure i mean i guess with with any business you know competition is usually good for the industry so you know i'd say any anyone that's that's operating a business should encourage that um it helps the the consumers it helps the the customers that are out there um we've we've uh have i'd say for our own competitive advantage um we have a special emphasis in catering to what our customers are asking for and that's part of our culture and so i'd say that you know that keeps our customers happy which keeps our business uh profitable thanks we also have another question uh what kind of target market does luca have target market sure so i'm all all businesses that have financial transactions in in digital assets so anyone that's trying to solve those pricing you know pricing and reference data are only two of the challenges but ultimately managing all of that data for post-trade operations is is very challenging can be very costly so our goal is to reduce those costs for businesses that are out there great uh we've got another question from robert roger brown as well he says does or will luca uh support thinly traded crypto assets yeah that's that's a great question so our look look at prime today covers the the more more liquid assets that have that have higher volume um and we're absolutely um uh in the process of rolling out it's not it's not available yet but it will be very soon within within months um we will be adding a number of assets to our pricing data in order to accommodate the more thinly traded um assets that are out there um and we'll have white papers and thought leadership and our and would love to discuss that with anyone that would that would like to reach out to us yeah so i think um it's a great time to wrap up yeah um thank you so much for that presentation i hope uh you guys out there listening to this learned a lot about luca and their their their products and thanks for sharing your presentation with us yeah thanks for having me coin telegraph like subscribe and hodl [Music] you
