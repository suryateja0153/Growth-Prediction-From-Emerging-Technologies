 hi my name is Sonny Agarwal and I'm a one of the researchers here at tender mint and I've been working on the cosmos project for about the last two years so cosmos is this very new design for how the blockchain ecosystem should work we essentially looked at the construction of the blocks and ecosystem and how it changed over time kind of from this generation one of the coin to generation two of aetherium and you know systems like a theory I'm like us Tasos whatnot and you know I think both of these two generations had very interesting ideas and they kind of had some drawback to each other and so this cosmos idea is trying to take some of the good aspects from generation one and some of the things of generation 2 and kind of combine them to make a even better generation 3 that that maintains a lot of the you know sovereignty that we had in generation 1 while some of the much more customizability that we had in generation 2 in that generation 1 we had all of these independent block chains that kind of all had their own use cases so you know bitcoin was there for money payments sia was there for storage namecoin was there for dns but you know there was no composability or connectivity between these I couldn't use my Bitcoin to buy a name coin DNS and store and have it point to a sia storage block pile and this where aetherium came along aetherium came along and basically said hey what you can do is put everything on this one blockchain and then have all these applications be able to interoperate with each other you know on aetherium i can go take my maker die and trade it for a crypto kitty on 0x that is something that just wasn't you know this composability of creating a larger user stories using these different applications this wasn't possible in generation 1 but generation 2 came at some drawbacks as well you know the etherium blocks in by putting everything like single threaded pipe you know it led into a lot of scalability concerns both from the technical side and the social side technical scalability through like you know all these applications are trying to shove their throughput down this small pipe and you know you might have a very important financial application and then the next clipper cadiz comes along and it's just like you know it just floods the entire blockchain and then from the social scalability side of things you know I think that you know I have this terminology that I usually like to use it I call it the etherium Empire where you know if the world of Bitcoin you know the Bitcoin sovereign chain like generation 1 was like small kingdoms cerium said ok you know let's create an empire let's try to put all these things under control and you know empires come with some benefits you know it's much more economic integration which is what that composability of etherium gives you but the high level of political integration leads of empires leads to you know issues right like it's just such a sew-in empires there's so many groups with divergent interest and you can't really you know you at the end of the day on almost every Empire you have an emperor or some aristocracy you know some controlling group and you see you know you see this happening in the governance debates in aetherium today and I think a lot of them come down to the fact that you know there's too many groups with divergent interests all trying to agree on one thing you look at the etherium improvement proposal repo on github and there's like hundreds of improvement proposals that are often contradictory with each other right like some people want state rent some people don't some people want X some people don't like you know and it's almost impossible for the entire aetherium community which is so big and diverse to agree on you know a common path now this is where the sovereign blocks change so you know if if a theorem is an empire cosmos is a world of nation-states where essentially what we're trying to do is maintain that economic connectivity that we have you know in today's world we essentially have wide scale economic integration while still having smaller political entities and that's kind of what cosmos is trying to do the different communities for different applications and you know different projects and communities like even if it's a like geographical base like we want to give them the sovereignty and the ability to control their own governance and like you know iterate faster than they could while being part of this larger Empire so hubs are sort of you know there's nothing really spent inherently special about hubs in the cosmos ecosystem they're all just chains and they use IBC to sort of connect to each other where the differentiation between and so in cosmos we really believe in this idea of application-specific blockchain is like you know like I said we want in that world of nation-states we want long chains to be specialized and hubs are sort of block chains that are specialized in connectivity where if you look at any large system that requires connectivity you it always kind of falls into a hub and spork hub and spoke architecture you look at airports right there's hub airports that handle most of the traffic you look at the internet you know any router can connect it any router but in reality you have some ISPs that provide you with that connectivity Dr Hubbs really do that you know your your application-specific chain instead of having to have like thousands of IBC connections to every other chain and also run your application what you can the hub will take on the task of like Oh will maintain thousands of IBC connections to all these different chains and then you know you're watching only eyes connect to this one hub that will provide you with that connectivity and then hubs will also over time provide additional features such as you know you know ISPs they provide Internet connectivity but at the same time they often thrive stuff like hosting or DNS and like some security stuff and so you know I think that's what the hub's will do as well like the one that we're I'm you know I spend most of my time right now thinking about is this that concept of shared security how look you know let's say you have a chain that doesn't want to secure itself necessary you don't want to go find your own miners or your own validators or something you can basically ask the hub like hey can you secure my train for mian and that way you know I like to overanalyze everything too like history and so and this were and not in that model the hub kind of acts as like you know NATO or something right it's a bunch of like sovereign nation states that are pooling their security together in order to provide higher security to any individual zone so there's a lot of ways you can think about the role of the hubs in the ecosystem you know in the cosmos ecosystem we have two hubs at the beginning we have one called the cosmos hub and there's one called the iris hub the iris hub is you know that we want that we expect some level of specialization between hubs and so the for example the iris hub is really taking you know a little bit more maybe of an enterprise II focus and definitely much more focused on the Chinese market while the Cosmo huh consoles hobbits you know maybe we can call it a little bit more cypherpunk if you want and so the cosmos hub is you know the chain that you know the company I work with tender mint that's the one that we are most actively involved with and we you know we vote the lot of the software for this chain and then it was launched by the interchange foundation which is you know why we're at this event today called the inter chain on conversations and the cosmos hub is basically a distributed chain that you know it's sort of a testing ground for a lot of these ideas that we believe in like we're using it to test proof of stake tenorman BFT consensus we're gonna be adding ibc very soon and then there's a number of zones in the cosmos ecosystem that are being developed using the tooling that we've created called the cosmos SDK and they're building zones that will intend connect to the hub very soon and once IBC is available and ready and so you know some of their zones include things you know the like the finance decks the rich is like a decentralized exchange we have the line own network which is sort of a decentralized video streaming system we have true story which is sort of a you know it's a it's a kind of like that cost I'll call it cross between a TCR and a prediction market we have stuff like the region Network which is trying to like you know incentivization for maintenance of land resources so there's an you know one of the nice things that the cause that we did was but like I said aetherium provided that composability between applications but he actually did one other very important thing which is it made it easy to develop applications so you know if you ever want in generation one if you wanted to make your own application really what you would do is you'd go take the Bitcoin core code base and fork it and kind of modify it and that was this like very spaghetti code C++ thing especially back then and that's why I like you know look at applications like namecoin they're not very well designed because they're trying to use a code base that wasn't designed for it a theory arm when it came up with solidity made it easy for these applications to be built and why we saw a widespread of many new applications what we've done is we've made it we've created this tool called the cosmos SDK which also makes all that cannon go and you can write your own application specific blockchain in go and you know it'll have an IBC module in it that you can use if you're using the cosmos SDK you can easily connect to the entire cosmos ecosystem because it already has a built-in IBC module in the cosmos ecosystem atoms are the stinking token of the cosmos hub so you know the Clongowes hub is just a single hub in the ecosystem and it is thus taking Toby we you know we really believe that like you know in this world of many blockchains you're going to have most of them be proof of stake blockchains like you know it's just it's fundamentally insecure to have multiple proof-of-work chains at least you know ones that you know share the same similar hashing algorithms and so for this reason you know we kind of really believe in this idea that you know there's some debate within the team we're like okay is there going to be zero proof of work Rock chains or is there gonna be one proof of work but you know the real general consensus that there's not going to be more than one peripheral worth watching and so these proof of State block chains are kind of you know how we create the security system for the cosmos hub and you know you know we generally believe that mistake has way more security and like then proof for because you have the in the protocol has access to much more fine-grained control over incentives and punishments and so we can you know in our opinion this actually helps increase the security of these block chains and so the atoms right that are act as this stinking token for the cosmos up and we actually wrote this interesting paper you know we have this philosophy called the atoms are not money it's this new type of asset in the ecosystem called a staking token what a staking token is you know it's not money because we purposefully made it pretty hyper inflationary what we want is people to take their atoms and make sure they stake them and what they what that does is it'll earn them these transaction fees that are being paid on the cosmos hub as well as all the other chains that are doing shared security with the cosmos hub and these transaction fees can kind of be paid in any other token you want whether it's Bitcoin or ether or Die and so really you know we're not like trying to make a pitch thing here right like we the atoms are sort of a way for people to you know it's a it's kind of like an ASIC that's that's the best knowledge in our opinion it's a piece of capital that you need just like a six or a piece of capital you need in order to be able to mine on Bitcoin atoms are a piece of capital that you need in order to be able to stink on the cosmos hub and earn those transaction fees you know there's definitely gonna be way more cryptocurrencies within the cosmos ecosystem you know for one there'll be many more stinking tokens a lot of the chains that are launching the using like their token as a stinking token so you know the region network has a token that they're using cava lie no true story they're all using these tokens as big tokens at some sort of you know work tokens as well and so we're gonna see definitely a you know an explosion of staking tokens and we'll also hopefully see you know many more types of tokens we have a lot of stable coins in the cosmos ecosystem there's a project called Terra which is you know building a stable coin using a new mechanism that they've created there's a project called Kaba which is creating they basically taken the multi collateral dye construction that the maker team came up with and they're basically implemented it on a cosmos sdk chain and so you know we're definitely gonna see a lot of stable coins arising we might see more you know just because the atoms aren't money that doesn't mean that the cosmos community might not decide to launch a token that tries to be money and so there's been a lot of talk around this concept called a photons idea where so I can you know maybe just cuz atoms weren't money the cosmos community might say okay let's launch a new token and they go this token is to make a play at money and so it kind of you know it's really up to the community how they want to play this and like you know really what the goal here was cosmos it's meant to like facilitate experimentation we want to reduce the barrier of experimentation as possible a lot of the Kosmos team really got into it because we're really fascinated with the idea of local currencies like currencies that are designed more for smaller communities and stuff so we're honestly yeah we're looking forward to see this new explosion in experimentation cosmos is this larger vision of you know everything I've talked about this many application-specific boxes and all interoperate with each other the tendrán team we basically kind of saw that in order to make this vision a reality we first need three tools three primary tools and there's other tools I think might will come later but you know the first three pillars are kind of the cosmos ecosystem is built on is tender mint BFT the cosmos SDK and IBC and so IBC is that a sidechain protocol that we talked about that allows you to move asset between different chains and move data and whatnot the cosmas SDK like we mentioned is the tooling in order to make you know your own application specific blockchain and then ten durman is a you know proof of stake has been a lot around for a while it was you know proposed I think about as far back as 2012 but you know in a world of proof of stake you really don't want to be using the Nakamoto consensus that was kind of you know usually proposed by Satoshi / for Bitcoin in previous you know what we want to do is we want to go to you Jake Wan basically looked at some of the old consensus papers from like you know the 90s and stuff like pbft and whatnot and he basically realized that we can adapt them and modify them to make them more usable for a blockchain contacts and that's where tendonman came along it's basically you know an upgrade of pbft but that's designed you know for working over a peer-to-peer gossip network it allows you to change the proposer every single block it has you know Byzantine fault accountability that if someone does something malicious you know exactly who did it and you can punish them which is what we want to do in proof of stake and so all of these ideas are kind of like the benefit to gives you over Nakamoto consensus is these things like fast finality write it in intend tender making there's no more thinking about oh how many confirmations does this block have is it gonna get reverted or not it allows you to run your chain at much faster speeds and so you know it just it's just sort of one of these three pillars that is required to make this cosmos ecosystem really work and so that and the sparse finality is actually really important because when we're doing this entertain communication in cosmos we want we need before we can send assets and you know to IDC packets between chains we need to make sure they're finalized on their each individual chain and so if you were trying to do IBC from like you know Bitcoin something else you know we have to wait for the finality or finally your Bitcoin which will take an hour right and so imagine that like you know we already have a pretty poor user experience when like dealing with Nakamoto consensus you make a payment you have to wait an hour for it to be like you know confirmed now you have to like you know make a payment and then they every time you want to move it to a different chain you got it you also got to wait for these like you know acts and everything and you know it just heavily degrades the user experience and will become pretty much unusable if we can't have these fast finality chains like the based on tournament and other BFD protocols and so that's why we really see tender monastic one of the three pillars of the cosmos ecosystem when when a new zone is created on cosmos it has the option of you know basically zones are can come up with their security mechanism however they'd like some chains might choose to do proof of stake and so for that they might want to launch their own token or distribute their own token somehow and use that as a proof of stake mechanism alternatively they could also you know kind of stuff I was talking about cosmic hub shared security is that like they can come ask the cosmos hub and say oh can you validate our chain for us and like you know we'll provide you these incentives to do so or you can even have some sort of hybrids in fact you know you don't even even if you wanted to have your own sovereign security you can even do a proof of work like system and have your chain be secured with that but still be part of the vehicles most own I I have actually written a module that allows you to use proof of work with ten Derman BFT for the fast finality and so you know if a chain wants to do that they're completely able to do that and so really what cosmos the best part about cosmos is it really just allows this experimentation and zones and communities can figure out what design is best for their use case and so whether that involves launching their own token or not that's kind of up to their projects to integrate into the cosmos ecosystem there you you do not need to be built using the cosmos SDK we're currently designing IBC to be a very well abstracted protocol that can be implemented really hopefully in almost any blocks and framework so you know like I said it's nice to use the console SDK because there will be a ready built IBC module that's easy to plug into but you know we want to make sure I BC is available on for example parity substrate or you know I only V we've or you know some etherium based chains and so we want these different chains to all you know kind of be able to integrate IBC and now so the question for chains are you know already launched how do they integrate with IBC yeah so most of these chains are going to essentially have to upgrade their code and natively support this IBC protocol and so you know we're working with a lot of the team for example we're working with some of the earth 2.0 implementers to kind of work to see how we can get aetherium 2.0 to may be natively integrate IBC and then you know when it comes to some change that you know that will never ever change like Bitcoin right like there's no chance in the world that we're gonna get them to implement IBC I'm pleased for the next 50 years right so for them what we have to do if you have to create these things called pegs zones which sort of like we gotta like retro actively hack IBC into it where you know it's not quite the IBC protocol but the the validator set of one chain for example the cosmos hub basically set you know kind of maintains a multi sing on on Bitcoin and they kind of act as a distributed decentralized custodian and so that's kind of how we and so you know we plan to build peg zones for like high value chains that like you know it would the cosmos ecosystem would just be suboptimal if it we didn't integrate with them and so you know our team is you know we worked heavily on an etherium peg zone and that's what we've been focusing on there's a team in the cotton ecosystem called Nam ik they've been heavily focused on building a Bitcoin peg zone and then there's a team called cava who is mentioned they were working on a stable coin and they've also been working heavily on building a peg zone to XRP and so you know these are just like you know for now we have peg zones or like you know the pop3 crypto assets by market cap and I think over time like you know we hopefully will you know maybe start to write PEG zones to you know other really high value stuff but you know for the most part we really do want people to try to implement IBC whenever possible honestly I can't even remember all the projects that are building on it at this point you know some of the I guess probably the most well-known one is the by Nance Dex and that's kind of the one that you know everyone knows I mean the B&B token is you know in the top 10 by market cap but then there's a also a number of many great projects being built we have a true story which is like a TCR prediction market combo kind of thing we have Sentinel who's building this very interesting decentralized VPN lino network which is building a sort of video streaming tip system region network which is creating like you know incentives for proper maintenance of land resources like you know all these stable coin projects that I've mentioned like cava and Terra and whatnot yeah I mean honestly I kind of Honeywell honestly lost track like you know if you go on the cosmos stock Network slash ecosystem we have there's a list of some of you know a list of a couple of projects who are building on it and you know are pretty far along and have like you know a you know maybe are like closer to launch and then there's a there's also community managed list that contains like hundreds of projects that are experimenting with the cosmos SDK and building stuff one of the main premises of Cosmos all of the blocks and ecosystem is I really think it is it you know it's it's built around the concept of exit and so you want to be able to eggs you know Bitcoin or cement a way of exiting the existing financial ecosystem and so we want to make sure that people and more zones more so have options when they're choosing which hubs to connect to and travel it is peace right you don't only have one ISP there's many ISPs that you can choose from and that you know the competition is good because it helps them you know not you know they can't price cows or in the same way you know the Kosmos hub you know they know that they can't do something malicious in order to negatively affect the zones because the zones will probably just like you know stop using the cosmos hub and they'll try to switch to using a different hub and so this is kind of what you know the purpose of these different hubs is and like the specialization also helps as well because like you know at some point a single hub is also gonna hit some scalability bottlenecks as well and so the this is why the iris hub is really cool because you know if it's a hub it's really focused on the China market and so you know because you know you know there's this notion of locality right where like and in any system you know even in today you know we're here in Berlin right now the I bet majority of financial transactions done by people in Berlin are to other people in Berlin and so if we can in any entertain system whether it's cosmos or theorem charting the bottleneck is always the amount of cross chain communication and so if we could try to localize say that oh look all of these zones are talking to each other but really focus on like Chinese businesses and stuff and they're going through the iris hub instead of trying to push it through the congos hub this will help the scalability of both the ecosystems and so you know I think you know if you look at any like competitive ecosystem we want these different systems that can do like you know competition that helps the consumers and specialization to provide interesting features to these users I mean I think the main takeaway to look at cosmos is I really think it's like a revolution in the gut or you know revolution in the governance of how blockchain systems in the Bitcoin Genesis block Satoshi put the headline from The Times of that day which was you know Chancellor on on on brink of béla second bailout for banks and you know one of the things it did was a timestamp the launch but it also kind of like kind of pushed this like thing like oh look this is the state of the financial system in the world and this is like except that it set the tone for the oh this is what bitcoin is trying to do in the Genesis block of the cosmos hub my validator in our in our Genesis transaction we put the headline from The Times of London of that day which was must delay brexit vote MPs warned May and so to me like I was so happy when I saw the headline that they I'm like oh this is so perfect because it's like what what bitcoin did for finance I really think cosmos is trying to do for governance it's like a revolution in how governance and communities and you know incentives form in the Boston ecosystem and will hopefully lead to a much more a larger explosion of new experimentation especially around governance hopefully [Music] you
