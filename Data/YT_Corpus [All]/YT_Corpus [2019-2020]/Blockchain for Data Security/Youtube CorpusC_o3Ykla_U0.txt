 video virtualization can actually be used to apply blotching technology to video for the first time the issue with video and audio and even pictures all these large digital assets is that they're not conducive to being stored inside of the blockchain they're just really too big we virtualized the video then we take video down to a fraction of a single percent of its size in terms of that virtual video file which allows us to embed the video directly in the blockchain piracy is a huge deal in the broadcast and TV world today in the cinema world by putting control of the asset inside of the blockchain you dramatically reduce it not outright remove that piracy capability but beyond that we introduce whole new monetization mechanisms that just aren't possible with today's distribution world you can start doing things like directly incent subscribers to share your videos and and really make things go viral and compensate people for doing that you have better analytics and insight into who's watching your videos where when when they stop they share them things that you just can't do when you're distributing through other channels the way you would today traditionally this is going to transform the entire world of content producers and distributors and in particular we think is going to have a huge impact on the media and entertainment industry
