 Hello everyone. Welcome to the Blockchain beyond the hype session. My name is Saffi Ali I am a cloud solution architect at Microsoft and I'm also the blockchain champion within the custom success unit at Microsoft UK And in today's session, I'm gonna be covering three main aspects of blockchain So the first session is what is blockchain. Why would you need to use blockchain? What are the main use cases for blockchain? And then I would be talking about some of the main use cases that actually blockchain was a major Enabler. lastly I'll be talking about what are the current? Offering that we have in the Azure platform that would make your life easier when it comes to developing maintaining blockchain applications, and and one of the main aspects that I will be talking about how to integrate your blockchain application with the old legacy Line of business applications and solutions. So let's get started. I'm going to be starting to talk about one of the you know, why would you need to use blockchain in the first place? because we tend to miss is It's basically when you look at blockchain, why would you need to use blockchain in the first place? Right? -- Before talking about what is Blockchain. We need to think about how we establish trust and How businesses used to establish trust So basically Trust is a paramount for every business big and small when you look at the normal supply chain around something when you look at the Property market when you look at normal trade finance thrust is an important aspect of it and you can't Do really.. Do a good business without establish trust between parties, but actually there are you know When we are talking about trust we rely heavily and those businesses rely heavily on some sort of intermediaries, so and one of them is You know to enable that kind of trustee you have to rely on intermedius to provide this manual verification methods That would you know make sure that all of the paperwork comes from partner to partner be are quite correct and quite a right So when you look at opening a bank account actually And I'm talking about the normal You know the things that we used to do in the last twenty five years when you go to open the bank accounts you have to Some sort of an identity document that you have to provide to the bank You have some utility bill is etcetera etcetera and actually the bank either have some sort of Verification systems in place or they are relying on a third party and most likely they are lying or third parties To provide that kind of verification before they will open the account So what we are trying to achieve with blockchain is basically move from this Friction by design way of establish trust to the blockchain world where we Either eliminate Intermedia is completely all we can make the actual Intend business processes more efficient because we can get them come together into a single Source of truth and I will be talking about in then in more detail the next slide so blockchain basically streamlines this idea of business processes by doing an important things so protein revolutionize the establishment of trust by acting as a secure shared source of truth that exists between all of these course party organizations, so they all come to Come together to have this single server throughs and basically a blockchain Does this by storing a record of every transaction on a ledger? So basically it's like a database is like a table But the the main differentiator between that is it's unlike in a typical spreadsheet or a database every one of the blockchain Network has their own identical copy of the ledger and if someone Wants you update. The record is what before any transaction is added altered or deleted Member must agree to the change and this this idea of the immutability makes it theoretically impossible To to fraudulently Alter data since all changes must be approved by network consensus so just keep this idea in mind is that nothing in the blockchain can be changed without the Fundamental agreement between all of these partners the way they come together to agree is by consensus Algorithm and there are a few different consensus algorithms that we Now update the depends on the blockchain implementation or the popteen legit that you're using When were that? This is a private or whether this is a public insertion we there are there are few differences, but the fundamental idea is nothing changed in the blockchain without the visibility of everybody and It's that that's where blockchain is quite different than any type of a database or a ledger technology So just just to reiterate on day on the immutability so this immutability is particularly crucial when addressing multiple specific enterprise business needs so When you are talking about trust this is really important because the first need is when a business process Crosses trust boundaries so, you know with a distrust boundary within an enterprise Internally in turn produces or whether this is a cross party or a cross organization business processes It means that multiple groups with potential conflicting interest Whether company's customers or even internal documents must work together to exchange assets of information So such processes are often critical to businesses But it would be naive to think that they can take place without the first without first addressing a sense of trust between all of these parties AB the second use case and the the second use case for this kind of business processes that can be used in improv chain is we are talking about multi-party walk of the same data, so One other thing that blockchain can can help with is you have to have a single sort of truth But at the same time you need to agree with everybody that this is a single source of truth Because you know normally what we when we have this cross organization workflows or presence policies. Usually everybody has their own Copy of the data and you know the actual synchronization between them You know, it's not necessarily runs at the same time. They could be a lag. It's not really a real time So that's where protein can can can have this solution out of the books They set up the third aspect is intermediate and I will really touch upon that is that Normally intermediate is controlled the single source of truth You have to go to the intermediate and ask them about the information probably will pay them fees to be able to use their Tools API services, etc. So as we have already discussed intermediates introduced kind of friction by design and Relax, when you even do a communication invalidation between parties the last one the last use case is The last Enterprise need the protein can help them with is You know when we are talking about Equal value when we are replacing this slow inefficient manual purification steps that we already talked about the earlier The the important message here is to mention the important thing that I have to mention here is blockchain is not for everybody is not for Every business and improve organization. It's it's really to solve a specific trust issue as part of any solution and that can be achieved by other solution, but Pretty much blockchain distinguish itself because it takes a lot of the boxes in Contrary is not for everything that unity, you know, Allah use cases that when we go to talk to customers sometimes it could be implemented with just normal hashing and stuff and That could work well because they don't have really problem when it comes to trust at all Just these some of some of the people especially around the media, you know keep mentioning blockchain and proc since it looks like a stamp in everything right now, but Having said that plot chain has a very useful and a revolution blockchain app business application across industries so from manufacturing to health so when you look at manufacturing This is one of the biggest use cases. I will be talk one of them and when we were talking about real-time tracking for assets Some some people, you know sometimes it's called asset tracking and sometimes it's It is called Provenance tracking depends which type of goods and services they were talking about There are a few interesting use case when it comes to if it comes to banking in capital market the same thing for government We have a very interesting use case when it comes to distributed identities I did which is called dense how to issue these kind of disputed islands that are verifiable so blockchain really has a lot of use cases despite the fact what I've said in the previous slide, it's all very tactical and Business needs but at the same time having said that there are a lot of use cases that you can the clock chain actually can solve and revolutionize whether this is from asset rep as a Transparent province to hi assurance audit and this is all across the board Before talking about a specific use case So and I would be talking about three main use cases as part of this session But really I wanted to kind of touch upon with in agile. We have a pretty Important very rich ecosystem when it comes to partners and customer your system. You have a lot of customers actually building production application or have built production application right now and You know, we have a lot of you know vertical reading Partner ecosystem and you know some of them have very experienced in in the capital market and insurance and Then and marketing and all of that So we have a very good ecosystem when it comes to the partners and customers ecosystem in Israel So let's crack in and discuss one of these use cases. So basically the first use case is given the Circumstances that we are living in right now Dealing with Cove in nineteen. I wanted to start by one of the use cases that 3m have started in 2017 with Microsoft So in 2017 3m if you don't know 3 m 3m is is well known for pharmaceutical products and and Manufacturing big manufacturing companies so but this is specific use cases was dealing with So in 2030, let's discuss the story in 2017 and 3 m 3m corporate research system lab they began to explore how to add value for Their customers through digital services and safeguard against tampering in its own supply chain Scrambling with medicine. It's just a just a huge You know alone with with you know, we concentrate much I can reiterate much that the fact that tampering those type of products is is really life-threatening in the first place, but also it has a good You know a big implication which comes to cost and reputation at the same time So 3m tends to use blockchain on edge or to explore adding a shared data layer among all parties involved into the in the supply chain so the company created a new solution concept which uses plot T known as your they are using few databases for students and One of the good feedback that I have to say about this is using you know this plug chain Has enabled them to have this high visibility about the supply chain in ten across multiple participant at the same time they started with good amount of participant in the first launch and Basically in the new solution concept so members of the blockchain Federated supply chain group will be able to see each step in the supply chain. So what happened and Who was responsible for the product? So every time a product changes hands the party receive receiving it would scan and activate the label So this this project is called label as a service And actually that would provide all of the participants to have this high visibility about the each products along the way and with blockchain service Model and the relatively low cost label compared to electronic based solution So the label solution concept could save 3m customer money And if you need to know more information about this use cases you can go today the as your case study website And it actually indicates and has a the details and some of the use cases already had their architecture design there But basically as you can see here from the manufacturing today actually reaching the retail store Everything is stored in the ledger. So so basically as someone who buys a bottle Can scan a QR code and understand the journey throughout the supply chain because basically what the QR code would go to the website and try to You know first provide the authenticity whether this product is authentic or not And the second thing is it will provide assurances for different personas within the supply chain Like who was responsible for this particular product? What are they? You know whether I am eligible to receive that medicine or not who received it in the first place who produced it who carry it from the Manufacturing site to the razor install all of this information is stored is in an immutable shareable Datastore, which is division The second use case that I'm going to be talking about is The secure marine insurance platform that has been built by an effort between EUI mask and Microsoft and guard time so it's a It's an important. It's one of the one of its kind The to build a security measure marine insurance platform. Let's talk about the problem here so think about what if If you want to get an insurance code for your car that would involve coordinating with not only your insurance company, but your Borough or a state department, you know the bottom of Transport Police Station State sometimes the government itself and different government agencies to get just the code for that What if your car insurance change every time you crossed a state or a? counter go across the state or a baurel or a different County line. So imagine that this is the situation Pretty much. This is what what happens when it comes to marine insurance So the the insurance policy is not static and it depends where the goods are different criterias when it comes to your day and You know the the route that's been taken by the but the vessel itself where it is where it has into the danger zone What are they longitude and latitude of the location? What are the experience of the the crew all of these parameters are getting are getting? You know filtered out and getting calculated to give a more realistic Estimation of the risk so they can know how much they can charge their customers. So To repair for example to repair state of a ship the makeup Let's say they the makeup and the experience of the crew the flag under which the ship is registered and the location of the ship all affect the coast and a ship insurance and the insurance premium changes dynamically as these factor changes So the biggest variables that the biggest bearable variable here is the ship's location So for example when a ship enters a warzone insurance premiums shoot up Right and because of the dynamic nature of the insurance pricing and the fact that so many parties are involved in insuring container ships insurance provides reinsurance reinsurers claim handlers surveyors adjusters Asian customers Port authorities and others all of these are just personas within this kind of cycle. So marine insurance cost are inefficient To price and high very high in cost which has the whole industry, right? And the whole settlement you can imagine the burden when it comes to settlement these kind of transaction and how much? it would cost when it comes to time and obviously money I delivered so they conflated process also makes Regulatory compliance challenging because everybody has their own vision and version of truth and that could introduce that will introduce errors and duplication across all of these personas so it often takes months to agree on a contract terms and and Sometimes here to peer insurance claims So having said that let's look at blockchain how protein is actually will Help with that. So basically what you can see here and this is just a very overly Simplification of what I just said But basically because what because basic one of the main parameters here is just a route the route that the ship is taking Where the ship is right now? So basically before the ship leaves the port the main port of the departure port There is an ideal path. It's pretty much like what? Pilot does win on an airplane. There is a specific Route and there is an ideal part that you have to take But during the journey, there are a lot of parameters like weather conditions whether there is a geopolitical stability and all of that that can come in real time that maybe they would take different route and do a detour and Because of that it's the day it's just a managing risks. So the ideal path or the safe zone maybe it's no longer safe, but there is a less risky one, but that would involve a danger zone and So because of that all of the parameters has interns and one of the Variables in the calculation is the longitude and latitude so GPS sensors and other sensors Send GPS and location data to the insurance company and not directly to the insurance company It's send that information today to the ledger and because everything has been agreed upon before leaving The departure hold the actual calculation of the premium. It happens in near real time and The actual settlement happens as part of the ledger because the terminal condition has have been afraid before Everybody can see the exact location of the ship Everybody can know who does what and what the obligation every person has So that would that has provided three main things single sort of throws across multi parties near real-time settlement and agreement on on any dispute that may come or even they the insurance claim and thirdly for from a regulatory perspective They can come up and they can extract the information that they need to prove that you know what they are doing whether this is a Whether this is right or wrong and and they can produce that in just a matter of minutes Instead of just waiting for months and sometimes years to actually do this kind of extraction In in in in no time in near-real-time So I've talked about the The use cases which I hope that you find that you found interesting But basically let's face the reality of building a blockchain from scratch Unfortunately building an interim protein application is a huge intake so proteins strengths lies in its ability to automatically validate transactions against pre-agreed business logic and Thus developers want to spend their time writing business started to develop smart contracts But there are dozens of other steps that you must perform before getting into this stage So from manually deploying a ledger to managing pre-processing and storage building the integration around it creating web client interfaces and more and Just building a ledger on self. It's a it's it's not an easy task so basically because of that Microsoft had a Very interesting view to the whole block chain ecosystem, basically as a blockchain We wanted to streamline these steps. So basically We wanted to from the start. We want a service like edge of opportunity routine service to allow Users to configure deploy and manage the networks Forming these foundation of protein apps in the cloud and the way we've build the edge of protein service We've made it and ledger agnostic. So basically we don't have a specific or hard limit towards a specific ledger implementation So we have support for quorum which is ready and enterprise for diversion of aetherium We have support for have a ledger fabric coming soon. We have right now support in preview for coda in Korda enterprise so pretty much the main player when it comes to Leadership technologies as approaching the surface is a Alysha agnostic The second layer is how to model and once once your network is up and running The other step would be how to write a contract how to author Test your smart contractor until you do with the same tool that we all use do so because we are as I said blockchain, you know building protein application is Just writing a small contract is different than writing normal code what we wanted to do is abstract this layer and build a few plugins and accelerators in order for developers to treat protein smart contract pretty much use the same tooling the same interface the same generators where the one I Want with one single IDE. So what we've done with Visual Studio to build the edge approach in Plugin which basically abyss tract or all of the tools that you require as a developer to get started So instead of you download different tools in Order for you to start authoring Building testing and deploying your smart contract you just download Visual Studio code and download this plug-in and you will be good to go Because this tool will it will distract all of the steps that you might need Once your network is up a running as a Brooke team workbench and this is one of the things that is very good for dev and test to accelerate the POC period So blockchain workbench can provide this intuitive UI for modeling and prototyping workflows and visual studio code integration makes it easy for Experienced developer to author and test those multiple trials so and to ensure your network communicates with the data output and Ingestion system you really use we have built the solution accelerator that I mentioned earlier Which is part of something called the area protein development kit. So within the development edge you can see sample smart contract into n solutions solution accelerators even devops journey into how to deploy and automate the deployment of your Small contract from your dev machines through the testing environment and filing it to the pre prod and production environment So we have and I'll be showing that in just a second So as I said, the edge approach in service is currently in preview you can deploy fully managed protein network So as your protein service is a platform as a service offering it will offload all of the burden when it comes to Consortium management so you can focus on your application logic. So you go to Microsoft you'd say I need a quorum Concession so we will manage the infrastructure at the network and you only care about how to manage your application logic The construction management so and one of the good feature in the agriculture service is the concession management Which is basically instead of you you know worry about managing the keys and who can do what in the consortium we we've Encapsulated this concession management with a set of powerful tools and soon Wednesday serves already We are looking forward to playing that as part of the azure portal itself so it's a it's it's it's it's a great way to Abstract all of the efforts in a fully managed ledger technology as part of the edge of protein service and at the same time Being a literature agnostic. I Think I'll really cover that Let's look at the current capabilities that we have. So right now in the education service we have quorum support and as I said currently we we have the Support for the AI PFD that consensus arguing. So if you don't know all of these details, it's part of the quorum And you know consensus algorithm as part of it so right now we support quorum 2.25 and We have another You know, as I said we have coda Enterprise coming in to private preview And coda is another religious technology that's being you know, we'll known when it comes You know it is Useful in all of the use case or most of the use case that I'm aware of but it's very popular in the financial sector So go to enterprise it is right now in private preview and if you are using coda or willing to use coda this is the link for You know signing up for the private preview right now So let's look at the edge approaching service and so this is just a as I said within the edge of prochain service we have You know planning to have this different layers of managing the concern itself so in the azure portal, you will get an out-of-the-box monitoring for the transaction number of transactions happening and Lettuce integration with local anaesthetics as your monitor for logging and alerting you can have high availability Clustered and patching healthy nodes. So it's a as I said, it's a past service So we will monitor these nodes for you And if you sign up for the standard as you put in service high availability is already included So enough talking. Let's have a look at the trend concession. So if I Scroll a bit and go to the azure portal. So what I've did let's go today today The portal and go to services and if I go to all resources Let's have a look at Create a new resource. So let's have ad So if I go here there is a complete section called blockchain I am if I click on blockchain as you can see here There is the edge of booking service and the azure protein workbench And so the edge of protein says service is the managed ledger and the a blockchain workbench is a layer on top of that that will enable you to only write to a smart contract upload the smart contract and don't worry about the user interface to even Interact with it. So it's so the other proteins workbench is A good way for dev test and PC acceleration, but the ad reporting service is basically built for production workloads But yeah as I can as I said we have a lot of partner solutions including coda hyper ledger and Later on, I will be talking about the high ability fabric on ATS the edge of community service. So what I've done I've really done mic insertion, so if I go to Search for agile block chain service if I click on that one, you can see I Have two protein services and if you can see here these two services or T these two members in two different subscriptions, so Which is a good thing and which is reflected to reality when we are talking about different members or different personas each one of them has their own trust boundaries and The way I model this forest boundary is by putting them in different subscription So if I click on one of them if I click on my ad ad the member one as you can see here This is the concern name and if I click on this so I have a concern called Sophie Dimmick insertion. So here click on that concession you Can see I have two members as part of that concession. One of them is one subscription. Another one is indifferent One of them is admin and one of them is just user You can read more in documentation about what are the differences but admin basically can do Everything adding inviting members right now The functionality is managed through partial at the moment But we are looking to bring that as part of the other portal when it comes out of the preview So basically as you can see here if I go scroll down Right now because I've already deployed that just a moment. I don't have any transaction didn't deploy anything But if I were if I ought to deploy anything here if a sample contract I would be able to see transaction number of handle requests if there are any pending transaction and Also if I click on transaction notes Let's look at the transaction notes. So right now I have one member call. Sorry That member has only one transaction note and I can add more notes if I click on here Adding new notes just for hire adding more notes for when it comes to scaling the Transaction if you want to if you're if you've done your load testing and know how many notes that you That you can add so basically adding more notice just as simple as that And you can add more noise by a PowerShell and CLI as well But it's already at the moment you really integrate with the portal if you wanted to The other service that I need to mention here is the blockchain Data Manager And one of the things that you were required to do is extract Transaction data from the ledger, right? So what if an ID device in this information to the ledger? How you can append reporting how can you notify external system about events that are happening? So let's say that the IOT device or longitude into a danger zone for the sinner that I talked about. How can you notify the Downstream system about this kind of event. So for this kind of situation reporting and integrating With downstream system. We have the edge approaching Data Manager Which is a simple way to integrate the edge of obscene service or the ledger itself the ledger data itself to the external world Which is if I click on add and as you can see here this connect directly to the transaction node and you just give it a name and Obviously before I would be able to create a plot chain Data Manager need anything crypt So basically the Protein Data Manager connect to the event great and from the event great You can off you go. You can go connect with hundreds of the under stream system databases and applications So if I close everything Let's look at the edge of proteins development kit. So the edge of approaching dev kit. As I said we have this different categories when it comes to the software development kit for agile blockchain So we have connect integrate accelerators and DevOps if I start from down to bottom add down to top sorry from down we have the devops for small contracts or something a lot of our customers and partners asked for how we can Use the same DevOps methodologies and practices when it comes to Distributed applications and basically this this provides samples and PD and intern cycle where you can utilize that as well using adjectives or Any tools for that matter when it comes to connect? How can you connect data? Producers how you can consume data from the external world and send them to the blockchain and the other way around How can you integrate legacy tools? So if I click on integrate, for example, we have samples for? Documenting media. So if I go to Something like including the blockchain connected to the logic app, which is a pretty much a great way. So you can use logic app to Send information today To the ledger and you can use Data Manager to extract data if you want to so It's pretty much about we we've got you covered here. So go to the azure samples in the blockchain is DK There are tons of samples in there so you can try yourself all of these capabilities So if I go back to the slides so Basically just to reiterate what I said in the data manager So the blockchain data manager, as I said, it connects the education service to event grid and from the event grid You will be able to send that to logic app two functions to cosmos DB And from any data store, you can build your own power apps and actually within the SDK we have a very interesting use case where you actually interact with the with your ledger storing values in your ledger via the logic app and Receiving events to your power apps notify notification to allow your power apps Once these events happen within the blockchain The last thing I need to cover here is we have fiber ledger fabric at 1.4 X on edge of community service so right now this is a on preview right now so you can sign up for this one if you want to and we have a good documentation on that and so the way I think about running hybrid fabric If you want you to use habit, so hyper laser fabric a the third ledger just I want to say that Beforehand, so I believe the fabric is a sample It is another that your technology can utilize and right now you can run it on VMs but also you can run that on as your community service on communities with which a lot of customer we would need or would like to use Especially when we are talking about heterogeneous cloud platforms You know, you know when we're talking about blockchain Not not everybody uses a single cloud provider. So because of that communities is Kind of the best fit when it comes to that as well but yeah, if you need to sign up for that one if you go to The documentation we have all of the documentation that comes to running high village of fabric insertion on a guess And you can see here the step by step diagram into how to run it and basically how to run that is Just go to the heart the ad reporter and search for Hyper later on a guess I guess I'm sorry, I Pulitzer I Just compared this That's it if I click on that one That's pretty much it. So if you are experienced or wanted to look at running hyper laser fabric I think this is a good option if you want to go to production right now So just to summarize In the last five minutes of this talk About this slide sorry and if I go back go to this one Yes my god So basically within what chain we've covered You know three of those things so the as approaching service we've talked about the edge of poaching Data Manager and lastly we covered the edge of chain development get The last thing I need just to mention We have a new service called the edge approaching token Which is atti compliant token service for tokenizing everything so Token generally would require another session to talk about it But basically you can think about tokens is a way to representing assets in the digital world and the way for you to represent Digital, you know physical assets in the digital world is by generating tokens for them. So you will be able to track. It's a a an acre of land or a an aircraft part or a mobile phone all of these things can be represented by their parameters their descriptions their properties within something called tokens that Token could be you know, a mutable token. There are different types of tokens. So we have a service for that Justice to summarize you can use as your protein service as I just covered We have the tools that can help you as a developer to start quickly We have the platform that can support you to elastic a scale in M. Fully managed service Fully managed services whether this is from the edge reporting service whether you are using different type of Ledger's hit true genius leisure Lydia we have support recorder for quorum We have support for hability frederick whether this is on vm or whether this is on a guess so pretty much we have a very rich ecosystem and if you are thinking of running your workloads on running a protein solution Just feel free to reach out to me on Twitter on LinkedIn and I'm more than happy to help you with that So with that, thank you so much for your time and look forward to hear back from you
