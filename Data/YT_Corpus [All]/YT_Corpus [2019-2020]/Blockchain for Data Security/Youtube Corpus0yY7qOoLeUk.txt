 Hey!  As we know Tezos blockchain is living well for two years and more and more developers are coming into the ecosystem every day to create cool and useful tools applications and services, that in one way or another are based on data from Tezos blockchain But where do they get this data? there are three ways RPC API explorer API or blockchain indexer RPC API is handy because it comes with the node you can just run a node and use it moreover, you can use public node but the problem is that it's quite slow and doesn't have most of the required endpoints for example to get an operation by its hash so for complex application the RPC API is often just not suitable explorer APIs offer a lot of useful data and high speed however, not all explorers offer free API especially for commercial use. Not always these explorers are a reliable solution and uptime of your application directly depends on uptime of the explorer but there are those 10 for from having full control over the entire infrastructure is a critical requirement and today we will tell you how to set up your own Tezos blockchain indexer and have full control access to data and not to depend on third-party services will review the TzkT indexer - one of the flagship products of Baking Bad TzKT is an advanced Tezos blockchain indexer with built-in performant api currently it is one of the most reliable and stable open-source indexer in Tezos you can find the link into the GitHub repository below and don't forget to put a star if you like it! so now let's see how to easily set up your own instance of TzKT indexer and API within just 15 minutes using docker we will need git make docker and docker-compose packages to be installed to run tzkt if you have all this package installed we are ready to start first clone TzKT repository this is a public open developing repository so, don't hesitate to create issues of feature requests move to TzKT directory and run make init run this command just once to init database from the latest snapshot during initialization the latest database snapshot is downloaded if the database already exists it is deleted and created anew after that, the database is restored from the downloaded snapshot when the database is initialized the latest images of the tzkt indexer and API are downloaded from the docker hub usually it takes around one minute to download the latest database snapshot and around 10 minutes to restore the database from it of course it depends on internet connection and your hardware setup when initialization is done we are ready to start our indexer and API service that's it just check that everything is good oh yeah starting API takes some time for cache initialization so we actually need to wait a few seconds let's try now yeah everything's fine we've got the head and can check the indexer synchronization status from now our indexer and API are working, blocks are synchronizing and you can easily access the API or the database directly to stop the service just run make stop command it will stop all using docker containers That's it!  Thanks for watching! In the next video, we will show How to build TzKT indexer and API from sources
