 I'm Richard Ma CEO and co-founder of Quantstamp. The reason why Quantstamp exists is because smart contracts are vulnerable to hacks and we make sure that they're safe for everyone to use. In January of 2017 there were only around 10,000 smart contracts, today there's more than 8 million. And, it's no longer possible for manual human experts to check all of these contracts individually. Quantstamp is really bringing automation to this security auditing industry, so that eventually when there's billions of smart contracts we can still make sure they're all safe. Here at Quantstamp, we're on a mission to help as many companies as we can to explore blockchain in the secure way, so they can thrive 10 years from now. To this day a constant has secured over half a billion dollars worth of smart contracts Richard Ma CEO and software developer at Quantstamp Visit quantstamp.com/audits
