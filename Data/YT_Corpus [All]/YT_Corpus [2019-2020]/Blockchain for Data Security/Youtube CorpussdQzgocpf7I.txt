 okay so if you um if you want to be able to basically consider blockchain for any kind of uh service or or project or use case right we first have to understand this blockchain presents many advantages some of them are the following: security, transparency, and trust. We'll talk more about this in the coming slides. Now if you consider a traditional client server application or for any of your existing projects or for a new project, think of it this way you'll have to invest money and time and resources and efforts into building the application and then into securing it so the first question that your management or your executive director will always ask you for any kind of a new solution is: is it secure? and how much is it going to cost me? right so is it secure it's one of the most important fundamental questions that we always get asked by management or by the executive directors about the security of the application the potential threats and how are we going to mitigate those threats so in this case a normal client server application even be a web app or even a a mobile app the more you have to spend on security you have to buy SSL licenses: secure socket layer you have to purchase endpoint security you have to purchase application level security and then when your application grows in volume you'll have to purchase additional layers of security on it firewall security and different layers of application type security aspects on that application port securities and so on so as the application grows in volume you still have to pump additional money into it to secure it right and that's can be a very huge cost burden a burden on the company and that's what blockchain has a major advantage because security is built into the blockchain network itself within the blockchain architecture you have different security layers built into the blockchain framework uh the secure hashing algorithm is only one side of it right so here we'll talk about how the security is built into the system and in the in the section to the next coming section we'll talk about the specific different layers of blockchain security that is built into the network itself right which gives us an advantage for you to be able to deploy your application on all right so let's go ahead and continue here okay first so these are the core uh fundamentals in blockchain right security transparency and trust and this is why blockchain blockchain solves the following problems in any kind of a project or an application or or the design of an application security transparency trust is embedded or built into the blockchain network here's how first of all trust the issue with trust is the following um traditionally we have central control right central authority every single bank financial institution insurance company and every traditional company owns and maintains and the centralized control of that data customer service information accounting information financial records information about that specific company organization employee salaries employees benefits and all that right all that is maintained in a centralized control environment that's owned by that specific entity right so trusting essential authority is no longer viable why because the 2008 financial crisis proved that point to us right we can no longer maintain trust in the so-called banking system right because the financial services the the economic crisis of 2008 proved that after we trust that system that's what happened right um trust was violated by those in power by those or owners or custodians of that financial institutions so now we have to take a look at the difference model decentralized control right we can no longer trust a centralized model now we have to look at different models that can help protect our interests and our investments as consumers the second part is control there is the risks of having central control over an application leads to corruption and fraud here is a big question when you give unlimited power to a few individuals and then they know they can get away with it by doing certain things by changing manipulating the system chances are they may condone into um malicious activities right chances are if a ceo of a company knows that he can do x y and zed and get away with it and he's going to be untouched right chances are he may or may not condone and support illegal malicious activities but if you distribute that power right distribution if you distribute that power and control over 10 000 individuals and you say okay if you have 10 000 people and all these the majority of these people have to be able to work together to be able to be convinced to manipulate or change tr transaction records into an organization it's less likely that ten thousand people or 8 000 people are all going to be corrupt it's the power in numbers right this presents a fundamental model or aspect of blockchain as a decentralized technology there's no single entity that controls and owns the data it's completely completely distributed decentralized right we'll talk more about what that means in the next few slides audit firms right so audit firms basically here when an auto firm issues the audit report for a bank we accept it as is right we don't question it but then six months later like for example the wells fargo case and other banking fraud cases that happened 2008 financial crisis of the banking fraud cases we now see okay what happened to these auditors they were supposed to audit these financial statements and give us confirmation that their financial statement the financial is a sound right the financial environment of the company is sound and stable but then we realized it was all committed fraud so what was the purpose of paying these accountants and these these auditors and this is what raises the question about trust now we can no longer maintain the trust in the existing system thanks to the financial crisis that happened 2009 thanks to the continuous aspects of fraud that we find in different international organizations across different banks across different investment banks and so on right we can no longer maintain that trust even though they go and they mean regulation standards and requirements and then they go and maintain their records with their auditing firm and they issue the autonomous reports and they issue their shareholders agreements and every year it still proves to us that there's there's there's a big gap in the market which we have to we have to address blockchain presents many advantages one of it is solving the problem of trust using decentralized and distributed computing okay so this is an example of a company back in the uk in london a big four firm kpmg has been stung with seven figure fine by the uk's accounting watchdog following a lengthy probing to its audits of fatsyndicate218 syndicate 218 was a insurance company based in the uk and basically what happened was the kpmg accountants and auditors colluded with syndicate syndicates top management and they basically inflated the financial records of the company and a year later it was discovered that they don't hold the right financial records as was stated by kpmg and hence they were uh they were fined right the uk wing of international professional services giant kpmg has been hit with a 6 million pound fine and severely reprimanded following an examination by the financial reporting council of this 2008 2009 audits of syndicate 218 right so essentially they were discovered again this brings up the main point we can no longer maintain trust in these audit firms because of cases like this and cases like this are happening across the world across different industries manufacturing sectors financial services sectors investments insurance and so on so we need something else to be able to make to maintain the trust of these organizations and for the stakeholders of these companies the ryzen 5 divides a broad group dubai abroad was a brush capital was one of the largest private equity firms in the middle east they were holding assets north of 15 billion dollars sorry north of 14 billion dollars in assets right and now two years later they were going to complete liquidation the top management has been accused of fraud and mismanagement of funds and the entire executive board and and of course they were using also another auditing firm which every year that auditing firm was confirming in their audit report that abroad capital was sound and they were maintaining all their accounting records and everything was perfect and then three years later they're going to complete liquidation and the management are being charged by fraud and mismanagement of funds and fraudulent activities on their transactions right a lot of funds were missing over 384 million dollars were missing taken by some executives so again it brings up another big gap of why and why we should consider other technologies to consider for those specific use cases okay so this is published by ey in 2019 97 of business leaders recognize the need to demonstrate integrity in their organizations right this was published by eoi as a survey between organizations across the middle east all right i'll stop it right here guys and we'll continue on in the next lesson hey guys welcome back all right we'll continue on the next uh the next lesson um so we'll talk now about transparency and confident confidentiality which is the second aspect of the advantages that blockchain presents so let's go ahead and continue here all right so the second aspect is transparency confidentiality which means that now blockchain the public blockchain which is bitcoin and ethereum whenever you're making a trade of a bitcoin or units or ether when you're buying and selling here's what this means the transaction that you do is completely transparent which means that all the transactions of the bitcoin network when you when you're buying and selling bitcoin william with your wallet address can be viewed on the block explorer or in the in the case of ethereum on etherscan.io these are the websites which allow you to see all the different transactions that occur on the blockchain network for bitcoin or for ethereum so for bitcoin it's a blockscap a block scanner and for ethereum it's the etherscan.io which essentially shows you all the different transactions that happened all the way up to 2008 or 2015 when ethereum was first created in the case of bitcoin you can see all the transactions coming in since the start the birth of bitcoin in 2009 right now this is a this is a fundamental aspect because we no longer are hiding behind uh centralized control everything is completely private transparency in the sense that the transactions are there but there's no link to the identity of the person who owns that wallet address right so if i'm sending you let's say one five bitcoins to your account when i go ahead and do it there's no link on the address on my wallet address that connects me my id or my social security number or my birth certificate or my passport id or my driver's license id is linked to my wallet address on the network when i go and create a wallet address on the bitcoin blockchain all i need to do is print a a code and they will assign me a hexadecimal code which represents my wallet address on the network and then i go and deposit funds into it right through of course through the cryptocurrency exchange right in case of binance or any other cryptocurrency exchange that you sign up with when you transfer the funds into it your wallet address on the bitcoin blockchain is only as code there's no id or link to your identification which is a powerful way that's when we say confidentiality because your identifications being um owned by you not by the system as opposed to any bank or any financial institution where they own your id and they're linked to your account now this there are some big advantages in this case like for example with a major bank announces their private banking business just grew by you know two billion dollars or three billion dollars or private equity business they just grew they just signed up so some ultra high net worth individuals and so now the increase in profit banking from like 2 billion to 4 billion this attracts a lot of negative attention hackers across the world are seeing this now they know oh so bank abc now just increased their private banking to 4 billion let's go and attack them let's go and approach them let's see what they have right you become an easy target for hackers so what does the bank have to do invest more in security invest more in protocol security and application layer security to protect their systems from these potential hacks right in the blockchain world the um the transactions are public which means that transactions can be viewed by anybody but nobody knows it belongs to you right so in the case of public and private blockchains private blockchains we'll talk more about in detail later on uh the private the transactions are private within our permission base based on user access and based on the entities involved and um so for example today's dba database administrator or let's say a system administrator or basically your your tech support they have complete control over seeing your entire database of applications and your transactions and your employees salaries and your for example your email services and so on right they have full access and that becomes a big risk if that person gets fired or terminated unexpectedly then that person can hold a lot of information about you and they can expose you to the public or to mainstream media which can be very detrimental and high risk to your organization now that's the key advantages right about what blockchain's confidentiality and transparency in blockchain all right i'll stop right here guys and then we'll continue on the next lesson to talk about security in the blockchain network hey guys welcome back okay so the third aspect of the fundamentals of blockchain which makes it very attractive as a technology is security so now we'll be talking about security and how it plays an important role in the built-in architecture of what blockchain offers all right okay so as we said earlier the first was transparency and confidentiality or sorry the second was transparency and confidentiality and the first was trust so trust transparency confidentiality and the third aspect is now security now the biggest advantage of blockchain is that it has a built in security layers within the blockchain architecture right and that gives you a huge advantage when you're comparing it to traditional client server applications whether you're doing a mobile app or whether you're doing a basic web app for your use cases right in your traditional use cases you have to factor security in within the design of your application which means that you have to spend time and effort and development time to building the secure layers in your application and you have to probably procure security licenses whether it's ssl and different security licenses application level security to make it more secure and to make your application secure especially when it grows in volume of transactions okay so how does blockchain address security in this case right so as we said earlier blockchain comes from a distributed model so it's inbuilt redundancy and decentralization if you're for example in a public ethereum or bitcoin if any nodes of the bitcoin network goes down right the bitcoin transactions still occur it does not affect the service the bitcoin service if i'm gonna send you five bitcoins you're still gonna get it as um as long as there is one or two nodes out there who are confirming and mining the transactions so it's very similar to bittorrent and whenever you're downloading a file in bittorrent um the file still continues to download as long as you have one or two seeders online who are seeding the bits of that file right so whenever you're downloading any kind of content on bittorrent such as music or movies or any kind of files or applications you have maybe 10 000 seeders out there and leechers and whenever you're downloading it downloads bits by bit from each of those seeders as long as these seeders are are online and connected you're still going to continue receiving your download if some seeders go offline you're still going to get your your download it just might be a bit slower right so disaster recovery is addressed and built into the system which means any node of the application that goes down your application is still up and running because it's completely distributed right it has high availability because of the the decentralization model or the distributed model and any number of nodes can go down without impacting or affecting the blockchain application any record so here you got so here you go any record of the transact can be verified by anyone openly in the case of a public blockchain right if you're deploying application on a public blockchain such as ethereum or even on bitcoin on the public mainnet then that means your transactions are going to be available to be seen on the block scanner right we'll talk more about that in the in the next section on security in a private blockchain records are permission based which means that you have selected parties which you give authorized access to you'll be able to see those records uh in in the in the case of private blockchain it's easy to audit any transaction and the trail of it right blockchain is designed to make it very easy for you to be able to track and monitor and see the transactions on it right it was designed that way specifically to be able to remove possibilities of fraud or kind of investigation so this is why we're saying blockchain has major advantages when it comes to security because the security is built into the network you don't have to go and do a dr site for your application or disaster recovery or replication of your or your of your of your infrastructure in a separate um separate data center or separate cloud architecture because security is built into the network okay a simple truth about hacking right so blockchain helps reduce the risk of being hacked security encryptions provide easy exposure now the security we'll talk more about the the different security layers in blockchain such as the sha in detail and the cryptography asymmetrical program in the next section but however just keep this in mind all right in any given model in any given scenario you cannot eliminate hackers from from happening or bad actors or malicious actors from committing um wrongdoing right there they're always going to be people who believe that they're that they can outsmart the system which they can actually um or they believe that they they can get away with things or they believe that they are smarter than than the people involved and they can actually get away with with certain things and hacking is just one of those areas or professions so there's always going to be hackers so you cannot eliminate that threat right there's only always going to be people who are with ransomware and so on it's this is the nature of technology as you advance in your defenses the hackers also advance in their attacks however what you can do is what you can control is to make it very difficult for hackers to try to hack or intercept your application and if they do commit any any fraud or malicious activities they're going to be easily exposed so you're increasing the risk of them being exposed those are the two main aspects that you can consider when it comes to cyber security and when it comes to defense against potential hacks so blockchain helps make that possible right the way the system designed and the architecture and the nodes and the transactions is designed that to make it very very difficult for hackers to try to be able to hack it intercept the application of the blockchain network and specifically if any attack occurs it's going to be easily exposed it can be easily exposed to hackers and those individuals for for them to be able to be pinpointed by the application that's the advantage of blockchain presents this is part of the design mechanism that satoshi did or designed into the application into the blockchain network specifically for that purpose because he knew remember blockchain was designed in 2008 during the internet era right so the uh the impact uh the possibility of fraud and and um and hacks was already there traditional banking systems were designed in 70s and the 60s right in the 80s way before the internet so they were not designed with security in mind and that's what makes a blockchain network a compelling technology to consider because of these built in security transparency and trust within the actual network right okay so the total benefits so when you consider all these three aspects security transparency and trust um these are the these are the benefits that you gain right transactions are immutable they cannot be changed modified or deleted right this protects against fraud and malicious activities and people want to be able to hide and transfer records asymmetric cryptography private key publicly this gives you security that you'll be able to access those records using your private key and private key public visa is part of a very powerful cryptographic hash which is a very uh secure algorithm used within the blockchain network high availability high availability and redundancy no need for dr sites it's built into the network no id is linked to the transaction or the accounts this protects the identification of people and users right to be able to to avoid hackers from being able to attack because of specific people who who they are targeting potential attacks can be discovered relatively with ease because of the design of the blockchain network it can be easily detect potential threats and hackers attempts on the network transactions are verified and confirmed in real time which gives it a faster settlement time and less errors during the transaction through the completion of completion of transactions right all these are benefits that we can gain from using a blockchain as an infrastructure as a database as a network for us to deploy your application on versus the traditional client server application where we have to build the security and all these factors into the application which contributes to the design process and it gives it a much higher cost okay i'm gonna leave it out here guys and i'll see you guys in the next lesson thank you for watching
