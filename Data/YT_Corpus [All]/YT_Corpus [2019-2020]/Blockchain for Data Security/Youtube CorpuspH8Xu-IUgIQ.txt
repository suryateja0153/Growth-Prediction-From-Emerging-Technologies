 Hello everyone! Welcome back to my channel, The Plug and in this video we'll be learning more about Blockchain. Now since its original inception in 2008 to serve as a public transaction ledger for bitcoin, blockchain technology has come a long way. It has evolved into something useful beyond just cryptocurrency exchanges. Blockchain technology is an amalgamation of various technological applications such as distributed ledger technology, peer-to-peer networking as well as cryptography. The composition of these various technological applications that form blockchain depend on the type of problem that the blockchain is trying to resolve. In this video we'll be narrowing it to its distributed ledger capabilities. A distributed ledger is a technology developed with the intention of having one shared ledger amongst all parties involved; for example cloud storage small business owners are increasingly turning away from traditional cloud storage solutions such as Google cloud platform as well as Oracle as these platforms are typically expensive and have limited security and transparency. As a result small business owners are skeptical of centralized cloud platforms and are looking for new and innovative ways in which they can store their company data. In turn a smaller number of blockchain-backed cloud storage solutions are stepping up to the plate and they are assuring small business owners to provide data security at lower prices compared to centralized options. Most blockchain startups in South Africa focus on cryptocurrency and the ones that I have been alluding to in this video are internationally based.
