 Blockchains are a new way of securely storing and tracking changes to data which can represent any type of digital asset. In short, a blockchain is a decentralized ledger  In a centralized system, security is guaranteed by a central authority, like a government or a company which runs the service. In contrast, decentralized systems are run by the people using the system and do not depend on any single person. This provides resilience and reduces the power any individual has over the system. Blockchains allow these decentralized systems to provide the same kinds of the same kinds of security guarantees that otherwise would require a trusted centralized authority. A ledger is a record of how an asset changes over time whether that change is a transfer of ownership or a change to the asset itself. So, a decentralized ledger is a record of how data changes over time which, to increase security, is duplicated across many different computers. This simple solution has the potential to revolutionize the way people, businesses and institutions interact with one another through provenance verification, process automation and many more emerging use cases. We’ll explore all of this and more in the rest of this blockchain video series.
