 hi NEM community around the world I'm Alexis Trujillo and this is the NEM Show [Music] the world economy was always about assets and institutions that assign a value to those assets now the blockchain technology has new ways to handle this finance relationship in a decentralized way is our ecosystem dynamical system ready to help companies and individuals to make use of these tools to answer that the CFO of the NEM Group Iain Wilson comes to the NEM Show to explain that a hybrid blockchain like symbol is all in. As you can see liquidity is not just the hot topic in the blockchain environment it is a matter of business it is a matter of time that every blockchain turns into the DeFi movement I think the better person in our ecosystem to explain how how important it is for us as a community to join the finance and business sectors it's our very own Iain Wilson who is the CFO of the NEM Group and he's joining us to this episode of the NEM Show hi and welcome to the NEM Show. Great to be here Alexis no no no it's really great to have you i mean the CFO okay big name and that's an important name nowadays okay how come someone from the business sector ended up in the blockchain world and most important why NEM? how come that? yeah okay I mean i'll just sort of go just go back in time a bit in terms of terms of my experience um I mean previously I ran trading desks um investment banks so um so so given that background I sort of understood the concept of DLT (distributed ledger technology) um you know and my first job as well I was working with trading room systems in the early 90s so I don't want to give away my age um but you know a lot of that really that was around um APIs and databases so some of the underlying you know technology that we're talking about with um you know with NEM um is something i've sort of sort of been exposed to in a roundabout route for quite a long time um the the analytics software you use um for for trading and investment banks actually was was very advanced compared to mainstream enterprise in a weird way I mean like the the there's a blockchain as a technology um it sort of makes sense just because of sort of my exposure in the financial field you know you see all the pain points um and the problems and then you know it doesn't take long to think actually you know what maybe is a bit better way of doing some of these processes so yeah that's that's sort of how I ended up getting involved really banking and finance sector they say that they are technology edgy things okay but in the real world they think to be more traditional why is that what do you think is that? yeah it's a couple of things I think I think what what a lot of people miss maybe from um you know from from crypto is about just how highly regulated these organizations are um you know if you're if you're looking at an early stage tech company and you you operate you know you're moving fast you're trying different models trying different products you frame them out if they don't work in a regulated framework you just can't put that sort of stuff into into production. I mean you've got concepts of sandboxes which allow you to do some innovation in a very controlled environment but predominantly no I mean if you know if you if you have a you know if you have lots of funds um or you have you know uh you know some of the you know you break some of these really uh quite heavy laws around uh AML KYC you've got a real problem with your banking licenses um so so unfortunately look I mean I think even within banking there's people that realize that the platforms are pretty poor um but it's just getting to that point about how you can actually innovate and I think that's been the biggest problem is it is the innovation's just been so slow because of the regulation you know but hopefully that's something that's changing. It's it's no secret for everyone then nowadays we have we we've been watching a long trail of partnerships for the NEM ecosystem it's uh i think it's it's it's part of this strategy of this new strategy of the NEM Group of being open for business or being an open for business blockchain now who outlined that uh strategy how comes we ended up being the blockchain for business yeah yeah that's quite that's quite an interesting I mean I would the way I look at it I mean I certainly think we're open for business um you know if you look at the terms of the use case and people might use Symbol um I don't think you've got necessarily strict I mean for example you know like um charities or aid organizations as there's a plenty of use cases around identity around there which you wouldn't classify them in the non-profit sector so I think better way of looking at is we're open for business um if you say like how you know if you look at us as a network I put things back to network effects so effectively a network effect is you know the more people that use your product or service the more value gets created within that network or that ecosystem and so the way I look at partnerships are you know you can have a different level or depth of a partnership but but the bottom line is the more partners and people we can draw in the wider our ecosystem starts extending and then we build more network effects in and there's more value that's created for us as an ecosystem so businesses are already engaged with it um you know what we need to do really is to to launch that public chain and then join everything up uh and part of that joining up process is getting as many partners engaged at all different levels Now thank you and now you mentioned partnerships that's the key word here okay what do you think is the best that Symbol can offer to all of this business that are looking for a blockchain for for a successful blockchain blockchain implementation? Yeah i mean i think that i think the key way that single differentiates itself is the fact is it's a hybrid blockchain um and you know okay what is a hybrid blockchain? I mean we talk about business but but business itself has an element where there's there's a public-facing b2c element and then there's business that enrolls this internal process and it is also dealing with its supplier network so more of a b2b process and if you think about a starting point there there's going to be loads of use cases or informational points where you actually need to have a public chain you know you need to have the transparency and the trust of actually publishing onto it onto a public chain but then if you look at how businesses internally run things there may be a whole load of transactions that need to take you know for privacy reasons or just just reasons in terms of like security confidentiality that might need to run on that private case um so so really for Symbol that's where Symbol unifies public and private chain and it allows people to put implement use cases that bring out the best of public chain and we know there's lots of things that are really really powerful about our public chain but you know you you have to provide people that the flexibility in business that you can't be maximised about you can't say for a business look 100 you've got we give you an option you just run on a public chain i don't think that's realistic you know you need to give people different options and you need to combine them in a way and if you can do that hopefully in how we've looked to or how the call devs have built Symbol um you know they focused on building core functionality or blockchain primitives in that core protocol and it's it's through having these feature set that you can allow people to construct you know products products that people can actually use people can sell people can offer more value to people throughout the ecosystem and it will draw in more partners once you start doing that you know the the advantage we've got is we've got something that's scalable and and hits security level for for enterprises but we can do that in a public environment as well we can give them the best of both worlds uh that's what I think is powerful about Symbol And and that's fine for for Symbol that has a lot of features as you say but now about NIS1 one about NEM NIS1 one is the blockchain that brought us here what's in the in our plans for NIS1? I think what's really important about NIS1 is it's 24/7 a blockchain that's been running no downtime for five years right that's really powerful it's a statement itself um what we also know is we've got a period of of six years or more where we're gonna have um you know post launch opt-in to symbol we've also got projects that have got a lot of data um and referencing data on this one so you know NIS1's not disappearing you know NIS1 is something that works right you've got something that works um in terms of the feature set as well you know you need to you need to also think about you know in terms of the use cases are there going to be use cases that work really well on NIS1 it's going to be a low cost load transaction chain we might find actually that and there's already been some specking out um here as well but you might find there's particular use cases that actually suit NIS1 um you know blockchains are decentralized and people running nodes and as long as people run nodes there's no reason why you know NIS1 is not going to be here in five years time in the same ways it's been up and running for the last five years And i guess that's inevitable that some people may think that you know what let's turn just shut that down and it won't work again and no no nothing happens there nothing happens like that okay. Well there's no off switch. I mean yeah you can you don't have a kill switch for a blockchain no not at all okay but also if you think that's really important you know the point where you've you've got something things that are cryptographically referenced um you know people have got the decision if they want to migrate some of these projects which some people will obviously want to do migrate they want to have a feature set or they can do more with it but but you we shouldn't be in a position where centrally we say you know um okay you can't use NIS1 anymore we're switching off and obviously we can't do that anyway but that's that's the whole point we should be celebrating the fact that we've got a product um and a blockchain out there that's worked really well um and and and it's for it's ultimately for the community um there's there'll be incentive structures within there to make sure the network's secure in terms of node incentives but it's it's not for anyone to say that you know NIS1 is over. Of course not and it's a good time for me to invite you all who have been watching us until until now to you know to join our social media and leave us your comments there it's very important for us to to say and to to to answer everything you have to say about our blockchains okay. Can you tell us what's the current position of the NEM Group towards the DeFi movement as a whole and what is it going to be after Symbol? So I think overall it's like if you can give people utility from our token more utility it's beneficial to NEM um and the particular DeFi applications we're talking about the ones that are really interesting are there's there's interest around this concept of liquidity mining or effectively running assets within pools and having automated market making which which is which is a powerful concept because the user's able to participate um in the fee structure and is also able to enable more liquidity of our tokens and that really means being able to move our tokens um and swap between different assets um it also means just simple things like if you know if you wanted to get if you wanted to use your tokens as collateral because you needed to borrow some money um you know that's that's an everyday use you know you might not want to sell your XEM tokens but you actually might need some short-term finance again against that you know that if you can do that in a very flexible way you lock your tokens up um you can take some stable coin loan against that um I think that's quite powerful for powerful for a user um and I think you have to be open-minded um I don't think you know you should be moving all of your tokens and and taking unnecessary risks um but but I think there's a period where you have to be open-minded about how the financial system might change and you need to experiment um and certainly offer people different options What you just said is about bringing value to the blockchain okay and there are two basic ways to do it through liquidity of course and implementation But what else do you think would bring value to a blockchain such as ours? If you look at Symbol um Symbol's not something that that we launch and it just stops um you know there's going to be a detailed um tech road map that's going to be published and i think as soon as people have a look at that road map they're going to suddenly go right okay Symbol we're on the journey now and symbol's just gonna get better and better if you look at some of the increased feature set um this is going to be developed in 2021 there's going to be in terms of financial application there's going to be some really interesting stuff around financial applications um and then also if you going back to DeFi there's a few things that are really important for you know for NEM in terms of our ecosystem I mean a stable coin is really important um you know we need to have some we need to offer some instrument or some some way of of hedging against volatility risks on tokens we need to have some sort of store of value that's fairly liquid um and stable coins are really important um in terms of DEXs I mean you have to think think that actually over time there's going to be you know certainly you've seen that already this year in terms of the volumes that have been going through on DEX's versus centralized exchanges we need to have some sort of DEX um you know the NEM world um if you look at bridges um you know it's not just question of linkages with Ethereum but there's other chains that are really interesting as well where you're probably going to find in the future we don't have they're going to be no single network there's going to be lots of networks that interconnect with each other in the blockchain well but there's also going to be some traditional networks like Visa which is not going away or PayPal so you know you you've got to have that flexibility and bridge between the different networks you've got to have the standardization um for the interoperability you know you can't you can't produce a product in a vacuum you know without thinking about actually how how the user wants to live their lives and how the user wants to operate with different use cases so I think it's really important I mean so I think it's really important to be open-minded um because you know you don't quite know you know we know we know we know we can see already the adoption adoption curve you know the last 12 months 18 months has been really strong um and obviously it continues its pace you know the the forecasts were you know in terms of blockchain adoption or how much value of assets are going to be tokenized is huge over the next say five to ten years um but but also within that you know there's a lot of unknowns um and and quite quite where quite where Symbol fits in and where it develops you know that that's something that we've got to be open-minded to different use cases and you know it's um there's a lot there's lots of opportunities but but you also have to be open-minded to different opportunities And we can all see that we are on the track well thank you so much to Iain Wilson our CFO on the NEM group Iain if you have any final thoughts do you want to leave us yeah I think I think I think the big thing is it's Symbol launch is really exciting um and you know well you know there's been so much work um put into it um and we're nearly there um the community I think when the when we finally get the public launch out of the way and then we get the road map there people suddenly see actually there's a really strong vision of where the NEM community are going and I think we'll have all the tools um out there and we'll have a road map that will give us more features uh more tools um and then hopefully in 12 months time if you know if we're talking about Symbol again um you know we can just talk about how many projects and and how many great great ideas the community have come up with um you know it's exciting and not just uh there's not there's not many times where you can you get to work with technology um and you can suddenly see you know how powerful it is and also see how great it's gonna be um you know if everyone keeps working and pushing and certainly that's what we you know we're all focused on and I just I just hope I just hope that the whole community can just really get behind Symbol Well this is all for this episode now okay let's thanks let's thank again to Iain for his time and that's all my name is Alexis Trujillo see you soon in uh in another episode of the NEM Show thank you Iain bye bye [Music] see you
