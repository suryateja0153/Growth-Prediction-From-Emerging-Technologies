 so Andy one o'clock tea first thing that comes by really is currencies Bitcoin of course wouldn't know I got in the past two years yeah tell me about it well I think everyone thinks a Bitcoin ever you say yeah well take Bitcoin was probably the first our most famous use of blockchain technology you know Bob Cheng technology is a series of lectures where you know everyone in the ledger has to approve transaction before it registers so yeah big point it is one example and yes I wish I'd invested six or seven years ago - yeah but you know it does have the wider application to speed loose in the moment for attacking mangoes and blood diamonds and supply chain people talking about giving bank accounts to people so they can exchange assets between each other without the use of a bank there's two billion people in the world who don't have a bank account yeah in the certain promises so so maybe just we explain to us what yeah watching technology is really a whole lot of lectures series of that of blocks where there is an essential intermediary the needs to approve the transaction all the notes in that work they need to bring the transaction coordinator through there's some features but once but it's then it's immutable you know that that everyone has a copy of that transaction so it slow disputes about where there's something happened it's decentralized you know so it doesn't rely on a centralized server and we know all about the hack sweet sweet talk about British Airways page up with HR there's been other ones too so you know help us in that respect - so Andy what we look at work HR what would you say are the main issues that we're used to doing things a certain way so you know applying for jobs on an MS word CV and apparently you know 50% of these Seabees or resumes they look quite nice on the obviously not yours or mine but apparently picking that CB zombie be all and end all of recruiting they're just one aspect of it they're just shows the verification of data and the core data the other thing is centralized data models so we all use them - well 600 million people use they - so we we update our profiles and that we do that for free but that page was in Seoul on to recruiters so you can find with people in organizations we call with that like why are we there other uses of software that we they you know they use use the data to sell products to in the HR space that has men that serve people and all the data and we've said that situation where you know recruiters are spamming very talented in demand individuals who are just signing off is very hard to find I think we need to completely rebuild the whole work infrastructure from scratch there's a whole blog problems and our bias discrimination and even just accessing the visibility of all the work out there a writer it's very hard to see where all the available work is same to find verified trustworthy workers so we need to fix the matching process I would say and I think we look at that I'm watching fair part yeah I think one user particularly like is the old-fashioned CV on ms word actually it really the digital version of that that's verifiable I think the future of CVS will be you know we'll have our word preferences certifications workers food references for colleagues psychometric tests whatever it will control in a wallet that's imprinted but only we have access to and then we share that data with parties that we trust that could be a potentially oh yeah recruiter the different serious we own it and we decide who looks at it and whether we want to monetize it ourselves that's a really really powerful I think if we go ahead to them that that could change the whole recruitment marketplace one of the people to get to that point and we can have more efficient work matching factors as I call them and that doesn't have to be a brown butter jars contacts would be for hourly advice you know this companies and startup space where you can actually get paid so fiat currencies by an error of the other bikes with three matching verification it's got great potential the platform enables peer-to-peer transactions so you find a job so what that means is this transaction costs go down I don't know what the fees are top of my head but roughly twenty percent down to below five and said we're just peer-to-peer so there's some great advantages for employers and workers in this in this another advantage of that is around giving benefits to freelancers and maybe they can earn or have a share in these in these platforms this is a very different model we're talking about and I've seen these being built today how people use is about yeah all the workers out there everybody gets paid on the fourth Friday of every month like in the UK whatever two weeks in the u.s. if anyone's work their own company's self-employed real answers you know take weeks and weeks to actually pay someone thing that what came to protect the verification checking and validation it's just fake that make that process more streamlined with more trust in it so there's a case of a couple of companies one is kroner Bank in Australia are paying construction workers basically the day after that day after the clock out you know they don't actually have money in their wallet where they can spend yeah parents it's a few dollars in the supermarket that evening so it's the FLE employer because they can validate that that person on site is should be that from that perspective working themselves know they'll get paper the other day so it's a win-win obviously we'd have to reconstruct a lot of arm and Accounts Payable finance and payroll processes I see this as a decades-long I am yeah yeah how do you think that these developments c14 these are I don't think they were fast yeah I mean the here we're looking at a my crystal ball we have to say if I didn't reset support Don Tapscott you might have heard of him has been took about the digital economy and broke blockchain revolution asked me to do a research support the opportunities are club chain HR and I described to leave spaces around there will trust in Seabees hiring work natural platform once again and get that with what happens next what happens to the curb where we can easily source project teams and workers from a liquid workforce we have the disability of that pay those workers more quickly we've got some AI to work out more makes great teams what happened small those people inside organizations we've managed all that searching it attracting I hope the viewers that the FIR becomes more event them smaller tapping into this little work so alongside that we have to our ask questions of society how do we provide financial security and welfare to these groups of disparate workers and in pieces of work so that's a question that we need to as a society regional solutions I think perfect doable but it's so take many many years and how can we get lost oh great question on HR Payroll in front of people or people are just generally interested there's a few ways one is I think the biggest change to change a mindset it's probably to read up a little bit about new business models correct about han-shan it's no need to study encryption and mathematics about the business models where we could do without intermediaries or desert of checking and validating required you know your business there'll be loads of processes like that that's one thing actually a little bit to get to understand about having a wallet and having encryption keys Ashby's that very low amount some people you investment advice in it but you could a couple of dollars worth of crypto and hold that wallet the feeling that I'm not saying what those companies or tokens well that's one way this industry groupings coming up there's retail industry content consortiums and our construction a blockchain consortium in the UK looking at all the opportunities there leave my obedient publication rock chain and the distributed workforce which is a hard barber people writing about this subject of ideas yeah well that's enough to be getting on with yeah that would be really good stuff thank you very much [Music]
