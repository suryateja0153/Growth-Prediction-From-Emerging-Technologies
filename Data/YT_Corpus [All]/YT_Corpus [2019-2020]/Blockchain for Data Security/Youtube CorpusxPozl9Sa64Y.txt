 NOW, I WANT TO BRING THIS HOME TO ANOTHER ICONIC BRAND THAT'S RIGHT OUT OF SEATTLE. IN FACT, IT GOT STARTED A FEW MILES FROM HERE AT PIKE PLACE, STARBUCKS. STARBUCKS IS, OF COURSE, DEFINED WHAT OUR MORNING COFFEE EXPERIENCE IS. AT THIS POINT, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S SO EXCITING TO SEE IS THE SOFTWARE ENGINEERS AT STARBUCKS, THEIR AMBITION, THEIR COLLABORATION WITH THEIR COLLEAGUES IN THE BUSINESS SIDE AND PRODUCT MANAGERS AND MARKETING, THEY ARE COMING TOGETHER COMPLETELY TAKE WHAT IS THAT ICONIC EXPERIENCE OF STARBUCKS AND INCORPORATE DIGITAL THROUGHOUT. EVERYTHING FROM WHAT THEY ARE DOING WITH BLOCKCHAIN AND SUSTAINABILITY, IoT IN THE COFFEE MACHINES AS WELL AS AI. AND TO REALLY GIVE YOU A GLIMPSE OF THIS, LET ME THROW TO THE SHOW FLOOR TO OUR TEAM TO SHOW YOU WHAT STARBUCKS ENGINEERS ARE DREAMING UP AND MAKING REAL. TODAY WE'RE GOING TO SHOW YOU THREE THINGS STARBUCKS IS DOING TO BETTER CONNECT WITH THEIR CUSTOMERS AND ENABLE THEIR PERSONNEL. FIRSTLY, CREATE MORE INTELLIGENT CUSTOMER EXPERIENCES WITH AN INTERNAL A.I. PLATFORM CALLED DEEP BREW. SECONDLY, SECURELY CONNECTING THEIR COFFEE EQUIPMENT TO AZURE WITH AZURE SPHERE AND, FINALLY, PROVIDING TRANSPARENCY INTO HOW THE CUP OF COFFEE YOU DRANK THIS MORNING MADE ITS WAY FROM THE FARM TO YOUR LOCAL STARBUCKS. STARBUCKS HAS CREATED A SOPHISTICATED INTELLIGENT RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM BASED ON REINFORCEMENT LEARNING MODELS THAT THEY CALL DEEP BREW. STARBUCKS CAN USE DEEP BREW INSIGHTS IN MANY AREAS OF THEIR BUSINESS INCLUDING THIS NEW MORE INTELLIGENTLY RESPONSIVE DRIVE-THROUGH, WHICH IS AN EARLY PILOT. HERE YOU CAN SEE FOUR RECOMMENDED CHOICES FOR A STARBUCKS IN SANTA MONICA. THESE AREN'T FOUR FIXED PRODUCTS FOR EVERY STARBUCKS, RATHER SELECTED BRING DEEP BREW AFTER WEIGHING MANY FACTORS. WHAT IS POPULAR AT THIS SPECIFIC STORE, THIS TIME OF DAY, THIS TIME OF YEAR, WHAT'S CURRENTLY AVAILABLE IN THE STORE, EVEN CURRENT WEATHER CONDITIONS AND MORE. AFTER I ASK THE DRIVE THRU WINDOW ATTENDANT FOR THE CLOUD MACCHIATO, THE DISPLAY SHOWS ME ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS THAT DEEP BREW KNOWS ARE POPULAR WITH THOSE WHO HAVE MADE THIS SAME CHOICE AS ME UNDER SIMILAR CONDITIONS. NOT ALL LOCAL STARBUCKS MARKETS ARE THE SAME, LET ME SHOW YOU WHAT YOU MIGHT SEE ON THE SAME DAY IN ALASKA. NOTICE THAT THE CHOICES ARE DIFFERENT, REFLECTING THE UNIQUE LOCAL PREFERENCES FOR THIS STORE AND THE RECOMMENDATIONS IF I CHOOSE THE SOUS VIDE EGG BITES WILL BE TAILORED AS WELL. SHOWING UP ON THE DISPLAY, IT LOOKS TEMPTING TO ME. STARBUCKS AWARD WINNING MOBILE APP LEVERAGES THESE DEEP BREW INSIGHTS AS WELL MY OWN PERSONAL ORDER HISTORY TO MAKE EVEN MORE PERSONALIZED RECOMMENDATIONS. DEEP BREW IS A NEW PLATFORM FOR STARBUCKS TO INNOVATE AND EXPERIMENT WITH RAPIDLY SCALABLE AND CUTTING EDGE MACHINE LEARNING AND IT ALLOWS STARBUCKS TO BETTER MEET THE PREFERENCES OF THEIR DIVERSE AND WORLDWIDE CUSTOMER BASE AND EMPOWER THEIR PERSONNEL. STARBUCKS DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION DOESN'T STOP THERE. OLIVIA IS GOING TO SHOW US HOW STARBUCKS IS CONNECTING THEIR ESSENTIAL COFFEE EQUIPMENT IN THEIR 30,000 STORES GLOBALLY.  STARBUCKS USES AZURE TO ADMINISTER THEIR CONNECTED COFFEE EQUIPMENT. THEY ARE CURRENTLY PILOTING AZURE IoT CENTRAL, MICROSOFT'S HOSTED PLATFORM FOR IoT SOLUTIONS TO CENTRALIZE SOME OF THIS WORK. AS YOU CAN SEE, THIS IoT CENTRAL DASHBOARD SHOWS DATA FROM THE LOCAL STARBUCKS STORES. THINK OF THIS AS MISSION CONTROL FOR YOUR MORNING COFFEE. BY CONNECTING THE EQUIPMENT TO IoT CENTRAL, STARBUCKS CAN MONITOR TEMPERATURE, PRESSURE PULL TIME AND MORE TO MAKE ENSURE THE FLAGSHIP MASTRENA II MACHINES IN STORES ARE PERFORMING AT THEIR BEST TO ENABLE STARBUCKS BARISTAS TO MAKE THE HIGHEST QUALITY HANDCRAFTED BEVERAGES EVERY TIME. CONNECTING THE MASTRENA II TO AZURE IoT CENTRAL ALSO ALLOWS STARBUCKS TO RUN PREDICTIVE MAINTENANCE MODELS TO MORE EFFICIENTLY OPERATE THEIR MACHINES. THIS DEVICE TELEMETRY AND PREDICTIVE MAINTENANCE ALLOWS STARBUCKS REMOTELY DIAGNOSE POTENTIAL PROBLEMS, REDUCE MAINTENANCE COSTS AND, MOST IMPORTANTLY, ACHIEVE HIGHER CUSTOMER SATISFACTION BY FREEING UP TIME TO ALLOW THEIR PARTNERS TO CONNECT WITH THEIR CUSTOMERS.  WHILE STARBUCKS COULD USE AZURE WITH ANY IoT DEVICE TO CONNECT THEIR EQUIPMENT, THEY CHOSE AZURE SPHERE, MICROSOFT'S END-TO-END SOLUTION FOR SECURELY CONNECTED DEVICES WHICH COMPRISES OF AN MCU EMBEDDED WITH MICROSOFT'S SECURE ARCHITECTURE, A LINUX-BASED CUSTOM OS AND CLOUD SECURITY SERVICE SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE THEIR COFFEE EQUIPMENT IS VITAL TO THEIR BUSINESS. STARBUCKS CAN EMBED THE AZURE SPHERE CUSTOM MICROCONTROLLER INTO NEW EQUIPMENT BUT VITALLY THEY CAN ALSO RETROFIT AZURE SPHERE INTO EXISTING MACHINES, BY PLUGGING THIS EXTERNAL MODULE INTO THE DEVICE. NO NEED TO REPLACE VALUABLE EXISTING EQUIPMENT. MULTIPLE TIMES A YEAR, STARBUCKS INTRODUCES NEW SEASONAL COFFEE. THIS REQUIRES SOFTWARE UPDATES ON THE COFFEE MACHINES. PREVIOUSLY, THIS WOULD HAVE REQUIRED TENS OF THOUSANDS OF USB STICKS TO BE DELIVERED TO STORES. NOW THE RECIPES CAN BE DELIVERED SECURELY OVER THE AIR FROM THE CLOUD TO AZURE SPHERE ENABLED DEVICES AT THE CLICK OF A BUTTON, WHICH YOU CAN SEE IN THE AZURE IoT CENTRAL PILOT, ACCELERATING STARBUCKS INNOVATION PROCESS FROM MONTHS TO DAYS AND MAKING THE PATHWAY FOR NEW INNOVATION.  STARBUCKS DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION IS EXPANDING BEYOND THEIR SEATTLE OFFICES AND COFFEE SHOPS TO ITS VAST SUPPLY CHAIN WHICH STARTS AT OVER 380,000 FARMS IN NEARLY 30 COUNTRIES. STARBUCKS RECENTLY PREVIEWED AT ITS ANNUAL SHAREHOLDERS MEETING A DIGITAL TRANSPARENCY FEATURE FOR CUSTOMERS ON ITS MOBILE. WITH IT, WE CAN SCAN A CODE ON EACH BAG TO SEE AN IMMUTABLE RECORD OF THE COFFEE'S HISTORY STORED ON AZURE BLOCKCHAIN SERVICE. WITH THIS, CUSTOMERS CAN SEE -- LET ME JUST GET THIS UP. SO WITH THIS YOU CAN SEE WHERE THE COFFEE BEANS WERE GROWN. STARBUCKS SUPPORTS EFFORTS FOR FARMERS IN THOSE REGIONS, WHEN AND WHERE THE BEANS WERE ROASTED, TASTING NOTES AND MORE. STARBUCKS AMBITION IS TO USE THIS TECHNOLOGY TO PROVIDE GREATER EMPOWERMENT FOR COFFEE FARMERS AS COFFEE DRINKERS BETTER UNDERSTAND WHERE THEIR COFFEE COMES FROM AND WHO GROWS IT. WITH AZURE BLOCKCHAIN SERVICE, DATA CAN BE REAL-TIME AND TRANSPARENT.  AS YOU'VE SEEN, SO MUCH OF STARBUCKS BUSINESS IS BEING TRANSFORMED BY DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY AND AT MICROSOFT WE'RE EXCITED TO SEE WHERE WE CAN GO NEXT TOGETHER.
