 hey everyone welcome to the session by intellipaat you might have heard of data science data science and artificial intelligence have been a really big boon to the world of information technology because this entire world is one big data problem and in this session we're gonna compare data science head-on with artificial intelligence and see where it stands well before we begin with the session make sure to subscribe to the Intellipaat's YouTube channel and hit that Bell icon so that you never miss an update from us here is the agenda for today we'll begin by taking a quick introduction to data science followed by which we can check out where data science is actually used and after this we can check out what artificial intelligences and some facts about artificial intelligence at the same time and after this we're gonna compare data science head-on with artificial intelligence and guys if you have any queries make sure to head down to the comment section below I do let us know and we'll be happy to help out of the earliest and guess if you're interested in doing an end to end Course certification in data science Intellipaat provides the data science architect master's program where you can learn all of these concepts thoroughly and earn a certificate at the same time well without further ado let's begin  the class coming to the first item on the agenda it is introduction to artificial intelligence I am sure in the past decade and in fact in this decade we've been hearing a lot about artificial intelligence right so what is artificial intelligence it is very simple guys it is a theory and the development of computer systems to basically mimic human intelligence or we can even stay at it as you know machine performing a task which would actually require some sort of human intervention there well there are many tasks where artificial intelligence at this point of time is actually a lot better than human beings for example our we have image recognition we have speech recognition process of decision making and translations when you think about all four of these basically you will know that there is some sort of human intervention required because we are trained to look at images we understand speech and our brain is logical enough to you know perform very good decision making and decision taking steps but then when we talk about translations as well pretty much we have been trained to understand different languages where we can you know translate between one to the other as well but nowadays all this can be done faster more efficiently and eventually better than human beings by making use of machines guys so where are we with artificial intelligence today when artificial intelligence has been so subtly integrated into our lives we don't even notice it is there anymore guys why do we see this stick with me for the next couple of slides and you will understand just this because when you look around you there as artificial intelligence everywhere and also you might have heard of the term such as artificial intelligence is the best career path of this decade and what not and that is a heavy statement because we are just at the start of this decade but then all the trends and all the analytics which have been performed all the surveys which have been conducted pretty much says that artificial intelligence as a career path and the technology is on the rise and it will be trending for the next ten years and as you can see artificial intelligence has the biggest community ever well if something is trending and if something is constantly on the number one spot for the last couple of years and definitely it attracts the attention of everyone right so that's basically that and then guys coming to where artificial intelligence has been used in this world well this is why I told you it has been very subtly integrated into our lives everything from Google assistant Cortana you know there's Siri there's big speeders Alexa and much more so you can talk to your phones you can talk to your computers you can talk to your machines to get so much done in fact there are smart homes being implemented for the last couple of years well all you have to do is ask Alexa to do stuff for you you know Alexa can unlock the door for you Alexa can turn on your TV home theaters and you know pretty much  turn on the lights move away the curtains and pretty much everything so when you think about it it has been there around us for a while now but then when we talk about the actual trending stuff about artificial intelligence you know when we talk about revenues especially for the next five years you can see from the graph all the way from 2016 to 2025 the amount given is in million dollars so you know pretty much it was three fifty seven million dollars in 2016 basically the revenue generated by enterprise applications from 357 it has been predicted that in 2025 it's gonna hit thirty one thousand two hundred and thirty six million u.s. dollars guys so imagine the growth as you can see on your screen I am sure you guys can figure out that it is an exponential growth just a quick info in case you guys are looking for end-to-end course certification in data science Intellipaat provides the data science architect master's program where you can learn all of these concepts thoroughly and earn a certificate in the same the link is given in the description box so make sure to check it out and without further ado let's get back to the class and then when we talk about how much research is going on with respect to artificial intelligence here is the thing in the year 2000 there was less than around one thousand one thousand technical papers which are actually published but then when you talk about 2015 and up there is skyrocket and from in fact from 15 all the way till 25 the numbers just keep going as high up as you can think as so we started all the way from 1500 in 2015 it hit somewhere around 18,000 and now you know pretty much it is very more than 40,000 papers which have been published guys so it is that nine times growing every single year is what we can tell and then coming to this slide where we're trying to see where artificial intelligence fits in well there are a couple of steps when we talk about data you know steps such as data generation data storage data processing and inside so the first steps pretty much include data generation and data storage and this gets covered all together by the world of big data guys and then coming to data processing and actionable insights well artificial intelligence here we go because when we talk about data processing we can make use of machine learning deep learning neural networks and there are many other concepts guys natural language processing you know support vector machines and much more - pretty much process all of the data and at the end of it we have very good data analysis and analytics tools which make use of artificial intelligence to give us beautiful visualizations which can be used to derive actionable insight and then finally coming to the comparison between data science and artificial intelligence on the first point we'll be discussing is the meaning well guys did as you can see is a very detailed process which basically involves and you know pre-processing the data performing some analysis on this data at the end of the analysis comes the visualizations where we'll be generating a lot of graphs a lot of visuals and at the end of it you gonna use all of this to perform some predictions on some future trends guys but then coming to artificial intelligence artificial intelligence is basically you know implementing a model and what this model at the end of the day does is that you know it is used to forecast certain future trends future events what might happen and how we can get there if that is the case while coming to point number two it's the skills well when you talk about data science again or data science you have to understand this is an umbrella term for a lot of statistical techniques a lot of design techniques and development methodologies guys well when we talk about artificial intelligence it has got a lot to do with algorithm design algorithm development efficiency conversions and in fact even deployment of all of these design and developed products guys but then coming to the next point it is the technique here is where there is a lot of difference between artificial intelligence and data science in data science you know we are actually majorly concerned about making use of data analysis and data analytics guys so data analysis where we'll be using pass data to analyze the present tense in a very simple term and with respect to data analytics we'll be using the past and the present data to predict the future trends guys that is why there is a small difference between analysis and analytics but then when we talk about artificial intelligence you need to know that you know will be concerned with a lot of machine learning concepts in this particular stage it can be machine learning it can be a lot of concepts as deep learning neural networks and much more as I just mentioned in the couple of slides ago well basically coming to the next point it is the knowledge well when we talk about data science data science was actually established you know to find hidden patterns and hidden trends in data to make more sense of the data and to make it a more friendlier entity but then we talked about artificial intelligence you need to know that you know with respect to artificial intelligence it is to make sure whatever data we are dealing with can be autonomously handled so we are trying to remove the human from the picture when we talk about artificial intelligence to give the Machine some depth some understanding of the data to let it work on its own without the human dependency guys then coming to the next point quickly is processing with respect to processing again data science does not involve a very high degree of scientific processing it involves a lot of complex procedures yes but then all of these are not the highest standards of scientific processing guys but then when we talk about artificial intelligence even as the name suggests it can be a bit more complex when we talk about artificial intelligence guys because your will be having a lot of high-level processing a lot of complex processing to deal with because at the end of the day we are trying to implement some sort of autonomy in the machines you know which eventually are telling the machines that they need to step up their game and to mimic the human brain and the human brain in today's world is the most intelligent being there is right so coming to the next one is the goal of these technologies well with respect to data science complex models you know are basically built by making use of various insights various facts about the data it's a lot of statistical techniques modeling and whatnot but then we talk about artificial intelligence well artificial intelligence was meant to build models that emulate cognition guys but emulate cognition what we basically mean as it again we're trying to make the machines self sustained enough so that where it would not require certain human dependencies and the next thing is that it will require some sort of human understanding to a certain level because that is what is required to achieve some sort of cognition and then coming to the salary of the develop words well the average salary of a data scientist is around hundred and thirty thousand US dollars per year and the average salary of an artificial intelligence developer is around one hundred and twenty thousand US dollars per year guys this is the average amount that I've mentioned to keep it to the scope of all the viewers well guys what you need to understand at this point of time is that we have kept the average number on the screen you can pretty much have access to three to four times the salaries mentioned on your screen regardless of which country you you're working from or what company you're working for as well guys so you have to know that these both carrier parts are very fun to work with very lucrative and at the end of the day you will have a lot of fun at your job at the same time so to summarize the differences between these two basically I want to say that artificial intelligence you know makes use of these loops of perspection that we call and then pretty much we use some sort of planning to become intelligent in how we handle data guys but then when you talk about data science data science is all about using patterns all about using trends and pretty much you know getting at a decision faster more efficient which might have crossed the eye when we talk about data so coming to when we should go about using data science or artificial intelligence well data science is actually preferred when you need to understand and find out patterns and trends in the data it is used if you have some sort of a mathematical requirement where you need an in depth and the faster analysis of the same it is also used when you need to perform EDA EDA is basically exploratory data analysis where you'll be hunting and pretty much going through the data to find something which might skip the naked eye as we said and then you'll also be using it if you need some sort of improvement which is supposed to be linear which you need a constant growth in your particular concepts and also it'll be required if you require very fast mathematical processing guys but then the last requirement is that you know there are a lot of industry requirements which will involve a lot to do with prediction for example if you're a sales company a product company you will be concerned with what is the products you might sell next month next year the next decade or so right so predictive analytics also helps your and data science does just that come into artificial intelligence well artificial intelligence is a requirement if you know you require some sort of precision which is out of this world guys and I mean it when I say that because AI is made to use in full potentials in full swing when we are basically trying to get the greatest degree of precision that we can and then when we talk about decision making as well artificial intelligence is known to be faster or when we compare directly to humans in many aspects so that is that and then coming to logical decision handling again guys as humans there might be emotional interference in multiple tasks where the requirement does not call for that in that case pretty much artificial will not have any swing to any emotions and it'll work fine and then handling repetitive tasks for humans can be a bit of a challenge but then when we talk about AI pretty much it can handle it with ease guys again working 24/7 365 days without any breaks or performing very good risk analysis risk-taking abilities and making sure you're efficient through all of these points that I mentioned on a screen AI does it better than humans at this point of time and then there are many other points with respect to data science and artificial intelligence as well guys well to keep it to the scope of all the viewers of this particular video we had to simplify it to present it here guys now coming to the companies which make use of data science and artificial intelligence well we have everyone from Apple Google Amazon Twitter of Facebook Nvidia and thousands of other companies who make use of data science on a daily basis then coming to the companies which make use of artificial intelligence we have everyone from Walmart labs Microsoft Genpact Accenture Ericsson KPMG and all the fortune 500 companies that you can ever think of guys so in today's world where we live data as an unruly and entity already know that but worry not concepts such as data science and artificial intelligence are in full swing to make data to make all of these processes a friendlier entity and to help us work with it faster more efficiently and with better outcomes and results just a quick info in case you guys are looking for end-to-end course certification in data science Intellipaat provides the data science architect master's program where you can learn all of these concepts thoroughly and earn a certificate in the same the link is given in the description box so make sure to check it out I hope this session was very informative for you all if you have any more points you wanna add on this data science versus artificial intelligence video or if you have any queries in general make sure to head down to the comments section and do let us know we'll be happy to help out at the earliest and on that note have a nice day
