 The internet is an intricate mesh that lets us share and connect without an emphasis on where we exist An inherently democratizing entity except it holds a registry of every site we've ever seen And tons of companies sit back and pluck the puppet strings keeping us in ecosystems, leading us to suffering Attention spans hijacked, held for ransom — converted into data that’s passed along for handsome offers Auctioned off for advertising revenue They’re literally selling you — don’t let ‘em get the best of you! ‘Cause well beyond the monetary nonsense they’re manipulating mindsets, hindering our progress Like when they came-to-bridge-the-analytics with a bit’a political activism HIT US WITH THIS TRAGIC VILLAIN! And this’ll keep on happening ‘til we commit to manifest a vision — patch the fabric of this backwards system Our data’s trapped so we’re takin’ it back and Blockchain’ll make this game a pain’a the past ‘cause only those we choose will be able to access with passes that automatically protect our assets Our data’s trapped so we’re takin’ it back and Blockchain’ll make this game a pain’a the past ‘cause only those we choose will be able to access with passes that automatically protect our assets What if an open-source nonprofit joined the running that was community funded and using its runway for a true reclamation of data — no filler Already has — let’s get ready for Pillar We’ll kick it off with the wallet the place where you can lock your data down on the blockchain you could call it a gateway in the most literal sense where you control the keys and know there are no holes in the fence And how about a browser that endows ya with the power to be shrouded from the adverts and trackers you encounter and allows ya... to control the data from your pocket then expose it to the market fill your wallet with the profits Call us ambitious, but we’re keeping it going cleaning the OS on your mobile so it’s free from the trojans And you can leave behind the concept of apps in favor of an AI that’s always got your back Our data’s trapped so we’re takin’ it back and Blockchain’ll make this game a pain’a the past ‘cause only those we choose will be able to access with passes that automatically protect our assets Our data’s trapped so we’re takin’ it back and Blockchain’ll make this game a pain’a the past ‘cause only those we choose will be able to access with passes that automatically protect our assets
