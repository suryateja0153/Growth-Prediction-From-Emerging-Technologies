webinar today first we'll take a look at blockchain and what blockchain as a service means then we will go on to discuss how blockchain as a service can work for you and what it means for your business and then we will talk about the practical application for blockchain as a service and how you can use it for your business so to start what are blockchains blockchains are blocks of data that are compiled together in an immutable form and then provided a unique identity generally after the blocks are registered they can be accessed by anyone on the network once any data has been put on the blockchain in the form of blocks it cannot be amended any further it's called a blockchain because the data blocks are linked with each other and each new block is connected and linked to the previous blocks the data on the blockchain is stored and distributed across multiple locations so that means that once data has been written into the blockchain it is made into multiple copies so in practice it means that a blockchain is a form of a distributed ledger the word ledger means a method of keeping records and blockchains have a process of distributing the record at multiple places to ensure that it cannot be amended without permission from all parties which have access to the record this also means that if a record is in the extremely rare situation that it's been corrupted in one place it can be corrected through the backup copies maintained at another place as of now blockchains can be found in various forms and there are two or three popular blockchains and they are bitcoin and ethereum which are commonly identified as linked to popular cryptocurrencies now that we understand blockchains let's go on to discuss the use cases of a blockchain in practice primarily their use in daily life can be seen through their use of a cryptocurrency as we can see in the case of bitcoin and ethereum for transfer of money like we can see for ripple and even for storage of data as we can see for common blockchain-based file storage solutions such as filecoin several popular blockchains can be used in a blockchain as a service mode by building decentralized applications upon them the first among them is ethereum which has a cross-country application as of now ethereum is popular for the common cryptocurrency ether which is based on the ethereum blockchain the second common blockchain suitable for use in decentralized applications is called hedera hashgraph hadira hashgraph is a fast platform that is meant to build scalable applications the third blockchain which can also be used through the blockchain as a service model is called ripple ripple is a financial services focused blockchain that was built to promote fast transactions on the ripple network to enable money transfer across the world the next popular blockchain is called eos eos was founded by a private company called block eos is specifically designed for the development of decentralized applications the company also distributed more than one billion erc20 tokens to spread the cryptocurrency and to increase the popularity of the eos blockchain the fifth popular blockchain that can also be considered for deployment in a blockchain as a service model is called dragonchain dragonchain was designed to provide developers with resources to develop blockchain applications very fast originally developed by the walt disney company and later put into open source uses dragon chain allows businesses to develop fast decentralized applications for use and also create smart contracts now let's move on to the focus of this webinar which is blockchain as a service so how does blockchain as a service work the blockchain as a service model came up as a follow-up to the software as a service model which we commonly call sas the software as a service model is dependent upon the fact that small companies could not access expensive software applications because they were too expensive to purchase license or deploy similarly blockchain as a service is a cheap mode for building up decentralized applications based on blockchain technology for small companies who are not able to operate their blockchain or operate their decentralized application on the blockchain without keeping in mind the cost consideration it came up as a service since developing and operating a blockchain or a decentralized application on a blockchain can be very expensive it can involve costly hardware a requirement for a fast network connection and also may need the expertise of many people who can be very expensive to employ to fulfill these needs companies came up with the blockchain as a service model which now allows customers to minimize costs by paying to use the particular blockchain and also enables them to create decentralized apps on the blockchain without worrying about the large costs that can be incurred for creating the blockchain or for operating the blockchain individually blockchain as a service model provides an option for the company to use the blockchain and run applications on the blockchain without actually incurring the high cost of establishment and maintenance companies can just pay a fee to use the service the blockchain as a service model also reduces linked operational costs since it includes services such as decentralized application development and deployment security services for the blockchain bandwidth management resource optimization and regular maintenance of the hardware which is required to continue providing the service in practice blockchain as a service is similar to a cloud service provider or web hosting provider but for blockchains and blockchain applications this shouldn't come as a surprise that many of the common cloud service providers such as amazon and microsoft also provide blockchain as a service models for businesses so what are the key advantages of using blockchain as a service the first prominent advantage is that it allows access to high performance infrastructure the deployment of a high performance decentralized application on the blockchain requires expensive hardware and is generally not possible for the small and medium enterprise with blockchain as a service it is now possible for small players to access better cloud platforms and infrastructure to deploy high performance blockchain applications and in rare cases even individual blockchains the second factor is the low cost blockchain as a service means that small businesses can have access to blockchain technology for minimal cost this means that these businesses will not need to think about the cost involved for establishing the expensive it infrastructure including servers and network equipment and the need for hiring the expert technicians the third benefit of the blockchain as a service is the ease of use the absence of the requirement to take care of any critical or complicated technology means that businesses can focus on their work without worrying about the blockchain as deployed applications and the potential for any errors which could affect their system the fourth major advantage is that there is no burden of infrastructure the customer does not have to be concerned about the need for maintaining the infrastructure this in turn means the customer can focus on deploying the particular software application that is helpful for his business without keeping in mind what infrastructure is required since he will just be using the infrastructure on rent and will not be required to set it up from scratch while paying a heavy one-time cost the final advantage of using blockchain as a service is that it promotes innovation since customers are encouraged to use more applications on the blockchain and create more use cases owed to the reduced cost of implementation this reduced cost means that the blockchain applications can be deployed and operated without worrying about the extensive infrastructure costs that can otherwise emerge for the small companies if they rapidly deploy a large number of new software packages this now brings us to the critical part of understanding the use cases of blockchain as a service while the list is endless we'll look at a few of the current important use cases of the blockchain as a service model and then we can see how they can be useful for your business the first potential use of blockchain as a service is for supply chain management this makes it useful for companies who are involved in the transportation and supply chain business and also for companies that use the supply chain through the deployment of decentralized applications with the use of blockchain as a service in supply chain management companies can ensure that all transfers and transactions of a particular good which is transferred across the supply chain is recorded on the blockchain and that there is a record of the transfer at every step which takes place at the time of recording a transaction or transfer it can also be kept in mind that special partnerships such as compliance with temperature control requirements can also be recorded on the blockchain this means that there cannot be any change later of the data whether transfer took place at a particular stage or not or who is responsible for handling a particular product at a particular point of time the use of blockchain as a service on the supply chain can pinpoint the responsibility which is entrusted to the people involved in the business and the people who are involved in every stage are now accountable for the transactions which take place on the system and are linked to them the second use of the blockchain as a service is in the trading of commodities securities and cryptocurrencies with the use of the blockchain as a service all these transactions which take place can then be recorded on the blockchain and cannot be changed any further this provides benefits for the buyer the seller and also the intermediary in between from the buyer's side this means that all the transactions that he wanted to undertake are now recorded on the blockchain and cannot be changed by the intermediary or the seller from the intermediaries perspective it is important since it records the consent of the buyer and the seller for the transaction and he is assured that the transaction will move through and from the buyer's perspective he is assured about the product to be obtained at a particular cost and he doesn't have to worry about incurring the further cost or about the seller or the intermediary declining the transactions ever took place the use of blockchain for the trading of commodities securities and cryptocurrencies has the potential to remove the possibility of any kind of underhanded transactions or accounts of fraud in these transactions as once a transaction has been initiated or processed it will be recorded on the blockchain and cannot be changed further by any of the parties involved in the transaction the next important use of blockchain as a service is for identity and access verification systems the use of blockchain on the identity front will mean that records of all persons who want to access a particular venture or a particular document are now recorded on the blockchain and the record of access and attempt to access cannot be changed later so to put things in perspective if a person wants to enter a building then his identity would be recorded on the blockchain and in the future all persons who want to know who entered the building would be able to see that similarly if there is an access attempt from the person at a particular point in time it will be recorded without any possibility of the person who wanted to access it being able to remove the logged information it can be very useful for controlling access to sensitive data or to secure premises since this means that all access requests and requests which are accepted are granted and accountability can be built on who was able to access the information or even a particular venue the next usefulness of the blockchain as a service is for the deployment of a secure voting mechanism voting mechanisms should be accurate and the possibility for a change of votes should not be available after they have been cast deployment of a specialized voting mechanism based on a blockchain fulfills this requirement since transactions that are undertaken on the blockchain cannot be changed further in case a blockchain is used as a service for the voting mechanism the vote would be recorded on the blockchain and cannot be changed later after the vote was recorded while on a larger scale this could be used for state and national elections at a smaller scale this could be used for corporations to record the votes cast in meetings such as board meetings or annual general meeting of companies in case a suitable blockchain is used for voting in any circumstances then the vote which is once cast is recorded forever and it cannot be changed the problem of double voting can also be eradicated since once the vote has been recorded the same person cannot be provided permission to vote again the second vote cannot be calculated from the same person if it is blocked after verification of voting linked to the blockchain the next use of blockchain as a service is the archiving of records property records are frequent points of debate among various people and property records must be kept safely in this process the property records of both movable and immovable properties can be stored on a blockchain without the possibility of any illegal amendments once a transaction linked to a movable or immovable property has been made on the blockchain it cannot be changed further so any transaction recording the ownership of the property or a change of ownership once recorded on the blockchain would be stored forever and anyone can access that record this can bring much needed transparency to the property record system and prevent the creation of any fake document the next is the possibility for recording any transaction record this is particularly useful in maintaining transaction records of places such as banks and for tax payments in case of a transaction involving immovable properties as well transaction records can be made in case of mortgages and transfers of any assets which take place this will help prevent loan fraud since the status of the mortgage of a property and its suitability as collateral would be known to all account audits and results of any tests can also be recorded on the blockchain without the possibility of any changes this means that virtually any record including the university examinations record medical records family records or anything which needs to be stored for perpetuity without the possibility for further changes can be recorded on the blockchain if the records are changed in the future then a mark of the change of the record can be found in the blockchain which would indicate the circumstances why the change took place it minimizes the possibility of creating any fake records or transactions and can provide much needed reliability for verification of records blockchain technology can also be used for money transfer payments it's no surprise that this technology has been considered for money transfer and payment since transactions in this field have to be recorded for perpetuity and there should not be any possibility for a change in case there are used for money transfers and payments these transactions would be recorded forever for both the sender and the receiver for the receiver they would be aware of the transfer which has taken place and of the details of the transaction signifying ease of transactions it is also useful for recording any payments made to any parties such as contractors or payment of salaries it is one of the first planned use cases of blockchain technology and in the future the use of blockchain technology for recording transfer and payment of money is expected blockchain technology can also be used for monetizing your digital content in the future it's expected that blockchain technology will be linked with access to pay-per-view services such as books movies special television programs and also for digital books audiobooks and music each access of the particular digital content medium such as books and music can be recorded and payments can be linked to the number of access attempts done or the number of times for which the music video was played or a song was played in the system this provides a reliable means for monetization of digital content and the number of access attempts recorded in the system cannot be changed downloads can also be recorded by this medium all download attempts can also be recorded by the system which would prevent the downloading of multiple copies of any valuable digital content these various use cases show that the sky is the limit for the use of blockchain as a service businesses can continue to build their use cases by building decentralized applications as they require based on a blockchain as a service model it means that in the future when blockchain as a service is considered businesses can be creative enough to build their applications which can then be installed on the blockchain businesses should contact blockchain as a service providers and experts to determine what possible use cases can be fixed for the business and how it can be optimized this can also help in cost cutting efforts for the business if you're thinking about using blockchain as a service contact empire global partners for potential use cases for your business
