 Let’s jog your memory about the blocks from the last episode The blocks containing the transactions accepted as true by the entire network are connected to each other by a strong link, called hash value creating valuable blockchain networks We learned that anyone can join the blockchain network and there is an enterprise-grade blockchain network as well Let’s find out how useful it is First, the blockchain we've been covering is a public blockchain where transactions are carried out openly As the name suggests it is a system where everyone shares transaction history without restriction and gets rewarded with cryptocurrencies in exchange for their contribution to the network But there is a blockchain where enterprises or organizations mainly exchange data called a private blockchain The private blockchain allows only authorized enterprises to have the right to read or create data and validate transactions by consensus And because enterprises join the network with a common business purpose they voluntarily invest in the necessary servers without competing to contribute to the network That's why cryptocurrency is not required But... Is it really reliable if certain enterprises and create and validate data? Is there any threat of hacking? Now, think about the security of thousands of public PCs and dozens of private PCs Do you think the private blockchain which has a relatively small number of PCs is more vulnerable? The answer is no In fact, because the enterprise must comply to the server’s high level of security each server is less likely to be hacked! So with a relatively small number of computers the blockchain data is securely maintained So how’s the private blockchain being used? Let’s say You pick up fish cakes at the grocery store You must be wondering where they came from or concerned whether they are made from fish in polluted ocean water If the blockchain is applied to the distribution of fish cakes the distribution history, from product origin to production plant, processing and vendors can be stored and checked on the blockchain The information such as country of origin production day and period of distribution are shared thereby reducing the risk of forgery This enables enterprises to manage the distribution network more transparently and allows consumers to enjoy quality products safely increasing trust between businesses and consumers Trust creates added value in the business Companies today choose to implement the private blockchain not only in distribution but also in a variety of industries such as finance, logistics, manufacturing, and healthcare In particular, to process a massive collection of data that is ever-growing day by day speeding up blockchain is as important as building trust in blockchain So, many companies are eager to speed up the blockchain A Korean company has developed the world’s first accelerator technology which speeds up transaction processing by binding transactions and has 10 times faster transaction time than before Private blockchain is definitely one of the most anticipated technologies Blockchain can transform business with unlimited possibilities based on trust How can this block accelerate innovation around the world? Aren't you curious? The more you know, the more you can trust Blockchain See you in the next episode! Promise?
