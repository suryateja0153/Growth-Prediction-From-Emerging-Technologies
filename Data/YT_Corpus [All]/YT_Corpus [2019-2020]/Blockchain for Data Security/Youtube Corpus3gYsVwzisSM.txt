 [Music] welcome back to the second lecture on blockchain architecture design and use cases so in this particular lecture we will look into the historical perspective of blockchain and how this concept of blockchain evolved over time and utilized in to different applications so a basic fundamental which is very useful in the context of blockchain so the concept is cryptographically secured hash function so a hash function is a function that map any sized data to a fixed size so for example if we define a hash function like HX X modulo n where X in n are integers and this modulo is the modular operation that means remainder after division by L so if we define a hash function like this way that means in this case you can see that whatever be the value of x the value of HX will be in between 0 and n minus 1 so these type of functions we call it a kind of hash function now one advantage of these hash functions are that we call them their one-way function that means given a xn n you can compute H X but if HX is given then you cannot say that what is the corresponding value of x you cannot say it uniquely so that is the property of a hash function and this concept of hash function is widely used in the concept of blockchain or indeed blockchain is nothing but a data structure which is built upon this concept of hash function now this hash function concept of hash function is used widely in cryptographic context and then we call this kind of hash function as cryptographically secured hash function now the properties of this cryptographically secured hash function is that first the function is one way that means given I X you can compute H X but given H you cannot compute X with any deterministic algorithm and the second property is that for any two different X 1 and X 2 this H of X 1 and H of X 2 should be different that means if X 1 equal to X 2 then you should have h of X 1 equal to H of X 2 for two different data set but if X 1 not equal to X 2 then H of X 1 should not be equal to H of X 2 so this kind of hash function we call it as cryptographically secured hash functions now this kind of cryptographically secured has function they have another important property which is called avalanche effect so what is an avalanche effect so avalanche effect is something like this so whenever we are defining a cryptographically secured hash function or sometimes we call it as cryptographic hash function so this X is called a message and HX is called a message digest and an example of tiptoe graphically secured hash function is md5 policy a 256 in next week class we will discuss about the details of the 75 panacea 256 the algorithms behind them but the Avalons property of these cryptographically secured hash function or cryptography hash function is as follows say given an input whenever you are computing the digest if you make some little change in the input you will see a significant change in the digest so for example whenever the input is fox this is the digest whenever you make the input as the red fox jumps over the blue dog you get this one extra digest now from here to here you make a small change that the earlier one was that the red fox jumps over the blue doc now you make it the red fox jumps who you are the blue doc that means from over you are making a change at who you are here then you can see that there is a significant change between the message digests so the message digests are completely different by looking into this message digest you cannot say that the original input was similar then from oh you er you if you make it ieave here you will see a completely different match message digest again by looking into these three message digests you will not be able to say that the original input text to us M similarly OB y up here if you make it over here again a completely different message digest so this particular effect in cryptographically secured has function it is known as avalanche effect and the avalanche effect ensures that just by looking into the digest it is nearly impossible to guess what was the input or even it is nearly impossible to guess that whether two inputs were similar by just by looking whether to digest are similar or not so that is an important aspect for the block chain context I will discuss why that is so okay so let us now go back a little bit about history that the use of this kind of cryptographic Alissa cured hash function in chains or blocks from where the concept of blocks and gradually evolved so the first use of this concept of cryptographically secure chain or blocks it came in 1991 in a paper by harbor and straw Netta so they have developed an mechanism for time stamping a digital document so you have a digital document and that document is edited by multiple people peoples time to type so one person has first created the document in person who has edited the document then person three has edited the document and you want to maintain a list of time Stan who ended occu meant has been first created followed by when the document was edited in a subsequent way but in a secure way so such that no people will be able to make a change in the timestamp value and that is important from the document purpose because many of the time you want to see when the document was last edited or if some people claim that I have not make any editing in the document you want to see that whether that person has actually make any edits editing in the document or so to solve this particular problem harbor ants donate that they have used this concept of chain of blocks they have not done this as a block chain but the concept is similar to blockchain so what they did so they have taken a parameters like the initial number the initial say in what order the people have accessed so it has started from 0 1 2 3 then then corresponding change value the construct so that block is something like that that whenever a client access a document you construct a block like this which contains the sequence number sequence number of axis this C 1 C 2 C 3 C 4 at the client ID who have accessed a block then the corresponding timestamp value the timestamp value and the hash value from the previous request so this is important so initially you have some hash value H 0 and whenever you are you are having this block information you have this information you make a hash of this entire information and get this value H 1 now this value of H 1 will be used in the next case so in the client to will access or make and editing in that document then again by taking these values that means the the sequence number the client who has made the editing the timestamp and hash value of the previous one you again generator hash value which is H 2 and this H 2 will be used in the next iteration who inclined 3 will access the document or make an editing in the document then from here you generate H 3 and this H 3 will be used when client four will make some editing in the document now in the advantage of this has change that if you want to make some change in the timestamp value so for example if you want to make a change in time stamp 1 that means you have to change the value of H 2 H 3 H for all the subsequent has values and people will be able to observe that all these values have been changed say for example climb two will be able to change that theatre hiss has values has been changed and that way they will be able to detect that someone time to tampering the document or tampering the time stamp value which is there so that way this concept of this concept of chain of blocks by connecting them by the hash function that was used to cryptographically securing the timestamp value of a digital document so this particular architecture looks like something similar to blockchain where you have multiple blocks of data and this blocks of data are connected by a hash value so here this second block it is connected with the first block by this h1 then block 2 it is connected to it block 1 by this hash value then block 3 it is connected to it block 4 it is connected to it block 3 by this as well so that way this individual has values are helping to commit the blocks one after another and making the blocks as tamper proof so that was the first use of this concept of chain of blocks which use earlier first ana block chip in securing this digital document now the next concept another concept which is widely used or which worked as the foundation for blockchain concept it is called a marquetry so what is a marquetry let me explain it with this example so Markley tree is a tree structure where the leaf nodes they will contain the hash of the document and every individual individual node or the intermediate node they will contain the hash of the combination of the left left child and the right child so this is an example of a marquetry so the leaf node it contains the has of the content of this document so this leaf not contain the has of b1 this leaf node contender has a b2 this leaf node contains the has of d3 this leaf node contains the has of d4 and then this level one intermediate node it contains the hash off these eight zero zero that Minister has value of b1 plus the has value of beauty d2 and a and their combined has value then at root level so this is an example of a binary marquetry in root level the root contains the combined hash off its left side and right side that means if you are making any change in this document that change will get reflected in this hash value this as well as well as this has value now if you want to secure a number of document together so here I assume that you want to secure all these four documents together then you have the advantage that you can just propagate this root value so the root value if there is any change in any one of these four documents then that change will get reflected in the rule value and that way that way you have that Vantage that you can collectively secure our number of documents together by using this concept of marquetry now this concept of markley tree was actually used in 1992 by extending the work where Dahlia people in 1991 they have developed that same kind of architecture to secure the timestamp values in a digital document and they're here in 1992 BR Harbor and stone etre they have developed a mechanism where we have used a marquetry to secure the timestamp values for a number of documents for a set of documents now there can be other uses of marquetry like in a peer-to-peer network whenever you are sharing a set of data blocks you want to ensure that the data blocks are received in an unmanaged and unaltered way so and other peers they are not lying about a block like they are sharing a block but that block is not updated blocked so in that case if you share the route has of the marquetry which we called as the murkly route if you shared the mark LaHood the murkly route ensures that none of the document has been altered another useful of the marquetry is the implementation of Bitcoin which is the most popular cryptocurrency and which actually work test foundation of this concept of liquid blockchain so in case of Bitcoin also you want to find out that the shared information which is there that informations are unaltered and no one is lying about some old transaction so there also you can construct a marquetry of all the transactions together and if someone is just denying one particular transaction your märklin due to a change and by looking into the Marklin loop you will be able to validate that whether the set of transactions have been transmitted from one node to another node in a unaltered way or not now as Bitcoin worked as the foundation behind this widespread popularity of blockchain concept let us look into the concept of Bitcoin in a in a in a bird's eye view later on I will have a detailed discussion about this Bitcoin methodology so Bitcoin it is a complete decentralized peer-to-peer and permissionless cryptocurrency which was put 14 2009 in a white paper by Satoshi Nakamoto in this paper Bitcoin appear to be our electronic cash system it was a white paper where Satoshi Nakamoto first proposed the concept of a digital cryptocurrency so the basic philosophy behind this Bitcoin architecture is that first of all it is completely decentralized that means there cannot be any central party for ordering or recording or controlling your currency just like bank or government so that was actually the concept which came from a few mathematician and the philosopher that why my money will be controlled by a bank or a government agency which is a centralized Authority so I don't want my asset to be controlled by any centralized Authority so that was a debatable philosophy so we are not going to that particular philosophy but that philosophy actually gave raised to this concept of cryptocurrency and citizen Nakamoto through this Bitcoin paper he has given a given a practical implementation of our digital currency or a cryptocurrency which is completely decentralized where no centralized authority like a our government will have the control over that currency the second property is the peer-to-peer that means the software the Bitcoin software it runs on the machines of all the stakeholders to form the system that means you do not have a central system with which all the peers are connected rather you have a complete decentralized system where individual peers are connected to each other and they shared the information among themselves and third important philosophy behind this Bitcoin idea is that it is permissionless that means it doesn't have any identity you do not require any identity to join Bitcoin network anyone can join the Bitcoin network and perform a transaction so this gives rise to an very important and interesting question that whoever you are allowing multiple parties to join in your network to join in your financial transaction system how we new ensure the security of the system because the persons who are joining because you are not authenticating them so they can be malicious or they can perform malicious activity so you have to develop a system which will sustain in the presence of such kind of malicious attack so that was the interesting concept which was put forward in this Bitcoin architecture so just a kind of a statistical information about Bitcoin that in last few years you have seen a lot of interest in Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general so it it is used as a cross country untraceable currency because there is no government control or decentralized control then the current Bitcoin price I have just recorded in on 15th March 2018 at 10:00 p.m. and the value is fluctuating significantly over days so if you look it today in Google you will possibly find out something different so on that data currency one Bitcoin was some eight zero six nine dollar the price was a zero $69 and if you look into the Bitcoin price increase that it reached on around $20,000 in the early of the last of last year and a first month of DC or and then right now we are just observing a deep in the price and if you look into the block Jim sighs the blockchain work desktop backbone of this Bitcoin architecture so if you look into the black blob Jim sighs as of December 2017 it is approximately around 149 GB so the size of the blockchain is actually growing exponentially so if you look into this website graph in the left side graph you will see that the growth of this blockchain size which actually stores the information of Bitcoin it is growing exponentially so the technology behind Bitcoin is the blockchain so that way I have discussed in the last class about the public ledger the same thing is applied here now we are storing this transaction information in a block so every block contains the transaction information those are the first block here contains the value that Alice poses that means rs.100 with her then she makes a transaction of rs.50 to Bob so the next block contains that particular transaction now Bob transact say rupees 30 to Jen so that is the third transaction and all these transactions are connected with each other through this concept of has Jen I will discuss it some time later lectures that what is a hostel so the concept that I discussed earlier in the context of digital document that similar kind of architecture where individually individual blocks are connected by a hash value so these circles are nothing but a hash value which is connecting the individual blocks together so that way this inter blockchain is coming into practice and the concept of decentralization come into practice that the copy of the blockchain is available to every individual party so Alice has her copy of the blockchain Bob has his copy of the blockchain jen has his copy of the blockchain and Eve has her copy of the blockchain so every individual parties possess their own copy of the blockchain and whenever there is a transaction those transactions are get included in the existing blockchain now one notice here that in this example I have shown one transaction in one block but in reality there can be multiple transactions in a single block indeed there can be more than thousand transactions in a single block so let us look into the Bitcoin transaction lifecycle whenever Alice want to send some money to Bob how it actually works so initially Alice she opens her Bitcoin wallet and provide the address of Bob and amount to transfer and sense that so this is an example Bitcoin wallet so Alice gives the address of Bob here and then provides the money to transfer and did he press the send button so once he pressed the send button then the wallet it constructs the transaction so so it makes the transactions like say Alice to Bob of rupees 50 a transaction like that and rich transaction is signed using Alice private key so this concept of signing so this is the concept of digitally signing a document so we call it as digital signature so by applying the digital signature technique so I will discuss the concept of digital signature later on by applying the digital signature technique so Alice sort of wallet it signs the transaction made by Alice and broadcast it over the network so as you know that this entire node network is a kind of peer-to-peer network everyone is connected to each other's to some it's say decease Alice so Alice wallet it makes or it broadcast this transaction over the network so all the nodes in the network or at least the majority of the nodes in the network receives that particular transaction now this network node they validate the transaction based on the existing blockchain now that is another interesting fact about blockchain so so in this slide we have seen that this blockchain individual block chains they contains the all the transaction records so whenever Bob is sending this transaction of rupees 30 to Jane and this information is broadcasted to all the node so the information also reaches to if that Bob has made a transaction to Jane of rupees 30 and by looking into this block shape.if can verify that whether this particular transaction is a valid transaction or not so she finds out that well Bob has received rs.50 from Alice so currently bob has raised 50 with him so bob is legitimate to make a transaction of less 30 to James so this transaction is a valid transaction so did that way by looking into the existing blockchain you can validate whether the transaction is a legitimate transaction or not now once this transaction is validated then this transaction are propagated to spacer some special node called miners and the task of the miner is to include the transaction to duct to the next block that will be mined that means the task of the miner is collecting all the transactions from the client which was there for say last 10 minutes and their task is to construct a new block and then apply a mechanism called mining I will discuss the mining mechanism later on apply the mechanism of money to connect that block with the existing blockchain so now we are we are coming to the miners so the miner they collect all the transaction all the transactions for a time duration say for 10 minutes and the miners day construct a new block and tries to connect it with the existing blockchain through some kind of cryptographic hash computation so in a blockchain concept as I have mentioned earlier that every block is connected to the next block truce up cryptographic hash function say this is B 1 and this is B 2 so B 1 is connected to B 2 with some hash function and ideally what is that just to give you an hint that whenever you are computing this hash function for B 2 this hash function will contain some parameter along with the hash value which was there for B 1 so that way this B 1 it connects the next block B 2 and the task of the miner is to solve this has problem in a difficult to it so this has problem which is given to the miners it is a computationally difficult problem and that computation and difficult problem every miner needs to solve and one of the miner are sometime more than one miner they solved that problem and they are able to connect that block with the existing blockchain so that this is again I am saying that this is a broad overview of the entire methodology the details methodology I will discuss later on this is just a kind of introduction to you about how the whole system works and once this mining is complete then the Huss is obtained and the block is included in the existing blockchain and this updated blockchain is propagated in the network that means every nodes every participating node in the network they receives a copy of this updated block symbol and once they receive the copy of the updated blockchain then Bob also receives that copy of the updated blockchain and once Bob receives that copy of the updated blockchain so mr. by looking into the blockchain with Bob can find out well inside that updated block there is a transaction from Alice to Bob of say rs30 so Bob can view this transaction and once Bob is able to view this transaction Bob can update this value to it to his wallet so the current value of Bitcoin that has been transferred from Alice to Bob that gets reflected to the wallet of Bob so this transaction gets reflected to Bob Bob can validate the transaction so this way the entered Bitcoin transaction works that whenever Alice wants to make a transaction of rupees 30 to Bob and at the backbone the blockchain ensures that this particular transaction is a legitimate transaction or itis a valid transaction so every individual user or in the individual node in the network they've maintained their local copy of the blockchain and as you understand that you need a complicated mechanism to ensure that all these local copies which are available to the individual nodes they are indeed the updated copy or the legitimate copy so and are that they are the kind of valid copy so once every node across that well they have a valid copy of the blockchain and they receives a new transaction so they can validate that new transaction against this copy of the blockchain and then the miners they collect all such transactions which are the valid transaction and the miners also have the capability to check the validity of a transactions so once the miner takes the validity of the transaction then the miner can apply this mining process where they solve a computationally difficult cryptographic problem where their task is to compute a hash function but not a very simple hash function rather a difficult hash function and that difficulty level basically governs the complexity of the system so once the miner salts that particular hash function using this has functioned the new block is added to the existing block and that way the blockchain size of the blockchain gradually increases so as the transaction comes in new blocks are generated and blocks are added to the blockchain and this updated copy of the blockchain is propagated to all the users and every user can see that whether there is any transaction which is intended for themselves inside a block and if there is any transaction which is intended for themselves inside a block they can include that transaction in the in their wallet so that way the transactions are performed with the help of a blockchain so you can see that there is no such centralized Authority like a bank which is controlling this entire transaction radar this intra transaction is controlled in a complete distributed way and there are many nice properties or interesting properties in this mechanism that we'll discuss in subsequent classes so based on this blockchain concept blockchain initial concept here was this concept of blockchain 2 which was based on this Bitcoin revolution so the concept of blockchain gradually applied to multiple other sectors like the academia industry and many of the startups it is termed as blockchain 2 and this concept of blockchain two that was extended for another interesting application which is known as Mart contract so a smart contract is that a smart contract basically provides a decentralized platform which can be utilized to avoid the intermediate very inner inner contract so when two persons are coming to a contract we have something like a legal advisory who is basically controlling this kind of contracts so there are some kind of middleman so with the help of this kind of blockchain environment you can avoid the intermediaries or the middleman's so this concept we known is known as smart contracts so the smart contracts provides on faster cheaper and more secure way for executing the contracts in a decentralized environment so in the next class we will go to the details of these smart contracts in details and we look into that how you can develop applications using blockchain which will facilitate the use of smart contracts so we will discuss again during the next class about the smart contract technology by utilizing the blockchain environment so thank you
