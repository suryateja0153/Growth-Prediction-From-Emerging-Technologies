 [Music] like the punchline is for everybody here content that actually brings value to the end-user game over this portion is like with me so I think this is one you need to get selfish like you'd ask your question hiring is guessing firing is no like you got to go fast that's how you get [ __ ] done that's a bigger step out this is the television and the television is the radio support these [ __ ] think so my question is how do you look at how much you should spend on the content production side everything you're doing on your personal brand I didn't really touch my personal brand we're a Content business ourselves versus working on product generating more revenue to fuel that piece my answer to that is as much as possible on the content side financially and time but not to over judge yourself if you're not doing it that's fine like I don't dwell but just so everybody understands like at the end of the day brand is what wins it always has it always will it's how everybody makes a decision like literally you cannot imagine how many decisions you're making on a daily basis solely on brand nothing to do with sales yet everybody so over indexes on sales it's why you know I've been learning a lot about the franchisee world just because the keynote I gave and just a lot of inbound and like when I started realizing how much a new franchisee pays these brokers to get somebody it speaks the same thing instead of spending those tens of thousands some of these companies are select when I looked at I'm like my god like 40% Commission 80% Commission tens of thousands of dollars I'm like I can send a single tweet and put 80 people into a franchisees right now when you build brand you build leverage you know veiners a 200 million dollar enterprise and we don't do new business well at all we don't win RFPs we're bad at it we're bad at it because and it's not because Andreea or me or and it's just it's not our DNA it's just car biggest clients just give us the business because of brand and by the way when you do personal brand you actually lose 20 or 30% of the action because some people don't like you when you actually just build a brand that's a logo it really gets going you know for me I want to do personal brand and at some level like I'm just not driven by money enough to like always make the financial decision over the happiness decision but there's nothing that is more leverageable for you than the brand of your company or you as individuals where people get caught as they fake it until they make it where everybody gets caught is they place somebody on the internet that they're not in real life that has been the reason I've made it so I would tell you that this is a very simple game of how much profit do you want to take home at the end of the year the reason I've always been able to scale and get to everything is because I've always made it at the cost of my own personal financial impact so you can if you're willing to make less money you know or or you can if you realize actually I don't like this like I'm not into it I'm more of a product guy I'm more of a product gal I'm more into getting that like self-awareness is imperative like you can't imagine how little time I spend on Finance are legal I mean for all I know mark you're getting our lawyer owns this company he just puts things in front of me and I just sign you know like you know but that's why you know it's funny to have hair like coms and new business like that's what I or HR like these are the things I micromanage more at least have opinions on I actually don't micromanage but I have opinions or occasionally I'll have a dictatorship decision but I think you need to first be self-aware are you not doing it because you don't like it or it doesn't come natural or are you doing it because of whatever financial requirements you're looking for whether that means you want to take money off the table each year in bonus and do something in your life which is amazing I don't judge what somebody does or is it because you're trying to flip your company and trying to maximize EBIT uh for a multiple which is all okay awesome I'm building businesses in perpetuity and I'm playing for legacy and I don't want to buy anything in real life so think about why my advice is always pour it back in if you understand those are my North Stars but let me say this building personal or brand for your business is the single most important thing in business it's the single most important thing it's number one two three four five and six especially as the internet continues to commoditize everything everything will be commoditized everything you do can be sold cheaper different better it is your brand that plays in the end McDonald's sells a lot of french fries every day I don't make the best french fries every day matters you don't want to be in the sales business and that's where everybody for the most part is because then you're just in a hamster wheel of only as good as your last sale you want people coming to you the only way can do that is through brand what's amazing about the way we can build brand now is everybody here can do that by providing value for the ecosystem that they're trying to reach versus making a clever commercial how'd you guys get here it's a super meta answer I didn't call you I mean cold email you matter like they mounted um basic [ __ ] that we do wrong it doesn't matter you're gonna want if you want something you'll get it we don't want to do dumb [ __ ] but but like but dumb [ __ ] is always trumped whereas like other people have to have everything perfect because they have no brand they just have the luxury of the quick moment of a sales pitch and the lack of friction to Oh migrate the singular strength my friend Tom Bell you nailed it for me I never thought about it singular strength I have singular is my inability to judge myself I mean hurt you you felt this right away in our first meeting you literally our first meeting how it runs calms now for us she's like I'd like to we changed the mission statement on our website it was like what the coolest one like this is maybe the most important thing that people it was a 38 second meeting like okay I was dying to think about what was going through her mind those are like seven-month processes and other companies because you come from a world which is most of the world where that literally people would have seven hour meetings about one adjective it's like your first week in a company you're talking to like the over-indexing face and founder of the company like it's a complete reversal of what one would think but it's because most things don't matter once you establish a brand I really think you should lean into it I think it will help your business but it takes time and I think the biggest thing for a lot of you novice I'm giving answered that it helps a lot of you as I keep doing this the intent of the content is imperative the singular reason we win and I win is because not a single piece of content I ever put out has any intent to sell sneakers wine for DS or vaynermedia not interested and people feel it what's that you know people call [ __ ] radars but we're animals right it's like a bat can sense things a dog can sense things like we inherently have been sold to for so long at this point that it's of course you can be tricked for a second because usually you're the kind of person that wants to dream and not put in the work the reason diet pills and quick rich schemes work is because people don't want to put in the work you want to look like Nick do eat well and work out every day take out your shirt Nick but you know what I mean like it's crazy there's a trillion dollar health and fitness industry and the math is as basic as [ __ ] eat well workout sleep but we don't want that we want to eat [ __ ] cheeseburgers and [ __ ] potato chips and get the results and that's how I think about business this answer is a hundred percent right we live in a world where there's so much supply of everything we do and it will continue to grow because with what I understood 15 years ago was the internet was gonna be the middle and everything was gonna be commoditized and the only thing that wasn't gonna be commoditized was brand and then the ability to execute a product that was at least within the circumference of the competitive set but this ideology of like we have the best product no you don't you think you do just like everybody thinks their kids are the cutest did America say that you're Miss America you know so that's how I think about stuff how do you look towards growing you have to be live off of memberships and in a very competitive tight space great like they want me to move in into a place where there's six other places around the corner yeah I mean look and it's fun to have something franchise wars in the building like this has become such an intriguing space for me first of all what's really interesting is when you're a franchisee there's a I'm trying to calibrate in my mind this half pregnant entrepreneurship DNA and it's not a negative I hear you know what I'm actually never gonna say half pregnant again I'm not kidding because it because there's an I use it as an cuz I love entrepreneur like it's a very interesting idea where you're in between employee and entrepreneur like that's why you signed up for it like like to me the thought of being at the mercy of the franchisor is devastating I don't even have a board I don't have investors like I don't know what to do because if I think this is right like this is why I hated school so I hate anything that contains me right like even even like comms I'm like eh I hope you know what you're signing up for like you'll tell me but like I have no idea what's gonna come out of my mouth you know like I think that's I think look first of all anything the franchisor wants you have to be empathetic this is not a negative it's in their best interest and that's fine that's amazing that's business but you have to a that'd be the first thing I would calibrate if you're my brother be like okay let's first understand that they want you to do that because they want you to do that there's nothing to do with you you're a commodity even though like it's just the truth it's okay I think that's not a negative that's number one and number two what are you able to do that distinguishes yourself that still stays within the lines of the franchise ORS rules I don't know enough about CrossFit's rules every franchisor has different rules of like how hardcore how loosey-goosey they all run date but I would have thank you for training yeah I mean sure but I'm also working on rebranding obviously so that we have more flexibility and experiences we can create and they allow that okay great little do the Department is username this we've really haver username and it's a marketing agreement yeah it's license not yeah literally yeah I mean I think that um I think that if you're talking about there's two separate conversations here one is the location right is just a classic supply and demand conversation is the rent worth the natural foot traffic you can or the way I now think about it which is not 1987 anymore where you just get the traffic because there's a Whole Foods or a mall or what-have-you it's how much do I like the two mile radius of Facebook and Instagram ads against it that's how I think about it now I think that's a really what I would do Tim Ferriss did something super smart when he did the 4-hour workweek I mean I heard about it like 13 years ago and to this day I still think about it because I didn't do it I wish I at some level it's so smart and I do it with my content I'm doing something incredibly interesting lately with my content we call it the Machine I'm running the same video on Instagram with seven different thumbnails and titles seeing which one / indexes and then then I'm posting it organically on my page and if they've done much better I think one thing you could do is almost run an ad on Facebook and Instagram on a fake gym that doesn't exist and say coming soon and just seeing what people react to and be like and just getting a sense of like I would almost run a fake gym with maybe another popular brand whether it's Equinox or berries or you know whatever or in you know orange theory or whatever and run it on like 15 different like like mile radius or like if you have four options of locations and just seeing where there's more demand I mean for a thousand bucks you can get a read on if there's more demand or not from operation so things like when did you guess like did you get a chief operating officer what kind of works but also what didn't work and kinda why I suppose what um it's great question so I always over hire always because I'm anticipating growth and that's how you grow you know well you'd like to think that you're getting the clock you know but yes to your point like I was like you seem nice you're hired like that was like literally how it went for like the first 300 people because I was willing to fire and and and I don't like the fire I'm kind of like I'll turn this bad boy around like that kind of DNA so it was a really interesting like double play on my side which is I hired I talked about hiring fast and a firing faster but I also don't love that firing because I was so into being operational and trying to fix in parallel I think a lot of this comes down to knowing yourself first of all so I'll give you a very good piece of advice I genuinely believe that I've seen this everywhere hiring around you on the things that you don't want to be doing is unbelievably powerful I couldn't be more bullish on it if all of you right now just truly take a step back and say what do I do every day that I don't want to be doing and hire for that I couldn't be more the reason the CEO has never worked for me not my dad not my brother not James Orsini is because I'm an operator and I love it and I'm willing to leave money on the table because I know from a CEO I could probably generate more top of the funnel business but I love the challenge of operating it's the game I like it I'll Rick should be there or Susan should take that account or will create this prime of operating I'm good at it that's why we're not Boehner below like you know when you hunt you got to be able to farm it and when you know how to operate you know that's where most entrepreneurs lose they can get the business but sheer he can't operate it right so I would highly recommend hiring around you so if you're thinking about CEO Oh are you just so overwhelmed or are you trying to be more physically out there but then if you're trying to be physically out there look nothing excites me more for b2b businesses today then running content ads on LinkedIn against the employees of the people you know you're trying to reach like your business is so uh dude as somebody who's been in b2c and b2b BB's easier like when you know who you're trying to reach it's easier I don't know who the [ __ ] drinks wine or wear sneakers like but when you know that literally the companies you're trying to reach you can do run ads right now against employees of that on LinkedIn and all you have to do is make content that is valuable to them instead of saying sign up now instead of an infomercial make a b2b magazine could be even not even about your own product like we go to speak so the reason I'm here is because this big conference coming up happens every year American Association conference we have a twenty by thirty booth we're taking a video team with us but we're going to the second you know obviously you know enough about me to to know this the second everybody here can be the voice of the industry and bringing value to everybody in the funnel the quicker they win it's what I learned with Wine Library TV I started that to do QVC and with in Episode one within the episode intuitively I needed to become the Wine Spectator not QVC and it changed the course of my life and I've done it ever since guys there are hundreds of agencies that literally just watch my content and get clients that we're trying to get with the same words I probably think about what's going like how much I believe in it it's coming out of my own short-term pockets I'm really giving my best [ __ ] but yeah I mean but think about how interesting that is like right like it's really it's a really like it's kind of not that I'm knowledgeable enough about the Bible but like I get it thrown at me it's like quite biblical it's like just like it's truly that so like you you're the greatest thing you could do at this DC conference besides be successful and do your thing is to listen to the problems that they're all facing and put out content that addresses it or makes fun of it like you couldn't have met I the amount of two minute videos made that is like a skit by comedians that make fun of library culture is zero every single [ __ ] person in the industry would share a video that was funny about that 11 truths in your business you know what I mean like the cliche [ __ ] like the Dewey Decimal System [ __ ] yeah like that like you should like you know like if you guys did a Dewey thing if you like dug up Dewey like the punchline is for everybody here content that actually brings value to the end user game over yeah if you didn't back to CrossFit I mean the big cliche thing I hear all the time is like people get hurt if you just put out a content series and that might struggle with corpora and I have empathy for that but if the content series in theory was just like how not to get hurt and like just deep knowledge on like the cliche 44 reasons why people do you get over a competitive you lose your form I don't know what the [ __ ] I I believe in that [ __ ] I believe I put out so much content with the hope that nobody ever hires us I'm not kidding cuz enough people will and that's how you build brand and sentiment and like carmine like a whole lot of other things plus there's one thing that I always have which is I know that I'm always gonna be good at emerging trends I'm not scared to give away all my social media advice because I know I'm gonna be great a voice and AR and machine learning and blockchain and like it's I'm the same thing just you know you're welcome yep the first one is where I get mixed up a lot is that we have two audiences right so we're selling franchises to $1,000,000 yep yep yep yep yep yep so creating or how to differentiate our company to these different audiences and then the second piece is you know we've been I think one thing you can do is the logo could focus on the end user dressers and then the humans whether you or somebody else could focus on the franchisees you see where I'm going that's a first of all you or somebody and the logo the company should have separate accounts there's a banner media account there's Gary B there's Wine Library right so if you think about the nature of it the the brand can really focus on the end and you can focus on the b2b part with occasional reference to the end look I'll be honest with you I'm also extremely comfortable with the account doing both some people may find it intriguing on the backend business stuff you know it's not the end of the world most of this stuff is not about organic anyway it's about paid amplification so but I think there's a natural for you guys to have a human face for the media yes we've been creating content putting it out there with very little great but like how do you set the benchmarks for your team to hold them accountable though how do you know when to fire like you know if I say hey our socials are digital states now like I write business results and we're doing good but I don't think we're not gonna now to the park with me so fire yeah there's no bench but like that's an owner that's a she or he decision what you're learn is you know it's like breaking up with a boyfriend and then thinking two boyfriends down the line like was I wrong about Rick because he's been a lot better than Stan and John maybe I [ __ ] up that happens but that's the true answer right to me it's like are you happy with your business results from the thing and if you're not business results not how many likes or shares or followers business results right and if not that's attributable to that you break up with Rick and you just hope that that was right yeah I haven't seen anyone as well trying to get the 1 million dollar people into the funnel or as well on the end-user ok million dollar investment versus you know like a crossfader a fitness you know the owner/operator models of a hundred two hundred thousand to invest are pretty easy organically but that million dollar investor it's been a little harder to tap into organically it makes sense because I think to get that person you need to be making a show about the whole concept of franchisees not about your specific content right you see where I'm going like you need to become the back of ink magazine and you know like you know what I mean but I mean but but like you need to become ink yeah like this is where I keep going into like that like you need to interview like 365 days a year somebody who successfully run a franchise to inspire the people to listen to that to then get into the potential funnel of considering you correct no it's not and so you make that and you run that on LinkedIn right and then on Instagram you see what I mean mine is stay with the brand move on to grand ideas so we have a brand that it's called Cebu it's our private label here care it does have its own website it has no brand awareness we have links from that platform on to our other salon sites so we do a little business online and a little bit more now that you know everybody understands what a CTA is an email community but but the issue is could we create something bigger and better that actually solves to a bigger purpose not just selling cebu but it allows any brand to have a bigger site to be able to launch their brands as long as you as you long as you understand how big of an ambition the sentence that just came out of your mouth is what you just said in that sentence is usually a 50 million two hundred million dollar funded startup with deep two-way marketplace DNA the answers you could but there's you know people sometimes ask me hey Gary God you were so early at all these tech companies this is not like why don't you have an app why don't you have a company I'm like because I don't want to because I don't think it's my strengths I don't think I'm the founder of uber or Facebook or Twitter like you're you're also talking about at a time where Shopify and Amazon are gonna grow at scale so for you to create a third-party marketplace like an infrastructure to be a wordpress e-commerce imagine you're going into shark territory which you could win within a small niche i but you have to make sure that you guys have the DNA to actually like as long as you like notice I'm jumping in because I want to make sure you realize that that's not like everything so far has been like a pass away comment like that is a huge like meaning not to undermine it's like it's doable yours is doable if you're gonna but you're gonna build a billion-dollar business that like that's like a real big thing and I think people throw around this theory very nonchalantly in the business world every day I get a oh we're gonna be a marketplace I'm like there's like six marketplaces like you know it's like like yahoo lost being a marketplace like you know like so yes i just want to make sure that you understand like I'm giving you a reaction to make sure you understand how grand that is I believe you I'm sure at this time when it's never gonna be easier or less friction to do short term sales through the Shopify and Amazon ecosystem it's not about like it's not the macro thesis it's the thesis at this moment in the emergence of those two specific platforms that gives me just pause to like think about it but go ahead speak to me about that when you said I just want to make sure I'm following along you mean how relevant that one brand will be yeah so look I mean it's it's not a very complicated thing to your point you just have to understand if you're looking to become you know a platform or a product are you gonna be smart water are you gonna be it's not Walmart but it's a QVC right they're just two very different things I will say this I believe that we're walking it's ironic I'm gonna take a little bit of a different stance I think we're walking into the golden era of the capability of direct to consumer brands at scale you're gonna be competing but the opportunity to have the leverage I mean think about the nature of being a product you were always at the mercy of your distribution you're not going to be and so that's exciting it's now how good is the product and how good are you at building a brand around a product versus how good are you at building a platform and building a brand about the platform I think that becomes the debate but I wouldn't run away from being a brand because a lot more brands are coming I would try to see I see the positive in DTC more so than a negative I really do because because the ability to compete against everybody else's DTC is I think more of a fair fight than competing with the hope that Sephora carries you there was major toll booths that kept all the margin the retailers have won the leverage game over the last decade so I think that's the question I wouldn't I'm excited about DTC I just think you have to be the best olive oil you know the phrase you have to be a top I think the long tail of DTC is more fruitful than a long tail of marketplace see what I'm going that's my point of view on it and I'm spending a lot of time in that world a lot I think at least for us we've got 10% of our sales we've got a 500 million sales 10% comes a product from service right the 10% more profitable better margin for us we have a Schneider own haircut recom we tried to have we build that name and the thought was do you build a different site that allows you to attract more eyeballs to it to sell our product off of versus hair better calm or you could just what is the brain called suck what do what about sick about building we do that that's correct but we so our concern is the 10% we sell right now you can buy anymore Amazon you can buy from website or Paul Mitchell you can go to Amazon buy our concern is are going to lose that 10% because you're gonna lose it if you're not buckle about it but if your site has an added layer of value like a club that creates content or access I think you should immediately start creating a weekly monthly yearly special SKU only available in your world so like if you're formulating new products you know one things I'm trying to push a lot of my CPG brands is to create a super premium version it's like I'm literally trying to sell like a hundred dollar ketchup that only comes out during the holidays you can only buy em they're calm so I think what's amazing is I think this is fun my natural DNA is always to look at the offense of scenario versus the defense your defensive point of view is absolutely correct there's far less friction to buy from Amazon when you're buying your deodorant and you're you know peaches and then throw yours in but you actually [ __ ] own the product so your ability to create a club so if you bind yourself you're in the club and I have no idea what you want to add on to that because you have no more time and I'm trying to remember so you got this product then you have salons right right and then you have your own salons of this product but the salons are yours I mean look in theory you could tell the end consumer that they get a 5 percent discount on their salon work if they buy the product on your site you've all the advantages I'm a big fan of [ __ ] the Amazon before it [ __ ] you that's what I do with Facebook Facebook didn't [ __ ] me and was like Facebook I built myself off of it you have the leverage you can use people you can use Amazon to get people into your ecosystem and then remark it to them as the brand by printing something on the back of the [ __ ] bottle that says come join club see bootleg it like so I think it's a concept of I don't think it's as black and white as the convenience of the lack of friction of shipping or cost I think it's what are you gonna do to the product and what are you gonna layer as bells and whistles added value that forces everybody I actually genuinely believe that the smartest brands are gonna [ __ ] Amazon not the other way around if they're very thoughtful to some of the stuff I just refer to when you build an added value around buying it from you at the same price you win now you can use Amazon as your gateway drug to acquisition that's what I would do other question I has is we're gonna talk later on again about culture yes we have a very strong intentional culture founded business by Dennis Ratner and he's really created that culture which we've got a lot of tenuring in our business but we're projecting it out over the next 10 15 20 years from a legacy perspective and how do we keep that culture and that we actually make it stronger so any recommendations on how you believe culture here for example what you're trying to do a great legacy and what you'd recommend you know you've already kind of won if even if there's ninety eight percent let alone one hundred percent truth behind your statement you've already won the ambition for legacy already changes behavior I think this is a big game of firing I think the biggest challenge for people that look like me and sounds like what you guys have is do you have the stomach for short-term financial pain by firing the most productive but people that don't actually bring value to the culture it's a very simple game of like do you live your truth it's really easy to maintain culture choose culture over money I really believe it I live it I watch it I seen in companies that I push it into if they're an investment of mine I really think it's you know it's scary when something like that is so simple but it's um it's like religion do you follow it or don't you like and where you choose to bend becomes the variable of how good the culture is but culture is made up of the humans that are in it at the time you know and like Wenders lore like founder Rick Thompson or Susan Magoo she always whoever's the executive of running that you know whoever runs vaynermedia when I go and buy smart water to become a CEO and that's what's gonna happen the next chapter this company is I'm gonna buy something when the world melts and when I go run Mountain Dew or stickers or Puma or whatever the [ __ ] I buy I'm gonna be at the mercy of her or his capability to uphold what I believed in and so I think you make it clear that's why you know you know it's funny to think about America this way right like how we interpret the Bill of Rights or the Constitution becomes obviously very intriguing that's what we becomes our culture but having it is already the starting point but I think it's a one I believe culture is one big game of do you have the ability to fire the most productive the worst person I really believe in that yeah but the way I think I get there is by that in-between move I really do I really think the reason I built Boehner and the reason it's built this way and unique in its way is I think I've built something that no like if I ran if I truly bought smart water tomorrow like it would be a much bigger company after four years based on all the things we've done so I'd like to get back to the concept we were talking about that company brand versus personal right now our social media content is kind of focusing on both we've got our our company brand that I focus on probably more than our ease personal brand and it really is the brand of the company makes sense so my question is my time is limited I only have so much to put into it which one makes more sense to put more time into which one is doing better from your perspective are you doing it yourself on your own page at all or whatever you guys so yeah you know what what is always the word I mean what Harry it was like I'm sure this fun to have her in a room like when you look when you're in our industry as she is and you look at Vayner from the outside people believe the vulnerability is it's so much about me and not enough about Vayner and there's real truth to that if you're an executive at SmartWater you're like am I getting a company is it Gary like these are the things you need to think about at the same token when you kind of start peeling away and you start realizing this is a company that doesn't have to win business through RFPs and you think about all the dollars you start having a really you have a more complicated to be you know for me for example this is this why I'm bringing this up the thing I'm probably most proud of in the ten years that I've run this company and built this company is my ability to trick the market big it is my biggest fear was if anybody in the big boy and girl world of advertising understood how big what I was building was going to be that they were gonna focus on it and you know I'd never competed against multi-billion dollar international companies starting from zero that's that's a challenge because if one really understood me they could just throw money at it like if literally if I was the competitor of vaynermedia five years ago I would have literally emailed every single person on LinkedIn that worked here and said what's your salary I will pay three times more and it would have been the right business decision so I've purposely not built vaynermedia's brand because I needed the market my competitors to underestimate it and continue to think it's Gary and a bunch of interns like it's who is this charlatan and like this can't be real that was our advantage from the outside it's too much about me right but what nobody knew from the inside is I have no clients I've built a scalable company you know building up Gary you would think oh [ __ ] every clients gonna want Gary I don't talk to any of them so I was able to successfully create me as a top of funnel awareness but then when it became a real meeting she or he on the other side the CMO knew right away I'm not your account person you can be I can be in the backbone business we can have lunch once a year but I'm the CEO and executive this I mean I don't service your account you're buying vaynermedia you're not buying Gary that comes down to how he's running his business right now where you guys are at scale right so I guess those are the questions are you servicing the business is it a vulnerability right now is it small enough where we can keep leaning into what is actually working do you do a good job once the customer comes into the funnel to realize it's not him or is it still him at this point which is super fine too that's the right formula for that does that make sense so to the extent just go that one further to the extent that it isn't me doing the servicing where does that fall into it is not you doing the servicing okay that's very clear early in the funnel like the conversation happens right it's not gonna be but I still do close almost all I get that and so did I um then I'd probably still I would say this if you are fortunate enough to have a face that has all the right personality traits I'm sure you know Harry it's gonna continue for like I'm not looking to suppress my people into the press I just don't want anybody know who the [ __ ] we are like if they think they're like like there's strategy to it so like I think if you still have all the right characteristics I think if you're fortunate to have a founder if she or he has good characteristics and it's not about ego and insecurity and all those weird things then you then you ride that personal brand because it converts better a human face converts better than a logo often the struggle is also his time because he's the CEO and he's doing all these other things his time is extremely limited that's why I created document not create yeah you can bounce the riff on that or where we show a little bit there is sort of in the b2b world right so so we're small company but you know what over 40 people don't be to be worlds some interesting parallels like our markets as we're looking for companies headquartered very nearby is a limited market right there's may be like a thousand companies that could potentially be our clients lovely so we engage there but the people that we connect to are generally CFOs and CEOs who care very little about the detail of how we execute but care a lot about the outcomes that they get so we I find that we struggle or I struggle to see the document versus create when I felt a lot of the documentation is a super interesting to them necessarily makes a ton of sense so to that point I agree with you I don't think you should document create which is why we created the model around the podcast or the show there's two ways to go and I think when you start inviting them I mean so you're saying it's literally just like nothing excites me more and there's a couple here than to having a regional business to do a show around because then you get to host a party you I mean literally literally you guys should literally have every Sleater CEO and CFO on your show once you host a party you win like you know I've send a lot and maybe you've caught on under my content like I call this the high school party roll like if you're the kid in high school who's lucky enough that your parents travel on weekends and you're like a c-level popular kid the second you throw the junior year party at your house you go from Osito an a-minus in popularity because you're letting the a-pluses make out at your house so where do we figure out how to get that what that good is like do a show where you interview businesses in the Hartford area literally once you establish some macro show like whether you call it you know New England this or Harford that create a macro framework for it and now you're emailing literally the people you want to do business with saying we're intrigued by your leadership we'd love to have you on the show versus emailing them saying we want your business scale it's even better like they don't get any [ __ ] love like what even what [ __ ] podcast wants them on their show nobody know though really this is really quite crazy I know you know it you're feeling and intuitively like imagine a world you know this played out extremely for me real quick just to bounce around a little bit on the pure Wow and and 1:37 side we have podcasts we just launched the show called the CMO podcast I got Jim Stangl who's like the former CEO of Procter & Gamble he's like the legendary CMO to all the current CMOS because Proctor was Proctor he's the host and literally the CMO so the biggest companies in the world are literally coming through our door every day to be on a show imagine an hour you will get everybody to say yes that you've been dying to have a conversation with them out of business if you say come to my office and sit with me for an hour and I'm gonna interview you about your leadership your business your thing they're literally walking into your [ __ ] company and if you really have the discipline to not sell and say nothing nothing inevitably she's gonna be on the way out or he's on the way out gonna say what do you guys do here I don't know oh really actually I [ __ ] hate my people want you to call it to put you in touch with Rick Thompson who runs our by the way there's nothing easier than to be a host of a podcast you asked eight basic questions how did you get into this it's super crazy huh I know it's super obvious and what's scary about super obvious is how well it works back to what I think about all the times the reason I put out everything is I do not believe my ideas even though a lot of times they're early and well thought out historically are my special sauce my execution is my special sauce right of course Lisa to unions like that so you know how did you scale the business so quickly like so one of the biggest challenges that we have right is we've almost we've been fairly we've been successful so we you know our marketing strategy we're doing a lot more digital now but it's been a lot of we call it one-to-many so you know they'll buff me to go like to that can I get CPA so she should do a lot of just educational content right zeros all of them think about how much if you film that and put on link down so now the challenge we have is like we're almost over selling the capacity right and it's not like McDonald's I just get a bigger fry later and I generate more fries right the again in human capital head is it is it showering people over think hiring just hire it sounds scary I'm gonna hire a clown she or he's gonna suck and I'm gonna lose the client I'm like but you wouldn't have the client and when you're willing to bleed if your ambitions high I always feel like I'm able to expects no but notice how my analogy wasn't the money it was the clients I think you're coming from a good I think most people come from a good place like to breaking the brand you know we've got we've so much good street cred there's a huge fear of like [ __ ] up that Claro everything's fixable yeah give them the money back like like money's not actually the thing for me like I'm never scared cuz everything's fixable I'll give you a free service I'll [ __ ] let your son intern here I'll do whatever the [ __ ] it bit like everything's fixable if you have that it this is why I talk so much about intent this is why talk about lack of fear plus the biggest mistake a lot of people make is they make a call for the other person likes about alternatives like if the clients happy the clients happy regardless of what your subjective of like are quite it's hiring I don't overthink hiring I try my best I hire people have so much ego in hiring it's just this underlining like insecurity to be wrong I love when I'm wrong guys I mean this like you don't know me well enough to like this is the truth like there's a weird part of me I don't know if it's like it's a probably a very flawed like sick part I get excited sometimes when I hire a very senior person and like a week later like nope and I know that for the next 18 months because you know like right like right 18 months and that's like c-suite where like you just can't scare everybody that you're just [ __ ] changing it like your underwear you know what I mean but like you know what that's happened to me twice a weekend I like good bump it up and then all the extra work I have to put in to disguise that and like manage it and manage you know then four months later the smartest people start saying wait a minute I think this person sucks and you got to manage that and then like 9 months later when the next level of smart people like I think this person side they're like you gotta like the game lack of [ __ ] fear and more importantly like no business than yeah firing and listen I'm the worst I'm a bleeding heart like you would not imagine yes you talk about sort of like you know what if you can't do it just [ __ ] just overpay them out so we're just like letting somebody go right now that's that's the horrible like she's got a bad situation she's only been once I was it just give her six months severance like whatever I do it's gonna make a great dude at the end of the day it's not about money out here it's about like feeling good and happy and like it like i understand that my CFO is not happy with me but that's what i need i [ __ ] fire people give me a huge severance and then I pay them on the side for two months I mean so much weird [ __ ] I'm always like I always think like man if somebody investigated me they'd be like all yours the [ __ ] silver bullet why is he paying Rick on the side I'm nice like it's like super weird but like it's really like like nobody would ever believe me like if you played that on like 60 minutes of somebody trying to get me they'd be like impossible is it literally just your DNA there's some like mental pneumonic this is crazy kind of question but it's like you know I mean you because we have sort of similar family backgrounds actually you know like Eastern European Jew like yeah right and like so you know we just first of all beat up education education education so like when I went on Affleck the lawyer tracked my parents are like oh my god what's happening you know I got lucky that's where I got really blessed and I feel a huge sense of like guilt and gratitude I can't believe my mom let me get away with these and apps what everybody else was like you're going to [ __ ] Harvard like I got really hit the lotto on that one but that perfection is almost like not mine not mine that's where I'm trying to create clarity like I it's why I'm so confident all that happened in my life was everybody said I was losing except my mom so think about that you've won it like that's actually the dream sentence like the dream scenario for disproportionate confidence is the world tells you you [ __ ] suck but your mom tells you you're the best and she's also smart enough to not create deletion so when you go over for in Little League it wasn't the sons fault in your eye or like your coaches it's you suck so it's accountability but she [ __ ] crushed it like I am a complete byproduct of and not only that I have been hot on my mom's like stuff lately my dad saved my ass big because what I was also though by being such a good storyteller was I was completely full of [ __ ] when I was 14 I would say anything to sell anything I lied out of my mouth 24 hours a day and that's who I would have become and that's what a lot of people think I am at first because of my showmanship but he corrected me because I got lucky again that my dad is my dad thinks if you embellished to him once embellish there were 19 people at the party he's like there were eight and that's it three strikes you're out I'm not your friend literally like I don't know a single more extreme version of somebody who's more uncomfortable with exaggeration let alone lying that my dad which over a course of four or five years of my teenage years scared the [ __ ] out of me because it started with like dad I still 98 bottles he's like you sold six and then six became from 98 to 44 to 13 to 6 and that got you know I got I'm very aware of how this all happened and then it's like it was reversed and my dad was first parenting me and my mom I would've been a complete nightmare I've been insecure and full of [ __ ] like like like so like I'm quite grateful so anyway I'm sorry but I wanted to create that clarity that is important for you to know that part though and I think a lot of what you're hearing manifests from that but I host the party and let's talk more because you got three seats here like for sure so and then you get excited and we start to hear like yeah because geographically gets into branding that I get excited about like to me I wish like just cuz I know how big I can make something cuz I'm an operator I'm like man if I had the New England business podcast it's game over give me one year yeah but like you know like yeah that that is audacity that's that's ego I never think anything I think I suck I'm being dead serious I'm confident but like I genuinely wake up this morning and be like no like like I could suck for the next year make a ton of bad decisions and literally everything I've done is wiped you know I believe that business is unforgiving compared to sports on this one in sports Muhammad Ali can lose to Trevor Berbick in his last fight we don't know that I know that cuz I'm a boxing nerd you don't know that right business is different when you lose I mean everyone then wipes out what you've done well what's that yeah you know what I mean like like the narrative can change very quickly we [ __ ] on Woolworths it was the dominant retailer in this country for a hundred [ __ ] years but on that on that journey right like so said not just saying the audacity of expecting why doesn't happen faster but there's got to be something to know you're on the right track right is it just the muffler no no the market speaks your business I knew I was on the right track because the first two years when I was half pregnant on vaynermedia we did three million in revenue in the first year I ran it we went from three to fourteen that was very obvious and 14 to 27 like business results and that was all based on what larger clients bigger fees there's a lot of there's a lot of things I'm good at and the core thing I'm good at is a mix of the followings I tend to sell something that most people don't see at first it ends up being right a lot of times which creates the back end but at the time I'm extremely good at selling in the short term there was no brand twitter I had a lot of followers so there was a little something but what I'm really good at is wasting no time on selling two of the unsellable like one of the reasons I'm fascinated by franchise to become a franchise order and I'm like what I do is because I would be incredible again in franchisees for a couple reasons one I'm just a lot of entrepreneurs look up to me and like so that would be good probably but after I filled the bucket let's like empathy okay I've sold my two million dollars worth of wine now I've got another 4 million to sell now it's work in that part I just don't [ __ ] waste time like I go to a new business pitch back to the same way I know somebody I [ __ ] up on I go to a new business pitch it's scheduled for an hour I sometimes bounce after 30 because I decided it's over three minutes in I'm like she has no interest in me and I don't have ego to be like to convince her I'll give it my best at-bat and hopefully he or she will like it but I think the reason I was able to grow so quickly is I'm very good at selling and focusing on people that will actually buy ok get enough people interest in I don't think I think it's funny back to like what you said like I never think I deserve anything period and look vaynermedia is the only company run by somebody who actually has success and doing the work that they do like in the whole [ __ ] ad world like I laugh when people think I'm Gary Vee and don't realize I'm running this company like like you're doing social media work with an agency that was built to make television commercials I'm like the [ __ ] poster child of the whole game you know and yet we don't get business from people all the time but I think if you host a party and you go if you create the right packaging and then the right merchandising of that packaging it's off to the races I heard 50 kids who a new idea what the [ __ ] they were doing just from where you mean employees are employees at the time I had a big enough Twitter my brother brought like six of his friends from high school in college I mean it was a [ __ ] rat we didn't have any agency people so at the level you're at now the content will retreat yeah run that's good run you should run you run your podcast against employees of your competitors that you want to hire you have to do a lot more paid when or when organic this for everybody when organic went away from Facebook and everybody got their anger and like [ __ ] Facebook I got [ __ ] I got pumped because people started like getting confused because paid was underpriced and I was like I'm not emotional if I can't like I get that this was free but if this is still a good deal then it's still a good deal I don't care about yesterday back to that mentality like yesterday doesn't matter Facebook's free you got all that organic traffic you weren't paying facebook for that organic track it was a trade they had a platform with a lot of attention you produce the content for it and a trade the organic goes down you have to pay for it you have to do a lot more paint the reason have to do a lot more paid everybody is you can target who you want to reach when you know you're about to spend $150 against employees of your direct competitor from eight towns over you're already thinking differently in the video you're about to make you might make a video of like how fun it is at your foosball table in your office because Rick and the other companies like we've all table click I don't like I only make content knowing who's gonna see it people like you always come out I'm like I made a video called you're 65 and your life's not over and I ran ads against people who are 65 it's gonna do well it's really it's people underestimate how powerful it is but if you make the podcast you'll crush because now you're gonna have CEOs and CFOs come in and be guests that's gonna already be a slight bizdev opportunity but you're also gonna be able to post produce and run some of those funny quotes funny moments you're gonna be i she's gonna be looking you're gonna be thinking oh he like Jason I are doing it right now I'm like what I'm telling you to do I'm doing right now like as I'm talking I'm like looking I'm like did you see that was that smart should we cut that let's test that like that's what you'll be doing in a year and now all of a sudden you answered a question where the CFO of the top 15 company like is really caught off guard and she's like that's smart now you're like oh you know now you're running it against all CFO's the machine so you were sort of the content yes so for you and you want one library we said a year and nobody watched it yes so we're producing contact personal brand and other things you didn't let that sway me but the market you know eventually because I have no expectations of the market for a long time I think I'm a showman in hindsight something I didn't know about myself at 34 I really didn't like I never I got a D in speech you know like like I didn't know that I had this stick I know it was a good salesman on the floor at the liquor store I knew that I was a good class clown where the teacher wasn't mad at me so I knew I had a good tact but none of this stuff even crossed my mind so now I mean I think if I did anything tomorrow it would work really if I talked about something I knew like if I need a sports I would need a number I genuinely believe I'd be the number one voice in sports today if I decided tomorrow for the next three years to go all-in I think I'd be bigger than Steven Naismith and Max Kellerman and all these guy just do because I think I have a personality that clicks with people that's just a trait some people don't that's why I talk about writing and audio you might not be great on video but you might be a tremendous writer or you might just not be cracked up to be the personality then you lean into the logo or hire somebody MetLife hired Snoopy yeah you know so that's where a piece of content where you talks about how like you do this thing a very invested oh the stairs you know I think I'm uncomfortable with not having some cash on hand for a rainy day so I think I used to think a lot now I'm old it a little bit from it but I'm a very big fan of getting people to invest in your business instead of taking the money off the table like just everybody wants to build big businesses but then what they're really doing is building lifestyle businesses for the things they want which is also tough for me because if you want a car look kudos do your thing but yeah there I mean I aggressively in the first five years of Vayner and the first five years of Wine Library had a pretty hardcore system where like one year I would try to make no profit porvis at all zero a little bit more just for for for both I'll give it to you for both businesses between five and ten percent is that where you run it today I keep running it cuz I'm just like but again I'm building it in perpetuity you have to know what you're up to like again if somebody here wants to flip their business I like and I'm sure everybody's big boy and big girl enough to know that but yeah I mean like look it's it's it's your other family member right you got to feed it go take care of it you know if you want to build big yeah which is the goal well then you got to feed it and then that's when you can fire and fire like all that stuff because you're not worried about the people like well Gary it costs more to fire somebody well I'm not as worried about the profit margin being insane I'm trying to catch the road [Music] [Applause] [Music]
