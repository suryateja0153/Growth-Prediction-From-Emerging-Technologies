 Hello everyone I'm going to go ahead and get  started uh this is Nick Desai I'm the co-founder   and CEO of a company called Heal uh based here in  Los Angeles California um I am actually the least   interesting and least informed person you're going  to hear from today um we have an esteemed panel of   guests that are affiliated uh and speakers that  are affiliated with UCLA um as faculty and I will   introduce them shortly uh I'm the moderator if  you have questions you can place them in the chat   we're gonna use slides only for about the  first five or ten minutes of today's discussion   which is around uh neural prosthetics and in  particularly limbs and movement and restoring uh   function through uh prosthesis and neuroscience um  the five experts we have across the intersection   between uh engineering medicine neuroscience and  how missing biological functionality can be re   restored through machine interfaces so without  further delay I'm going to turn it over   and introduce the first panelist who will be  presenting a few slides that's Dr. Kodi Azari   who's a medical doctor and a orthopedic and  hand surgeon and Dr. Azari turn it over to you Thank you Nick it's an honor and a pleasure  to be with you My name is Kodi Azari   I'm a plastic surgeon a reconstructive plastic  surgeon but also an orthopedic hand surgeon   but I'm here to talk to you about transplantation  which sounds really schizophrenic but   it's actually not what I'm most proud of however  is that I'm involved with a program called   UCLA Operation Mend and I'm the medical direct  co-medical director of Operation Mend which is   actually a philanthropic organization where we  take care of some of our most severely wounded   service members and we bring them to UCLA  we pay for their treatments their advanced   reconstructive surgeries and and through  my role in this incredible organization   I have seen incredible challenges especially  unsolvable extremity reconstructive challenges   and amputations where advanced prosthetics  would be ideal for some of these patients however and unfortunately upper  extremity in particular trans   uh prosthetics are not highly utilized by  most amputees they just don't find them to be   what they need or what they can use the  prosthetics don't have the appearance of the hand   they don't have the precision that's required and  what we do is a hand they don't have the strength   they don't have sensation and they're  not durable they're incredibly expensive   um and they're not durable every few years they  need to be replaced two so too many patients   prosthetics are unsatisfactory uh a replacement  for what they had before so because of that um   UCLA has been a one of the pioneering centers in a  in a in a field called hand transplantation which   is actually a one-stage reconstruction where we  take identical tissues from one person and that's   a deceased um donor just like any other organs and  we transplant that to a recipient that requires   it and and I'm going to talk to you about hands we  can do skin subcutaneous tissues tendons ligaments   bones joints all of these are transplanted in  one setting and this is our program this is one   of our transplantations that we will perform  and this is actually the patient after a few   months of transplantation you can actually see  this was his own tissues and here is the newly   transplanted hand you can see there's a  little bit of a hair pattern difference   and this is the patient just doc will i be  able to play the piano after the surgery   three days after um his hand transplant and he's  wondering if he can play the piano someday he   didn't play it before that's his joke within  about four or five months he's lifting weights shooting basketball jumping rope  and actually tying his shoelaces i   i told him his left hand is the one that's  been transplanted i actually told him it's   going to take you about two and a half years  to be able to tie your shoelace and he sent   me this video at about six months tying  his shoelace so he was very proud of it   and this transplantation has allowed him the  freedom to put on his lower extremity prosthetics and and regain quality of life however this comes  all at this incredible risk and cost of having to   put the patient on anti-rejection medications  and and this these are the amount of pills that   he has to take on a daily basis and having to  take these pills is really not good for anybody   except this just allows us to keep the transplant  on so patients sometimes become non-compliant and   they really have side effects so we developed  this field because we currently don't have   the prosthetics that patients feel that are  appropriate for them and why I'm really proud   to be on this panel today is i want the future to  be making the transplant safer but also providing   the patients with a prosthetic so hopefully we  won't have to do transplants in the future so with   that thank you for uh inviting me as a guest  and i look forward to everybody else's talks   uh thank you so much Dr. Azari that video was  was touching and compelling and if that's the   state of the art we can only imagine the future  to speak a little bit more about the future is Dr.   Tyler Clites who's a mechanical and  aerospace engineering faculty at UCLA   and he's going to talk to you about some of the  work they're doing to advance exactly the kind of   prosthesis that Dr. Azari referred to thanks  so much nick and thank you Dr. Azari for uh   both setting the stage so well for some of the  problems that we face in our uh in our engineering   work and and showing us the truly miraculous  things that are being done surgically um so as   uh as Nick said my name is Tyler Clites I'm an  assistant professor of mechanical and aerospace   engineering and orthopedic surgery and I direct  the anatomical engineering group here at UCLA   in the lab we use novel surgical techniques and  advanced mechatronics to engineer the body and   the machine in parallel and our long-term goal  is to transform the field of rehabilitation and   augmentation technology by opening the door to  invasive bionic solutions so I've been in the   field of prosthetic limbs for uh on the order of  10 years now and have seen a lot of things and and   I'm very familiar with this work I'd like to spend  most of my intro time today telling you a quick   story that I think captures both my connection  to the field and highlights what's possible today so during my doctoral work I worked with a team  of surgeons to re-engineer reimagine the way   amputation surgeries are performed so as you'll  see in this animation you know essentially we   took the kind of traditional amputation  surgery and modified it and our goal was to   create a residual limb that was better suited to  interact with the neurally controlled prosthesis   so we we reconnected muscles and tendons in new  ways and then built a new prosthetic limb that was   able to be connected nearly to this new residual  limb that this this with this new operation   and the goal was to create a prosthesis that the  person could move and and feel moving as if it   were their own natural innate biological limb and  so the first patient to undergo this procedure   uh actually was forced to make the excruciating  decision to amputate his limb after falling 50   feet while rock climbing and here you see him  after his after having this novel amputation   procedure and and having been fitted with this new  prosthesis and he's controlling this prosthesis   and and feels it moving as if it's his own limb  and you can see in that video how how cleanly the   control is that he has what's beautiful about  connecting a device like this and integrating   with the nervous system uh so completely is  you start to see an emergence of naturalistic   behavior so there you saw him kicking a piece  of electrical tape off his shoe and here you   see him climbing stairs in a way that looks  very natural and feels to him very natural and so as I mentioned this particular patient   injured himself rock climbing and  if you can advance the next slide   um injured himself rock climbing and at the end  of my doctoral work we had the privilege to take   him back to the actually the same location in the  cayman islands where he where he initially fell   and put him back on the rock wall with a newly  uh specialized a newly developed specialized   prosthesis that was built specifically for rock  climbing and what i love about this story is it   captures it captures two things first of all it  shows how incredible humans are that we can suffer   such a tragic loss and bounce right back and get  back to the things that we're passionate about and   make us and the things that make us happy and  it also highlights a future that I'm excited   about in which it doesn't it doesn't matter  what materials our body parts are made out of   what matters is that they are connected to us  that they're a part of us and that we're able   to use them to to do the things that that bring  us joy and that we love to do so I'm excited to   talk a little bit more about that future in  that vision today thank you for having me Thank you so much Dr. Clites it's it's  incredible to think that someone is   back in rock climbing with an artificial uh  limb that that was made and engineered and   all of this is driven by of course a deepened  understanding and a continually deep understanding   of the brain itself and the core neuroscience and  so the next uh panel esteem panelist we have is   Dr. Steven Cramer who is a neuroscientist at UCLA  Health and we'll talk about uh some of the brain   understanding and the things that we're learning  Dr. Cramer thank you Dr. Desai hi my name is   Steve Cramer I'm a professor of neurology at UCLA  with sub-specialty training and stroke although   I spend most of my time in the lab these days  where my research is on neural repair in humans   The work on hands and feet that we're seeing  is spectacular and exciting but you have   to forgive me as a neurologist if I have a  decidedly brain focused approach to all this   The purpose of bones is to carry the brain to  interesting places like LACMA or the Hollywood   Bowl I'm not saying femurs won't get something  out of hearing a Beethoven sonata but I think   the brain would get more out of it so in my  lab we focus on treating the brain to improve   human livelihood how might this be pertinent  to prosthetics well there's at least two ways   the first is to support this outstanding work  being done in the limbs but remember you need the   brain to optimize the success of prosthetics for  some prosthetic attachment surgeries that may be   less important and for some it's more important it  can take months or years right now to optimize the   effectiveness of a prosthetic a lot of the focus  is on behavioral training and practice and therapy   but I foresee a future where the right drugs  the right cell therapies the right electrical   magnetic brain stimulation can be used to  maximize prosthetic function to maximize   how well the brain can adapt and make best use of  the prosthetic could we turn on the slide please So on the top row is results of two recent  trials from my lab so on the upper left   this was where we devised a cellular  therapy that's made from bone marrow   and it was injected intravenously and to improve  outcomes in patients who were years after stroke   very nice results on the upper right was a study  where we came up with the telehealth therapy   that was used to deliver intense  rehabilitation therapy in the home   and it reduced disability after stroke so these  are examples of treating the brain in order to   improve function and could be adapted to treating  the brain to improve success of prosthetics the   second way in which neural repair can pertain  to prosthetics involves personalized medicine   boosting brain performance is not one size  fits all and so one might rely on biomarkers   A biomarker measures one's biology for example the  biology of the brain through an MRI Biomarkers are   needed to match the right patients with the right  therapies this is personalized medicine so looking   at the bottom row in the bottom left it shows how  we use an MRI measure of injury to specific wire   bundles in the brain in order to predict who will  improve from a therapy and who won't the bottom   right shows how we use specific EEG measures of  network communication to predict who will respond   and who will not respond to various therapies  that aim to improve function slide off please I envision a future where a  person with severe limb injury   gets a series of brain scans in addition to the  other evaluations that we're hearing about today   and then the engineers and the physicians  including neurologists work in teams   to optimize function in the brain and in the  prosthetic and thereby maximize reduction   of disability thank you for your attention Thank you Dr. Cramer but my dearest friend   other than my wife is a professor of neural  prosthetics at Stanford Dr. Krishna Shenoy who   many of you probably know but who trained  our next uh esteemed speaker Dr. Jonathan Kao   who is a professor of electrical engineering at  UCLA and we'll talk about some of his work Dr. Kao Thank you Nick um my name is Jonathan  Kao and uh it's a pleasure to be here so   my lab at UCLA is the neural computation and  engineering lab we are a multi-disciplinary team   of electrical engineers of computer scientists  bioengineers neuroscientists and MD/PhD students   much like Krishna's lab at Stanford and so  our lab here at UCLA has two key thrusts   First we want to understand how the brain  computes and to do this we collaborate   with neurophysiologists at UCLA and  beyond and our expertise is in using   machine learning and statistics to try  to understand how circus of neurons work   The second thrust of our lab and  the one more relevant for this panel   is that we want to take that neuroscientific  insight that we gain from basic neuroscience   to engineer neural prostheses which are  devices that help people who have neurological   injury and disease and so in more detail my  lab is particularly focused on the problem of   helping people who have paralysis move again and  so paralysis as you all know is a disorder where   the natural pathways that convey information from  your brain to the rest of your body about the   movement that you want to make these natural  pathways like the spinal cord are severed   even though these pathways are severed  however the brain still conveys or still   contains the information about  the movement that you want to make   and so what we do is we read out this information  directly from the brain and we decode it   into the movement of a robotic arm  or a computer cursor on the screen   and through this someone who is paralyzed  can move again just by thinking about it  As you can imagine there are many unique  challenges to building these neural prostheses   which are also called brain machine interfaces  at the core we need to know how to interpret   neural activity how to translate and decode  that into movements and that involves a lot   of basic neuroscience and modern AI and so at  UCLA my lab is focused on building tools to make   brand machine interfaces more widely available  as a treatment option for people with paralysis   and we have several projects along these lines  one that I'll talk about at a high level that   we're excited about is using modern AI and brand  machine interfaces and so you all have likely   heard of the success of modern AI and how it can  achieve superhuman performance on tasks like being   the best go player in the world or in computer  vision tasks and so in my lab we are building uh   similar types of modern AIs that support brain  machine interfaces and these AIs these artificial   intelligences they cooperate with the brain  machine interface user to carry out movements   and we believe that this fusion of AI and human  control could lead to brain machine interfaces   that achieve much higher performance than today's  state of the art and so I'm happy to continue   uh talking about these topics on today's channel  and uh look forward to the conversation thank you  Great thank you so much Dr. Kao and uh last  and and uh someone I really enjoyed speaking   with the other day working at the uh connection  of prosthesis to tissue is Dr. Veronica Santos   she's a PhD and a professor in mechanical and  aerospace engineering and bioengineering at the   school of engineering at UCLA uh Dr. Santos if  you could tell us a little bit about your work Great thank you so much Nick I direct the  UCLA Biomechatronics lab which is dedicated to   improving quality of life by enhancing  the functionality of artificial hands   and their control in human machine systems so  we study human robotic and prosthetic hands and   in particular we focus on giving robots a sense  of touch which can be sent directly to an amputee   or a remote human tele-operator or even used  to make semi-autonomous decisions by a robot   and since many of our tactile sensors  are deformable like the human fingertip   we develop machine learning models for pattern  recognition so that we can transform raw sensor   signals into higher level abstractions such as  shape rigidity and roughness for decision making   The early part of my career was focused  on tactile sensors for prosthetic hands   and now our lab is addressing the entire continuum  of human robot systems for grasp and manipulation   These can be robots that are physically attached  to the human body like prosthetic limbs or robots   that are detached from the human body  such as robots mounted on wheelchairs   on the manufacturing line or supporting  our servicemen on the battlefield   Since today's panel kicks off a series on building  the bionic human I thought I'd share an exciting   new project that aims to transcend the physical  boundaries of the human body we've recently begun   a new collaboration with Professor Dustin Tyler  at Case Western Reserve University as part of an   interdisciplinary multi-university Human Fusions  Institute led by Professor Tyler our new project   addresses the fact that touch is essential to the  human experience and the entire world has observed   this first hand with physical distancing and  restrictions on hugs and handshakes Bless you Nick   Well less than three months ago we successfully  ran a groundbreaking demonstration with nodes   at Case Western Reserve University and UCLA over  what's called the other net and we believe that   the other net infrastructure will revolutionize  the bi-directional interface between humans and   technology A researcher in Cleveland controlled  the robotic gripper in our Los Angeles lab and as   he grasped objects he was able to feel forces  on his own fingertips through electro tactile   stimulation and this is just the first step toward  the connection of remote robots and humans through   the direct stimulation of peripheral nerves  via implanted electrodes Collaborators at other   universities are currently developing their nodes  for other robotic devices our multi-university   team aims to move beyond the traditional paradigm  of robots as tele-operated tools We want to   achieve human embodiment of a robot by directly  connecting human neural systems to technology in   real time over the internet I'm looking forward to  the success discussion and thank you for having me Thank you so much Dr. Santos I'm struck by your  background which I'm certain was intentional   uh reaching out and touching the the finger of God   as we move to the discussion part of this I was I  was also struck by um the previous background and   and you know when I went to UCLA and I finished my  master's in '92 it was just the school of medicine   and the school of engineering there wasn't a  Samueli school of medi engineering and the Geffen   school of medicine but it struck me that these two  titans who have made money in in technology and   entertainment are representative of how these  two industries have come together and today   whether it's streaming a movie on our iPads  that my two-year-old daughter knows how to do   or listening to music through uh through uh  bluetooth headsets from a device from a thing from   whatever how much engineering and science have  come together to advance in certain ways and   as we all hear this one of the things to keep in  mind is there's no single university that has a   greater combination of world-class engineering and  medicine on a single campus literally next door   to each other right the walk from engineering to  UCLA to medicine at UCLA takes about two minutes   right working together to solve these problems  yet one of the the truisms in neuroscience and   neural prosthetics is that the most uninformed  person me can ask the most complex questions so   i'd like to start by asking you this question Over the last two decades we've seen engineering   and technology entertainment engineering and  medicine come together in so many interesting ways   and when it comes to neuroscience and  neuro prosthetics we hear on one hand about   we're going to have music coming  straight into our brain from Elon Musk   on the other hand every day in our daily life we  see people struggle because of handicaps trying to   get up the stairs or open a door so what is the  state of the art what is the reality of what is   here and how far are we from the things you're  talking about being available in the primary   setting as part of healthcare delivery to enable  a large number of people to take advantage of them Was that question directed at me Nick It's to all of you to you Dr. Santos   and Dr. Cramer Dr. Kao Dr. Clites  and Dr. Azari to all of you Great well I can kick things off and  then other people can jump in as they   as they like but um where are we now well  we can train machine learning algorithms   to recognize patterns from biological  signals such as brain activity muscle   activity eye gaze for example and  to infer human intent to some degree  We can stimulate the human nervous system  whether it's invasively or non-invasively   and we have robotic devices that can respond  to our commands and be programmed to adjust   to our capabilities um I don't think that  any of these problems are completely solved   but we can begin to integrate these systems  now and enable humans to do meaningful work   while while being physically in one place but  experientially in another so what some of the   things that are that we're really excited about  are you know imagine doctors all around the world   being able to embody a robot in one of the  quote-unquote medical deserts in our country   where healthcare facilities are more than an hour  away and yet they can provide round-the-clock   physical hands-on care by embodying a robot or  imagine being able to provide a comforting touch   to someone who may be quarantined in the  hospital or enabling members of medically   vulnerable populations to be out and about in  the world go to school interact with other people Do any of the other panelists have  anything to add because I think this   is a question as I'm looking at audience  questions this is the one that's sort of   coming in which is sort of you know where  where are we what's real versus what's hype We're certainly I'll jump in with a couple  comments we're certainly in an exciting place   medically neurologically where  we're beginning to understand   different cell therapies and what's involved  with getting them to make the brain work better  We're beginning to understand what we can  implant in the brain deep brain stimulators are   implanted into thousands of patients a year in  this country to good effect for the long term and   we're beginning to understand how to decode the  neural signals in order to use that information   to inform both sensory and motor prosthetics  and now telehealth has come center stage not   only because of its own evolution and as you  say the marriage of engineering and medicine   over recent years but uh with the the thrust of  the COVID era we're seeing immense attention and   advances in telehealth and I think when you  add all these together um I would say that uh   we are really on the precipice of major advances  in uh using prosthetics to reduce disability if I if I can jump in as well I think um you  know we're on the we're on the cusp of of a   really exciting time where all these different  diverse sets of technologies that have been   developed in lab settings and isolation by people  who are super specialized and very very good   at the thing they do they're all ready for prime  time and ready to be integrated into these complex   systems like the one Dr. Santos described uh like  the the uh prosthetic limb that I showed in some   of my videos um and and it's really exciting and  really what's what's going to happen is you know   right now clinically if you look at the state of  the art and clinical care for prosthetic limbs   it's all focused on function function is the  primary thing um and we the question we're asking   is does this limb work well enough does it do  what it's supposed to do and I think we're finally   getting to a place at least in laboratory settings  where we can start asking the next question which   is okay we're getting function to a place which  is it's not perfect but it's it's pretty good   what about embodiment right can we now create  devices that feel that actually feel like they   are a part of the person that it's not like  a shoe you put on you get up in the morning   and put your shoe on or put your clothes  on but you know doctor has already talked   about people leaving their prosthesis on the on  the shelf and to me that's a travesty right you   don't leave your arm on the shelf right you  might leave a shoe on the shelf you might be   closed on the show but you don't leave your  arm on the shelf and so i'm excited about uh   you know I think in the next couple decades  we'll start to see devices that that truly   become integrated with our patient's  sense of self in a way that it would   to them the emotional toll of leaving it on the  shelf would be uh would be something disastrous   and that's you know I I frame that in a slightly  negative way but that's actually very exciting   right to get to this point where where our  limbs are made out of different materials You know I think that is a that's a fascinating  way to put it because we do think there are   devices that are not prosthetics our cell phones  our air pods are whatever that we just think of   as part of us right people will notice I'll tell  you a crazy story randomly our car got stolen off   our driveway three days ago it took us two days  because none of us used that particular car to   realize the car was stolen yet it would take me  two seconds to remember that my phone is gone   right so I think that's a really interesting um  way to put it the the question I want to ask next   is this one which is and one of you said this in  our in our practice session right but you have the   government and DARPA type of funding sources who  want to get some basic signs out put out the press   release you have venture capital who are willing  to put tremendous amount of amount of money into   something that's productized that has a billable  medicare code and it can be uh that can be used in   the middle is the hard science of taking a pilot  that was done on one person with 20 surgeons and   14 engineers to something that everyone can  have where does that funding come from and   how important is that to holding a to in turn how  much of a limiting reagent is that to the kind of   work we want to do to be able to help a large  number of people and again that's for everyone I I can I can tackle this one to start um  this is our version of the valley of death   where where uh new ideas and exciting technologies  um die before they make it to having real world   impact and the challenge here is is actually  quite simple as Nick highlighted right it's that   most of our funding streams are on the the best  funding streams that we have available to us as   academics from the order of three to five million  dollars for a a project that's going to be three   to five years which sounds like a lot of money uh  it is enough money to do with the experiment the   types of experiments that we're talking about  it's enough money to fund between five and ten   patients which does not get one over this valley  of death and into real world clinical application   um and then as was mentioned on the flip side  there's sort of this you know there's this this   is venture money and all this this other money  out there for commercialization but but nobody   wants to acquire a company that's only been shown  in or an idea that's only been shown in a very   early proof of concept stage in a few patients  so in the middle there's this n of you know 30   to 100 patient trial that needs to happen that  where we can really demonstrate the value and the   importance of our of our devices and that costs  on the order of 50 to 100 million dollars and   there are just not very many grants out there that  that do that for us and that's where philanthropic   money comes into play and becomes very very  important to the type of work that we're doing I'd like to add to what Tyler  said anything that's worth doing   is going to take time effort and funding and with  state funding of public universities continuing to   decline it's pretty clear that philanthropy is  going to have to become an especially important   funding source for researchers to to complement  the federal industry and foundational support   so I would say to all you watching if you wanted  to support anything I would vote for student   fellowships they are absolutely essential I mean  we on this panel we can write grant proposals we   can provide mentorship but the students are the  ones who are actually doing the work in the lab   every day and for us to be able to recruit top  students for a diverse and inclusive team and   guarantee our students funding for the entirety  of their doctoral careers that would be a game   changer we could then focus our time and energy  on the science and not so much on the fundraising Sorry go ahead Yeah i echo what Tyler and Veronica said uh  especially what Veronica was saying about student   fellowship um this is connected a bit to the prior  question as well which is uh where are we now   and what is hype and what is not and um with the  particular example that you brought up Nick with   Neuralink Neuralink has built this device  that has increased by an order of magnitude   the amount of neurons that we can record from the  brain and this advancing neural technology is sure   to lead to more insights into basic neuroscience  but to solve some of the challenges like um   I think you said something about maybe  listening to music and perceiving that um   writing that into the brain or writing some  other information to the brain uh solving   questions related to memory to consciousness  that isn't just a technological challenge   that would require more insights into the basic  neuroscience of how memories are stored in the   brain how do we write in things like how do we  write them in a new memory or how do we write in   things that you hear or things that you feel  into the brain and so uh I echo again Veronica   saying student fellowships are important because  that basic neuroscience research that at the   inside into these basic science questions  will be critical and necessary for us to   take the advancing neural technologies that we  have towards building next generation prosthesis You know I think I I think it's an it's such  an interesting paradigm and I'm going to go to   a couple of questions from the audience because  there are some really interesting ones but just   as a as a comment on this last point right you  should not be lost upon any of us that UCLA   is the founder you know the the  mothership of the internet right   what Dr. Kleinrock did over 50 years ago is  is the foundation of our modern world and yet   what's three to five million dollars for a  three-year study is three to five billion dollars   in the venture world for famously companies that  want to rent your short-term office space and   you know we all we can all talk about success  examples or but that but the gap in funding is   is incredible and yet without the university  driven innovations many of these there's no   internet company that exists without the internet  right from Amazon to Netflix to anyone else and   so I think that's really important for for the  audience and for people like me to think that   how can we give back and how can we support is  by being that bridge to taking basic science and   bringing it to industry where ultimately it does  have both a financial future but more importantly   the ability to help humans um so I'm gonna go to a  couple questions from the audience that I thought   were really interesting um the first one and these  can be quick answers because there's a lot of them   there's a lot of interest is on one hand there's  a work on prosthesis and the stuff you guys are   talking about on the other hand uh and these  aren't necessarily competing but there's work   on um artificially grown limbs stem cells embryo  cells etc do though are those things diverging   will they converge does one help the other  how do those pieces fit together and again I want to tackle that for a second um I think  these processes move in different speeds   So one is the promise of tissue engineering  that's one the next is the promise of   prosthetics and the final one is what I talk  to you about the promise of transplantation   I think the promise of transplantation is  this way the promise of tissue engineering   is going this way it's fairly flat but the promise  of prosthetics is exponential growth and I think   that's really the future that will proceed much  much faster than regrowing a limb that's actually   very difficult difficult to do before we even  move on I want to say something that's I think   really important I didn't get to say it and  we we want to talk about the sense of self   and why is it that the prosthetics are put aside  and not used and so much of it feels like this   doesn't feel like me this doesn't feel like part  of me and I I learned this lesson from doing the   hand transplants so initially when we put the hand  transplants on they get function fairly quickly   but they don't get sensation and they  always call it the hand until the point   and then that's a that's a slow progress and  one day usually the patients turn around and say   my hand and that corresponds with them developing  sensation the nerves have regenerated so I can't   over state how importance of that feedback is for  this to be moving the field forward and i think   you've heard it loud and clear from everybody  on this group this is what they're trying to do Great um Sorry I'm gonna ask you the next question Dr  Cramer and you can wrap in maybe both answers   uh this is also a question from the audience which  is one of the most uh growing disease and talked   about disease with the number of people becoming  over 65 in America and people living longer   are neurodegenerative dementia and Alzheimer's  um in the broad range of dementia are these   the things you're all working on relevant for  those people a) and b) are they also relevant   for people who may be more slightly or slight  more progressively impaired as in starting with   a slight impairment on down and then also if you  want to comment on the previous question sure   for the new question um these are considerably  different challenges replacing a peripheral limb   is different from replacing brain modules and  in the degenerative diseases and somebody is   struck with Alzheimer's disease for example we see  much of the brain matter itself dissolve before   our eyes and replacing that is along lines of  tissue engineering that's going to take some time   and I think a lot of modern therapies are  targeted towards slowing the injury um there   is hope for that but that's that's an area of  active research that's going to take some time For the earlier question I was only going to  point out that when movement is sensation and   sensation is movement uh and uh next time you go  to the dentist's office and have sensation removed   but no change in movement watch how you slur  your words because movement requires sensation   updates regularly to have normal movement and so  when we talk about restoring movement if the brain   is involved um movement is sensation and sensation  is movement and then we also start getting into   psychology where such psychosocial creatures  that um the effects of expectation and resilience   uh and other psychological qualities can  be critically important to modulating   how well the motor system adapts to it  to a new limb those are a few thoughts yeah and I just really quickly want to jump on  what Dr. Cramer was just saying for a prosthetic   limb or even for our natural limbs um if we  were to lose our sense of touch or even our   sense of proprioception where our limbs are  in space our movements are much less efficient   and are much more difficult and so when you  think about brain machine interfaces where we can   decode the movements of a prosthetic limb well  the control of that limb will also be limited by   us not being able to uh or by the amount of uh  feedback that we could write back into the brain   like proprioceptive feedback but the challenge of  writing information about where the robotic arm is   in space or about what it's feeling into the brain  that is another difficult scientific challenge   that would need to be solved for brain machine  interfaces to achieve a very very high performance   and so in parallel um I also want to  say though I worked in brain machine   interfaces and I think that what doctor  has already said was correct which is that   the growth is uh more exponential uh we do also  hope very strongly that there will be uh medical   interventions that could repair broken pathways  and also therefore restore a naturalistic control Oh okay great and and I want to ask Dr. Clites  Dr. Kao and Dr. Santos talked about funding   undergraduate students and their fellowships  or graduate students and their fellowships  There's a couple of interesting questions here  from the audience related to that which are if you   are a student undergrad or grad student you want  to get involved or prepare for a life in in this   work as all of you have what is the best way to do  that and a related question that I just found very   touching is if you are an amputee or if you have  a family member that suffered this kind of injury   whether on the battlefield or climbing a a rock  How can you become an advocate for this type of   work What is the best way for people to get  involved if they don't have huge checks to   write either as a student as an advocate as a  patient what's the right way for them to engage Well for the students watching my advice is to  follow your passion and curiosity My anecdote   when I was an undergraduate at UC Berkeley  was when I was considering whether to go to   grad school and and what to major in um I knew I  wanted to work on prosthetics and prosthetic hands   and a faculty member told me don't go into  prosthetics it's a dead stagnant field just   don't head that way and I'm glad that I kind of  ignored that advice and and got on this crazy   organic path to where I am today um so follow  your passion and what you're curious about   I think that's where you do your best work find a  community to work with and keep an open mind and   attend seminars like these because you never  know where your next big idea will come from I I can tackle the the other part of that and it  looks like Dr. Cramer may also have some things   to say but um the second part of that question uh  you know for people with amputation who look to   get involved we we uh depend on uh cooperation and  and collaboration with um the the populations that   we are targeting with our work and and there are  as our studies progress there are almost always   opportunities to get involved in in some way or  another so the best advice they have is to keep   an eye out on our our different our respective lab  websites and potentially email us and other places   and and we typically reach out when we are ready  to have patients come in and start working with us And I would also say that oftentimes a lot of this  research is funded by the Department of Defense   and the Department of Defense  usually when they're trying to   decide what to fund they ask for populations and  they ask for civilian members to help guide that   those decisions so I think that if that  opportunity presents it's very much worthwhile The other another question that that isn't  interesting that's it's partly goes back   to the funding and partly goes back to that  the conversation around um you know senses   touch and touches uh sense Dr. Cramer  you said that much better than I did but   in some ways this pandemic going on right now  COVID-19 which is a national and global tragedy   has been a watershed moment for the acceptance  of things like telemedicine that hey I can talk   to my doctor by video because it's the safest  way to do it right is the watershed moment for   the type of work you're doing is it an  injured person regaining basic function   more or is it some athlete or something achieving  what you would call superhuman or bionic function   that becomes a sensation that opens the funding  floodgates which are what are the kinds of things   that have to happen to get people to say  wow this is where I want to put my money Well I could touch on that briefly um let me  paraphrase and see if I've captured what you   said accurately um in a sense if there's  something that improves function in those   who've had an amputation or had brain injury or  have some degenerative disease what happens if we   aim the same therapy at healthy persons to provide  them with supernormal performance some people call   that neurocosmetics um and it's controversial  uh there are some forms where if it's a   relatively benign intervention and it can improve  performance that might be a good thing uh imagine   air traffic controllers who are flawless and  calm and perform perfectly uh that makes sense   but then perhaps there's differential access  to this and some would call that controversial   for some more aggressive or invasive therapies  there might be some ethical questions how much   risk is it worth exposing a healthy person  to for the promise of some uh supernatural   abilities and when it involves genetic basis then  it opens up even more ethical questions um so I   think as with everything there are probably some  safe examples where we will see neurocosmetics   uh take root and be useful to society and there  will be some that are probably more controversial Interesting and and is there an opportunity at  this stage one of the audience questions which   I think relates to this funding question for spin  outs public private partnerships that are not   philanthropic per se but that are  early venture type money where   you spin out a company that five years  from now will become you know a profit   or is are we too early for that kind of thing and  how does somebody get involved in that at UCLA Well the telehealth system we we invented in our  lab the regents of the University of California   my boss asked me to patent it and we did and  now that patent has been licensed to a company   TR Care you can go to the website trcare.net and  that is to me an example of successful academic   industry relations so one pathway in my  lab that we're focused on is generating uh   intellectual property that has market value  and merging the interests of a company that   licenses the technology with the clinicians  who are doing the research to try to make   that useful for the broad population  that's a pathway of interest in my life Any of the other professors uh or or  any of you that have anything to add   to that in terms of public private  spin-outs that type of funding arena Yeah I'll just add one comment which  is that if you can get a patent on   something that is foundational that could  serve as the seed for many applications   that um that's that's a good way to go just  because um you know I had considered a career   in the upper limb prosthetics industry but the  market for that is just so small that um you   know it's hard to create a brand new startup now  and compete with the behemoths that already exist   so if we can in academia and other research  institutes come up with foundational seed   ideas that can be patented and then licensed and  and used to um you know basically see all these   other applications that's when you get i think  maybe more interest from investors oh thank you okay sorry go ahead Dr. Clites This is really quick I just had one more idea  onto this that I think builds well in the previous   question as well is uh one one way to increase  market size is to create technologies that appeal   to a broader market so obviously the idea today of  lopping off an arm so that we can get a better one   is is uh does not sit well I think probably with  most of us um and that's partially a function of   of how we think about the world and partially a  function of where the technology is today uh but   in in other uh I think the word uh Dr. Cramer used  was more benign uh situations increasing market   share by by kind of pitching something in a way  that's uh that is applicable not only to people   with pathology but also to to people who would be  at what they consider their physiological baseline   uh in order to augment them in some way is  a great way to increase market size so that   costs can go down and access can actually improve  right so this is a way you know it's often framed   as well what if some people can have it and  others can't uh the example i think of is   the cell phone which has become or the smartphone  which has become nearly ubiquitous it's a form of   i think of it as a memory prosthesis um it's  it's not cheap right the new iPhones I think   are a thousand bucks so plus and and yet still  they're they're everywhere uh and and I think   part of this is that the the technology has  become sort of foundational and part of life and   people decided that it is it's worth um putting  resources into and then also the demand has caused   price costs to go down uh so that's a great  way to bridge that valley of death I think Great uh so look I I know it's crazy  because it sounds like we're literally   just getting started and at the tip of the  iceberg but this is an hour long session   we have about seven minutes to go um so i'm  gonna ask for a one thirty second answer   on a question that's come up a few times and  then I'm gonna ask for your closing statement   we'll go in the inverse order on closing  statements starting with Dr. Santos on   up um and in your statements which if you can  keep to one minute try to answer the question   What is the unique value of a multidisciplinary  ecosystem that UCLA has almost unlike any other   place in the in the world the one quick question  is Where does 3D printing fit into all this I don't know how quick of a question that is  but I can draw something out so I have I have   several active projects right now that are  focused on um novel uh orthopedic implants   uh that benefit greatly from 3D  printing so 3D printing is a buzzword   I think we often additive manufacturing is  probably a more way a more appropriate way   to talk about it um nowadays and essentially  the idea is that instead of cutting material   away you build things up and so the the  possibilities that that affords us are are huge okay great so Dr. Santos one  minute or less closing statement Sure I already told you guys what  I thought about uh philanthropy   for students follow your passion a little  more specific advice would be to seek out   internships where you can whether they're  on academic campuses as volunteers or you   know join your first robotics club or whatever  but start developing those hands-on skills and   finding your your people your community and I  would say that the unique thing about our UCLA   ecosystem is the people the amazing people and  the infrastructure the fact that the engineering   school and the medical school are literally across  the street from one another and our engineering   school is investing in over 9600 square  feet of new collaborative space for robotics   and cyber physical systems that will enable  students in my lab to work literally next to   Tyler Clites' students so if you're interested in  being a part of that please let us know thank you Great uh Dr. Kao Great uh first I want to answer the UCLA  question which is um as as we touched on today um   these challenge the challenge of building the  bionic human or even of just building neural   prosthesis that help people require  a truly multi-disciplinary expertise   and so you need expertise in neuroscience  you need the neurosurgeons who are able to   implant recording devices you'll need computer  scientists electrical engineers who are able to   analyze populations of neurons and  try to decode what they're doing   and so UCLA having all of these so close to  each other uh makes it a really unique place   where we can contribute in all areas of extra  expertise there's also something to be said about at least when when on campus it's it's powerful  to be able to just take a five-minute walk and   and to be talking to a collaborator  and expert in a topic um as for uh uh   for a parting message uh  echoing what veronica said for   uh students as we've been mentioning it's  an exciting time to be a neural engineer   it's an exciting time to work in this area I  think that we are with growing neural technologies   and growing uh growing uh growing uh and also AI  and machine learning um there will really be uh I   think a take off in this field in the near future Great thank you Dr. Cramer Sure uh first uh coming from 3d printing I would  say think big man why not 4d printing when are we   going to this is my third hippocampus when are we  going to print that engram into my brain function   rather than rely on the physical substrate  regarding UCLA I just got here a year and   a half ago and I'm just so delighted to  be here um it's all about collaboration   um we say in neurology four hemispheres  are better than two cerebral hemispheres   and eight is greater than four and um the work  of my lab and so many others it's multicultural   and good things come from multicultural  collaborations artillery rehab system   involved the interactions between  engineers computer programmers   an expert in gaming in expert motivation  psychology occupational therapy physical   therapy and a neurologist and these are the kind  of things that you can do with physical healing Thank you so much Dr. Cramer Dr. Clites Look UCLA is an amazing place I've been here for  uh what four months now um and I already have   uh five distinct ongoing collaborations with uh  fully practicing uh orthopedic surgeons which for   anyone who is uh sorry to say this Dr. Azari but  for anyone who sat down with an orthopedic surgeon   and and um launched a project with them knows that  that it is a unique place UCLA is a unique place   where that that can be possible uh I've struggled  at other places to make things like that happen so   i it's really a wonderful interdisciplinary  environment um as far as parting message goes   I I would like what's been said I mean this  is uh the future is bright right a lot of uh   terrible things are happening in the  world right now and I think it's hard to   to recognize the just how incredible humans can  be and the amazing things that humans can do and   and uh truly this is a you know a time when  we are um we're working towards eliminating   disability towards uh humanity um and so it is a  it's a very exciting time to be part of this field Sorry my son burst in I'm very sorry about that  um uh Thank you Dr. Clites and uh Dr. Azari   uh if you can make a closing comment then I will  make one to the audience and we can go from there You know um I'm actually quite humbled to  have been on this panel with everyone I   I'm humbled because um honestly I feel like the  carpenter uh sitting with a group of incredible   scientists that have the vision I I just  want to say how important what your work is   I know if I have a hang nail my finger is sticking  out all day long I can't type I can't do my work   I can't imagine what it would feel like not having  a hand I can't imagine what it would feel like not   having two hands or adding two hands and two  feet yet with this COVID crisis we're actually   seeing this this is one of the things that they  don't talk about people are losing all four   limbs because of because of COVID so what your  work is is absolutely incredible to bring back   decency and ability to take care of oneself   and having reliance on yourself and not  somebody else so godspeed I'm here to   help you in any way that you need and I look  forward to our collaborations in the future Thank you Dr Azari Thank you to all  of the panelists thank you to all of   the attendees as well thank you to  Samantha Lang and Elizabeth Trejo   whose emails are up and if you're in this audience  and if you found this fascinating and if Dr. Azari   who is a world renowned surgeon is humbled I'm  blown away I I uh and I I'm sure all of you are   I would just encourage you to get involved  let this be the beginning of a relationship   with UCLA and and not at the end uh not  the end or just one panel um and thank you   so much everyone uh for being a part of this  and for allowing me to be a part of this I am   I am truly in your debt and honored and I  really encourage everyone to get involved  Thank you to the panelists  and thank you to the audience
