 [Music] hi welcome back to what is the last lecture of this course on electronics packaging and manufacturing okay so as part of this last lecture we are going to look at some special topics it's not it's not a one particular topic which we have typically followed before or one subtopic what I'm going to do in this last lecture is talk about a few subjects which is very relevant today and where there is in some of the newer advances where people are in the last in the last few years or within the last decade at least there has been a lot of concentrated research going on okay so the first one we are going to talk about lead-free solder then we are going to talk a little about carbon nanotubes and then 3d printed electronics okay so we will talk about each of these one by one and finally we will close with a small video so let free solder what does this mean okay so see all this file whatever solder traditionally we have used since we started using electronics and making electronic components the solder has primarily been lead tin solder okay let until where the primary components but however what happened is RoHS which is restriction of hazardous substances so they this organization came up with mandate where they identified six substances that would be effectively banned for the majority of manufactured electronics okay so that's and they gave enough notice so I remember I was working on lead-free solder at Intel in the year 2003 okay this was whereas this effect was supposed to come from 2006 so companies had started taking preparations because this meant a major change remember solder is almost ubiquitous we saw that we will again see today one slide where so solder is so widely used in the electronic industry and certainly if you and say that you know everything has to change and you have to move to a new material that change is not going to be easy so it takes lead time and and companies did well okay and today it's almost effectively banned so what RoHS said is these are the six hazardous substances and so in electronics the concentration limit by weight must be less than 0.1 percent for each of these and the first one and this list is led okay all right so actually cadmium is point zero one percent not 0.1 percent so therefore the question is that what are we supposed to do in this case because use of lead in electronics through the use of lead tin solder nearing eutectic solders are everywhere I mean we have talked about solder solder balls extensively right we have also talked about interconnections by soldering techniques from the package to the chip carrier from the chip carrier to the motherboard ball grid arrays all solder balls okay so you see that solder was is almost omnipresent in electronic products all right so so there was this push that you know you cannot use this solder anymore you have been using it for so many years that's fine but let tin near eutectic soldiers can no longer be used so now we have to move towards lead-free solder so what has done is there is an extensive research across the world in different companies different labs where people have and universities labs means both University labs as well as research labs where people have looked at various compositions in order to replace or in various compositions to come up with an alternative solder which can replace the lead tin solder okay so some of these are shown there and so the first one is led tin lead is 37 percent tin is 63 percent and that melting range is around hundred and eighty-three degrees C but what has happened is most of these what has been found is that sack or ACC which is a composition of tin silver and copper okay say tin the chemical formula is SN silver is argentine m-- AG and copper is cu okay so that is where s a see if you take just the chemical names and take the initials that's where sse come from so this tin silver copper solder family which is going to replace tin-lead solder so various compositions have been tried some of which are shown over here and these are primarily the difference is primarily in the concentrations by weight alright so as you can see tin is the major is the major is a major contributor major composition is stained for most of these you see 96.5% 99.3% and then there is also some tin bismuth and some other formulations but what you see is most of the sac family which is most popular which is listed here the first thing that we notice is the melting range is higher alright so we'll come to this but that's something that we see right away from the table that strikes our eye now compared to the lead tin solder the lead-free solders have different microstructure of course different composition different microstructures these have higher anisotropy city stiffness ductility and creep resistance so some of these are good right higher creep resistance of course is good higher stiffness is good okay ductility also fine but what this does is this impacts a durability under these stress conditions that we talked about under thermal cycling mechanical shock vibrations and most of them are favorable property changes but what we also see is the melting point of this lead-free solder is higher so what does that mean that also means that the reflow temperature when it is refloat and pass through the reflow oven or wave soldering the temperatures that we need to reach are higher because the solder has to melt so now if you have to heat it to higher temperatures what happened we have seen enough about CTE mismatch about warp age before that is because of CTE mismatch between silicon and organic laminates and now we are saying that in order to have this reflow process the temperatures have to be higher so which means that delta T is higher therefore the plastic strain is higher and and therefore the life is going to be impacted right the life the cycles to failure which we saw as part of our you know the reliability reliability discussions that is going to go down right so there are some positive size negative sides and the whole thing as to how this new composition is going to behave under fatigue cyclic loading what will be the crack formation will there be a crack formation how will it propagate so all these are going to be different and so there's a whole lot of new characterization that needs to be done shrimp is exactly is just an example what about vibrations what I would drop test impact test okay and the other thing that has happened is remember no flow under fill' when we are talking about under fill and refill epoxy the first thing was you first bond it and then you discipline say epoxy and then through capillary action it kind of squeezes into the spaces between the solder balls in a flip chip arrangement the other one was a no flow under fill' where you first dispensed the underfill on the substrate and then bring their dye with the solder balls and it comes and it squeezes out the it squeezes out the salt the the the underfill material and the bonding happens under pressure and a little bit of temperature so let free solder therefore goes towards no flow under fill' okay enough that's what is called so let free solder has been a big there has been a big push towards first of all coming up with new materials and characterizing them under different applications alright the second special topic we wanted to discuss is carbon nanotubes what is carbon nanotubes carbon nanotubes is if you take what is called a graphene sheet which is a 2d carbon a little--it rope primarily from graphite what is graphene and then if you can roll it up in this manner what you get is a carbon nanotube okay so this carbon nanotubes this has been a a field of research for almost 10 15 years now these have got some amazing properties first of these the anisotropic definitely but if you look at it these are if you and you consider so copper solder and CNT just in terms of properties the elastic modulus for carbon nanotubes is 1001 order of magnitude higher than that of copper and even more almost 420 times higher than that of solder right current density you can see this three orders of magnitude higher than copper five orders of magnitude higher than solder electrical conductivity the amount of current it can flow of course it is directional property but you see this thermal conductivity 5000 copper is 400 okay 355 okay solder is around the 50s or 60s 58 I mean some some formulation carbon nanotubes 5000 higher than and higher than diamond okay CTE coefficient thermal expansion way low right in the transverse direction very low in the longitudinal direction somewhat higher but still definitely several times lower than that of copper or solder so can you look at carbon nanotubes as an interconnect material right seems to be having all the favorable properties right so that's one so carbon nanotubes therefore has gained importance so has graphene if you look at this 2d structure if you have a conductivity a planar conductivity of 5000 you can understand it will be what a wonderful heat spreader is going to be reference sheets right so excellent so the advantage of C n T's you see here high current carrying capacity high thermal conductivity low electromigration low Joule heating because I squared R is less net mechanical flexibility higher modulus of rigidity as we saw so all these are very good properties disadvantages extremely expensive okay there are few methods by which carbon nanotubes can be made but extremely expensive especially single walled carbon nanotubes but again this is something that is advancing and therefore with more and more newer techniques and innovations it's becoming cheaper it's still way more expensive compared to other materials but the trend is towards cost reduction right handling and safety okay you don't want to ram these these are so tiny things and if you don't I mean handling and safety is a concern it's delicate low yields in the sense I mean it's it's a complex manufacturing process that's why it's expensive you cannot really make it in in large numbers in high volumes at a very fast rate high-temperature fabrication because when you want to want to manufacture these the process occurs only at very high temperatures I have intentionally not talked about the processes you can you can look up on the internet the other thing is it's difficult to grow so these are these are like tubular structures like nanotubes right where can you grow right it's difficult to grow on fr4 or silicon disadvantage if you want to view it as interconnect materials and you want to replace let us say the solder balls in flip chip technology with this carbon nanotubes then you should be able to grow it either on the board side or on the right side so either on fr4 or silicon it's not easy okay and interfacial addition to other materials there's one property which which can be you know harmful or not harmful I would say which can impact us adversely some people also use it to that to an advantage you can have a carbon nanotube and it can be it will stick very very easily and you can remove it like a Velcro I have seen applications like these okay so depending on the applications but here I mean it can be both an advantage or a disadvantage but primarily we have to be careful about this okay it should not adhere to a surface which pad where we don't want it to it here clear so what can be the applications in electronics industry so we already talked about on chip interconnects vertical via interconnections horizontal wires you can think about all of these of chip interconnections so flip chip bumps through silicon via here and thermal management can it be very good I mean can it be used as a thermal interface material you imagine right this is such high conductivity if you grow it densely why not if you and align it properly so that the conduction happens only the vertical direction from the chip to the heatsink why not you have a grease and have this carbon nanotubes dispersed and somehow come up with some method to align them okay so these are all examples where carbon nanotubes can be used and graphene again as I talked about if you don't roll it up into a nanotube and just have the graphene sheet that again has lots and lots of advantages even from the thermal point of view that would be a wonderful heat spreader all right carbon nanotubes again a very hot area of research especially in the materials world but also in the applications world it's a wonderful way where material scientist it's wonderful Avenue for multidisciplinary research where whether if you're an electrical engineer focus on the first two applications if you're thermal engineer you focus on the last application and work closely with the material scientist who will develop these materials for you okay wonderful all right so we have talked about lead-free solder we have talked about carbon nanotubes two very relevant and current topics of interest and research in the field of electronic packaging the third one is probably the newest and that is 3d printing we see this entire push towards additive manufacturing and 3d printing is one of those techniques so what is the additive manufacturing alright so additive manufacturing what it means is you grow a substance you grow a structure or a pattern or whatever you want to want to make you actually grow it layer by layer by adding materials okay what do I mean by that see till now let us say you had to I had to make something I have to make a structure made out of aluminum what was the method I take a block of aluminum and then use various machining techniques let's say I want to have some channels on an aluminum plate I will take an aluminum block and then use maybe an end milling machine to mill off the channels right if I had to drill a hole I would take a solid surface use a drilling machine with a drill bit and drill through correct so it was all about subtractive you start with a mass of material and then you remove the material where you don't need where you don't need it and then give rise to the structure additive on the other hand is I don't remove material I take material may be in the form of powder and deposit it and make the structure out of this you know wonderful example is play-doh that kids use play-doh right it comes in the form of a dough of different colors and they'll take small pieces and you let us say they want to make a shape of a face so they take one color make a circular disc then they take maybe another color make the ie make the nose make the smiley face okay so what what have what have we done there or what has this this child done he has actually made this and grown this layer by layer okay now make it even more complex let us say this was the face on which there was this I end I end nose and and the face let us it has to be very knit it has to be a flat structure so then what do we do right we will put will keep these holes out and then fall for the eye for the nose for the face and then put this other colored cradle in those holes and you get this planar structure now on top of that you want to have some other phase right so let us say when you invert it you want one phase maybe the man's face you invert you look at the other way it's a woman's face then I will do the same thing on top of that clear so what have we done I have made a structure layer by layer now bring it down and scale it down I will take this powdered materials and deposit it layer by layer okay when we print a color photograph what do we do on a piece of paper if you take a color print out it will print with black ink where it has to be black it is going to dispense RGB or or or combinations of those for the different of the colors right well it is red it will be read white is blue it is blue but it is yellow it is yellow right so 3d printing is similar I am going to deposit these powders of the material that I want layer by layer and grow it okay so 3d printing is a process of making this is a Wikipedia definition Wikipedia always we don't trust okay because there is no sanity check of what people put up but that being said this one is the most in I would say majority of cases they are good they are correct and in this case it is correct a process of making a 3d solid object of virtually any shape I am going to come to this virtually any shape from a digital model it is achieved using an additive process where successive layers of materials are laid down in different shapes so for example this is a 3d CAD model I probably want to make this so in a CAD software I will put this I will get a nest STL file then I will have a slicing software where it is going to break it up into slices of anything dimensions so each of these are you can think of it you are taking multiple printouts on the same piece of paper one above the other and that paper allows you to do that so it's similar so first I will deposit the powdered metal the 3d printer will deposit the first layer in the form of this solid circle then in the form of a ring with a certain slightly higher diameter again a slightly higher diameter and so on and so forth and finally I find get this 3d object now this is all white it's the same material but could it have been different materials could the different layers have been of different materials of course it could have been so I could have had one type of plastic maybe a white plastic then red then black now could each of this if I take just one of these rings could I have different materials at different sections yes I could have okay and I could have different patterns different materials even different colors same material of different colors so everything is possible okay so virtually any shape what do I mean let us say I give you a plate we are talked about Cole's plate before right where you have a serpentine channel you have an inlet you have an exit and you have a serpentine channel through which the material flows how am I going to make it I will take a base plate you make this serpentine channel and then take another lid and bond it that's how I do that's how we will do but in 3d printing I don't need to do that it doesn't have to be the two layers with a final welding or whatever some addition process because it will be just layer by layer it is going to be done and so now think about it I can virtually make any kinds of shape even a fractal shape inside as long as my 3d printer feature size allows me I can do that okay so that's 3d printing all right so why 3d printing for electronics you can make it very fast you can make very complex shapes reduce tooling because it's just one printer now and many other stuff okay lightweight inventory reduction blah blah blah all kinds of stuff okay so this is again of I want to acknowledge professor Chris Bailey I have taken this from his presentation this slide alright so current state so 3d printed antenna sensors are already there in mass production two to three million pieces a year okay it can print a broad spectrum of conformal functional circuitry sensors EMI shields antennas etc but think about it if it is possible and I'm sure it will be why not okay before that let us just let us look at this picture it's a cell phone chassis or a case mobile phone cover with an integrated antenna and and EMI shields 3d printed printed layer by layer some plastic some metal whatever you need now think about it mother port when we wanted to do it we had to do that layer by layer right kind of stuff we had to add shade we had to remove you know use use photolithography etcetera but now 3d printing if it allows me to print fr4 print copper wherever I want and I have I can have any kinds of shape my copper traces doesn't have to be rectangular anymore right I can have much more traces so all this is possible I can make a whole motherboard out of that can i slowly connect 3d can I print the solder joints can I print the interconnects layer by layer yes why not it is possible there's not been done yet but it is possible opportunities are endless with 3d printing so it's one of the hottest and very new area hottest techniques and lots of rnd efforts are going on new materials deposition method structures micro nano scale of 3d in in micro nano scale 3d fabrication devices of the order of you know 0.1 millimeter 2.00 one millimeter some one micron possible optical elements MEMS microelectromechanical systems you see these in Vienna University what they have made these are in microns okay nano scribe another one so it's an important application but printing micro structures with features a few hundred nanometers in size could be in the electronics industry but currently patterning nano scale features on chips involves very slow explained Civ techniques this is from MIT technology review it is showing the promise of 3d printing okay so that kind of brings us to the end of this course we talked about three very hot and current areas lead-free solder carbon nanotubes and 3d printing what I will do is I will end this course with a small video trying to show the relevance of what we just covered as part of this course this electronics packaging and manufacturing sector the relevance and importance in the Indian context all right so I hope you saw that video and the video kind of underlined you will appreciate that the video kind of underlined and highlighted the importance the growing importance of electronics industry even in the Indian context today if you look at some of those numbers I mean an annual growth of twenty six percent year-on-year that's really mind-blowing well honestly I think we have not been able to hit that number the actual growth over the last four five years have been in the range of 12 to 13 percent year-on-year but that itself is quite staggering right and this is because of the way that electronics products primarily consumer electronics products have percolated into our lives as you saw there we are the second largest number of Internet users in our country we are a country which is one of the highest users of smartphones and we see that around almost all of us have smartphones today okay so that kind of shows the importance and the growth especially in the consumer electronics markets and not just that we are talking about a digitally connected world today Internet of Things and all these require electronics and electronic products and devices right so what we have done as part of the course have been trying to highlight what all goes into the design and manufacturing of these electronic systems and also to ensure that it performs reliably as per our expected expectations over its life cycle okay so that as I said before this brings us to the end of the course and today I also have my co-instructor professor Gautam Chakraborty with me I hope you have found this experience or or found this course to be a good learning experience and if nothing else you have been able to appreciate how important and how multidisciplinary this entire area is right it requires a a good electronic product requires expertise not just from a VLSI designer it requires expertise from semiconductor physics from electrical engineers mechanical engineers material scientists manufacturing engineers reliability scientists and so on and so forth and we have tried to give you a little flavor of all these aspects that goes into electronic packaging and manufacturing okay so if you recap we started with a little bit on the basics of semiconductors and then we went to what we call the first level packaging which is the silicon on the chip carrier following that was the second level by the chip carrier along with the silicon chip was connected to the circuit board and the circuit board if you recall was the platform which facilitated communication among different electronic components right and then there was a third level where the circuit board went into these sockets and holders and finally gave the shape to the final product inside a chassis and then in the second half of the course we talked primarily about the reliability aspects where we first talked about thermal management the importance of it and also some cooling technologies we talked about solid mechanics or applied mechanics in ensuring that these products are performed reliably and finally we also looked into the reliability considerations the physics of failure and so on and so forth and of course in between and at the end also we had some special topics of very high relevance hot topics of research as of today so hopefully I hope or we hope that you found this experience to be useful I will have professor Gotham chapter what they say a few words about how he felt as part of this course and then we will wrap up hello so I hope that you have enjoyed this course and you have found it useful dr. Bhattacharya has taught you different aspects of very complicated subjects I am sure he did a very commendable job in that and for my part I taught you basics of vibration which is a very important for the packaging industry but it is a difficult subject as well but I hope you have found it useful and in due time you will learn more about this and you will feel interested in more detailed research topics on the similar on this subject and that will be our remains pleasure if you get yourself involved and if you find whatever way we contributed to your knowledge has become successful and with this I think I thank all of you for your kind attention and on our property area yeah that's a very nice thought I mean as we said I mean whatever we have taught if you can actually use them or pursue them as potential topics of research in your careers ahead then we would really feel that our effort has been white while have has been worthwhile so with that what I would end is with something that I said right at the introductory video or the introduce a small five minute introduction that was recorded for this course as I said I spent quite a few years at Intel and the question that was often asked to me is you're a mechanical engineer what are you doing in a company like Intel that's where computer scientists should be or electronics and engineers should be so I hope after this course you will appreciate and you will that the mechanical engineers also have quite a bit of a role and I would say quite a bit of a critical role to play in the electronics industry okay thank you very much and we wish you all the best in your careers ahead
