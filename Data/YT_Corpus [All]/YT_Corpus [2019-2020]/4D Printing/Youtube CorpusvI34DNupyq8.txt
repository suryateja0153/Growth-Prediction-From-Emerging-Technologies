 [Music] now it's my pleasure to introduce professor McNasty one of our more prolific inventors one of the world leaders in 3d printing please go ahead thanks I communication we all read books newspapers signed documents and we have many many copies of variety of documents we all use cell phones that we used to forward messages to a variety of people but it wasn't like that always first old man used to convey his ideas and dreams by cave painting and since people have started to express themselves by writing it is considered to be as the northern the beginning of the modern world since then nothing really has changed too much only fourteen forty five Gutenberg has invented the printing machine he invented the printing machine and the most famous printed item was the Bible since the printing of the Bible and the invention of printing machine information exploded all over the world mainly at the beginning at Europe but you can make more and more copies which will be exactly the same copies unlike this cake painting since 1445 still nothing really has changed too much you take a paint or an ink put it on a paper on the wall on a carpet and you get an image which is information we all have at home printers printers now cost about $50 nothing nothing very exciting about it for me what's exciting is is that the ink cost a lot money and our expertise is making inks so ink is really very simple to make please we are hearing closed audience so don't tell anyone I'll tell you a secret all you need to do is to take pigments or material that will become a pigment it can be a tomato can be mud can be ashes you simply mix it in a food processor like instrument shake it and then at the end you end up with particles dispersed in a liquid which is a pain I'll come in a minute to this can that you see campaign what we are interested is now nothing simply get generating blue or yellow or red colors we are interested in making functional paints and functional inks the meaning is that we deliver a function beyond color what you see on the right side is a cane which contained a black paint black paint we all know the cars are made of many cars bare of paint but with the black colors all the documents are printed by black colors but our black paint is unique and it is unique because it can the pigment can collect the sunlight radiation and convert it into heat and the heat is converted in is used to convert water into steam and the steam is used to generate electricity so this process is called thermal solar power generation so this black paint that we have developed was licensed by company called bright shows and this company is making the largest thermal solar plant in the world while using our black coating which is heat resistant like 6 700 degree C and it capable to absorb all the sunlight and then convert it into very heat high temperature what you see here is a power plant in California which is already producing electricity to over 100,000 houses and the company now is working on the next plans in China and in Israel which will be even bigger so we learned in this project how to make paints and inks that are heat-resistant could can we use that for other applications yes a few years ago an entrepreneur came to me and asked can we print black paint on glass why is it important for when you go back to your cars you'll see a black frame on the windows of the car the purpose of this black paint is not for decoration it is to protect the glue that hold the glass to the body of the car from the UV radiation but this is done usually by a conventional screen printing process and the entrepreneur asked us can we make it by inkjet printing process which is a digital process one year later we ought we were able to make that ink we use inkjet printers the same as you have at home for 50 dollars but with the much larger printer the size of 3 by 3 meters of 6 by 6 meters and what you do is really print our heat-resistant ink on a glass and then put the printed glass in an oven so since we have a glue which is composed of nanoparticles of glass this glue is embedded with the whole image within the glass so we have an image on glass which is stable for many many years and the company because of this business development decided to move from the automotive industry into the architecture field so what you see on the right side is examples of readings all over the world for example on the the left corner you see the Assad of Harlem Hospital here in New York which is printed by our technology using the inks and the company has developed the printers we use none of materials in our inks water nanomaterials one nanometer is one millionth of a millimeter just to give you a size per second perspective one hair fiber which I don't have is about thirty thousand nanometers this is really big so what you see here is an electron microscope of a hair fiber and the colorful samples that you see here you can also see them at the exhibition out there is really gold and silver that are different than the gold and silver that you know the we can make blue silver red gold blue gold yellow gold green gold purple silver etc simply by controlling the size and the morphology of these particles what is it good for the path the material really changes its properties when we go down to size it is using nano medicine a variety of application professor Berlin will talk later about a unique application which take advantage of these small particles our expertise is in making metallic nanoparticles and we have working we've been working on making silver nanoparticles for many years and we were able to find several simple synthesis process in which we could get silver nanoparticles the simple nanoparticles are good for making conductive inks I will show it in a minute what you see on the left side is how this particles are formed by simple chemical syntheses in which we take a mixture of chemicals including vitamin c really very simple and if you use a material which is called carboxymethyl cellulose that is used in ice cream cost about one dollar per kilo you mix it in this solution and you can control the size of the resulting particles so we have ways to manipulate the size and morphology of the particles and what you see done at the bottom of this slide is a silver ink which is made a very highly concentrated system that is stable for a very long time go back to the Nano in fact silver melts at about 1,000 degrees C what we see what you see here is electron microscope photographs of silver nanoparticles which are heated at various temperatures and you see that at about 200 degrees C this silver nanoparticles became melted so we have a degree decreasing but to 800 degrees C simply because we changed the dimension of the particles what is it good for imagine that instead of printing black color or yellow color we print silver nanoparticles and if we cause these particles to merge together we can get electrical conductor what is it good for all our electronic devices contain electrical conductors so this brings me to the field of 3d functional printing we can use this type of materials to print solar cells to print circuit boards which are in every device to print smart windows displays now phone touchscreen etc so it show only a few examples of using this type of particles for making a application in print electronics here there's an example of the company called nano dimension it is already traded in the Nasdaq that is doing rapid prototyping of 3d printed circuit boards so what they do the print our ink then put another layer of insulator and our ink is a letter and we get 3d printed circuit board so what you could do in one in one month now this company can do it in a few hours or only and on the right side you can see that it really works there is a device a small robot that can function with use while using our inks you can also print electroluminescent devices imagine that instead of having this light projectors you can print the light on the walls so this is actual sample of printed light emitting device you can also see it in the exhibition out there it takes about one hour to make the whole device this is really amazing because this is the strength of digital printing you press the bottom and you get a working device we can also make smart windows to those of you who travel the Dreamliner remember that the there is no shades on the windows you only have to press a button and then the color or the opacity of the window changes from transparent into a pack or transparent to other colors this is not yet our technology in this plans that we have developed together with collaborators a nice technology that uses our inks all printed as you see there it is connected to Internet of Things communication between devices so we don't have to worry too much about labeling and then gluing etc we simply print directly on the requested device we can also make transparent solar cells so imagine that we have buildings that the windows are not really windows there are transparent cells solar cells so you can see through these solar cells again made by printing by self-assembly and using nanoparticles that we produce in our lab and also with my collaborator Leo cigar so this is all about 2d printing what about 3d object can we make them the answer is yes on the left side you see traditional way of making an object you start with the bulk material in this case it's a wood you cut this wood into small pieces and then you have to glue this wood into a larger path on the right side what you see is that someone press the bottom and cause an inkjet printer to print water on flower what happens when you print water on flour it solidifies 'iz or in gypsum it also solidifies so this poor guy on the left side is still working on making de ja and on the right side we always see that we can get the printed 3d structure you can make very complex structures as you can see here and all you need is really to design whatever you have in mind press the button and you get a sub n object so manufacturing is really going digital it can be used for engineering prototyping for example my students when they need an instrument they just simply go and print it and it cost to my lab quite a lot of money and it's real fun we can also use it for future application in the past I used to use this slide as future applications but some of it is already here we can print organs of the official heart it will happen I have no doubt that it will happen we are on the way to do it collaborating with people which are coming from biology and bring our expertise in new materials for making scaffolds but at the bottom you can see personalized hearing aid that is already existing so you can scan your your ear and print this hearing aid which will fit exactly your ear this is in sweden company in sweden also if you go to a dentist if you go to sophisticated dentist most likely he will print the replacement that you need so the future is already here no wonder that this field of additive manufacturing or 3d printing is considered as the next industrial evolution and in america there is a lot of money invested in research in Academy and Industry the program by Obama administration of America makes etc we also recognize the importance of this field at the Hebrew University and we established about a year ago the first Center in Israel that deals with functional and 3d printing it is equipped with top-of-the-line printers and we encourage people from different faculties different disciplines to come so we quite often see people from biology and brain sciences and physics and chemistry and agriculture and even students from our school that come in they use this printing an example of a nice collaboration is this a Nokia that you see on the right side a collaboration between me and Ovie while taking his quantum dots and embedding them within our polymerize herbal inks he will talk more about this I don't have time for that we can also make stretchable materials we have developed very recently materials that can be printed and can be stretched 10 or 11 times it's their original size you can make with this grippers what is it good for soft robotics we can start printing arms or legs of soft robots or we can use it for medical purposes imagine a medical gripper and we are discussing this week with surgeon about making real printed devices that can go into our body so there are really a lot of possibilities in this field this was 3d printing we are already in 4d printing what is 4d printing this is printed object that can change its shape while exposed to some trigger and the trigger can be simply time it changes its properties its shape by time temperature humidity like fulfill whatever so what you see on the right side is a printed medical stand that start to move and expand to its original form after it's been printed so you see there on the right side it is the stent that opens up after it's been exposed to our body temperature on the left side you see a result of an art student who saw our work this is by the way by using a special material which is called shape memory polymer it's a polymer that has a memory we printed in one shape we abuse it somehow and then it goes back by itself to the original shape that we have printed so this out student made jewelry which is called dynamic jewelry you have a ring you go out to the Sun when the ring is opened this is really for fun what else can we do with that next generation medicine forget the regular pills that you know from home imagine that you can print pills that have multi challenge that can open up when we want only where we want it you see them again the width there that to begin the weight small and one in a big one the small one is while it is immersed a acidic condition as we have in our stomach the big one is the same one expanded tremendously after it reaches high pH as we have in our intestine so imagine printing a pill Megan McGann the VIP pill double shielding appeal that you swallow and will open up only at your intestine or it can be used to protect the drug that they don't want it to be exposed while it is in the stomach and so on the right side what you see is actual printed pills which have really funny shapes the shapes are because you want to have a pill that is very small when you manufacture but when it goes into a body it will open up and send fingers and tails and whatever to control the release of the drugs so this is a research collaboration with dr. Benny from the School of Medicine so we collaborate and join forces in order to get nice interesting results so this is next-generation medicine we're just going to submit the patent the beginning of during this week so I am free to talk about the taste I couldn't resist seeing so many beautiful women here to talk about cosmetics and this is introduction to always work on other not a type of nanomaterials so we have developed a nanoparticles of dead sea minerals we simply took the dead sea water and converted into into nanoparticles women became we become addicted to it samples for that one is available also exhibition and in order for you not to forget what I talked about a recent development of nano droplets of pomegranate oil which is very very potent antioxidant that can go to the brain it is sold since three months ago is a food supplement that can help protecting neurological diseases what else I don't really know what I say is only that we have to fly with our imagination and try to print our dreams thank you very much [Music]
