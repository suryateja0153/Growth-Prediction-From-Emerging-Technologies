 there is one positive that we have seen during this pandemic it is the piece of the human spirit that jumps in to help and not just from adults but from young people as well when two students at st. John's Country Day School saw that first responders did not have enough personal protective equipment they realized that something they learned in school could help here's how molding an idea into something that could save lives is the project's the Hodge Patel and Jonah Katz from st. John's Country Day School have been working on when they heard about companies refitting technology to make personal protective equipment it gave them an idea using the school's 3d printer they began making face shields for first responders they donated their first set of 32 the Clay County Emergency Operations Center they say it is amazing to take the skills they have learned in school and amplify it to a level where they know they are making a difference to those on the frontlines fighting coronavirus and they have no plans on stopping so if you would like to donate to be able to help them or if you just want to maybe reach out to them we have a link to do that inside this story on First Coast News com they also say any other schools out there any other students who have access to 3d printers they are happy to share the plans and the specs with them so that way more people can be making these face shields they also wanted to say a big thank you to their families for letting them essentially take over the house with these these with this equipment and with all of these supplies and a thank you to miss Gorman at their school their director of technologies for helping teach them how to do all of this
