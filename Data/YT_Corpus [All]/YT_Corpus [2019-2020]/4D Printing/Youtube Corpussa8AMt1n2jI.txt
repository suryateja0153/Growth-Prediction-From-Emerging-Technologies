 So before we start with today station so little bit of background about me I have almost more than seven years of experience in IT delivery and consulting and I have worked in diversifying Domain but mostly I have dealt with different kind of data set and I have been helping our client into giving different kind of big data solution but I have broad knowledge in Big Data Analytics cloud and iot but my passion is more into the data science and so that's that's the time I used that area into data science and from there on for last 45 years I have handle different kind of pollution like in pre sales manager in data science business concern then and helping data scientist as well to groom into their area and in terms of analytics project you can talk to me about a different kind of traffic light supply chain sales customer marketing and BPO so feel free to ask your question as I said I would be taking the question in the end after 10:45 so normally I would like to understand the audience and their expectation but since I won't be able to ask the same thing for all of you so probably we can quickly start with the station and as I said while you post your question from you can give little bit of your background so this is the agenda for today so first we should start with high level data science application what is happening right now in industry what is going to happen in future but will also understand at what point we are at so why today and why you should learn about this things I would be discussing about that then the second would be very much interesting so whoever has started just Google in what is data science what is analytics what is a I am sure you are quite in you have already been interested that's why you are joined this but still there are a lot of confusing terms of those terms I would be clearing out what is machine learning what is AI what is big data how to join big data and data science and create Big Data Analytics pipeline and then would be also talking about a case study which is about fraud analytics and I think these second part would actually clear your thoughts around this and you would also understand which aquaria to choose so that I would be talking mostly into III section where I would be talking about what are the opportunities what are the different kinds of roles are there what are the kind of companies are hiring and and what is the market you have so that you can actually get into that area and I would be also explaining that it doesn't matter with water background you come from or whatever experience do you have you had some role in data science even if you have 25 years of it experience even if you don't have any experience at all in it still there is a role for you in data science which should be interesting in this III section should be with us and feel free to ask your question but we would be starting with a small video I hope you would be hearing about Sofia Sofia the First AI robot and would be actually looking at a snippet and then probably we can start before this. There was couple of question but the robot was actually given all those question and answer so it was quite easy for her but now the question is coming those are actually random question which is coming at her way now listen to the question and definitely if you have not heard about her interview would be surprised so you might think that is not the correct answer but he intentionally ignore that question because that might create a doubt and controversy around Sofia that's why she intentionally ignore that question sorry about that I think I think that's enough and probably that is why I chose this video because still people and thinking it's about only hi. Hi. If you do a Google search and YouTube then you would understand that there are a lot of negative article about Sophia that this is nothing but a program but to be very honest I am also quite excited about the future and I hope that I can in this one 1 hour and 40 minutes I can also create lot of interest among you so late understand what already happened in this last 100 years what happened if you see the big Industrial Revolution so we are at 4 Industrial Revolution 4 but what happened in last three the first one was when we actually created invented steam engine so we experience the industrialisation and urbanisation around lot of different industries and that time productivity was around 0.3 % then I come with the early Robotics where we are talking about the production line so there was mass production from electrical power oil and steel but still the productivity is like 0.4 then come the use of it which came on 1995 to 2005 so using computer and internet we could achieve lot of productivity until this. Everything was fine and where are growing at good place but something happened around 2015 and which actually go on till 2065 and which I am not saying this is actually from McKinsey paper you can get it as well that this is going to come from automation which is industry for industry 4.0 right now we are looking at it and this productivity would come from fusion of different Technologies suggested come from digital and physical due to artificial intelligence big data cloud and iot and if you just search about this which is actually Hype cycle if you just search about Hype cycle Gartner Hype cycle of Technology is emerging Technologies there are so many Technologies right now in the height cycle which include deep learning machine learning connected home lot of things but one thing is evident that these and which is artificial intelligence machine learning and deep learning these three will actually exist all the other future developments and all the other Technologies so you can talk about cloud but you can get the highest efficiency when you come by in cloud with you can be a very good IIT engineer but you can get highest use usage of it when you combine iot with a n m n i am not explaining all of them but I would actually ask you through couple of industry use cases which can probably a give you enough excitement in your own domain that how this is going to change everything so it doesn't matter whatever industry you come from say when you coming from agriculture so there are so many use Kesar happening in agriculture I am sure you would be hearing about Drone so right now Drone can be passed on to the field and they can actually capture all the humidity and soil master and all the stuff and based on that probably you can come up with a machine learning algorithm which can tell you what is the kind of what is the kind of pond or wheat or rice or whatever you should actually be so that gives you more productivity similarly in Automotive in Healthcare in telecom there are thousands and thousands of use cases where machine learning can be used this is also from am I can see paper you you can search about it that there are so many industry and there are so many use cases but I would be talking about couple of use cases today but I want to give a Framework so that once you go back from here you can also learn about these use cases and you can utilise that knowledge in your own domain in your current current age job so one there are three lenses so there are three lenses by which you can look at any any application so first lens is about your industry lens so which industry you are working on suppose you are IT Engineer but you are working on bfsi PUC there would be whatever the application your building till last 5 years problem you can say you changed their sunao fraud can be detected by machine learning the credit scoring can be done by machine learning if you are working on Telecom earlier you are building application where whoever was leaving for tomorrow you can see a machine learning application which is not only telling you who is leaving your Telecom network brother who is going to leave the predictive analytics can be also done similarly if you are in manufacturing then normally see that what are the parts is going to be broken so that is predictive maintenance even before the path got broken it can be predicted similarly for transport and Logistic also everyday Paytm Flipkart Amazon are using this transport cost Optimisation so that they can tell you that what time your product should be delivered so that the guy the delivery guy can reach maximum home similarly there are plethora of example in different industries I can talk about it I am in 6 hours and 7 hours but still that only cover similarly in terms of business function also if you are in if you are doing SAP CRM then you know the customer and analytics but you would see there is a you change going on in near future because everything whatever you used to do in SAP that we now driven by machine learning similarly you are if you are in to sell side of 8:00 UTC that whatever you used to do in excel prove that is going to be replaced by machine learning Technology all the business function it can be HR it can be supply chain it can be fraud everywhere machine learning is going to come
