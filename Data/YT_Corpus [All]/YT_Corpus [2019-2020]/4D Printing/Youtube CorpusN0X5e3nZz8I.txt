 [Music] hello guys how are you doing so i'm back with another video this time i'm showing you 3d print 2. um as you can see we have this sneaker from request you can get them from finger words and they already made the design already made what you just have to do is just use your print printer and as you can see for each shoe we have three parts the shoe itself the sword the left and right and also even the laces are filament from and we have the blue one that is here really nice like the design the finishing layer by layer and the top is astonishingly shiny and we have this white one too uh what's most important about this shoe is that they are flexible you can see it so we're gonna try them out and you will see and we use this material the tpu as you can see yeah from over tour and specified uh also puzzle temperature the bed temperature and the printing speed you have this one uh the white transparent one in this video guys i'm gonna show you how we 3d print these shoes they were not manufactured there is no mold involved in it just 3d print as every one of you can make it from home so see you we're gonna open the file that we have the printing on so it's the request sneakers2 this one is a size model that is reduced i would say it's about 10 so the sneakers are here on the top of the bed i'm using a cr10s crearity this one we just turn it over and make it suit the way i print it just was like this yeah i prefer this angle so from here you can see the shoe looks like it fitting inside of the bed which is a good thing when i go go to the standard quality we have the standard quality we can also just take recommend but i would go with a standard card i like the finishing to be really natural so the layer height i will put it at 0.1 millimeter so the wall thickness 0.8 uh wall line i will take two so the bottom thickness i will take 0.5 and what's more interesting here is the infield i just put it at 20 since i if i put it at 100 it will be too heavy and not flexible anymore uh the info pattern i would take cubic at the temperature i just follow what manufacturer is saying to me at the print speed i make it at 50 millimeter per second uh that's it [Music] i'm crazy since you're gone what thank you guys for watching see you peace
