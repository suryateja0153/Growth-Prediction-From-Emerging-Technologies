 Good morning, good afternoon, good evening on today's webinar, hosted by Michael from Taopix and myself, Ray from Ultimate TechnoGraphics. We have a large crowd today so we thank you for connecting and making the time to be on today's webinar on How to Automate Photo Printing. You'll see of course different examples live in a few minutes from now. Michael will be doing a live demonstration on Taopix and I will be doing a live demonstration on our new Ultimate Impostrip, new generation version.
