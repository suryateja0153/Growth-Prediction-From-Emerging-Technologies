   Music   Tension Pistons The Tension Piston developed at the Wyss Institute and MIT CSAIL amplifies piston force and increases energy efficiency by using flexible materials to transmit fluid-induced tension. Conventional pistons are made of hard materials that move along the wall of a rigid chamber to transmit fluid-pressure-induced tension forces. Tension Pistons use a flexible membrane enclosing a compressible rigid structure to transmit fluid-pressure-induced tension forces. The Tension Piston is able to produce substantially greater force compared to a conventional piston at the same driving pressure. In object crashing comparisons at the same driving pressure, Tension Pistons (on the right) develop greater forces than conventional pistons (on the left). The Tension Piston (on the right) can outperform conventional pistons with subtantially higher power and energy efficiency. A numerical model can predict the linear Tension Piston's performance. Tension Pistons can be constructed with a variety of configurations and materials. Tension Pistons can be used in pumps, engines, compressors, shock absorbers, or energy storage devices to convert force/torque to fluidic pressure/energy.
