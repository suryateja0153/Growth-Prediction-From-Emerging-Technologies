 this video introduces activists texture displays and gives several examples involving functional prototypes of those kind of displays active display means that those displays do emit light they do emit photons on this slide you can notice on the left side former and said student wearing and active display design produced for French telephone operator company France Telecom in the early 2000s the company's logo is in the upper part of the jacket the photo of the company's CEO that period is in the middle and the 3x3 alphanumeric matrix containing nine alphanumeric patterns able to display numbers and letters is located in the lower part on the right side of the slide you can see better how each alphanumeric nine independent segments individual display is defined moving text or numbers have been possible to be displayed in the lower part of the jacket the principle of functioning of this active display based on the weaving or optical fibers is explained in following slides on this slide is shown on the left side eight by eight independent pixel light emitting optical fiber flexible display o FF D on the right side a same picture on the o FF D structure realized by optical fibers weaving within two layer basic velour fabric is present optical fibres used in this display are 250 micrometers in diameter they are made in plastic more precisely PMMA the main principle leading to design of Oh F F V is explained in following figures as our or f FV is realized by living optical fibers it is necessary to produce some lateral light leakage in order to be able to see the light emitted by the display when the light source is connected to optical fibers beams used for each pixel there are two possible methods to provoke this light leakage pattern from an optical fiber in the first figure in the upper part of the slide you can noticed then when the light is introduced on the one side of optical fiber because of different refractive indexes that are one for the air one point for approximately for the cladding of the optical fiber and one for in fact five for its core the light rays remain inside the core the first method to generate some light leakage is based on the cladding treatment the cladding thickness is about five to ten percent of the total optical fiber diameter those micro holes let sunlight out with the o F optical fiber and therefore a light leakage is possible lateral micro holes are made either mechanical by projection of micro particles on the cladding or chemically by brief application of acid and solvent on the cladding also this method is quite efficient but the emitted light is not homogeneous and some light spots appear on the o F surface the second method able to generate more homogeneous light leakage without light spots is based on the bending of optical fibres above the - of the angle value therefore a small amount of the light goes outside of the optical fiber to produce light leakage effects are shown on the right side of this slide showing light spots for the first method and more homogeneous light leakage for the second method two pictures made by atomic force microscope microscopy AFM show the climbing morphology after the chemical treatment in the left side and after mechanical treatment on the right side it is possible to notice that the holes made on the cladding surface have more regular shape when the chemical solvent based treatment is applied comparing to the whole visible on the right side picture made the projection of sent micro particles at high speed on the of' surface however in both cases those micro holes generate high intensity light spots on the fabric made by leaving the optical fibers therefore by controlled alteration well defined surfaces of the f FD and by connection to corresponding EF beam to independent light sources it is possible to control such pixels in independent way in function of the connected light source intensity and its color the light will be guided by the UF beam to the surface of the fabric able to emit it laterally in corresponding color and with corresponding intensity this slide shows how light sources multicolored LEDs are connected to independent five beams each B corresponds to one independent pixel realize the living of life light sources in our case LEDs are controlled by a microcontroller and power interface in order to put on or off corresponding pixels if the light source is blue as shown on the 8x8 matrix on the right side all the pixels will be blue when lit on Dornier industrial weaving loom having 24 independent frames used for optical fiber bearing is shown on the left side of this slide the specific feeding system for optical fibers used in that direction has been developed in order to avoid optical fiber packages during the vivek as optical fibers not elastic at all this feeding system able to follow a living machine movements is necessary a dreaming is also realized each other low speeds up to 120 hits per minute for 250 microns PMMA optical fibers in the middle and on the right side of this slide it is possible to observe light emitting fabric realized for a photo dynamic therapy emitting homogeneous light on the whole surface of about 100 Smith square centimeters the light source in this case is a diode laser emitting light is 630 nanometers that is red color adapted to the PDT this light emitting fabrics are deposited on the screen to activate photosensitizers were able to kill in selective way actinic keratosis pre cancerous cells
