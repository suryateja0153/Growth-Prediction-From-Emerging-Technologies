 every once in a while an animated movie comes out that is impossible to ignore spider-man into the spider verse is one of those movies it is without a doubt one of the best animated films that I've ever watched and it seems like I'm not alone and the Oscar goes to the film won the 2019 Academy Award for Best Animated Feature Film but what was it that made this movie so great let's break it down so I would say there were two main aspects that made into the spider-verse such an amazing film first a great story and second a unique groundbreaking animation style in this video I'll talk about that second part if you watch the film or even seen the trailer you probably noticed something was different about this movie the way it looks and feels is different from other animated films in recent years it doesn't look like 3d animation but it's also not really 2d as we know it so what is it if we look back to when the industry first made the transition from traditional 2d animation to 3d computer animation the shift was very clear it was obvious that Toy Story looked nothing like ranking the differences were visually apparent once the switch was made the industry worked harder and harder to push the art form as much as possible getting better and better renders producing more realistic results films kept looking better each year but there's only so far we can push it at some point all films just look amazing the fidelity is incredible and there seem to be no limit to all we can now produce with computer animation then the question had to be asked what's next now that we can make everything we can possibly dream of where do we go from here the people behind spider-man into the spider-verse found at least one answer to that question that is playing with people's expectations at this point we all know what to expect when we go to the movies to watch an animated film yes Disney has its signature style and Pixar is known for creating amazing worlds and illumination is still trying to go the other way with more edgy humor and cartoony characters Japanese anime is also rather visual predictable and Lika has mastered stop-motion to the point where it almost looks like CG honestly I got bored of animated films lately sometimes I feel like I watched them because I have to like I need to be on what's new so I don't get left out of the conversation it became more of a chore one that I don't particularly enjoy anymore it might be that I got older but it also might be because most animated films just feel the same but from the first minute I sat in the theater to watch into the spider-verse I knew I was watching something different I felt something I haven't felt in a very long time watching something new the film kept playing with my expectations I found myself staring at the screen trying to figure out how they did this or that I fought the urge to pull out my phone and start taking notes on all the things they did different I bounced between trying to analyze what I see - forcing myself just just sit back and enjoy the experience was a 2d or 3d what the hell cares it broke all of my expectations and felt almost like a new genre of animation like a nudey of course just to be clear it's not a nudie it's 3d animation I'll get to that in a minute if we want to innovate with animation it's up to us to come up with visual ideas that challenge our viewers in new ways go right when everybody goes left it's not about making the art form more sophisticated it's about using it in new and creative ways that is what the people behind this film did and now because you did click on this video for the question posed in the title let's talk about these technical things that movie did different from professional point of view and break down the whole 2d 3d things as I mentioned before spider-man into the spider burst is a 3d animated film not 2d by that I mean that the majority of what you see on screen was created with 3d models in a 3d program and not by drawing the frames in the traditional 2d animation way they use 3d models and rigs for the characters and backgrounds in this movie however there were a few innovations they came up with to make it look different mostly by adding 2d elements to the 3d assets they added line work to the characters face using 3d geometries to give the artists more freedom and creating expressive poses they also occasionally paused the film and overlaid the shell with to the illustrations of that one frame as a reminder that we're actually inside of a comic they pushed that idea even further by adding typography into the scenes like cell phone rings car screeches and even some narrations the team also painted over most of the frames and often used abstract backgrounds that resembled commercial motion graphics in addition to creating specific tools for producing a 2d feel to the movie the creators also made some very specific decisions for certain aspects of the art style these decisions played an important part in challenging our expectations I broke them down to frame rates motion blur and depth of field so one of the most visually apparent creative decisions in this film concerns the frame rate of the animation 3d animated films are usually created in 24 frames per second and this film is no different however the creator's did something really interesting with the animation of the characters themselves often reducing the character animation to 12 frames per second also known as animating on twos animating on Tuesday is usually done in 2d animation stop-motion and anime this means there is one new drawing every two frames when 3d animation came along the animation was done on once meaning every frame within that 24 frames per second is changing into the spider-verse still played on 24 frames per second but the characters were often animated on 12 springs per second while the camera movement and backgrounds were still moving on one that pushed that 2d filling even further and was one of the main elements that gave the film its now signature style another major decision was to not use motion blur in its traditional sense if you're not familiar with motion blur it's that blurriness that occurs when an object moves really fast on screen that blurriness is technically a defect seeing in lag movies since forever but when 2d animation came along they had to recreate it because viewers were already used to seeing it and expected it but since we're using a software we can easily turn it off this usually doesn't look so great as every frame is extremely sharp and crisp motion blur makes the motion feel smoother and softer but the spider-verse people wanted to do it their way they turned off motion blur and instead added quick drawings between fast motions to give the feeling of motion blur it's a common trick in 2d animation where motion blur can't exist organically they sometimes added broken body parts which they duplicate to create that motion illusion comic book uses a similar technique this decision allowed the artists to have even more control on how each shot looks and again push that to the Han Jahn comic book style even further lastly the creators did something pretty interesting with depth of field depth of field is the blurriness of objects that are not in focus usually the main object in each shot is in focus while the background and foreground objects are more blurry in spider-verse though in many cases when an object isn't in focus it starts splitting up into its RGB colors similar to a phenomenon called chromatic aberration in which objects on the edges of the frame start leaking their RGB colors this feature isn't just unique but it also pushes the comic book feel since printed comic books often had color misaligning during printing which causes some colors to be offset even when it's almost unnoticeable this decision adds to the overall comic book look layer built and now we have to ask ourselves does any of this matter well yes and no it matters because a studio has created a visual masterpiece that challenged us as the viewers in new ways that is no small task and now wanted to take for granted and yet it wouldn't have mattered if the story itself wasn't so solid if any of the story elements such as acting plot pacing and humor didn't work so well together all of this for visual extravaganza wouldn't have mattered at all well done Sony all done and if you want to learn about how to make your own animated movie we have a free ebook we created you can
