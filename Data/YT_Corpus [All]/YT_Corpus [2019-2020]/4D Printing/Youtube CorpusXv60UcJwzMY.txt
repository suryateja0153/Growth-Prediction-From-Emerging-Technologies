 a local engineering company in Fairmont is doing its part to give back to those responding to the corona virus pandemic Emily McNamara spoke to that business on how they're working hard to make a difference in an unpredictable time for tea tech solutions and Fairmont has been asked to help create masks for the National Guard that are reusable and give a person the ability to interchange the filter the design came from a doctor in Montana who shared the design with engineers all over the country so they can provide a better protective mask for people who are possibly exposed to the virus this will allow the mask to last longer before needing to be replaced it's something we can do to help in this interesting trying time we definitely want to do it it's just how we are it's what our culture is here at 4G tech if we can help we want to help and we've worked with the National Guard in the past so he has a were a veteran owned business he's the owner so we we it's very close to home for us 40 Tech Solutions has made 17 masks since Monday when they were cleared to start making them they have about two weeks worth of supplies right now but because the demand is so high for the National Guard medical workers emergency response teams and more they will continue to order new supplies and keep putting these masks together as long as they are able to personnel who are possibly exposed to kovat 19 are the number one need for masks but but something as simple as going to the grocery store can lead to getting the virus and everyone should be aware and cautious to stay safe it is important to keep our germs to ourselves especially when you're out and about if you're at the grocery store and you're just passing by somebody and you don't mean to get so close to them that leaves maybe a mask will protect you then from you and you from them for anyone who is exposed to Kovan 19 daily it is much harder to provide the proper masks to protect them emergency personnel just want people to work together to be wise about caring for masks and making sure not to quickly dispose of them they want to remind everyone that if we run out of supplies to make these masks and everyone will be affected reporting for 12 news I'm Emily McNamara
