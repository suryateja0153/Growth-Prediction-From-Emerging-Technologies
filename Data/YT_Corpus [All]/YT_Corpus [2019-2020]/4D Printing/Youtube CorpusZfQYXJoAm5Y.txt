 so what I will do here is I will go here enter a please enter your choice C is entered I will print C let's say D equals hint of C which means now P will be let me remove this this is not required by should I print C and then if you say T equals in dupsy now look at what I'm going to do next if P is equal to 1 : enter rent you entered one and now I'll run this you probably have no clue what I would hear this doesn't sound like English them sound like mathematics it doesn't sound like any language and you're very bugged I know it but stay patient let's see what this does I have are you please until your choice I sell one you entered one okay let me figure out what this is doing I'll repeat this once again run enter your choice I press two it shows nothing remember what we did with our scratch program yes you do remember right look at this we used set C equals something and then we said if C equals something then do something C equals to C or 3 do something similarly similarly I am trying to do it using Python right Python is not as beautiful as scratch where we can simply drag and drop stuff here you need to do some work what is that work [Music] type things that you what do you mean by that look at us and say if T is equal to 2 then prank you do where you put a little little put if I if I replace this by my name it will display my name now let me run this please enter your choice I say one which is you enter one let me run this once again I say my choice enter your choice I say King you enter the number to correct with window more of us if D is equal to 3 say what I say drink you enter the number 3 now that we're pouring I'll say I'm tired just like that for fun I'm saying something else here so let me run this my choice needs to be one it is one if my choice happens to be two it says you've entered the number two and if your choice appears to be three it will say you entered three now that's because that's not what I am saying here as I told you the computers that you are using is so dumb it'll just do the same time very faithfully see if you just do what you are asking you to do not more not less so it will actually say ah I'm tired so now it's very clear to you how if look books in Python a word of warning you should type if within brackets only you should type let's say D equal is equal to one please note it is not one equal in Python it is two equals you can ask me in scratch you could one equal here why on earth are you putting two equals here my friend English is different from Hindi is different German is different Sanskrit is different from Tamil Telugu Kannada you name it all these languages are different they come with they own style and you must stick to that style otherwise computer will slap you what does I mean fight I'll tell you what I mean by that instead of print if I say prnt you say and you run here you say please enter your choice I will say 1 and you see name prnt is not defined it got confused basically it'll show you a lot of unwanted stuff very scary stuff you start rendering you'll probably close your laptop and run away all the entry easier now don't worry about them it is quite a translate that computer gets confused doesn't know how to react so it will throw off all these unwanted text very careful what to say and what not to say let me write it back to print and then play it saying this will be a choice I enter one it does show you
