 Every year about 1% of babies in the U.S. are born with a congenital heart defect which makes it difficult to provide blood from the heart to the lung As a result they have difficulty with breathing and feeding To treat this defect surgeons make a connection between the heart to the artery that is connected to the lung by suturing a tube. The drawback of this kind of approach is it requires open heart surgery which is a very dangerous and a traumatic and expensive procedure Moreover since the device doesn't grow we need to repeat this surgery multiple times to accommodate the growth of children So the part that I'm interested in is if you think about our organ how our organ can grow, but if you think about a conventional implant device they cannot grow So if you can make a device that can grow we can potentially solve this problem So when I designed these devices we actually first needed to utilize a material that is approved by the FDA for cardiovascular device applications But if you think about those materials these are plastics that don't really make any changes Then how can we induce growth out of this material? The device that we have been developing is self-growing RV-PA conduit. Right ventricle-to-pulmonary artery conduit. This device has some kind of fold form, so if you think about a straw a straw has some fold but in the case of a straw it can grow in the length direction Now if you think about making a fold along this diameter it allows us to increase its diameter The 3D printing is kind of a desire for creating these devices because it can allow us to make a complex design that can result in this shape change So as a result we might be able to minimize surgery for children so that we can minimize risk associated with this procedure Hopkins provides the ideal environment to pursue this kind of research because at Hopkins many doctors are very open to have a collaboration with engineers And also, when I try to make some devices I need to know what are the kind of constraints what are the different conditions in the body Working with medical doctors I can get all this information and utilize this knowledge to design a device that is suitable for solving the clinical problems
