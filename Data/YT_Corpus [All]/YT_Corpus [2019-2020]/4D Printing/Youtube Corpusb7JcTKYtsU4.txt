  Hi everyone. i'm Samuel Logossou, and welcome to my course, Create a photo realistic beer bottle in Cinema 4D. I'm a 3D generalist, artist with experience in architectural visualization, product visualization, and similar fields. This in-depth course is designed to help you get a solid understanding of how to create a photo realistic product in Cinema 4D, and Photoshop. in this course, I'll start by showing you how to model the beer bottle by using spline and polygon modeling tools. Then, we'll adjust material properties to create an accurate reproduction of our reference images. You'll see how to create, a high-contrast lighting on a black backdrop with the help of the compositing tag. And after that, we'll learn, how to create a realistic material for the condensation forming on the bottle, and on the labels. Then, you'll learn, how to set-up a multi-pass rendering for the Physical renderer, and how to add some effects such as the depth of field and the Ambient occlusion, in order to create a professional-looking image. In this course, i will teach you, many of the tools and skills you'll need to create your own realistic product rendering for print and video advertising. I’m excited to share my workflow with you, and I hope you'll join me on this journey to learn texturing, lighting, and rendering with the Look Development for photo realistic product using CINEMA 4D and Photoshop. Now, let's get started with, Create a photo realistic beer bottle in Cinema 4D.
