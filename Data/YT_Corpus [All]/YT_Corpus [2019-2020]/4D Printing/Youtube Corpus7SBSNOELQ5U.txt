 well there are some good ideas out there too in these tough times especially when it comes to toiletry items the saying goes necessity is the mother of invention well John Thompson and his son certainly made one mother of a solution when it comes to the toilet paper shortage we seem to be in John sent us this picture yesterday it's what making lemonade out of lemons has come to in his house you see John's a chief technology officer at the insurance company an insurance company I should say and he put that technology aspect to work this week while he's been working from home John told us like a lot of us the last few weeks he'd been out looking for toilet paper and what did you find I found that was a little bit late to the Tea Party so what did you do I began using my resources and found that they had these egg rolls I could buy I didn't know how big mega roll was but I thought hey it's photo paper I'm gonna buy it now so I have it just in case and how big are these rolls well this is your normal roll right here yeah that's the mega roll Wow okay and yeah that's a lot of toilet paper so you're fortunate on that end yes but that doesn't quite fit in the dispenser that's usually in our bathroom yeah that's the problem I found is I received on my open the box and I said well how is that gonna fit in the bathroom and it just was so what did you do well I began collecting empty rolls and thought well maybe I can make a contraption that will reload these empty rolls for me and so that's where this bad boy came in okay so explain this bad boy to us what is this so essentially it's the rotisserie off my barbecue grill that I've modified ever so slightly to allow me to put the bigger rolls up above turn on the rotisserie and refill the rules below it rolls pretty slow okay to allow the rolls to cook properly on each side like so it's in this technically rolling a Wow so now your house is fully stocked with toilet paper we're getting we have anywhere between five and six people in the house at any given time so yeah we need to try to pick your giving new definition to a rolling your own and ve just set it and forget it that's right well congratulations John that is probably the most ingenious thing I've seen in a long time well desperate times call for desperate measures they certainly do and John yeah that's his name John he named his doohickey the reloader 3000 he says he and his son were bored yesterday they put together in about three hours by the way one of those mega rolls is about 720 feet of toilet paper a standard roll of two ply is about a hundred and eighty seven and a half feet long so John should be able to get about four regular rolls out of one of those mega rules and that's one way to very slowly wipe away the fear of going without
