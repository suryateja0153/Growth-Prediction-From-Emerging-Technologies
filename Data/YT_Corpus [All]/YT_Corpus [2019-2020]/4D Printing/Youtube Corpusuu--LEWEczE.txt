 alright ladies and gentlemen it's my pleasure to introduce our next speaker Skylar Tibbits is a faculty member from the department of architecture and he's the director of the self-assembly lab again as I mentioned before I direct you to the bios to learn more about it but he's been involved in a great many different things and won many awards he teaches in co design he teaches undergrad design studios & Co teaches a class called how to make almost anything now that sounds like a pretty cool class I I be interested to find out what you what's been made or attempted to be made and then among many others recently awarded a 2013 architectural league prize the next idea award at ARS electronica 2013 visionary innovation award 2012 Ted senior fellowship award etc etc enormous number of common accomplishments for for Skylar and just a little bit about this lab the self-assembly lab focuses on self assembly and programmable material technologies for novel manufacturing productions and construction construction processes so think about what we've talked about today the challenges that we're thinking about in the future and how this what we're about to learn about maybe another potential way to change the way our supply change our production processes work thank you very much scholar thank you so wonderful it's a pleasure to be here and hopefully I can convince you and describe what we work on self-assembly seems like a fairly abstract topic probably and I think historically it's an abstract topic at the human scale and at the industrial scale and that's what we try to focus on so I started this research lab arrived been doing this research now at MIT for about six years I'm in the architecture department I have a background in architecture and then I came to MIT and did computer science and the way that I got into this is because in the design space in architecture product design graphic etc computation and software is booming or was booming and is still booming and it's the fact that code has changed the paradigm in what we can design so it opened up this new possibility it evolved solutions massive iteration geometric complexity etc simulation then change the paradigm allowed us to analyze our design solutions far better than we could have before so computation revolutionized and is still revolutionising design it then went a step further and digital fabrication i think is arguing that computation can revolutionize the way we fabricate things you could change this video and you can replace it with a laser cutter cnc router waterjet cnc mill industrial robot arm you name it but the the link between computation and fabrication is changing what we can make and as I said software is changing what we can design our lab focuses on what happens after fabrication what happens after making parts this is me assembling a prototype for six hours straight and I think it's pretty indicative of the problem that digital fabrication gives us this new freedom of complexity that everyone talks it about but we forget about what happens after we produce these super complex things then they have then we have this huge task of assembly which is a major problem and we forget about how we use these things and what do we do with them and what is the interaction between the user and the product and so we try to focus on is how can we bring computation to construction or how can we bring computation to the the last phase of that which is after materials are made and how we assemble them how we interact with them and we specifically look at human scale and industrial processes like manufacturing assembly construction distribution products and user interaction etc so this macro scale world if you look at other people that are interested in self-assembly and reconfiguration and programmable materials most of those are happening at nano scales biomechanical material science and and maybe robotics applications and what we're trying to argue is that there's this you opportunity at the macroscale world to rethink the way that we assemble things rethink the way that materials can interact with their environment and the user etc and what I would like to argue is that we should probably switch from a mentality of only automation to a mentality where materials can do more and meaning we don't need to get rid of robots we don't need to eliminate them altogether there's a lot of advantage to automation but if you go to almost every industry people will say well the solution is automation if we can just make smarter robots then we can solve all of our problems in manufacturing we solve all of our issues but I think there's a big problem there it's ignoring the material solution and ignoring the environment around it and what we're trying to do is allow materials to have a greater conversation materials are great at physics they're great at responding to energy and they're great in material properties change a behavior shape etc and so what we need to do is have machines that are good at things that machines are good at precision repeatability etc humans that are good at creativity abstract thinking etc and materials that are good at physics responding to energy and material properties and so we need to have this dialogue and so that's where we're switching to a mentality of smarter materials and potentially self-assembly so self-assembly is a process by which disordered parts build an ordered structure completely independently so non guided energy and when we take non guided we mean I'm not picking up parts with myself or a robot and I'm not forcing them into place sledgehammer lots of energy fighting tolerance this sort of brute force mentality of assembly but rather I'm supplying noisy energy to get them excited and through this noisy energy they can assemble themselves and if you look at every process outside of the human scale this is fundamentally how things come together if you look at biology chemistry physics at super small scales or super huge scales there aren't any molecular sledge hammers screwdrivers robot arms etc right there they're looking at self-assembly how innovate individual parts interact with their environment and their neighbors and so what we've tried to do with lab is focus on what are the key ingredients to utilize this process at much larger scales the first one is really obvious materials in geometry so that's what we use every day everything is made out of material properties everything has shape functionality etc the second one is interaction interaction is how do those parts find one another how do they get excited and more importantly how do they error correct so we utilize a principle called error correction I'll show an example in a second but basically it's trying to find ways that you can have weak local interaction with redundant systems that guide themselves to more and more precise parts and they weed out errors which is exactly analogous to analog communication to digital communication which already voting sending more information than necessary so therefore you get perfect signals from imperfect parts so we're trying to do the same thing for manufacturing construction perfect systems and products from imperfect processes and parts and the last component is energy and energy is probably the most important and we're specifically interested in passive energy meaning agitation fluids heat sunlight pressure etc which are super abundant super cheap and can be utilized to get things excited and assemble into precise shapes so to give you an example if you have heat you probably want to dial in your material to respond to heat so you may want to use metal you want may want to use a thermal polymer etc if you lock in your materials let's say you need to use wood you probably want to use an energy that would can respond to like moisture and so we use these ingredients and dial in the system so that you can get active transformation one of the first demonstrations we did was a glass flask and you shake it hard and the parts break apart and then you shake it a bit softer but still randomly and the parts come back together to form the final structure and so this demonstrates to me that any person can pick this up have no idea what's in the bottle no idea how it works or what to do and can precisely assemble this structure but not because they're I hand coordination or because they know the instructions because they're supplying random entered it also shows that random energy can produce non-random results normally we think of entropy is breaking things apart and destroying systems and what we're trying to do is guide entropy into building useful structures so that it's easier for the parts to build something precise and useful than it is to break apart we showed the error-correction principle looking at chirality right handedness and left handedness where you dump a bunch of black and yellow parts together shake them randomly and you always get fully black and fully yellow you never get half in half and that's because if two parts connect in the wrong way they'll work and they'll connect a lot in the wrong way but it's very weak a third part can't connect there that makes it stronger so it'll break off if two parts connect in the right way a third part will connect and it makes it slightly stronger and then slightly stronger and then slightly stronger so that successful structures are guided and errors are weeded out so in that way we can guarantee precision of the parts this project looked at a slightly different topic more self organization than self assembly what you've seen in the past few examples was that precise parts can make precise final shapes or structures and therefore that's sort of a manufacturing application you have a bunch of components you want to supplies noisy free energy and you want to get precise products in this application we're looking at crystallization and material phase change like solid liquid gas you want a number of fundamental components that can come together to make vastly different systems like a solid liquid gas ice water etc so we were trying to study fundamental structures we looked at carbon and tetrahedral model using two positive and two negative poles and looking at what types of structures can emerge graphite diamond caffeine geometrically linear chains hexagons Pentagon's dodecahedron etc so same fundamental components vastly different structures based on their interaction with their neighbors and the guidance of the energy externally so we have a 200-gallon tank of water we deposit hundreds of these objects in there they're new buoyant so they move freely in all three dimensions and then in the back we have two pumps and those pumps we can blast the energy to break everything apart or we can calm the energy down to allow things to assemble we're somewhere in the medium where you get a vortex and you get sort of assembly zones and disassembly zones we can also oscillate the energy and we can create a regular patterns or more chaotic patterns and what we're interested in here is both the local patterns on the global pattern so if you look closely throughout this video you'll see a number of pentagons and hexagons or squares show up but we're also interested in the global lattices and patterns that that emerge and we see this project in a few ways number one it's an educational device that you can imagine in classrooms around the world that you have chambers like this that you can study what happens if I use carbon and I subjected to this amount of energy can I get graphene for example or can I discover new material properties and so therefore you understand existing ones and you turn the corner to try to discover new properties but we're interested to go a step further and we see this as sort of a future vision of where fabrication or manufacturing can go in the sense that you have these fluid chambers you deposit material you subject them to energy and they propose solutions and they reconfigure themselves into potentially optimal solutions that you may not have been able to simulate or predetermine prior and you can link that up with simulation so the simulation is actually analyzing what happens updating the environment etc so if you think about a bracket in a car or a plane or you think about a heat sink or many other structures the normal ways that we simulate it and then we 3d print it millet cast it etc and then we try to put in the field and hopefully it works and hopefully all the energy was calculated correctly and the forces don't change but as we know a lot of those things are very dynamic and so what we would like to do is deposit materials that can reconfigure themselves into highly optimal structures on the fly and so we can see this is sort of a design and fabrication chamber and that's we're now trying to turn the corner and do another project based on lattices and try to build engineered lattices that you can pull out of the tank and make fully structural systems so I'm going to turn the corner of it and go from our self-assembly self-organization research into our programmable matter research or programmable materials and we often are using printing 3d printing additive manufacturing as a way to do that but I think that we have a slightly different perspective then you've normally heard and there's a lot of hype about 3d printing and we're always at printing conferences or people want to talk about it and what we find most interesting is actually the challenges that printing has the hurdles that we need to overcome in order to utilize 3d printing in manufacturing and I've listed some on the right here there's probably many more but this is what most people aren't talking about why 3d printing is not so good right now because these are the opportunities we see number one is bed size so as printers get cheaper and cheaper and more accessible they get smaller and smaller and therefore less and less useful for industrial scale applications some people would take the perspective well maybe we should build huge printers and I argue that's not really the best mentality because if you want to build a skyscraper you don't want to have to build a skyscraper machine because you might as well stop at the machine there's no point in making the first one the second one is maybe we could build printer farms the problem there though is that if you produce a lot of parts and then you assemble those parts there's still an assembly problem which we need to get over and second the parts you're producing is probably are probably worse than existing parts that we use today so our I'll show a project that looks at how we compress material and print at super small dense scales and then we can unfold super large structures another one is print time that they're extremely slow software is an interesting one because right now one of our collaborators autodesk is focused on software and argues that it's one of the first times in recent history that we can build things that we can't design for normally you can design things we have no idea how to make it it's one of the first times that we can actually make things we don't how to design for and a good example is multi-material printing there's not even a file format that takes advantage of multi-material printing not to mention bioprinting there's no bio printing file format that can take advantage of all the complexity there so there's a huge advantage in software development right now material properties most people will talk about we need better plastics metals and ceramics and what I think is a more interesting discussion is how can we utilize 3d printing to go beyond the material capabilities today and embed multi functional properties like logic shape change property change visual appearance change etc how come we use this as a material science chamber to make new macro scale material properties so the first project I'll show is the one looking at bed size we did this project for ARS electronica with formlabs who's an MIT spin-off and they build a low-cost SLA printer but it's a great example because it's super high precision but super small the bed size is roughly 5 inches by 5 inches by 6 inches so I think it's a great example of what's happening as these printers get more accessible you can print less and less so all these things we found around the office that we can't print and we thought it was hilarious all these useful things like a fish super useful you can't print it so what we tried to do is take any arbitrary large-scale object break it down into a single strand you could break that into sheets or sub components then we break the Strand down into these chain like units and each chain has a lockable joint and that lockable joint can be designed to give the instructions of the final shape so we then crumpled the chain back up into a cube and we print that super super dense chain but that chain has all of the instructions so when we print the chain it's the most dense volume you could possibly get in in that chamber and when you pull it out it has the instructions for the product you want to build but you could change the final product send a new chain it would look exactly the same when you print it when you pull it out you have a whole different instruction set we were able to show that we produce a 50 foot long chain from five inches here you see us having some fun in Austria dropping it off the side of the building what you don't see is when we dropped it and smashed smash the chain into pieces and then we built a chandelier so this linear chain has all the instructions like straight straight straight right left up down right left etc into building this this chandelier structure and we think it's a great principle in order to build very large-scale systems you can imagine in space it's very similar to the principle of folding telescopes or solar arrays that you send a machine and super dense volume of material out of that machine you can pull out basically like an extruder you can pull out limitless amounts of material that and then if that material has the instructions or even better if that material can assemble itself then you can get huge functional objects so this project tries to go a step further showing that materials can indeed assemble themselves or at least reconfigure themselves it was a project with autodesk and Stratasys Stratasys is one of the leaders in 3d printing specifically because they have the contacts line of printers which is a multi-material printer right now you can deposit three and they're getting too many more super precise placement droplet resolution in all three dimensions with vastly different material properties and you can gradient between them so we created this project called 4d printing the idea was to create smart materials for 3d printing that we want to be able to print not static objects but active objects like actuators and sensors where the material transforms itself without any external control we use this connects material multi-material printer deposit to right now one of them is a rigid plastic the rigid plastic is like the Braille for this example basically it's a geometric program that has a structure backbones angles limiter it's all the precision and all the information for what we want to fold the other material is an expanding polymer and that expanding polymer reacts to water it expands 150 times sorry one hundred and fifty percent in in water and therefore that creates the potential energy and the sensing to transform so we have the information and the energy we've done a lot of work to be able to go from any one shape to any other shape both in 1d 2d 3d transformations right now the red is representing this expanding polymer so depending on the orientation we can get linear folding planar folding three-dimensional folding and a lot of calibration so now we can go from anyone arbitrary angle to any other in all three dimensions with autodesk we've been trying to work on a new design paradigm that allows us to design around programmable materials number one is can we simulate all the things we can fabricate and vice versa and number two is can we design structures saying I want a final product I have no idea how to get there from this state tell me where I need to deposit material so that I can print it and it'll get there or tell me if I print in this shape what will I get afterwards and so we're trying to turn the corner to have both simulation and optimization for 4d printing one of the first examples we showed was this single strand when dipped in water transforms into the letters MIT some good advertising and then we showed the letters MIT going from the 2d structure transforming itself into another 2d structure in this case it's the letters s al for the self-assembly lab but it's a bit like abstract art so you kind of have to squint it will help you in a second I'll show you so we showed here that we can go from any 2d to any other 2d shape bit of a cheat but it was good and then we tried to surfaces so I think surfaces show one of the greatest advantage of this technology that you can print super fast super cheap and then you take advantage of shipping and volume constraints you can produce the these super minimal structures and then activate in water and they can transform into precise three-dimensional shapes far more easily than if you printed that structure or if you print if you produced it another way and then shipped that structure so it takes advantage of the transformation to assemble either on-site or in a certain environment when it's triggered so this is a truncated octahedron structure that self folds another surface example I think this one is even more elegant that we moved all the joints and all of the angle limiters etc we print this record like shape with the two materials and we dip it in water and over the course of a few minutes it eventually jumps into shape and it produces something called curved crease origami so all of the white parts are creases and they fold mountains Valley Mountain Valley but they're folding on a curve so that gives you a saddle structure so you go from a flexible 2d sheet into an extremely rigid 3d structure with all the precision of that structure so you can imagine a lot of origami applications here or two-dimensional sheet to three-dimensional rigid body applications but most of what you've seen or all of what you've seen so far as folding and curling so a 2d sheet or one day strand that can fold and curl we had to go further and demonstrate stretching linear stretching is the only way to get double curvature at least from a flat sheet without folding and curling so there's a lot of applications in textiles fashion sportswear or architectural applications or you have flat sheets you want to deliver to site flat but then you want them to be activated based on their environment or their use and fold into a comfortable three-dimensional structure without forming it on-site and hammering it or slaving it away so what we can do is precisely expand every point across that surface and by expanding it or contracting it we can control the the three-dimensional doubly curved surface as it reacts to water so we can get this complex curvature from a flat sheet and with precise control one last example of the 4d printing work we rented out the Olympic swimming pool at MIT and we built this 50-foot long strand and over the course of an hour because we can't control the temperature of the water it transforms 75 times in linear length so this long strand folds itself much like a protein into a complex structure and here we're trying to demonstrate that these also could be educational devices and we've printed a number of different protein structures but that they point towards large-scale applications and large macro scale transformations okay I'll show one more project that we recently did and it talks again about printing but this time it 2d printing and we're using DNA we worked with autodesk to develop a design tool we take the DNA sequence actg etc and we and we synthesize a custom strand or many custom strands then we can draw in this tool and sign these biomarkers to the designs and simulate what happens if it wat if I wash with one marker I wash with another one or which ones interact etc so it becomes a design tool to simulate this biomaterial we worked on a couple different hardware platforms that allow us to deposit it it's basically inkjet printing for DNA so we can precisely deposit it and what you're seeing here is we've printed a pattern on the white paper and then we wash by hand with another complementary pattern and you see MIT show up and MIT only shows up when it meets that marker so we're looking at DNA as a as a basically magic ink like a smart ink that we can program it's binding with another biomaterial and we have we can design custom biomaterials that respond to the environment the sunlight air pollution proteins on my skin etc and by by designing around these bindings you can get graphics you can get packaging you can get inks that transform based on their environment and so you can I guess the sort of Holy Grail example is that you have a book and depending on who's holding it or what environment you're in the text the images are changing these become sort of smart displays using DNA so we went from something similar to abstract art again to the letters MIT which you can see a bit more clearly in these images so for me this image points to where we are today that we have super complex things that come together in super complex ways with really intelligent people and super engineered robotics etc but it seems a bit like we're forcing everything together and that there has to be a more elegant solution to make these really smart products that we want but allow them to come together responding to each other and responding to the environment so we make smarter systems and smarter manufacturing processes what I think we want to get towards is this vision where we have products and systems that are responding to my demands and my needs as they change and as the environment changes so a good example is in the sports bar space that if you take shoes you have a different pair of shoes for every activity or tires in the automotive space if a different type of tire for every road condition but if my shoes as I'm walking could then turn into running shoes when I start running or if I'm on grass they grow cleats or when it starts raining they close up and become waterproof or open up to breathe these are smart products that allow me to perform better and they're actually fluctuating based on the environment they're not static fixed objects that don't change for the life of them and that means that we need to buy all of these new ones or throw them out when you're not good and the environment destroys them so that means we need new materials and we take both perspectives we need to utilize fundamental research in material science so we can invent new materials but we also can combine macroscale materials like plastics woods metals phones all the materials we use combine them in smart ways taking advantage of the energy they already react to so you can get super smart transformation and that way they're not any more expensive not any harder to but they're more robust and more scalable so in that way we can create materials that have smarter behaviors and in manufacturing I think the application is more an error correction and allowing materials to be part of the manufacturing process to produce smarter systems in more elegant ways without trying to force them fighting tolerance and energy the shipping we talked about previously where you can take advantage of volume constraints and actually ship things that then assemble later or that they regulate themselves based on fluctuating environments in the shipping environment the last one is dis assembly and disassembly I think is a fascinating one where you could say material should be able to repair themselves we're working on some prototypes now that there's sort of pipe examples that when they get punctured a secondary layer expands and fills a hole so that they can repair themselves and there's a lot of research happening in that domain the second is that if you have functional systems they should be able to reconfigure themselves into another functional system when they're not needed and the third one is that if you can self-assemble you should be able to self disassembled for recyclability so you can separate all your fundamental components into different groups and then allow them to be recycled back into products so we're looking at this whole lifecycle and how products are produced how we interact with them how they're shipped and how they recycle so I'd invite everyone to come visit us at the lab or reach out and be happy to find collaborations and find exciting conversations that some of the research that we're doing and sort of this magic space that we're looking at and somewhere between art design science engineering and how that can apply outside of academia into real-world applications and we're super eager to talk to all of you and find more collaborations with industry right now we're exclusively collaborating with industry and almost all of our sponsorship is that is in that direction and I guess I'll leave we can open up to questions but I'll leave it in a question for you guys which i think is a challenge that we take on and really a challenge for everyone here it's not that we really know the solution but this is exactly what we're working on can we design material parts with enough information and decision-making that they can assemble themselves and adapt independently to internal and external forces so I'll leave it there thanks so much so Skyler has a question for you who's got an answer form or who's got another question you can avoid it yeah okay here you go and reminder just state your name and a company so Richard Roth with Hitachi how do you foresee groups being assembled for example your your shape once it forms up now I want to take 15-20 other shapes and I want them to self-assemble in your tank you had an example but it looked like magnetics what was holding those together yeah it's a great question and I would point to hierarchical assembly so we have a few ways to do that one one way that I think is interesting is probably related to biomolecular assembly again that you have kind of primary secondary etc and you assemble one structure and then those structures assemble together into larger structures and therefore you can have deterministic shapes at one level they're always going to make the fundamental building blocks they always come out of the fundamental components but at higher orders of magnitude they're going to meet you can bake art arbitrary complexity because as the those structures assemble again they can either go again to deterministic or branch off and then respond more to the environment so the you can use the environment as either a purely an assembly technique or you can use it as a way to guide the types of structures that emerge you're going to think about if we start changing the buoyancy over time or as you assemble a structure maybe the buoyancy changes collectively so you might start assembling sheet-like shapes even though they're built out of these fundamental components so it's something or certainly interested in doing for the most part we've kind of taken the low-hanging fruit that we can assemble precise shapes self's or error correct and now organized different ones but I totally agree next steps are to show arbitrarily grouping many types of components and the other one the other question I think you were hinting at is some of our early ones are on are using magnetics but you can obviously use material properties adhesion hydrophobic hydrophilic interaction you can use buoyancy you can use geometric locking mechanical structures as many static you can use many different properties to get materials to interact in smart ways okay another question yes Rob Rob Fitzpatrick from national ICT is try to an attempted answering your question but asking you the question in response strikes me from the examples you've given that food manufacturing and packaging could lend itself to this if you can automatically wrap and packaged items so it doesn't need to be food but I i can imagine there'd be a lot of hygiene and health benefits if he could with self-assembly the packaging might be able to wrap around products as soon as it comes off a manufacturing line is that something you've explored not specifically the food space for packaging certainly I think there's a number of things that we're working on the point to packaging the smart Inc scenario already like heat shrinks is a big space in packaging but if you can get it to have multiple states not just the one direction and then static but on-site or after shipping that then there's a second state that's activated and it's trying to design around the energies that you would meet so that it doesn't have hazard Lee assem under symbol itself on the truck or you know in some other environment but certainly packaging is a ripe example for that taking advantage of both shipping and volume and differences between manufacturing and insight etc but there's also the user experience side and there's a lot of magic that I think we're not really even talking about this point because we're trying to be super serious but that has a lot to do with it as well as we're playing with this is kind of spontaneous serendipity and excitement and so we've seen a number of people coming to us based on that side the novelty aspect and the excitement of packaging and how people engage with these physical objects here Scala if you don't only work on to test the structural integrity what will say a 4d printed object as opposed to a conventionally manufactured yeah it's a good question and the kind of secondary question that is robustness longevity and and more the material properties and I think the reality is were maybe half way to where we would like to be in material properties right now in terms of repeatability the materials will fold under water when you take them out they'll start to unfold it will never get back to the original shape it'll kind of get 75% there and if you dip it in water it'll go again over time it's degrading itself and so we would like to make a set of materials that are single directional certain applications only want to fold one way and then another set of materials that are bi-directional and extremely repeatable and nitinol and by matar by metallic alloys and some other shape memory polymers etc I think are closer to that domain but the reality is that we're not arguing our 4d printing work is exactly what will be implemented you know many applications are not going to utilize massive forms of contacts multi-material printers or the exact polymer composition I think it's more the vision that very simple production means and very single simple plastics not to mention woods metals phones all the other ones can have these type of very precise behaviors and so we're trying to say we could this is one way to do it and that we would like to work with people in many other industrial applications with other processes to have the same as same effect with other materials other industrial settings yeah question you know we supply chain guys are always challenged with the reducing costs and a lot of that has to do with raw materials and components so what what is your vision about the state of the art in terms of material substitution yeah great question i have a few perspectives on that number one I think the alternative and again the sportswear example is a great one that forever the vision was if we could just make smarter shoes so we'll put a lot of robots in a lot of motor sensors computers etc and the problem is number one that's kind of dangerous number two there's an assembly problem number three cost goes way up failure goes way up so that never was really feasible and so what I think were arguing is that fundamental material compositions can be the same price the materials that we're using are not any more expensive than printing in another way they can so they're not cost prohibitive for sure they're not assembly prohibitive because they're assembled in the same way that any other static object would be produced and we're looking for other processes we could do the same thing with lamination weaving knitting extrusion so therefore assembly and manufacturing is it more expensive and they're far more robust and less failure-prone because it's material so it's not external mechanisms so I think that's our vision is that materials can be robotics materials can have actuation sensing communication and they're super scalable and super cheap so we take that perspective and I think that's why it's not cost prohibitive the other side of it though is is that people will say well we need to make a lot of development on material science in order to really get applications here and and part of that is true and some of those often you'll get a new material and that it's super expensive so we can't implement it yet usually that there's a curve and that will come down over time but the other perspective that we take is what I've said previously that you'll have macro scale materials that are abundant and all around us and we can make them do smart things our colleagues in Stuttgart did the exact same strand that folds into text they did I CD which is the Institute for computational design and they did it out of wood so they take a strip of wood and depending on the orientation and the grain direction and how they laminate it they can get it to fold one way another way fold into custom angles and they can get a piece of wood to fold into text so that shows that everyday dumb materials woods really smart material but everyday materials can do super precise things and therefore I don't think it needs to cost any more money yeah hi stephanie was on from sweden and i was thinking about the future do you think it's possible to to decide when the material will change if i don't know don't want to to that happen the first time it come near heat or near water if it could be the second or the third time or when i need it yeah the easy way to do that is to deposit multiple materials on so we've we've looked at depositing three dissolvable material rigid material and expanding material so therefore it's based on time and the quantity of volume of dissolvable material you put in will give you a time change so therefore you know if I put a large volume here and I put a less or a smaller volume here this is going to fold first that's going to fold second and I can orchestrate what's going to fold when so that's one way but there's also mechanical ways to do it so we always look at there's material ways there's geometric ways and there's ways to respond to energy so the geometric way would be you do it mechanically you have latches you have something that has to build up enough pressure that then it releases afterwards and so you can time it like that that this one the latch is weaker this one it's much strong one so this one is going to take longer it'll take less you could activate it by temperature you could say only when it's hot water so you put it in water I have a heater on this side I flow hot water across the sides going to fold for a second anyway you could do it many different ways but but certainly time control is is really important for a lot of applications yeah thank you yeah I am I'm Jared genzel from here at MIT having two young boys I sometimes purchase products for them that say some assembly required and sometimes that takes a while I was wondering if you're only working on the extreme of self-assembly or are you also looking at easier assembly either for humans or computers or materials that can make it easier to assemble products therefore lower the costs of doing that or make it easier movement more user-friendly yeah great question i think the ars electronica project shows that where we built this long super long strand that one we had to fold it by hand so we're still reading out the instructions or or basically feeling the instructions you you move it until it clicks into place and then it's done you move on to the next one it clicks into place and there are a few toys out there or a few products out there as well that have something like that where the geometry and the material property are the instructions and so we're certainly interested in that how do we I guess a bigger vision for us is how do we embed codes into materials so they help us assemble it or even if I'm assembling it can tell me precision tolerance constraints orientation moisture control it can have information in there that helps me build a smarter product or a more precise object so we're interested in that and then we're also interested as you said and how they can assemble themselves for certain applications and all right Kyler but Daniel from MH I so I'm thinking about the capital investment life cycle for manufacturing right where we put in these big pieces of equipment the last for a long time and I'm trying to figure out how we start planning for these new man facturing technologies and I'm thinking about like Moore's law how you know the whole hardware industry sort of plans around it is there anything like that or do you have any suggestions for you know if I'm looking to put in a factory that I'm expecting to depreciate over 20 years good idea bad idea yeah good question I think a lot of the processes that are already in manufacturing could be used in different ways if you think about sorting sifting agitation filtering orienting parts all of these are in line with exactly what we're talking about and most of the solutions that we need in manufacturing and many other industries we normally go to robotics first we spend we throw a lot of money and mechanisms sensors and computing at it and we solve it in a in a sort of brute force mentality I think over time those become more and more elegant and so you know our vision would be that you don't need a lot of new infrastructure to do these things rather that you listen to the energies that we already have whether it's sunlight gravity so we use gravity fed systems or wind or water these kind of scenarios that you already have but it's sort of utilizing them in the right way so i guess the like far term vision for us is that the environment around would be used as the energy source and the production means it and and less and less super specific one off let's say robotic or manufacturing machines but more and more activated energy to guide things in the right direction so it's a bit vague in that sense but I think it's much less about one offs and more about Universal and scalable energy yeah okay I montes bars from the Institute of shipping economics and logistics in Bremen Germany I'm I've got a question concerning your time saving you said as that 3d printing of course it takes a bit of time especially if the structure is quite complex did you have any estimations how big the time savings is printing or buy a 40 printing compared to 3d printing that's a good point so our 4d printing is fundamental using 3d printing we're not using any new machines we're using a new material and it's I think a new thought process about how we make active printed structures but fundamentally we're just printing so the time it takes to print our structures at the same time it takes to print a dumb structure or a static structure so in that sense it's the same but if I wanted to print I let's say that dodecahedron versus if I print the plane we would certainly win because the time for transfer transformation is much quicker especially if you have to talk about post-processing and that's another discussion that most people don't talk about in 3d printing is you take your object out and it's almost never ready there's this huge process of post-production so when we print flat we don't have that post production problem and we're transforming in real time where it's still going to be hours before it's finished the other one so i think that's that's a real advantage there but generally so generally people will say well the time we can never beat existing industrial processes with the time that 3d printing takes injection molding is going to kill it every time and so then they often go to the customization argument that well we can make customized parts or we can you know mass custom argument versus mass standardized argument but my argument would be more about the actuation sensing a computing scenario that you know even if it takes more time and even if you would say that per part is more expensive than injection molding today if you add in all the time and cost that you would need for actuator sensors computers and a embley human assembly or if you say for our dodecahedron structure versus one of our 40 print the time it would take someone to hand assemble that or precisely assemble with a robot arm we would certainly beat it in terms of cost of labor for the human versus the part assembling itself and we would definitely beat it if you think about cost of this industrial robot arm that's going to be super expensive or one-off machine that's extremely expensive versus the part assembling itself using water so I think time and and cost it's definitely going to win if the part can do it itself we also another question I'll have a question for you Skylar so is there a particular company particular industries that you're interested in working then where do you think this technology where it is right now can be advanced even further you know this kind of your wish list what do you want yeah it's an interesting question in the beginning I have a background in architecture and I would have thought you know construction is it's great that would be a perfect industry to work in and we're fascinated by the construction and materials and kind of macro scale manufacturing across the seas but then we got surprised by the companies that came to us when we released the 4d printing work the sportswear was one of the first more infrastructural like water electric that space came to us space the space industry was really interested medical and defense obviously so we've opened up that that palette and were interested in a wide range and one of the most fascinating things for me is that the principles that we're studying self-assembly reconfiguration replication programmable materials are very very scalable as long as you're dialed into the materials and the energy in the application you're working in and so therefore one of our focus is trying to find companies in many different sectors with different scales of applications either many many arts or large parts or super specific structures etc with challenges and the vision that we have that we can do it a different way that there's there's another way to look at materials energy production interaction and so in that case we're interested in many different spaces and right now this there's software we have software companies are working with materials and printing infrastructure electrical infrastructure we're looking at medical and and pharma etc so you know it's across the board but for us it's how do we scale these technologies to many different domains it strikes me that you're probably working with materials engineers in companies have you been working with logisticians at all people in the supply chain domain haven't so much other than through the companies that were working with let's say they a company will come to us and say we see a connection between the technology you have and a challenge we're facing or a specific domain we're facing and part of that conversation will be supply chain and distribution manufacturing etc and so the conversation will come in there but not we haven't had it where it's only about that discussion but rather that's one piece of a larger discussion but yeah certainly be interested in that well I think that that makes sense and for us today I think the challenge is to think how can this particular development enable are you know the end result which I you know is best demonstrated by that flat surface that self-assembles into no three dimensional surface and you think about how much cheaper it is this ship a lot of flat things to the end customer and then have them activate that so you know that's has a big logistics aspect to it so if there no other questions that I'll say thank you very much Skyler and is great sorta break now and let's reconvene at 345 here for professor Sanjay Sharma
