 hello i am yutanoma from the university of tokyo and today i would like to talk about our new paper pop-up print rapidly 3d printing mechanical reversible object in the folded state first of all 3d printers are used widely entirely the world as a powerful tool to enable the vision of rapid prototyping however 3d printers have three problems first is print time 3d printers print the object layer by layer which results in longer print time for a taller object second is support consumption to print overhangs 3d printers use support material however they will be thrown away after printing third is storage and transportation most 3d printed objects cannot be transformed into the compact state which is an obstacle for storage and transportation to cope with these problems many researchers have proposed various projects for example 4d printing methods such as thermor shape representations using springs and structures inspired by telescopes however they suffer from irreversible and complicated transformation processes or extreme limitations on the final shape to provide a better solution we refer to the development of the beetle horn the beetle horn is first developed in the folded state and is unfolded after metamorphosis by other words they fabricate their horn in the folded state and unfold them after fabrication inspired from the beagle horn we propose pop-up print a method to 3d print objects in the compact folded states and unfold them after printing we first show the object printed with our technique they are printed in the compact folded state like this after 3d printing the object can be unfolded like this these objects are the japanese safe bottle and cup and can be used as a portable drink set also we printed various objects such as this cup like object the huffman's cone the two hump doll the starfish which has a branched arm and the stanford bunny to fold various objects we made the following three contributions the method to fold various 3d shapes the mechanical biasability measurement and the interactive design tool to determine the final crease pattern first is the folding method we refer to the related work in computational origami that uses planar folding planar folding is a folding method that folds the 3d surface with a plane just like the left figure we applied planner folding as the basic folding method because its structure is simple and the computation method is very easy here we show the folding pipeline first we extract the surface of the original shape second we extract the foldable region third we fold the the surface with planar folding and last we thicken the surface and create the hinges on the creases for detail please refer to the paper next for a second contribution we conducted a mechanical by stability measurement experiment mechanical by stability means that an object becomes mechanically stable both in the floated state and the unfolded state as we show in this video the left is bistable while the right is not bistable since the object will be used in the unfold state it is important to make the object mechanically by stable to generalize this mechanical by stability first we 3d printed the example objects by changing the shape parameters second we measured the force required to pull the object from the unfolded state this slide shows the result by curve fitting we obtain the formula that can calculate the mechanical biasability with several shape parameters using this formula we can judge whether the object becomes bistable or not finally to utilize the methods we implemented an interactive design tool to determine the grease pattern first users can manually rotate the object and find the best folding direction the red area is the foldable region and the foldable region changes when the user manipulates the slider also this design tool computes the biasability using the formula and if it is not bicycle the design tool notifies the user by showing the area red finally the user can thicken and save the 3d model for 3d printing so my conclusion is the following points first we propose pop-up print a method to 3d print objects in the compact folded state and unfold them after printing next to achieve pop-up print we made the three contributions thank you for listening
