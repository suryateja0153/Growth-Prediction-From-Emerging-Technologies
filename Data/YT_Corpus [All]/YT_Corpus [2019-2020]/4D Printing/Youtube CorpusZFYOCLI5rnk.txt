 [Music] this video review is based on price quality performance warranty brand trust after sales and service reusability familiarity and easy to operate the brother QL 1100 label printer is at heart a why format version of the brother QL 800 we reviewed this time last year like it's smaller sibling the QL 1100 turns out labels in several sizes in this case up to 4 inches wide both die-cut and continuous length labels snappily and in good quality it uses rolls of direct printed thermal paper and like most such printers the per label cost varies a lot according to your source for the stock that said aside from its QL 1110 and WB sibling this is the first wide format label printer of its kind that we've seen at this lower price it's a fine value for small office and home office shipping barcoding and other types of white format labeling setting up and stop watching within about 10 minutes of taking the QL 1100 out of the box I printed my first label loading the label cartridges consists of unpackaging them removing a piece of tape dropping the cartridge into the compartment and closing the lid everything else is done via software if you don't use an existing labeling application brother has you covered the combination of the P touch editor and its database provides a robust place to start in addition the data is stored in these applications is easy to migrate to other programs if and when the time comes kindly see the description for this product link thanks for watching kindly LIKE and subscribe you
