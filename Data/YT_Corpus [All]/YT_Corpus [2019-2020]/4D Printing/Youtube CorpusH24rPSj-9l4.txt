 hey everyone daryl here with tested today i will be walking you through how i made king atlan's recording device inspired by the movie aquaman i started off modeling the device in cinema 4d i knew i wanted to add the lighting effects as seen in the movie so i opted to print the model on the people phenom using sierra tech's simple clarism once the print was finished cleaned and cured this is what i ended up with the print did suffer some issues as i believe during the hollowing process the inner walls may have been too thin causing the insides to tear a bit but the outside turned out great for the lighting i opted to use adafruit's featherboard along with a neopixel ledge strip here's a quick look at what the lights will look like in the device next it was time to clean up the print working with this resin i always make sure to wear gloves and respirator along with good airflow throughout my workspace i used a pair of nippers to cut off some of the support structures that were left behind from the initial cleaning process i then started sanding the device with 220 grit sandpaper i was not that concerned about a super smooth finish as the device in the movie has a slight texture after a quick rinse i moved on to masking off the details this part of the process was very time consuming and tedious for masking the details i used mascara maskal is a liquid rubber solution that can be applied to surfaces that can later be peeled off after paint has been applied i started off by using a very thin paint brush but i kept having clumps of mask all adhering and drying to the brush so i opted to use a sculpting tube with a silicone tip so when the mascara would start to dry on the tip i can easily remove it and keep going after a few hours of masking i moved on to painting i applied a layer of filler primer which really helped me see the details embedded in the device i followed up with a layer of gloss black to help prevent any light leak outside of the mask areas once that was dried i applied a layer of hammer texture bronze to give the device some texture i followed up with a light mist of antique bronze and the final layer of paint being krylon foil gold the device in the movie was heavily weathered so i mixed up a wash of black and burnt umber acrylic paint and applied it to the device and used a sponge to dab off the excess wash i then dry brushed and dabbed with a sponge some vallejo rust airbrush paint thin with water i also used robin buff's gold antique on the edges of the device to add to the weathering effect once all the paint was dry i proceeded to remove the mask again this was very time consuming i used an x-acto knife and a metal sculpting tool to remove the mask as i was removing the mascara i would shine a light into the device to ensure i was removing most of the mask wall from the areas that were masked off i then moved on to the lights i uploaded a modified code to the adafruit feather to set the color of the light and get the sequence i was going for i then wired up the board and added on an on off switch and the device was ready to be assembled and here's the final prop i hope you all enjoyed this video as much as i enjoyed this build so we're actually doing a little bit uh something new this week we're doing a project recap uh because i wanted to hear more about this prop daryl i have you on the line drl how you doing good and you how about you norm doing great uh watch the video you put together as everyone out there just did and that prop looks so beautiful is that it right there yes this is it um yeah it it came out better than i expected and so this is like it's the king atlan's uh recording device um i assume you chose it because you want to experiment with the translucent resin that you're working with and a way to light up something and have it look like it's you know solid old but also kind of have this energy inside of it yep so i you know after watching the movie um i thought it'd be a great prop like you said to experiment with the claire resin um piapoli sierra tech has a clear resin it's actually their simple line and it was really simple to print with and i really wanted to to showcase it have something that i can really showcase the the clear print on and i landed on this project i haven't seen anybody tackle this so i thought it would be you know a great project to kind of tackle and see if i can do it and and it came out it came out pretty well the shape is almost really deceptively simple because it's a cylinder but it has all these fine engravings and cravings that actually matter because of what you're trying to do with the masking how fine the resolution of those cracks and stuff can you talk about the modeling of this both the exterior and also the core sure so the core is just a simple cylinder um and it just has some details that extrude out from the bottom of the actual um device um so that that part initially was simple after reviewing the footage i went the symbols were the hardest thing to find the atlantean engravings on it um so i googled some atlantean fonts um and i came across two different kind of fonts and this one was the closest one that actually matched the ones that were in the on on the prop in the movie um they're not exact but they were very close to it um and cinema 4d is in which i modeled this with uh has a tool in it um called a volume mesher and basically you can take um vector shapes and apply it to the model and it'll cut these grooves into it now this could easily be done in zbrush and i'm still learning that but i d i took the fonts bought them in cinema 4d used that tool and um got a clean engraving on the actual cylinder which gave me a clean print in the long run the inside is hollowed out because i needed to you know have the lights running in it and i just made a simple enclosure for the bottom that i can hold the switch on and literally just used a piece of p a piece of pvc pipe um to run the lights on and it was pretty a pretty simple um setup on the inside is that relief is it uh like the same depth wrapped around the cylinder like cylindrical surface um so it's like at every site it's a certain depth is that how it works yeah so basically with um resin printing the best thing to do is hollow out the the model um so there is some hollow spacing in this um to save on resin but i did run into issue with this one so i may have hollowed it out too much i find that maybe four millimeters is kind of like the sweet spot um but for this i think i hollowed it a little bit too much and the the inner walls were already thinning thin enough so i didn't need to hollow i was just kind of kind of trying to save on resin and i did run in some issues on the inside which really didn't matter because um nobody was seeing the inside anyway but the outside came out fine it actually tore i think from the for the peel force from the actual resin printer toward the inside um and again like i said it didn't make much of a difference it probably kind of helped in the long run because it diffused the lights on the inside but outside of that the outside turn turned out great it's like all this extra consideration you have because you actually care about the inside structure like your the thickness of the outside wall and the thickness of the inside wall for light um because it's like it doesn't look like carvings it can't just look like a hole right it actually looks solid on the inside um and then clean up um pretty pretty similar yeah clean up was pretty straightforward uh with you know with printing on a resin you have to um take the proper precautions you know wear uh a respirator gloves um because it's gonna air you know irritates the skin once i pull it off the printer clean off all the supports clean it with 99 isopropyl alcohol cure it under a uv light once that's cured uh it was just simple sanding this is much more easy to stand than a pla or um any kind of one of those filaments this literally took i would say maybe a good 15 20 minutes to sand and i wasn't trying to get a perfect surface because in the movie um it did have some texture so when you remove the support sometimes it leaves little um like crevices and little fine um holes in it and i was perfectly fine with that because i wanted to have that antique look um so it really added to the to the look at in the long run all you're trying to do is get rid of print lines uh and it sounds like the bulk of the work was actually the applying of your liquid masking medium yes so that that was very tedious and it was a long process actually i think all in all i spent about four hours applying it and taking it off um and i had issues with them so i used a product called mass call it's a liquid rubber and you could apply it on like paint it dries you can paint over it and then peel it off similar to liquid liquid silicone the issue i had was that i've had that mask off for a long time and it lumped up on me um and nowhere in virginia beach sells that product and it would have took like three or four days in order for me to order it and get it in and i didn't have that time so i was doing some research and you can thin it down with water um so i thinned it down and let it sit for a few a few minutes and i was able to use it the only thing that happened was because there were um lumps and clumps in the bottle already every time i would pour some out and then use a uh a paint brush it would clump up on the paintbrush and dry and add hair to the print brush so what i did was i took a sculpting tool with a silicone tip and used that and used that to apply it to the details and that worked perfectly any time that i would get any clumps or the mascot would start to dry it was just a matter of just taking my finger and peeling it right off and keep on applying yeah i mean we've used things like uh there's liquid latex that we've used and it seals that pretty firmly but it's all about that working time and how delicate it is right because you're balancing the kind of viscosity of whether it can fill these crevices and create the where you have these edges because you don't want to spill onto the surface because it's not like this weathering effect but then at the same time you know it's going to come back to haunt you when you have to peel it away and so we've done things like a toothpaste as masking but it's not nearly as easy to move around it doesn't perfectly fill the crevice it's more like big blots of it and that's easy to wash away but it's again these these trade-offs yeah and with this i wasn't too concerned about getting really clean as long as i got it in the details again because this was so heavily weathered and then when you look at the uh footage from the movie the parts that actually light up um they weren't fine clean lines um i guess this was supposed to be um a ancient an ancient piece so those lines did have some weathering to it and it worked out perfectly um because again taking this off was a task in itself um yeah so it it it was it was it was it was tedious but it was worth it in the end and just like every masking you would do whether it's with tape or with a medium like this like you don't know if it's gonna work until you peel it off so you have all this built up stress of like did i apply enough they miss a spot and at the same time you're covering it with these layers of of paint can you walk me through those layers of paint because some of that like the first layer that black layer uh help cut you know help help seal the masking in i guess and fill up those edges yep so um after i sanded it i actually i rinsed it off first and then i applied primer filler to it um and i really wanted to do that so i can see the details because up until this point up until that point you know i had a clear piece and i really couldn't make out all the details other than the render that i had um so that actually you know brought in like i was able to see what i was working with once i was satisfied with that i used um a layer of black gloss and two things for that uh i use black in particular so it can um blot out any of the light leak that i would have and then also um to add to the metal uh spray paint that i would add on afterwards um so i followed that up with uh bronze hammer texture rust-oleum spray paint right out of the right out of the can and that gave it a little bit of texture and it was just building upon layers upon paint so after that i did a coat of antique bronze and then i misted it with some krylon foil gold and then i think i went back again with the bronze texture and kind of spattered it all over and then went back over it with another coat of the foil gold and once i had that that was kind of like my base and then i moved on to weathering right it's one of those things where i love the the extra going back to the texture pain and then and all that is helps you i'm sure when you're seeing you have it in front of you you can read those layers with that black gloss underneath to really make it look like both kind of earth-like like you know it's organic it's but it's also has this metallic look to it yeah and then when i brought it up my wife the first thing she said was it looks like it's antique like it's been sitting around for a while um i in terms of weathering i did um your standard black acrylic mixed with burnt ombre water down um but what i what i did differently was i didn't apply and then wipe it off i applied it and just dabbed it with a uh a sponge and that left um it broke up the the color of the gold um and then i had gold parts still peeking out through the through the um actual weathering um and then i watered down some vallejo rust um acrylic paint and i used a sponge again and dabbed it on and that added another layer of weathering and then i used um antique gold rubbing buff and just hit the edges and that was pretty much it upon removing the the mask all what i did notice was that when i was removing it some of the gray from the primer and this is what i probably would do differently um when i was removing the mask all some of the gray was showing peeking through from from the gray primer so if i had to do it again i wouldn't apply the gray primer i'll probably use a black primer but it worked out in the end because the i went back and once i removed the mask all i weathered it again just the details and it was because it was watered down the light was still able to peek through it right and that's a little bit of diffusion that unevenness it's not as crisp sometimes that led lighting can be a little too crisp and you don't want to be able to see like the different diodes there so it's just a strip wrapped around the the the core yep it's a strip wrapped around the core i could take it out and show you um if i can get this off so basically it's a um i have a adafruit feather board in here simple code that i modified to get the color and the sequence that i wanted um loaded that up to the board soldered it and wired it up and this wrap this around and i have it hot glued right now because at some point i may want to use it for a different project i did cut an opening here so i can charge the battery i have one of the batteries from adafruit in here um i just literally had to charge it last night so it's easy for me to get the cord in here to charge it um have the on and off switch at the bottom it's held in by magnets as well and just a simple on and off and that's pretty much what is powering the inside of it that's so nice it's a great pattern and then like yeah combined with those extra laser paints like it's showing off like yeah the material the paint finish it's it makes something that otherwise looks like almost like a amazon alexa speaker look like this really awesome old ancient thing yep and somebody had um they said at first glance it looked like a uh like a cover for an alexa so i thought that was funny yeah it could be it could be a mod in the future to cover your speakers with one of those things you know it's a recording it's an audio device yeah awesome awesome and it's an idea like you went through this whole process because you want to make the prop but also to try the translucent resin to try lighting from inside and that's something we see in so many different props and even costume pieces that type of masking and that type of lighting so it sounds like you know this can be applied future future projects too yep and i really wanted to have a chance to use adafruit's products um i've seen them used throughout cosplays um you know to light up different pieces of armor and stuff like that and i thought this would be you know a great project especially in the way the movie had it lighting up in the sequence that it was going the neopixel lights were perfect for this project any other special considerations for the printing process because you knew you're going to be printing with you know this hollow inside or or modeling a certain way or using this type of resin anything different than you would be normally printing it um not really the only thing that i took into consideration again um was the hollowing of this i wanted to make sure that um the walls weren't too thick so that the lights wouldn't actually um peek through when i did the masking but it all turned out this resin in particular once you carry it it does have a yellow tinge to it which i wasn't really worried about because um prior to this project i did a a another project which i use lighting with the same kind of resin and it worked fine um it doesn't it doesn't tint or mess with the color of the led lights that you put in there so um it turned out perfect to be honest with you awesome well thank you so much for sharing and diving deep into this uh for folks who have additional questions about how you printed it how you modeled it uh feel free to please post those in the comments below and uh daryl will see you at the next project uh you'll be working on and i think we can tease that you're actually testing uh an impressive 3d printer for us at the moment so hopefully be able to share more of that next month it's so good to see you daryl so good to see the front and we'll see everyone next time bye-bye thank you bye
