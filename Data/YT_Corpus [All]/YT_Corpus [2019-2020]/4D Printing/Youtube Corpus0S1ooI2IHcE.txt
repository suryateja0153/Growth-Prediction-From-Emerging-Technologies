 My mother passed away two years ago, at a palliative care unit in one of the major metropolitan hospitals in Melbourne. During this experience, I found there are many areas that we could improve, in terms of family togetherness and patient connectivity, for people experiencing end-of-life care, through design. When a patient is not able to go home for their final days, and palliative care needs to be delivered in hospital, an acute or a sub-acute space is often used, as palliative care services are limited. What we need is a design that reflects patient-centered care, We like many, operate on limited resources, we need something that can turn sub-optimal environment into an ideal environment, to facilitate affordable end-of-life care. The design response does a number of things, but it's primarily about family togetherness, both physical and digital. When a decision is made that a patient will be receiving end of life care and a palliative care room is not available these two objects can be rolled into any sub-acute room and effectively turn it into a palliative care room. The guest bed module folds out of a slim cabinet, and it's designed to comfortably accommodate an overnight guest. The communications module will work with any of the personal devices, that the patient will want to bring in, but it'll also work with more dedicated technology, such as the Facebook portal. The work we're doing today is still in its very early stages, right now we're still prototyping and trialing, but we're convinced that one day the things we're working on will make a big difference, in palliative care. Monash Health is always supportive of innovation, Being able to flexibly convert a sub-acute space, to make it suitable to deliver palliative care, is a wonderful, cost effective way for us to be able to meet our patients needs.
