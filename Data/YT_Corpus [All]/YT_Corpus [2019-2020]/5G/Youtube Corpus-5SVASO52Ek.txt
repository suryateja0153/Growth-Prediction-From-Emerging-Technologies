 this is a new episode of our series 5g explained in this video we discuss initial acquisition procedures including cell search decoding of the broadcast channel and a random access channel we look at the phases of cell search and the role of the primary and secondary synchronization signals then we look at P BCH decoding to retrieve the master information block and how this procedure supports beam sweeping recovering the SSB time index is a crucial step in decoding the MIB we will discuss the next piece of information aue accesses after the MIB the system information block type 1 or si b1 finally we will look at the random access channel and procedure the synchronization signal block provides the ue with the ability to perform frame and simple synchronization which means the ue can discover the presence of a downlink 5g signal and then start making sense of it after presence and timing have been established the ue decodes the broadcast channel and reads the content of a master information block a sight piece of information that can be gathered is the SSB index which helped determine a suitable beam for communication between the gene OB and ue i would use illustrations from the NR synchronization procedure example in MathWorks 5g toolbox to explain this process in detail as we saw in the episode of is 5g explained series about the synchronization signal block there are three possible primary synchronization sequences the ue typically runs 3 correlators in parallel to detect one of the three possible sequences once a peak is detected two pieces of information have been gained which PSS is being transmitted and the timing of ESS B note that at this point gue cannot tell which one of yes SB occurrences it has detected this will come later here we can see that the Yui has been able to detect all 8 SS bees that were sent although the second one is the one with the highest SNR it will be selected for the rest of the procedure also the PSS corresponding to index 0 in blue is clearly recognized as the one transmitted in this cell the other 2 in orange and red do not show any peek there are three hundred thirty six possible secondary synchronization sequences but at this point the timing of the SSS is known so those correlations must be run only once this stage determines which SSS was sent the main piece of information gathered at the env stage is the physical cell ID which is three times the sss plus the p SS a value between 0 and 1007 this step shows a very clear peak for sequence number 34 as a result the physical cell ID in this cell is 3 times 34 + 0 or 102 - the matlab code shows the simple process to determine the SS s there's a loop that tries out all 336 possibilities and identifies the SS s with maximum correlation each SSB comes with a realization of the physical broadcast channel and associated dmrs the knowledge of cell ID is important to demodulate the BCH button enables the UE to generate the right dmrs for channel estimation once the BCH has been demodulated the master information block and the SSB index unknown the next few slides explained the different steps for BCH demodulation each occurrence of a PB CH has a different dmrs which depends on the SSB block index the ue receiver hence tries out all 4 or 8 possible versions of a DMR s and determines which one was sent for SSB received in doing so the Yui determines the SSB index if they are up to eight possible occurrences as you may remember from the episode about the synchronization signal block for carrier frequency under 725 gigahertz or fr1 it can be up to 8 code currencies while that number is 64 for fi2 or a millimeter wave transmission this means that another piece of information is needed to uniquely determine the SSB index for fi2 transmission as you may remember from the video of this 5g explained series about synchronization signal block for far to the MIB carries 3 bits for time index those 3 bits along with the knowledge of which dmrs was used let the UE determine one of 64 possible SSB indexes here we see a more detailed view of the procedure thus far dmrs search leads to channel estimation and noise estimation along with the SSB indexed or 3 bits thereof depending on the carrier frequency the SSB resource elements are equalized and decoded yielding the master information block you can find a complete MATLAB code for this procedure as part of math words 5g toolbox although the standard doesn't mandate it explicitly it is widely expected that each SSB occurrence will be being formed with a different pattern this enables the genome B to scan the space and target the energy in successive directions remember that with millimeter wave frequencies beams become narrower but the 5g standard specifies up to 64 possible occurrences instead of 8 this means that it is possible to use a high directivity antenna pre coder to extend PVC edge coverage here a few blocks are shown each targeting a few degrees in spades the code on the right shows how to generate those beamforming vectors with MathWorks phaser a system toolbox notice I have a more concrete look at the process of BCH decoding and beam search with an example built with math works well G toolbox we artificially paused the simulation after each SSB transmission as it otherwise would be too fast to command alive you can see the gene OB with an array of transmit antenna heat transmitted the first occurrence of SSB with a beam toward the size of a space in front of it the UE is located at around 20 degrees of the horizontal but we assume there is no direct line-of-sight the only path between the genome B and the UE is that one bounce of the wall shown in blue the urea received this first transmission with low energy the second transmission leads to a similar result a correlation amplitude and so do the following ones until the seventh transmission where the main beam covers the location of the reflection in this case the received energy is much higher and once all transmissions are complete the UE can clearly identify the SSB with the most suitable beamforming as a side note we'll talk about Raj in a few slides but it is worth noting at this point that if the Eno The Associated occasions or transmission time opportunities with a particular SSB index it can expect Raj that are received at a particular time instant to be coming from a ue had picked that SSB index as the strongest as the G nobody knows which mean forming was used for that particular s has been indexed you can perform receive beamforming using the same pattern at that given time instant to maximize the probability of receiving the ranch this can be seen as the initial step in establishing beamforming between the Gino B and the UE the next piece of information the UE looks for is the system information block one cause si b1 as we saw in the episode about synchronization signal block the master information block includes all elements needed to locate and decode the SI b1 note that the si b1 is carried by the dl SCH which is the same channel that carries data packets once the UE has decoded the si v1 it has all the information it needs to request access to the network the other random access procedure there are two possible lengths for the ROG preamble the long preamble at 839 and a short one at 139 the long preamble is used for these large cells as the timing uncertainty is larger because of longer propagation delays left for the long preamble is limited to subs 6 gigahertz 5g transmission the short preamble applies to all possible 5g frequencies we're not going into all the detail of a different ROG formats here but it is good to be aware that different formats exist which vary in number of OFDM symbols cyclic prefix length and God times the information about which format to use is carried by the SIV one we want to conclude this section about acquisition procedures with a simplified overview of the random access procedure the ue makes its presence known to the network by sending a Raj the G note B replies by sending a Raj access response carried by the PDS eh it contains a timing advance for the UE to adjust its timing a temporary rnt I or Radio Network temporary identifier and a scheduling grant for the UE to acknowledge the access response the Yui is able to discover and decode the access response because their response uses a reserved rnt I called the RA rnt I referred to the episode about downing control information for a discussion about the use of our NT is to identify control information at this point there could be several us that sent the same request at the same time and the Geno be can't tell which ue or you ease it is talking to so the response to the ROG access response is a contention resolution message which is sent via the PU SCH or data carrying channel using the scheduling around provided in the access response in the final step the Gino B acknowledges the contention resolution message by sending back the device identity in a message encrypted with the temporary RN TI the UE that recognizes its device identity knows that it has been acknowledged by the G note B and uses the temporary RN t i from now on this concludes this episode of the 5g explained series on initial acquisition procedures
