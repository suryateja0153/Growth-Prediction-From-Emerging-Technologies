 today we're unboxing the first 5g pc [Music] this is the lenovo flex 5g a huge thank you to qualcomm for sponsoring this video and sending this over for me to check out and show to you guys one of the things that i'm most excited about with this is obviously 5g because it's incredibly fast but the battery life on this thing is incredible they said that i can get up to 24 hours of video playback and multiple days of use on this thing on one charge oh i just cut all the way through the cardboard we've got another box charger cable which we're hardly going to need because the battery life is so good which is great because do i ever want to get off my couch now so this weighs 1.3 kilograms and i'm gonna have to convert that into pounds right here for myself oh this is so thin we have two usb c ports over here we also have an airplane mode headphone jack and the power button this is also powered by usbc as well which is great honestly all i've ever wanted is just a laptop that is constantly connected i used to go to a lot of coffee shops to work and i would never feel secure connecting onto their wi-fi networks but now with 5g i could be running the world let's see what else is in the box and then we're going to set it up oh we have a sim card ejector because you know why this is always connected i just wanted to make sure there was nothing that just wasn't missing anything because we know i've done that before and then i'm digging through the trash to look for something you guys in the comments are like justine you just threw away insert important thing here step one unbox step two plug in step three plug into wall step four turn on here is where our sim card is already there verizon 5g okay now i gotta put it back in [Music] there we go here we go let's start up time to set it up i'll be with you guys in just a moment the lenovo flex 5g is powered by a 2.84 gigahertz qualcomm snapdragon 8cx 5g compute platform it's thermally efficient and really quiet since it doesn't have any need for fans to cool it it uses 60 less power and has twice the performance than the previous generation so that'll give you multi-day battery life the 14 inch full hd wide angle touch screen display gives you enough space for work conference calls or just watching content it seamlessly switches between 4g lte 5g and trusted wifi networks so you'll stay securely connected to the best available networks the flex 5g enables super fast download speeds of up to 4 gigabits per second which is 10 times faster than a 4g data connection this was designed to go head-to-head with competing processors but at a fraction of the power consumption all of this making for a very versatile two-in-one [Music] so i wanted to test out doing a video call and i was gonna go visit jenna but she actually doesn't know that i'm gonna go visit her yet she just got some birthday candy from my parents and i don't have any candy at my house i'm gonna do a quick little call to kind of see what it would be like if i had to do a business call i mean i think this is business candy is business this is very serious business [Music] hi how's it going good i was uh sweeping my porch oh that sounds like fun no i just remembered that you had candy and i wanted some candy and i don't have any candy at my house i have a lot of candy you also have really fast 5g by you which is exciting i do i i actually do well i wanted to show you my new lenovo flex 5g it's pretty cool it's like one of the first five gpc's it's pretty awesome why are you here already well because i was filming a video with it and then i thought candy yeah come on over i will see you no okay bring the dog i'll bring maddie and we can watch some some content on it i'll show you how cool it is okay bye bye do you wanna go see her we're gonna go see her okay how about that that'd be fun oh big stretch is it a big stretch if you don't say big stretch one thing i do really love about it is how light it is i mean this is so extremely light let's go do you like that we can be in the car and be on our laptop and have service wherever we are 5g 95g [Music] super thin there's an airplane button well yeah because it's 5g enabled so it's basically always connected i'm really excited that's what i skyped you on it looked really good all right let's walk maddie and we can go have some snacks candy i'm here for the candy [Music] so i'm back after spending a few days with this two in one and what i've liked the most like i said before is the fact that it is always connected so wherever you have cell reception you'll be able to be connected to the internet now 5g is interesting because 5g is not everywhere yet so i went and took a look at the coverage map and i found a location that was near my sister so i went to visit her because she has a tower next to her another thing that i like is we went to a coffee shop and the coffee shop had a sign that said no laptops well here's the thing i can technically say well it's not really a laptop it's a two-in-one oh i won't use my laptop here i'll just use my tablet i think what makes me so excited about this device in general is obviously this is one of the first 5g enabled pcs all of our devices will eventually be connected when 5g is so readily available that you just walk outside and it is everywhere it's going to be so shocking the amount of things that we're going to be able to do with those speeds we'll be able to edit in the cloud we'll be gaming in the cloud everything will basically be taking place not on your device but somewhere else on the internet qualcomm really is pushing the limits of what you can do with these types of devices and i'm extremely excited to see what they do in the future so with that my friends i'm going to take my not a laptop back to the coffee shop thanks again to qualcomm for sponsoring this video i'll see you guys in the next one [Music] you
