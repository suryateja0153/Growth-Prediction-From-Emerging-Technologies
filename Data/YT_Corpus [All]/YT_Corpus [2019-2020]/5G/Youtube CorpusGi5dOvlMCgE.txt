 at first i didn't believe there was a virus but when they start taking away your rights it doesn't make sense the coronavirus is the biggest threat this country has faced for decades if you don't follow the rules the police will have the powers to enforce them you must stay at home conspiracy theories about 5g have been spreading since the beginning of lockdown there is no virus it's 5g radiation poisoning this is all a big part of the eventual goal which is control your body can't handle this new 5g it's not built for it and yet lots more people are going to be ill these false theories have been contagious bbc news at two o'clock this is nikki cardwell police have broken up a group of around 25 people protesting about the lockdown in central london [Music] the demonstration took place near to the a e units of st thomas's hospital fascism fascism fascism major health organizations have said that 5g is safe and that there's absolutely no link between it and coronavirus so where did the idea come from and how far are its believers prepared to go you're gonna you're gonna be poisoned are you gonna are you gonna stand for that well we're not standing for it it isn't coronavirus [Music] hey how's it going i'm good how are you yeah i'm good nice to meet you how much time are you spending online i looked at my screen time on my phone i think it was like 16 hours maybe a day yeah but it's gone it's gone down now but at first it was like 16 maybe 17 hours yeah what did your mom say i wasn't happy at 4. isaac is 17 and he's been stuck at home like the rest of us he's been living through his phone and in early april his friends started sharing something unusual someone sent something into my snapchat group chat you know some guy he was talking about how the 5g thing is that real thing that we should be scared about not coronavirus and coronavirus is a cover-up for a lot of different things that the government is doing i was thinking this guy is definitely bored because it makes no sense what are your friends thinking they're thinking about the 5g stuff the radiation and it making them sick and whatnot some of them actually generally believe it and some of them haven't they don't they basically don't want to leave the houses wow yeah false theories about the virus and 5g spread quickly at the beginning of lockdown do you think it's difficult to tell what's true and what's false in me very very difficult i just don't believe i just don't believe anything to be honest unless i see it come from one of boris's speeches the misinformation that people are spreading is quite dangerous there isn't one coherent 5g conspiracy theory some people say the virus is man-made and lockdown is a cover for installing 5g others say it's actually 5g that's causing coronavirus symptoms and some think it's an excuse for forced global vaccination it all comes back to a fear that 5g is harmful to human health there's no credible evidence to support that but that hasn't stopped wild speculation online and celebrities have been super spreaders us singer kerry hilson was one of the first she shared this now debunked video of an alternative doctor in march and i'll finish with anybody want to make one guess as to where the first completely blanketed 5g city in the world was exactly kerry later tweeted that her management asked her to remove the post what the doctor said wasn't true but the idea was infectious and anti-5g posts went viral on the first day of lockdown mia tweeted then later removed this here's the broadband that they're like digging up to install why are these men here then callum best put a post on instagram so did lee ryan from boy band blue like so many of these posts it's since been deleted then hollywood actor woody harrelson [Music] these messages were coming up on all of our feeds and they weren't stopping amanda holden said she accidentally tweeted a link to this petition but four hours after she shared it the page had over a hundred and twenty thousand signatures bbc news at 8 o'clock there's been another record increase in the number of deaths i think it's a man made thing guys it's been put there for a reason to keep everyone in while they test the 5g amongst his usual posts british musician black the ripper was sharing anti-5g [Music] for allowing videos to come in [Music] then he died rest in peace ripper and respect for speaking the truth before you died it fueled even more conspiracy theories by the end of the first week of april fake news was everywhere and the government decided to step in on the point about the 5g masters the stories i have got about that they play a role in the in the spread of the disease that's just nonsense dangerous nonsense as well [Music] with all the misinformation swirling around it's easy to lose sight of what 5g actually is david robert grimes is a physicist and cancer researcher hello how are you doing hey i'm doing great how are you 5g is essentially a new standard in mobile technology one of the things that people correctly realize is that this is a form of radiation radiation is scary people are frightened of that word there are forms of radiation that are very very dangerous but what people forget is light is also a form of radiation 5g is tens of thousands of times less energetic than even the visible light to which we are exposed every day but i think it's really important to work out that a lot of your conspiracy theories being spread at the moment are actually not even new there was people against 4g there's there's groups against wi-fi and back in the 1910s there was people against radio what has changed now is not that these fringe groups have existed they always have but now they can harness the power of social media to go and spread their beliefs and to evangelize them and because we live in a world where we use technology but we don't always understand what it really means or how it works we are very susceptible to frightening claims when i heard the word 5g i just for holding here we go naveed works for bt open reach a lady approached my van she said i know what you're here for i know what you're doing you've been hired by the council to basically roll out 5g he installs home internet and phone lines not mobile networks like 5g but he's been targeted just like other engineers one day in april a woman approached him quoting false information it made no sense to me as well about microwaves and blood cells and how it affects everyone she walked further further across the shop and probably about 10 meters down there was a group of uh 10 men when she was pointing at me and she said that person he's the the cause of everyone dying because then i could hear foul language i could hear abuse i could hear things like murderer killer uh threats like watch out watch what happens to you you feel uh very very frightened and scared no job is worth risking your life for between april and june 2020 telecoms engineers reported 264 similar incidents so what are you laying fiber what kind of fiber ones you know when they turn this on it's going to kill everyone and that's why they're building the hospitals no idea no idea no it's not only because when i put it on facebook [Music] that's one of them what was he saying uh tell him we don't want 5g in this area why are you guys hustling this man i see him take a lot of crap before they attacked him and they say uh why is he putting in 5g and he says he's not 5g he's a professional guy he's working this thing is bigger than all of us here because i can find myself in a box tomorrow because the government can kill people if you talk too much the birds are getting the biggest hit because they you know they get the radioactive they can't take certain microwaves in their ears you know because they're weaker than us yeah we get we we die slowly naveed is one of many engineers who've been harassed thanks to the spread of theories linking 5g and covet 19 and there's consequences one study found that if you believe in a link you're far more likely to leave the house even if you have coronavirus symptoms the latest figures show that another 346 deaths linked to covet 19 have been confirmed across the uk in 24 hours bringing the total number of victims to 31 587. it's early may a month since the government assured the public that 5g conspiracy theories are false a small group of protesters have gathered in st james's park london their concerns range from vaccines to freedom of speech bill gates is saying that we have to have mandatory vaccinations until we all do take the vaccinations the whole world is unlocked down but 5g fears are what seem to unite them there's an appeal from over 240 scientists and doctors formally appealing to the un asking for the stopping of 5g it's already been stopped in a lot of cities and countries it was there that we met john 5g when that gets turned up that's when they're going to start blaming the second wave all that kids are going to get done with pogba radiation poisoning this ain't no vibrancy there is no coronavirus they're not treating people with coronal fires they ain't they're suppliers [Music] my name's john i'm a carer for my dad i'm a personal qualified personal trainer my spare time i like to do boxing and train my clients so we met you at the protest why why did you decide to go my concerns over 5g there is no virus in my eyes because everywhere they're turning on 5g is where this so-called virus is coming now i've had concerns over 5g for over four or five years now vast majority of scientists think think that it's safe they don't they don't that's what the media are telling everybody the proper scientists have come out and said it's not safe i know my body for 10 years it's been a certain way until they brought a 5g tower to around about literally two minutes from my house and i've got a metal jaw and that's that's that's been in agony i've had headaches i've had eyeballs feel like they're boiling i'm getting rashes i'm getting my psoriasis has come up when it never has and all this has happened within five weeks since they put a 5g tower next to my house i mean have you been to the doctor about that i'm not going nowhere near an nhs the hospitals they're murdering people doctors get into medicine no doctors nothing so what do you think is really going on then i think it's a new world order he's pulling the strings bill gates they're wiping people out with the radiation and then you're gonna come for the children with your vaccines the same man who wants to vaccinate us is the same man who wants to depopulate the world i mean vaccines stop people from getting they don't they don't they don't they don't there is no virus a lot of people have died from this no they haven't we've been we're being played whatever way is we're being played when i deal with people that are anti-5g they're very frequently anti-vaccine they're very frequently anti-medicine in the conventional sense bill gates has put an awful lot of his work into vaccinating people in developing countries and we do that because after clean water and sanitation there is nothing that saves more lives and vaccination that makes him a villain to people that are ideologically opposed to vaccination so to accept that 5g is secretly doing his harm you have to then accept that the who and the center for disease control and all these international health protection bodies are lying to us and as it goes on you have to accept more and more to preserve your initial belief and that drives people deeper and deeper into i'd say the rabbit hole of conspiracy theories and conspiracy theorists have turned on people in unexpected ways in april a pair of amateur 5g fans noticed their website had suddenly become a lot more popular today i'm in grimsby a northeast lincolnshire fishing town which also happens to have a 5g site in the town center which you'll be able to see right behind me here and that's the site i'm going to be testing out today i'm jake i'm peter and today we are in oxford city centre to look at networks peter and jake are 5g enthusiasts they run a site that maps out the masts around the country so we're now near jublie gardens and just to the side of jake there is a three samsung small cell three do actually have small cells yes that recently we saw a spike in um traffic to the website at first we were just like oh oh our seo must be really good you know we're at the top of the google search results people must just be interested in 5g it was only when we started to look on the stop 5g pages that we realized it was a bit worse than we'd actually thought 5g tower zero g now yeah remember when lots of celebrities were posting about 5g that week there were 20 arson attacks on masts the website traffic increased by about three thousand percent but some pages were increasing in traffic by over about fourteen thousand percent one group in particular was specifically titled as a mast arson competition and that's when we made the rather sad decision that it was probably best to start to take down some of the pages in another part of the internet one doctor has stepped up in the fight against misinformation did 5g cause coronavirus people suggested that 5g damaged the immune system and boosted the viruses this is not true dr karan rangarajan is a surgeon in the nhs how do you know coronavirus is real well apart from all the you know science and medicine and ct scans and chest x-rays and tests that we've had to prove it exists i've had coronavirus he's become an online medical myth buster 5g mobile data is transmitted over radio waves these radio waves are non-ionizing which means they don't damage the dna inside our cells unlike x-rays gamma rays and uv rays spread knowledge not the virus i did a video on youtube and on tick tock the comments which dominated the comment thread are all about how i'm not a physicist which is obviously accurate but you know you don't need to be a physicist to know that 5g doesn't cause coronavirus you need to be a human with common sense and logic the real worry is young kids and other people who could be for once of a better term brainwashed by these ludicrous theories which doesn't just stop with five gene coronavirus you know it goes to vaccines and then young mothers not vaccinating their kids you know and by not vaccinating we can have outbreaks of these things we don't want that it's been over seven weeks since most people have seen their loved ones around 300 people have taken part in a protest against the lockdown but a week after the last protest there was another and it was much bigger tom simons was there the protesters gathered near speaker's corner making few attempts to keep their distance from one another they opposed the government's measures some saying that the virus was a hoax piers corbin the brother of the former labour leader was among those led away it had been a while since i'd seen john from the last protest so i met up with him on the eve of the final clap for carers how's it going so how have you been since last time absolutely still in pain from the 5g towers that's about it my jaw um we have to keep going don't we instead of clapping he's made a sign i agree strongly with this no clapping for the murderers no to 5g and the radiation that comes with it because all our kids are going to be harmed it's that time again loud and proud let's all clap for our carers while the rest of the uk were clapping john held his cardboard i remembered something he'd said earlier when i spoke to you last time i think you said you were a carer yes i'm a carer myself it's called clap for carers so really they're happy for you yeah well i don't want no one to clap for me because i'm a carer for my dad which i'll do for free i don't want no help from no government i don't want no one to clap for me these are the things that we should be doing anyway the nhs they're doing their job [Music] how is your dad at this moment he's touch and go on what's happening and how long he's got but i've got him comfortable do you think maybe it might be good to spend you know the time and effort that you're putting into this you could be spending it with your dad i get that but again it comes down to humanity i i can't sit back and rest while i know we are being murdered do you worry that you're you're isolating yourself a bit there no i'm not i was isolated away from the world anyway because the world has too many nasty evil greedy people in it so i my life hasn't changed much i don't care what anyone thinks i lose my own family over this i stand by my beliefs i have fire in my soul and i will not back down john is one of a growing minority who believe in the 5g theories and that anger is having a big impact around the country welcome on board this avanti west coast service to liverpool line street there's been nearly a hundred mass fires since the start of lockdown merseyside has been a hot spot i'm not aware of us having any attacks against 5g masts prior to the covid 19 pandemic detective chief superintendent mark comey has had to set up a unit dedicated to investigating the fires the most side police received a call from a member of the public who had seen three figures running away from a telecommunications mast and he could see that the master was on fire we found the partial burnt remains of a rubber glove when we sent that off for dna examination a profile came back for michael witte michael witte was sentenced to three years in prison after pleading guilty to arson this is the first time we've had a conviction in the uk it is arson that they're committing it's a very serious offence this is foolish behaviour done by stupid people who don't understand the impact of what their actions are doing to the wider community removing a key means of communication for people who may be vulnerable to get in touch with emergency services or to get in touch with their own loved ones it's an attack on our national infrastructure [Music] today we can say that our long national hibernation is beginning to come to an end and life is returning to our streets the uk is emerging from a lockdown infected by damaging misinformation theories about 5g mutated and multiplied undermining social distancing and potentially stopping people from getting future vaccines meaning this conspiracy theory could have a toxic legacy for all of us
