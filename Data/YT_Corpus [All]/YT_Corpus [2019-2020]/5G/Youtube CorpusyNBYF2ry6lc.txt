 It's important to understand what the 5g is doing and what they say it's doing We're told on the I Triple E beam informing document that this technology cooked your eyes like eggs in world or you And you all need to understand these military weapons, these are assault frequencies If you garner nothing more than that, that's what you need to know it's microwave radiation for sure is what it is Ladies gentlemen, please. Join me in welcoming to the National Press Club Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom wheeler It's an honor to be here at the National Press Club The first generation wireless 1g was voice the second generation 2g Allowed both talk and text the third generation 3G the Internet in a limited way and today's technology 4G Completed that digital migration, but if anyone tells you that they know the details of what 5g is going to become Run the other way This video is brought to you by the number five and the letter G and pretty soon everything else will be too I Have to tell the people 5 G's akela I'm mocking anybody who hasn't heard me and what the systems head-up display expert leading experts in the world I've actually brought over a million to this The reason I became an expert it was to invent them what I'm going to see it eats idiot Do not believe a single word. I see it Not one. I want you to do your research. You're playing it up fine This 5g rule of there's a weapon system I've got a letter with several good because I know about what the system is more than anything all that In Britain in a place in the north of England called Gateshead a scientists they're called mark steel has been very publicly and actively warning people about the effects of LED streetlights, which he says in Gateshead are emitting now 5g I've just come to where these kids have talked to rumors about the piercing this say This these tribesmen has on these lakes that of course and harm assault in the community This is an existential threat to the economy to the environment and humanity of these transmitters are everywhere then everyone's at risk There's a lot of confusion about what 5g is The G stands for generation. So you started off with the first Transmitter system back in the 1980s and then yet ETS We have one G then you had to G in as the generations moved on we started to see more complex signal systems Cleverer pieces of you know, antenna designs, etc. Etc. So the whole thing became More data quicker dealer quicker downloads, etc, etc however 5g is something completely different Alright, let's get a break though. Let's tell the people what this really is. This is the 5g transmission device Bring that's a hell of a beef start, isn't it? These are the uninsurable transmitters Just get a good look at that guys because obviously I know there's quite a few experts who want to see More detail about the transmitters and the chipsets Stava good luck boys. This is the control management system Masseria There's no antenna that you see that what is this fears? The rear antenna here? What's that? This is for Fears. Are you alright? as you'll see it's got a drive that's got some chip pegs one chip with a chipset on this this is Destroyed in World Order this what it gets it comes to see I'll tell you what I think the Vela sent some of these educated fools by the school or just send them to prison Which I was the easiest I think prisons probably better Right about 5j guys. That's 5g hard way Must consider the whole part played by electricity in nature human beings cannot go on developing in the same way in an atmosphere permeated on all sides by electric currents and radiations It has an influence on the whole development of man this life of men in the midst of electricity notably radiant electricity will presently affect them in such a way that they will no longer be able to Understand the news which they received So rapidly the effect is to damp down their intelligence such effects are already seen today even today You can notice how people understand the things that come to them with far greater difficulty than they did a few decades ago Rudolf Steiner 1924 Rudolf Steiner noted that in 1924 since then our atmosphere has become far more permeated with electric waves of widely diverse types there's no doubt now that electric waves Electromagnetic forces cause direct biological effects. There's thousands of peer-reviewed papers on this subject There's no doubt about it. But what are these effects? How are they affecting us? What can we do about it? We're now at a stage where we're putting in what's called 5g? which is a special type of broadcast for high density information Transfers and it turns out that this is the same frequency bands that are used in crowd dispersal weapon Five key first and foremost is densification. So it's significantly more transmitters at close proximity To a human and it is also a sophisticated Illegal, unlawful transmitter what I mean by that is it is a high gear Dielectric lens antenna and what that allows 5g? Transmitters to do is to 3d map its environment in your home the 868 Megahertz frequency is specific for both field interrogation systems so so gigahertz that allows the signal to travel through concrete brick work with ease and It can actually data Geller. It is a target the choir in the system Fears. The rear is basically read off the battlefield it is extremely good that identifying targets and being a lock on the tolerance and Not only that it can specifically target you as an individual. So any judge said no, no In in breast in case let's see any lawyer and he barrister anybody doing any work that is potentially controversial Your life could be a threat So the antenna design that you currently have non-stop of these LED streetlights masquerading as a contour management system it basically Barfield interrogation equipment The first phase the rear unit was actually called mum it used to by the Germans during the Second World War to identify Allied aircraft Obviously things have moved on significantly since then Well, I joined the Royal Navy in 1960 and I specialized in microwave warfare Radar, obviously which uses microwave but they don't just teach you radar. They teach you all about microwaves and other uses So I understood about microwave warfare and how it can damage people how it can harm people Microwaves then were used as weapons as they are today it is a Perfect stealth weapon and when governments don't like a group of people for instance that the ladies who protest at Greenham common In England about the American missile base they camped they were microwaved We might throw both Catholics in Northern Ireland to make them sick It goes on all over the world and it's a weapon that you don't know you're being targeted Because the dose is very very low which is actually more dangerous than a high dose It's very very low and it may take a year or two but you can you can cause neurological damage and cancers with low-level microwaves and you can make all your Opponents sick it it's a perfect weapon for a government Our impulses are being redirected We are living in an artificially induced state of consciousness that resembles sleep their intention to rule Rests with the annihilation of consciousness. We have been loaded with friends They have made us indifferent to ourselves to others. We are focused only on our own gain Please understand. They are safe as long as they are not discovered. Keep us asleep Keep us selfish give us sedation Almost immediately. I had near buzz knocking on the door talking about children bleeding from the nose I had images posted on Facebook the modern era in particular killed a my door and Mentioned the fact that since the LED street lighting had been installed. She was bleeding from the nose every single night I thought was unbelievable however, spoke to another neighbor who lived not far from the first lady who mentioned this and she also Confirmed that since the LED streetlight had been installed she also had started to develop nosebleeds and never had nosebleeds before in her life that then Put me on a journey to investigate Imagine microwave radiation levels from the transmitters on top of the LED streetlights the basic 868 megahertz it was significantly higher than the current comes through 1815 resolution which is a maximum of 600 millivolts of measure doctors over 3,000 millivolts Five times five to six times higher than the than the guidelines Significantly higher than then the current comes through Europe guillotine 15 resolution, which states that 200 millivolts Should be the maximum that by your initiative report States that it should be significant lesson Matt's who have got a counselor Europe. That's you know, the International Criminal Court or state nut, you know The learner have said that 200 millivolts and are measuring in bedrooms and get set minimum minimum 600 an upper 4000 does this mean that in 2020 2021 when 5g is destined to roll out globally? That you're going to get those kind of readings everywhere all the time everywhere all it's worse than that worse enough Yes, 5g will connect the Internet of everything if something can be connected It will be connected in the 5g world hundreds of billions of microchips Connected in products from pill bottles to plant waterers requiring massive deployment of small cells We won't wait for the standards now to make this work five. The 5g build out is going to be very Infrastructure intensive we must reject the notion that the 5g future will be the sole province of urban areas the 5g revolution will touch all corners and that's damn important the interconnected world of the future Will be the result of decisions we must make today The main issue before us today is Senate bill 637 and Senate bill 894 the former by Senator Hugh and the latter by Senator nobs We're gonna invite the first four witnesses in support of the legislation and that would be John Jones with Sprint David Lewis and Andy Emerson with AT&T Neil CREB de with Verizon and Frank act committee jr With t-mobile, so be straight with me Is it true it could be Gentlemen Practice these words in front of the mirror Although we are constantly exploring the subject Currently there is no direct evidence that links cell phone usage to brain cancer I'm Sharon Goldberg. I'm an internal medicine physician I've practiced medicine for 21 years and my background is mostly academic internal medicine Hospital based Clinical research and medical education. I'm a certified Microsoft small business specialist I've worked on space station designing the cabling system for the airlock module. Where as responsible for EMI EMC analysis Which is electromagnetic interference electromagnetic compatibility a professor in the Department of Epidemiology biostatistics and occupational health and I teach there both toxicology and health effects of electromagnetic radiation My name is Donna Tocqueville. And I'm the founder of organization called we are the evidence We are an organization that represents the many adults and unfortunately many children who has become very sick from wireless technology Radiation there seems to be a couple false Easter eggs being put out there right now I want to make sure we dispel that right off the gate the effects of Wireless on health Scientifically are very very clear So it's always pushed back to the definition of an acceptable level of radiation. And that's what this is By the way, this is about radiation Wireless radiation has biological effects period my name is dr. Angie Colbeck I've been reviewing the studies showing the impacts of wireless radiation on our health and there are now thousands of studies Showing the following adverse health impacts to wireless radiation cancer oxidative damage DNA damage DNA failure things like memory dizziness anxiety brain fog headaches nose bits Cognitive problem exhaustion. We have an evidence of DNA damage Cardiomyopathy, which is the precursor of congestive heart failure short and long term memory loss decreased attention spans lower reaction times Even involuntary contractions of muscles causing misalignments of spines and jaws breast cancer We suddenly have breast cancer in women have no DNA predisposition disrupted immune function and change in stress proteins reproductive and fertility effects, there are dozens and dozens of studies that show beyond any doubt what this Radiation is doing to our sperm now if you take this the the cell phone out of your pocket The sperm will recuperate within three to four months. What would not recuperate would be the damage to the DNA of the sperm? That is irreparable The wife of the ex governor of Indiana was diagnosed with glioblastoma Same brain tumor Ted. Kennedy have and John McCain had did you look at John McCain's car? This is a cell phone brain tumor LeBron James one of our sports people had a salivary gland tumor. That is another cell phone Tumor you didn't hear about it because immediately after that was discovered. He would pay it was paid by Samsung to become their spokesperson We are seeing increases in in brain tumors We're seeing increases in Alzheimer's we're seeing increases in all of the neurotransmitter diseases ALS Lou Gehrig's disease Parkinson's, these are all disease systems that are known to be associated with low-level energy exposures we talk about 24/7 around-the-clock exposure wherever you are and your whole body You never get away from it and it seems from our studies that maybe your immune system can cope with for a time but it will deteriorate then the irradiation will Definitely damage cells at the deeper level and the question is what will then happen? These are out of peer-reviewed papers. So these are not just Hypochondriacs thinking that they're doing it. We're having real problems with this This is no longer a subject for debate when you look at PubMed in the peer reviewed literature These effects are seen in all life forms plants animals insects microbes So 5g is not a conversation about whether or not these biological effects exist. They clearly do there is scientifically Evidence that is so strong that you can be certain that the standards used by the SCC To manage health effects are wrong We need to start measuring how much radiation are people being exposed to before we roll out 5g there are four kinds of Electromagnetic fields that we know are harmful to human health so radiofrequency radiation Magnetic fields dirty electricity and electric fields. Okay our Exposure any given person and all humans are affected by EMFs What is our exposure and in a day it's not one cellphone Its cellphones. It's multiple wireless networks. It's smart meters its cell towers. It's this sandwich and it all adds up The data we're going to look at are all published science testing results or public standards At the bottom end of the radiation scale of what's called power density or signal strength is the minimum level at which cellphones will work Which was found to be point to billions of a micro watt per centimeter squared Pine needles were found to age prematurely at point zero zero zero zero to seven At short-term exposures of point zero five children aged 8 to 17 experienced headache irritation concentration difficulties and behavioral problems Point one is the BAU biology or building biology guideline for extreme concern 1.0 produced sperm DNA fragmentation and a decrease in sperm viability in vitro Also at 1.0. The science shows the following bodily effects can occur headaches dizziness fatigue. Insomnia chest pain difficulty breathing and in digestion 2.5 saw altered calcium metabolism and heart muscle cells 4.0 changes in the hippocampus affecting brain memory and learning and at 6.0 DNA damage in cells So where are smart meters on this list? Electrical power Institute in December 2010 measured a single eye Tron smart meter with pulses up to seven point nine three microwatts per centimeter squared Our own testing indicated approximately 8.0 with one meter These tests are at a close distance approximately one foot away from the meter But an infant's crib can be just as close on the other side of the wall where the meter or bank of meters are installed Even though there are all these known health effects at levels far lower Switzerland Liechtenstein and Luxembourg see fit to set the standard at nine point five and China Poland and Russia 10.0 this is the same level at which behavior has been altered producing reflexes of avoidance following 30-minute exposures a room of twelve smart meters are very common and even a conservative number in an apartment building test it at 19.8 microwatts per centimeter squared this is hundreds of times higher than levels which clearly indicate harmful effects So how can you Atilla teas and governments get away with forcing these devices on everyone. This is how in Canada in the US and several other civilized countries the safety limit is set at 600 to 1000 micro watts per centimeter squared This so-called safety limit is literally tens of thousands of times higher than levels which are known to damage health according to peer-reviewed published science Faster better more reliable internet That's the promise of 5g technology, but there is also the peril health hazards associated with radio frequency That is higher also and requires more transmitters and in antennas and the start simple fact is the health hazards are unknown and unstudied and That is a sign of neglect and disregard on the part of the Federal Communications Commission. That seems unacceptable There have been no answers so far. The FCC basically has said everything's fine But in order to reach a conclusion about the health and safety of this new technology we need facts Chairman thank you for having this hearing 5g as you well know also uses higher frequency waves That don't travel as far and will rely on a network of hundreds of thousands potentially millions of small cell sites and the question then is Are there any health implication? And he's public safety implication to those additional sites that are likely be located close to homes schools workplaces and closer and closer to the ground Correct Correct cetera. Yes, so my question for for you particularly. Mr. Gillan and mr. Perry How much money has the industry committed to supporting additional Independent research I stress independent research Is that independent research ongoing? Has any been completed where can consumers look for it? And we're talking about research on the biological effects of this new technology Thank You senator and I think thank you for your focus on the issue Safety is paramount and as you alluded to we rely on the expert agency rely on the findings of the FDA and others as to The requirements to keep all of us safe there are no Industry back studies to my knowledge right now happy to visit with you as to what? Opportunities you think there needs to be more studies and we're always for more science. We also rely on what the scientists tell us So essentially the answer my question how much money 0 I can certainly follow up with you senator to my knowledge. There's no active studies being backed by industry today Anybody else know of Industry commitments to to back research funded support it to ascertain scientifically the health effect No, I'm not aware of and you know there really is no research ongoing we're kind of flying blind here So far as health and safety concern Thank You mr. Chairman You're trained medical professional yes, we don't have one on the panel What are we to make with of the American Cancer Society? For example? telling us there's no evidence of Harmful product many of these organizations have conflicts of interest very briefly if you can what's your definite? What do you mean by conflict of interest one of the first things that you teach? Residents is that you always have to look at the funding there's a tremendous amount of sponsored research by people who are hired to do studies to find no effect and That's plagued this field in a number of countries The radiofrequency radiation work that we did was supported by Motorola the relationship was really very cordial and very stress-free but Only up until we started to jitter hitting data. These folks were very very upset and began to talk about How are they going to handle this what sort of spin can we put on this? What can we expect from this and from? That point on the relationship changed What we saw was that Motorola began to exert more and more control over the work telling us what to do Telling us how to write abstracts what to say in the abstracts what to say in the papers How to do the work no, don't do this. Yes do it this way This was unacceptable. I Had completed our study of DNA damage and I submitted the final report To me on a roll up. They simply weren't willing to accept My interpretation of my study my evaluation of my study my knowledge of science at that point and Tried to urge me not to publish the study did you hear about people coming to you as far as uh As far as some kind of complaints about illness we were made aware of health complaints following installation of smart meters And we wanted to verify this using our fieldwork So I measured the field of about 30 different people while they stood one foot in front of the smart meter and in every single case the Human energy field was obliterated as they stood in front of the smart meter so in our first slides what we see is normal cells and the structure of the cells is Intact and sound this is what we would expect from a normal sample So after two minutes of exposure in front of the smart meter at about one foot away, we see a totally different story Sample one you can see a lot of degradation in the cells The cell walls have been broken and you see changes in the cells which are called mycoplasma It shows a mutation to the cell in the second sample We seems a different type of degradation to the cell membranes. You can see a corrugation here this is called bottle-cap formation and it's known that this occurs due to oxidation or Exposure to free radicals. So this third subject when we did her sample, she had to be pulled away from the meter after 45 seconds because she complained about a Increasingly severe headache and here you see a phenomenon called Reuleaux where the red blood cells are stacking up which makes it very difficult for the blood to deliver oxygen to the tissues As they would be their normal function every single one of these is a degradation every single one of these shows trauma to the blood cells and That came from something and the only variable was the smart meter The good news in all this is the patience and the blood can return to normal Once they have been removed from the influences of these stressors Some of the effects that We can look at well one thing is is to sigh regular Wi-Fi 2.4 gigahertz That's in the same range as microwave ovens, which are also called radar ranges because that is radar 2.4 gigahertz is interesting. It's not the peak absorption rate in water for microwave frequencies but it's at a point where it allows full penetration because if it came in at the peak It would prevent the insides from getting warm So that's what basic Wi-Fi now when we look at 5g 60 gigahertz This is what they call active dispersal sort of weaponry just to keep people back it burns the skin It doesn't penetrate but 60 gigahertz is the frequency of oxygen molecule absorption since They have electrons that they share with each other. What we breathe is actually oh two pair of oxygen so Being bombarded with 60 gigahertz could very well Impair our oxygen absorption rates in our body and thereby the whole basis of our living system Martin Paul says putting tens of millions of 5g antennas without a single Biological test of safety has to be about the stupidest idea. Anyone has had in the history of the world So assessing all this we have experts in various fields military EMF weaponry biological effects on humans Firefighters that are getting cognitive impairment by being there in them countries that are banning these sort of technologies around schools because of the impairment to cognitive Let's weigh that up in light of what Rudolf Steiner said in 1924 about just mere radio causing the impairment of Cognitive functions on people that they can receive news from around the world But they can't understand it as well because of the effect of the electricity we have to say Something smells sinister here With the fifth generation, it's actually a whole new ballgame. It's not using the same technology. They use they're switching to military-grade millimeter wave technology and when you look at this technology And if you go and look at DARPA reports kind of look at some of the patents that the United States military has put out on what they can do with Psychological weapons all sorts of things crowd control Active Denial anything you can think of this is what they can do with 5g So any type of military? Application you can think of which is has an electromagnetic base they can do with 5g and they're putting this out blanket across the population Ladies and gentlemen the President of the United States Good evening. My fellow Americans in the council's of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military-industrial complex the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes The FCC is a capture agency They probably conducted what I believe to be the biggest fraud on the public ever conducted The FCC has been described by Harvard University's Center for Ethics writer Norman Ulster as the most captured agency in DC Acting more as a industry cheerleader than a regulator This is especially true today with 5g where there are serious safety concerns and potentially misleading Information coming from the FCC. For example, the previous chairman of the FCC is Tom wheeler He was the head of the wireless Lobby Association for 14 years. Now. Remember Obama told us there will be no lobbyists in his administration So he took the biggest lobby and put him as ahead of the FCC and that damn important The 1993 the FCC started a rulemaking to adopt the I Triple E Regulations on this issue. I Triple E is an engineer Association. Why is it that we adopt regulation of engineers? Who maybe know how to measure this radiation? It's passing a wall but not when it's passing a body all our health agencies objected it saying that it makes no sense to adopt Engineer Association that they had not even one biomechanical person on their on their team. They're effectively indemnified against adverse health impacts when the Acceptable limits are higher than the limits actually shown to show harmful health effects The FCC guidelines were developed for short-term exposures six minutes 30 minutes depending on it's a phone or an outdoor exposure and they have Absolutely, no connection to the biological effects that have been very clearly summarized in the bio initiative so you can see there's a number of individuals in this room today that have serious concerns about this as regards to their health, if one of your companies decides to Put one of these small cells up at a pole that's within say 50 feet of one of their houses What recourse do they have to say? Is there a way to move it somewhere else? there there's language in the bill so that the authority can require the applicant to come forth with certification of compliance with the FCC's rules related to radiofrequency emission remember that denial of request or denial permit request that you can put in it's going to point back to the Acceptable levels as determined by the FCC not the EPA are not the CDC the ones who usually take care of health concerns But by the SCC, which is staffed by former eff Members of the telecommunication industry that's the fox guarding the hen house It's a fact that most insurance companies will not indemnify against EMF effects telecom companies around the world are warning their investors of potential major costs due to real or Alleged risks of EMF pollution from their products interestingly enough They're warning their investors, but they're not telling their customers. They're basically keeping it quiet because that's where the money comes from So we're using technology that Could be very potentially harmful to us and the investors know it But their only worry is that they might lose money. Not that our health might be affected First of all, I think What you should really think about is why is it that they're not insured? It's honor they chose to be self-insured They actually rejected by the insurance company from being insured because they understand the risk So the insurance companies the big insurance companies will not insure the telecommunications Called secondary insurance companies secondary insurance companies are the insurance companies that insure the insurance companies so in a van that insurance company Let's say I insure Verizon and it may not be able to meet the claims Then the secondary insurance company is kicking in like Lloyd's of London. Sorry like Lloyd's of London And Swiss red both told the insurance Company not to insure the wireless industry and this is why they're not insured and that should give you a hint now This is exactly why they have to prevent it health in a lawsuit and how do they prevent lawsuit that goes back to Section? 704 Section 704 was passed in 1996 This is how our rights in regards to health were taking away by the wireless industry. What is the distillation? Did it gave the power to regulate the health effects of wireless technology to the FCC F? This is a spectrum auctioning agency. It's not a health agency. They don't even have one biomedical person on their team and then the other thing is section 704 did It actually took the power from the state to regulate location of cell towers based on health And what does it means it means that if they want to put a cell tower in front of your home? You cannot go to the city council say hey stop. I don't want it I just heard it lecture that there's 10,000 studies proving that it's harmful. I don't want it. My child is sick They would tell stop you're not allowed to mention this in the City Council Because section 704 says if you will and if the application will be rejected The city will be sued can be sued by the wireless industry a Major US government study on rats finds a link between cell phones and cancer Very first government study linking the radiation from cell phones to cancer through decade 30 million dollar Federal study out today found there is some evidence of a link between cell phone radiation and brain cancer Yes, sir. What is the NDP? I've heard that study several times in DPS work So it's a 25 million dollar study on the rats and mice that was supposed to demonstrate that there were no effects of radiation below thermal and in fact It demonstrated exactly the opposite and it follows on the heels of two major Studies and animals that said exactly the same thing and that study was designed Perfectly to make sure that it cannot be a challenge that there will not be any doubt. That's why it took them 14 years That's how they prevent a discussion of health. And why do they want to prevent discussion of health if there's no problem with health? Simply put FCC is completely unprepared Unable and possibly unwilling to oversee 5g for safety even as it barrels toward us They are falling back on tired definitions and panaceas long since disproven by science to make matters worse Recent FCC rulings at numerous industry friendly bills passed at state and federal levels between 2016 and 2018 Removed the last vestiges of local and state review over infrastructure sightings. Just when we need it the most When those foreign studies who will perform these years and years ago, nobody knew about the importance of the microbiome The role of the microbiome and the immune system and even less the role of the microbiota inside our brains That is the microbes that are abnormal Arrested inside our brains whose influence on brain function is nothing but immense anyway think well Who cares about microbes belies microbes we have the abilities? Well you we know by now that this is not absolutely the case because microbes are truly essential For the development and function of all our organs and systems our immune system is based on the microbes we have in our gut and our ring also as microbes that influence its function In tests it's been found things like mold If you grow mold inside a Faraday cage, it'll grow one way in that even if the electromagnetic fields around Take the Faraday cage away and some sort of 600 biotoxins are developed within the mold because of the effects of the EMFs upon it electromagnetic fields even of weak quality have an effect upon our microbiome, which is really essential to our whole being this is going to eviscerate Microbial DNA inside human beings which is our effective operating system number one So it may not impact human DNA in laboratory experiments right now and they're saying it doesn't impact human DNA but given that human DNA is less than 1% of the cellular DNA in the human body the rest of the cellular DNA is Microbial and we know that this will eviscerate Microbial DNA so we're talking about a takedown of the operating system of human beings exactly exactly I couldn't have put it better myself Job Brian morning. Mr. Brandt Wow, my Amanda I've been trying to get ahold now You guys are covering up chemtrails. No, we are not covering it. We have we have no reason to cover-up Well you personally I'm you would lose your job You are due to reveal anything to me and it's probably unsafe really even be speaking about this, you know It's it's not on say Problem with us talking on your system. You're making a complaint Complaint in an area that we don't we don't have authority to regulate So the connection between Chemtrails and 5g. It's all interconnected the metallized particulates That would allow the 5g fears the rear so basically the radar that would allow it to Identify you so then watch you are gonna identify you in your own home 24 hours a day 7 days a week for the last X amount of years We've been through chem trailing and that is now the cat is out of the box. We've had these nano particulates Raining down on humanity for years now Impregnating our bodies by best accounts staying inside our bodies those nano particulates what you're saying are creating building up a kind of a phosphorescent glow Capability so that we can be flagged up in our homes behind concrete and steel Inside bunkers in the basement doesn't matter where you are the 5g will be able to now Triangulate map and read you because you as a living being are impregnated with these nano particulates Which are acting as a kind of transmission and reception technology - exactly absolutely exactly You have to consider that DNA also works as a fractal antenna Which is able to send and receive and also to process Signals under the form of radio frequencies. Well, then there is no doubt that artificial a variety of frequencies Such as those of cell towers and in particular these and new types of towers that have a much higher density of signals they may somehow interfere with the ability of DNA to retain and transmit biological signals So this is one level of danger that very few biologists are aware of How much effort was put forward to address this The other what most of these people are many of these people are here for which is other health concerns Was there any dialogue back and forth was there any working was there when many studies? Evaluated to look at regarding this area maybe Not every person that has concerns in the legislation was brought to the table. Okay? so from your perspective you feel that there was a legitimate amount of time to evaluate the data that the Opposition would have on this one. Absolutely and I am I wouldn't put forth something that I didn't believe in And I'll tell you as I mentioned earlier And it's been commented several times amongst the panel here. This is truly an economic development issue our three-year-old again at home is Outraged when we pull out the driveway and he's not able to access Wi-Fi But I think anyone who puts Wi-Fi into a school should be locked up for the rest of their life I really do I think They're not fit to walk on the surface of this planet because they haven't looked at the research and Whatever incentive they have it is not worth the genetic Problems that parents are going to face with their children when they're born France has banned Wi-Fi in nursery schools and put warnings out for regular schools because they're finding there's impaired learning capacity and children when they're around Wi-Fi and They have to put up warning signs where they put Wi-Fi transmitters When I got sick and I learned that they're putting Wi-Fi in schools in Israel I was very sick at the time, but I could not tolerate the thought the children in the schools will become as sick as I have and after few months of Correspondence, I submitted a Supreme Court case in Israel to ban the use of Wi-Fi in schools and we place them with wired Network the Four top diseases that kills our children our young adults right now are brain tumors thyroid cancer testis cancer rectal cancer everywhere we put our cell phones and a lot of our children are sick and they've been misdiagnosed and mistreated because the wireless industry has put Billions and billions of dollars in the past 30 years to mislead the public as to the health effects and keep the public Uninformed. We are performing an experiment on children. We are exposing children to microwave radiation for six hours during every school day We have had absolutely no studies looking at the long-term effects of this radiation on young people or even on adults a considerable amount of research shows that developing brains and bodies of children are much more affected than at all and There are clear indications of a link between increased electromagnetic fields and autism spectrum disorders we took ten artistic children and Went back to the sleeping location where the mother was when she was pregnant with their child and compared it with the sleeping location of a mother that gave birth to healthy children We had 10 mothers in that group 10 mothers in this group and in the group of the autistic children We found that the the measurements have we got for the microwave? Exposure was elevated compared to the group of children that were normal The fetus is affected the exposure to man-made Electromagnetic fields has become the first factor that could be isolated ever in autism that could predict autism The fifth generation of wireless technology or 5g as it's being rolled out worldwide without safety testing let me say that again without safety testing and how we've got scientists doctors and environmental organizers saying Stop this Because in terms of the effects of wireless radiation, the science is in Wireless radiation can lead to cancer as heart tumors brain, tumors DNA damage wireless radiation is linked to infertility the autism Alzheimer's and more and Guess what all the effects that I just listed Those are some of the effects that are known according to the technology that's being seen today first of all you have to know that we know that the other EMFs that we're exposed to are already known to be health risks and and basically that 5g Because of the frequency that's going to be used and because of the extraordinarily high pulsation levels that will be used Is a much bigger threat to our health than the things that we already have which are very substantial threats to our health We're not just talking about the intensity We're talking about the frequency and the very high level of pulsations. There's a huge literature Which shows that pulsed EMF CMS that pulse up and down very rapidly are in most cases Much more biologically active than our non pulse DMS every single wireless communication device communicates via pulsations But the industry completely ignores this issue The problem with 5g is that they're planning to put out tens of millions of these antennae all over the place without doing one single biological safety test Are you implying? possibly that we the consumers are the guinea pig since they haven't really done tests to see the effects in a smaller setting I mean That's not an implication. It's a statement we are yes Cancer is not the main concern that I have I'm really concerned about sperm count and about effects on pregnancy How many of know that one in six American couples is unable to have a child when they want to How many of you know that last year the birth rate in this country? Dropped the most that it ever has in recent history 3% in a single year people look at the sperm Do you cell phones and the sperm you should sperm swim and they swoops straight But if you expose them to radio frequency lower phone waves a swimming circle Studies have been done here in Australia taking sperm from healthy men and one test-tube gets exposed to cellphone radiation and one test-tube is not exposed to mobile phone radiation, and then the results are Evaluated and this is a measure of vitality We measure how well the sperm swim. This is a measure of mobility motility this is a measure of the Mitochondrial DNA damage they have three times as much damage on their DNA if they have been exposed to mobile phone radiation The data on that are rock solid cell phones can damage sperm quantity and quality Your embryo your uterus in the fetus where your child is developing for the first 100 days in the ovaries the eggs do not have that protection so they are at maximum risk from radiation and For the first month or so you wouldn't even know you were pregnant. You wouldn't even be taking precautions that Is the main danger area so you give birth to? a daughter But her ovaries are now contaminated She may be normal. She may be genetically Damaged but her ovaries are at the most risk so when your daughter grows up and she Becomes pregnant and has a baby. This is where one of these eggs will be fertilized and come out So the real damage here is your grandchildren that is where it is going to show most Do you think that there is a chance that within the third generation of females they may be Not in the third generation But in the fifth generation and that would for humans be something in the order of 150 years ahead of us And of course then it's too late to say that you are sorry and it's very too late to say stop There is a wealth of papers. I mean we're talking about thousands of published papers in the scientific literature few of which or sometimes none of which have entered the official documentation from Authorities and likewise, so I think it's really time to have an independent Compilation of data such was done at August 31st 2007 in the form of the bio initiative report of which I was one of the authors and then we put together approximately 2000 scientific references on a little bit more than 600 pages Clearly saying that if you for instance if you are a rat or a mouse or a cell or a molecule You should definitely not allow yourself to be exposed to this. And in the meantime, we have this full-scale experiment using our own kids One interesting case John Patterson is a telecommunications engineer in Sydney Australia, very brilliant Man for 20 years John tested Telstra digital systems over the time. He realized the dangers of Electromagnetic radiation it disrupts the boil the trick system of your body Which is really your brain your nervous system How your muscles talk and he tried warning of these effects through different agencies through his company go to Lotus get measured it and draw up a report and Always he mediately removed from service finally in 2007 he took matters into his own hand. He Commandeered a used British army tank and went and destroyed six cellphone towers in Sydney, Australia Because he wanted to stop this he was trying to make a point The message was that held suppose You know, these people were elected by us to manage our infrastructure in a responsible manner That is the sole purpose of government if it's going to exist at all, and if it doesn't do that, then it has no Right, it is invalid. So we need to pull this infrastructure down We really do but in order to do that, I mean we can't just be some violent domestic terrorists You've got to you've got to bring this awareness to the people that these towers are doing them damage You don't need bandwidth that fast and they're not doing it so you can download movies quickly They're doing it so they can track every single thing you do and bringing this social accrediting system to control even everything you think The story about a lady called Clare Edwards, she was a United Nation staff member and she was warning of the potentially catastrophic Dangers of 5g technology. I took issue for took the issue to the UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres he is a physicist and electrical engineer and lectured on Telecommunication signals early in his career yet asserted to me that he knew nothing about the dangers of 5g Current public exposure levels are at least one Quintillion that's 18 zeros 1 quintillion times above natural background radiation according to Professor Olle Johansson of the Karolinska Institute in Sweden The highly dangerous biological effects of EMFs have been documented by thousands of studies since 1932 Indicating that we may be facing a global health catastrophe Orders of magnitude worse than those caused by tobacco and cigarettes 5g is designed to deliver concentrated and focused Electromagnetic radiation in excess of 100 times current levels in the same way as do directed energy weapons there is currently an international appeal signed by 237 EMF scientists from 41 nations Urging the UN and particularly the w-h-o to exert strong leadership in fostering the development of more protective EMF guidelines encouraging Prakash measures and educating the public about the considerable health risks particularly the risks to children and fetal fetal development because These things know talking to the Wi-Fi systems, I'm worried because I put those devices in my house. I This I will have to I mean I might confess my ignorance on this we will have to But I'm going to raise this with the red show which I think is the organization that might be able to deal with it properly because I must confess I Was not aware of the attention In 1996 when the Telecommunications Act was passed in it was a provision essentially they kept local officials from addressing health issued concerns when Approving or not approving a cell tower. So that's been incorrect, but then something new who is happening We've talked a lot about it on the Silurian report. Thanks Jason bought the Smith and his website EMF warriors, but but this is new. This is very very new So you're you're basically, you know sending out an appeal on something that in one sense hasn't happened yet This is not just an incremental change. This is a big step up. It's it's a sea change you and on slots Not in an improper way, that's it's a bombardment So instead of a cell tower one mile or two miles from you and you still have cell phone service We're gonna have antennas every block and some pourcel is going to have one mounted to utility utility pole Maybe less than 20 meters from their home So this kind of you know invasive bombardment with this many antennas So I mean just in one square mile if you do the math one per block and sixteen blocks per mile That's about 250 antennas per square mile. The millimeter wave is untested former FCC Chairman Tom wheeler openly said that they don't plan to test we won't wait For the standards and then our appeal also addresses the fact that there's a plan to roll out 5g through satellites in low Earth orbit, so 20,000 satellites which will cover every square foot of the planet with Night after night politicians and other leaders were telling Americans that Sputnik revealed that we were at great risk I Think they're fairly plan Probable Soviet were all dominated we choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things not because They are easy, but because they are hard because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept One we are unwilling to postpone and one we intend to win Welcome everybody to the White House. This is a White House 5g summit. My name is Justin Clark I'm the director of public Liaison and we are thrilled to have you here today really happy to be joined by a lot of leaders in industry members of Congress and the Senate White House leaders on this and people from the FCC Before we start one We are government so don't assume we know anything Okay, I do agree. I don't know anything. I have become accustomed to giving speeches in my new position on Subjects about which I frankly know very little and we need more cell towers and connections in Connecticut on Wednesdays ridiculous The u.s. Is in the lead. Thanks to our private sector as well as the work of the FCC and this administration Overall China and South Korea and many other countries are eager to claim this mantle We have every intention to deploy 5g first and reap the benefits of faster and more robust wireless Yes I hope we'd be China of course and get 2 Giga Giga gigabit speeds and low latency and the race has begun Let there be no mistake The race to 5g is a sprint winning the global race to 5g. It's a national priority We must bear in mind the national security implications of win the race on 5g today We're talking about the importance of being first in 5g continued commitment to putting America first in the race to 5g We're calling it America first 5g first well Our strategy is called the 5g fast plan a plan to facilitate America's superiority in 5g technology connected devices for health applications Which I love has the capacity to make people healthier as I understand it A lot of medical applications industry is not asking the government for money to build 5g networks They're asking us to cut the red tape that surrounds infrastructure deployment We cannot let today's red tape strangle the 5g future the red tape slows and sometimes stops the building of densified Network Facilities necessary for 5g as we continue our efforts to keep government out of the way So that America can continue its leadership for America to win the race to Phi Z one path is the government regulatory path the other path is the private enterprise free market the Ailes of creative destruction shrimp winter path They never heard that the house of pray'r destruction. It just means Let it rip the new Replaces the art with 5g. We're on the cusp of another era of American innovation It means an even more connected world for everyone around us Unlocking the potential of the Internet of Things to become safer healthier and more sustainable for our future, you know Sometimes look we all believe in the tenth Amendment, but sometimes you have to override By the way the 1996 bill permits that kind of override we're not here to be completely heavy-handed But sometimes you got to do what you've got to do in Some of these states of cities that don't want to cooperate want to shake us down We can't allow obstacles and barriers to stop this movement. That's all And this happened in Canada, I mean there were some activists I was working with up there They said well, you know we went over victory We got the local the public, you know the Commission to allow us opt out and I said boy you let's divide and conquer they just got rid of the the people that were raising hell So, you know, that's not a that's not the answer we need to opt out everybody an opt out is an agreement to pay to not be hard an opt out is Volunteering in to extortion an opt out says that if I don't pay you You have the right to harm me so that that doesn't work. This is a mandate This is being pushed down your throat by a company that is not responsive by a government that is not responsible and it's being done in a collusion that's designed to undermine the individual rights of individual people in communities across the country and around the world The Minister for the environment has a duty it's DVT is primarily to ensure that there is cleaner better Healthier environment for people in this country. It's a simple duty It will says responsibility in regard to science and innovation to make sure that that happens What seems to be happening here? In fact one would say undoubtedly happening here is he's using science and innovation to ensure that our right to life is threatened There have been no public debates. There is no public discourse There are no public disclosures as to why when how what is going on in regard to 5g? That by itself is a breach of ministerial Responsibility and one which we really should look at in terms of a private prosecution Against the ministers who have failed to protect our right to lie Okay, smart smart technology smart meters smart cars, not that smart, huh What a smart mean anything that has small attached to it secret militarized on limits in residential technology that's where smart came from and smart every bit of technology that you see today has all all being developed for the some type of battlefield some type of intelligence government system And obviously these developments have to be commercialized and people have actually took them into the homes the definition of a smart grid is a wireless system that will fundamentally turn every single appliance in your home into the equivalent of a Transmitting cell phone. That's every Every computer every television every furnace every air conditioner every coffee machine every printer every single appliance that you have in your house will eventually in a smart grid have an antenna that's embedded into it that will transmit your usage data to a smart meter on the outside of your home that will then transmit your usage data to Another tower receiving a usage signal that will then go to the utility company for supposedly billing purposes Not all signals will just be about your individual use there will be aggregated Will bounce signal from house to house to house within a neighborhood that will then? Accumulate all of the usage data that will transmit that to the utility company Now what that will do is that the end metering system that is transmitting All of that data will be firing an RF signal at many many times a second which will increase the average homeowners radio frequency radiation exposure Exponentially this picture shows some aphids on the leaf of an orange tree Shortly after radar equipment was installed at a nearby airport a number of years ago I noticed that every few seconds all the aphids were tense up in unison and do sort of a little dance as you see in the picture a pound further invest I found that the interval of time between the activity of each dance coincided exactly with the rotation of the radar rotor device at the airport, which was a distance of approximately 14 miles The antenna arrays create this steerable beam Which helps concentrate the energy the beams get pointed at the user What's a MIMO tank mussaf? In Mass Effect British government have got a planet or 400,000 Oh This is so that you've got 5k in every nook and cranny every part of the country sites for that You can have autonomous trackers believe it or not. However, those transmitters these are real off It is fierce terraria door door not real off signal sweeping The countryside will kill every pollinator every biological structure. It will sterilize livestock It will kill the ground so consequently Land want to have a value? Obviously farmers will die The community will be under attack The community will be under a ton if we can't produce food if we kill all the pollinators. We're in serious trouble the takeaway is that 5g the trillion dollar rola a 5g by our friendly local government is Definitely a weapon system Masquerading as a modern efficiency technology, it will certainly is and what I'll put it down It's economic terrorism. There is no value nil in killing ophea population and destroying your Ability to grow food to kill all your pala nearness that may have a nice financial number on a piece of paper but in reality dementia diabetes all the things that are currently crippled in the area chest a burden on the country illness mental health issues the the focus of that calls can be Identified and has been identified in the science. The science is more than the Epidemiological data that was seen on the street is now substantiate not science Their DNA inside you the mitochondrial DNA you can trace Unchanged to your mother her mother her mother Right the way back to the beginning of the human race in Africa the Stone Age It is unchanged the magical and that is being unchanged in your children Which means if you damage it your child could be genetically damaged then her child and Her child and her child Forever you are condemning the future generations of every single child There is a way of our air and light at the end of the tunnel or there is a summit ray of hope thanks to the principles of biological quantum entanglement that we have learned how to exploit in the field of biology medicine now we can transfer the information from the microbial DNA to the human DNA and In so doing we can train so to speak the microbes to withstand Whatever extreme condition they're exposed to including this new technology, and then we can train them to Transfer these resilience of theirs to our DNA So let's say that there are good reasons to be worried about the introduction of these and new technologies But fortunately since the knowledge in the field of quantum biology in the field of micro or micro Biomedicine is advancing as fast as potentially harmful technology Then we can exploit this knowledge to protect ourselves from Any real potential or perceived the danger from these new? technologies I've met with molecular and cellular biologist swith blood microscopists with weapons development experts Frontline activists and researchers and all the stories. I'm hearing from these experts and pundits leads to the same thing 5g is almost certainly the endgame. It is an extinction event Brought into our homes into our classrooms onto the high street Into the very cells and DNA in our human bodies It is such a perilous threat that it is almost impossible To imagine let alone describe when the 5g signature goes live It will tap into a multitude of satellites which are NGO set orbit around the surface of the earth millions of surface antennas will pick up that signaling and will then scatter the signaling into Hundreds and hundreds of millions of different micro antenna systems and set up on street lamps and even in your home Which you're not aware of incidentally the LED light bulbs in your home invariably contain the micro or nano tech lens flare Capacitors which will receive the 5g signaling and it will proliferate the 5g signaling everywhere by Exploding the signal into billions of photons which will target everything all at the same time This is stealth technology. This is invisible Science but what it means in simple terms is that you will be flagged up visible Trackable inside your own home anywhere you move on the surface of the earth They will have a lock and load tracking capability over you you will be visible to invisible masters each one of us all the time today our governments and the corporate sector have managed somehow to infiltrate the mainframe of our Civilization and are pushing through a 20 trillion dollar infrastructure already? Without any and I mean without any health science running behind it there have been no tests your government and your health authorities are either in collusion on this matter of Genocide and ecocide or they're just m stupid and I would suggest as the latter Shame on the technologists and the electricians who are furthering this technology in our homes in our offices in our streets shame on the legislators and the parliamentarians of the troglodytes and bureaucrats that proliferate our society today shame on that a Shillong for putting their signatures to contracts, which allow the fast-tracking of this technology into our homes not to our high streets shame on the parliamentarians and international leadership whose wedding signatures and seals of office are sanctioning and Permissioning the rollout of something which is arguably the greatest threat to humankind shame on each one of us who now fail to get up out of our homes walk out of our front doors and Challenge every so-called authority who dares to violate our bodies our homes and our future generations
