 [Music] we need to check this out with the cancellation of NWC you may not have heard too much about this new experience yet but it's a game-changer we're gonna get into all the specs and everything we know about this new phone today but first to all you new subscribers thank you I'm super excited about the community of photography building here and if you're new here we do simple to understand in photography and video tutorials insights and reviews so hit that subscribe button you won't be sorry so I have to admit I have been expecting the camera makers and the smartphone makers to converge or technologies but the other way around where the camera makers would be using computational imaging to augment the capabilities of their sensors and enhance the dynamic range or maybe the zoom capabilities but Sony's gone in the other direction and they're using the sony alpha technology to enhance the smartphone's I mean it makes perfect sense when I think about it and it also explains the naming logic behind this phone the Sony Xperia 1 mark 2 in other words the second version of the Xperia 1 first of all let's run through all the upgrades you get from the first experience you get a four thousand milliamp battery up to 3300 you get the IPS 65 68 water and dust resistance you get fast and wireless charging and then you get the newest snapdragon 865 5g chipset which is about 25% faster CPU than the first edition oh and for you audio files you get the return of the physical headphone jack I don't personally notice any quality difference and Biagio but some people do so that might be important you also get eight gigabytes of RAM 256 gigabytes of storage and the signature six and a half inch 21 by nine cinema y 90 megahertz 4k 643 pixels per inch HDR OLED display oh and you can custom set the white balance for viewing on this now let's get into the good stuff the camera most importantly you Sony integrated the sony alpha camera division into the sony xperia development process and that brings us a host of features that we didn't see before first of all you get three 12 megapixel sensors behinds iced-tea stark coated optics which have been shown to significantly reduce glares flares and reflections a pretty logical and smart move from sony considering their long-standing partnership with zeiss and i'm i'm happy about that the main lens is 24 millimetres f 1.7 with OSS optical image stabilization there's an ultra wide at 16 millimetres f 2.2 and a zoom 70 millimeter f 2.4 lens also with OSS there's also a three di TOF time-of-flight sensor wedged in between all these for low-light autofocus giving us up to sixty times per second continuous autofocus and auto exposure on the main camera and up to 30 times per second on the other two lenses the camera can shoot up to 20 frames per second in burst mode so with that time of light sensor you're getting three calculations per frame every second it also has real time I autofocus and not just for humans but also for animals and to maximize these features we get the Sony Pro photo app which kind of mimics the sony alpha interface and a separate cinema Pro app allows us to connect our phones with our sony alpha cameras for touch autofocus and an accurate rendition of white balance assuming that the phone screen gets bright enough and daylight to see it and then there's the Xperia Pro Edition which is still in development phase but truly has some pro features it's got a custom graphene sheath inside with a vapor chamber and an air gap to keep the device and components cool and then the outside casing is made of a low dielectric constant material giving it that rugged graphite look which is engineered to allow a high-speed millimeter have passed through an interference ennas surround the device for maximum connectivity in 360 degree antenna coverage to take advantage this we also get an HDI Mini port so you can connect the phone to any camera not just a Sony and use it for video monitoring or for vlogging for instance or you can also stream 4k video to the internet over 5g shortwaves the faster more stable version of 5g will also get dual SIM card slots 512 gigabytes of RAM with an extra slot upgradeable to a terabyte and may be my favorite little feature is an extra button on the side which can be programmed for just about anything I'd probably program it for focus hold anyway the non pro models are slated to be out late spring and are supposed to be $1100 us since the pro version is still in development we don't know exactly when that's gonna come out hopefully later this year so what do you think will you get one I'm personally pretty excited I mean I played with the Xperia One and it was good but just not good enough to switch away from the pixels but now with the sony alpha features and the interface that's integrated I'm pretty excited but what about you is it enough to make you switch from your current phone I mean this is a pretty big leap for camera technology in a smartphone especially with the connectivity but the fact that Sony is now integrating all their most exciting technologies together between the smartphone and the sony alpha and the sony bravia giving us awesome sensors continuous autofocus I oughta focus custom white balance all in a beautiful display that's pretty exciting the real question is does this mark the beginning of the end for the big cameras and I would say not quite yet first of all the megapixel sensors on the phones even if they got up to 42 or we've heard over a hundred mega pixels the pixels are smaller so they still can't compete with the dynamic range and capabilities of the larger format cameras also even though these phones now have Zeiss glass in them which is exciting it can't reproduce what this lens can capture in the field still the gap is closing and pretty fast and I just think that this is going to press the camera manufacturers to continue to innovate which is a good thing for everybody ok if you feel like that helped or was at least a little bit entertaining please hit that like button is that really does help also if you're wondering what I think about the pixel 4 I did a full review in comparison against the a7 r3 in a video I'll put in the description below and you can check it out and I'll keep you updated on any news I get from Sony on the exterior Xperia Pro models so hit that subscribe button in the notification belt to stay in the loop around here and I'll see you in the next [Music]
