 the new 5g network technology is currently being rolled out in the united states germany the united kingdom and many other countries all over the world what's new about it does it really use microwaves like in microwave ovens is that something you should worry about i began looking into this fully convinced i tell you that this is the usual nonsense about cell phones causing cancer but having looked at it in some more detail now i'm not so sure [Music] all you need to know to understand the 5g controversy first of all what is 5g 5g is the fifth generation of wireless networks the installation of antennas is not yet completed and it will probably take at least several more years to complete but in some places 5g is already operating and you can now buy cell phones that use it what's it good for 5g promises to deliver more data faster by up to a factor 100 optimistically it could catapult us into an era where driverless cars and the internet of things have become reality how's that supposed to work 5g uses a variety of improvements on the data routing that makes it more efficient but the biggest change that has attracted the most attention is that 5g uses a frequency range that the previous generations of wireless networks did not use these are the millimeter waves and yes these are the same waves that are being used in the scanners at airport security the difference is that in the scanners you're exposed for a second every couple of months or so while with 5g you'd be sitting in it at low power but possibly for hours a day depending on how close you live and work to one of the new antennas as the name says millimeter waves have wavelength in the millimeter range and the ones used for 5g correspond to frequencies of 24 to 48 gigahertz if that number doesn't tell you anything don't worry i will give you more context in a moment for now let me just say that the new frequencies are about a factor 10 higher than the highest frequencies that were previously used for wireless networks another thing that's new about 5g are directional faced array antennas complicated word that basically means the antennas don't just radiate the signal off into all directions but they can target a particular direction and that's an important difference if you want to know how the signal strength drops with distance to the antenna roughly speaking it becomes more difficult to know what's going on because of these new features conspiracy theories have flourished around 5g and there have been about 100 incidents mostly in the netherlands belgium ireland and the uk where people have burnt down or otherwise damaged 5g telephone towers dozens of cities counties and nations have stopped the installations there have been protests against the rollout of the 5g technology all over the world and groups of concerned scientists have written open letters twice once in 2017 and once in 2019 each letter attracted about a few hundred signatures from scientists not a terrible lot but not nothing either before we can move on i need to give you some minimal background on the physics so bear with me for a moment wireless technology uses electromagnetic radiation to encode and send information electromagnetic radiation is electric and magnetic fields oscillating around each other creating a freely propagating wave that can travel from one place to another electromagnetic radiation is everywhere light is electromagnetic radiation radio stations air music with electromagnetic radiation if you open an oven and feel the heat that's also electromagnetic radiation these seem to be different phenomena but physically they're all the same thing the only difference is the wavelength of the oscillation commonly we use different names for electromagnetic radiation depending on that wavelength if we can see it we call it light visible light with long wavelength is red and at even longer wavelength when we can no longer see it we call it infrared we can't see infrared light but we often still feel that it's warm at even longer wavelength we call the radiation microwaves and if the wavelengths are even longer they are called radio waves on the other side of visible light at wavelength shorter than violet we have the ultraviolet and then the x-rays and gamma rays the new millimeter waves are in the high frequency part of microwaves now we may call electromagnetic radiation a wave but those waves are actually quantized which means they are made of small packs of energy these small packs of energy are the particles of light which are called photons you may think it's an unnecessary complication to talk about quantization here but knowing that electromagnetic radiation is made of these particles the photons is extremely helpful to understand what the radiation can do that's because the energy of the photons is proportional to the frequency of the radiation or equivalently the energy is inversely proportional to the wavelength so a high frequency means a short wavelength and a large energy per photon a small frequency means a long wavelength which means small energy again that's energy per photon that the frequency of electromagnetic radiation tells you the energy of the particles in the radiation is so useful because if you want to damage a molecule you need a certain minimum amount of energy you need this energy to break the bonds between the atoms that make up the molecule and so the most essential thing you need to know to gauge how harmful electromagnetic radiation is is whether the energy per photon in the radiation is large enough to break molecular bonds like the bonds that hold together the dna breaking molecular bonds is not the only way electromagnetic radiation can be harmful and i will get to the other ways in a few minutes but it is the most direct and important harm electromagnetic radiation can do so how much energy do you need to damage a molecule damage begins happening just above the high energy end of visible light with the ultraviolet radiation that's the light that gives your sunburn and that you've been told to avoid it has wavelengths that are just a little bit shorter than visible light or frequencies and energies that are just a little bit higher in terms of energy ultraviolet radiation has about 3 to 30 electron volts per photon an electron volt is just a unit of energy if that's unfamiliar to you it doesn't matter you merely need to know that the binding energy of most molecules also lies in the range of a few electron volts if you want to break a molecule you need energies above that binding energy so you need frequencies at or above the ultraviolet that's because the energy for the damage has to come with the individual photons in the radiation if the individual photons do not have enough energy to actually damage the molecule they either just go through or sometimes if they hit a resonance frequency they'll wiggle the molecule if you wiggle molecules that means you warm them up so what matters for the question whether you can damage a molecule is the energy per photon in the radiation which means the frequency of the radiation not the total energy of all the particles in the radiation of which there could be many if you take more particles but each of them has an energy below what's necessary for damaging a molecule you just get more wiggling all the radiation used for wireless networks including 5g uses frequencies way below those necessary to break molecular bonds it's below even the infrared so in this regard there's clearly nothing to worry about but as i mentioned breaking molecular bonds is not the only way that electromagnetic radiation can harm living tissue because tissue is complicated it's not just physics you can also harm tissue just by warming it and how much warming you can get from electromagnetic radiation is not determined by the energy per photon it is determined by the total energy per time that is transferred by all the photons and on the fracture that is absorbed by the tissue the total energy transfer per time is called the power and it's commonly measured in watts so the frequency tells you the energy per photon the power tells you the total energy in photons per time for example if you look at your microwave oven that probably operates at about 2 gigahertz which is a really small energy per photon about a million times below the energy required to break molecular bonds but a microwave oven operates at maybe 400 or up to 1000 watts and that's high in terms of power so a lot of photons per time on the other hand if you have a wireless router at home it quite possibly operates at a similar frequency as your microwave oven but a wireless router typically uses something like 100 milliwatts that's 10 000 times less than the microwave oven and the router radiates into space not into a closed cavity that's a relevant difference for a simple geometric reason if the photons in the electromagnetic radiation distribute in all of the directions as they do for antennas like your wireless router then the density of particles will thin out meaning the power will drop very quickly with distance to the sender this is why in wireless communication the highest power you'll be exposed to is if you're close to the sender and that is usually your cell phone not an antenna because the antennas tend to be on a roof or a mast or in any case not on your ear okay to summarize the frequency tells you the energy per particle and determines what type of damage is possible the power tells you the number of particles and it drops very quickly with distance to the source the power alone does not tell you how much is absorbed by the human body back to 5g what the 5g controversy is about is whether the electromagnetic radiation from the new antennas poses a health risk 5g actually uses electromagnetic radiation in three different parts of the spectrum called the low bend the mid band and the high band the frequency of the radiation in all these bands is below that which is required to damage molecules the frequency of the mid band is indeed comparable to the one your microwave oven is using but actually there's nothing new about this microwaves have been used for wireless networks for more than two decades the radiation in the high band are the new millimeter waves this band has so far been largely unused for telecommunication purposes simply because it's not very good for long-range transmission the electromagnetic waves in this range do not travel very far and can get blocked by walls trees and even humans therefore the idea behind 5g is to use a short-range network made of the so-called small cells for the millimeter waves these small cells have to be distributed at distances of about 100 meters or so the small cells communicate with macro cells that use the mid and low bands with antennas that operate at higher power and that do the long range transmission so a fully functional 5g network is likely to increase the exposure to millimeter waves which have not before been used for cell phones this means the people who are citing the lack of correlation between cell phone news and cancer incidents in the past 20 years missed the point these studies don't tell you anything about the 5g high band because that wasn't previously in use now the thing is if you look at what is known about the health risks from long-term exposure to the new millimeter waistband there are basically no studies we know that millimeter waves cannot penetrate deeply into the human body but we know that at high power they warm the skin and irritate eyes exactly what power is too much in the long run no one knows because there just hasn't been enough research here is for example a matter review published about a year ago which came to the conclusion the available studies do not provide adequate and sufficient information for a meaningful safety assessment and here we have rob waterhouse vice president of a telecommunication company in the united states waterhouse admits that although millimeter waves have been used for many different applications including astronomy and military applications the effect of their use in telecommunications is not well understood the majority of the scientific community does not think there's an issue however it would be unscientific to flat out say there are no reasons to worry that's not very reassuring and the world health organization writes no adverse health effect has been causally linked with exposure to wireless technologies but so far only a few studies have been carried out at the frequencies to be used by 5g so the protests that you see against 5g i am afraid to say are not entirely unjustified don't get me wrong damaging other people's property is certainly not a legitimate response but i can understand the concern we have no reason to think 5g is a health risk indeed it is reasonable to think it is not a health risk given that this radiation is of low energy and scatters in the upper layers of the skin but there's very little data on what the effects of long-term exposure may be how should one proceed in such a situation depends on how willing you are to tolerate risk and that's not a question for science that's a question
