 There currently is a homework gap where students in rural remote areas don't have access to the same connectivity as other students would have We have to make that a level playing field so they can meet the challenge but also be the next creators Innovators and the next people to lead our country 5G will open the door for augmented and virtual realities to expand our students learning and to give them a leg up on what they need to be successful in life There's all kind of examples of virtual field trips obviously exploring geographic areas that you can't do by physical location I think that's that's a big positive But also there's virtual learning and virtual reality to teach welding to teach different types of surgery or doing biological dissections It puts them in an atmosphere where they're actually learning and touching and feeling and they're not just being in a lectured environment I think with 5G, the door is open for language immersion language learning, the online access and being able to video chat with someone and connect from country to country but to actually have that interaction When you look at rural areas teacher shortages are an issue, and if virtually you can connect with another school or an online provider They can help fill the gap. I think it's definitely a social equalizer I think it's a workforce development economic development for rural regions as well that they were able to expand their learning but also expand the capabilities of what our students can do if we have connectivity and technology at the fingertips of these rural students that are creative and innovative and do a great job You know the sky's the limit on what they can do
