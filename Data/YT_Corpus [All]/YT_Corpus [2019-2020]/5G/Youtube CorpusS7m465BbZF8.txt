 How will 5G change the industry of tomorrow? That’s what we will find out today at our Automotive Testcenter. Oh, look! There’s the action! That’s 5G at work! It will be able to provide reliability as high as 99.999 % with a sub-10-millisecond latency. Data speeds 10 times higher than today’s 4G. And a connection density as high as 1 million connected devices per square kilometer. It’s all beeing tested right here in our industrial 5G proof-of-concept. To be more precise: in the first private stand-alone 5G network in an industrial environment using the 3.7-GHz band. Here’s one of the future applications we’re testing: the operation of automated guided vehicles, AGVs, equipped with a 5G modem. All signals are processed in real time. Thanks to seamless connectivity, the AGVs can communicate while on the move and react to any unforeseen situations. And now take a look at the heart of this private stand-alone 5G test network equipped with Qualcomm 5G technology and operated with SIMATIC automation equipment and SIMOVE fleet control from Siemens. Siemens and Qualcomm Technologies are working together to pioneer future solutions for industry with 5G. We’ve achieved the first milestone on the path to connected production, maintenance, and logistics. That’s the future – and we’re serious about it. Very serious.
