 5g cellphone towers are slowly popping up around Kern County but it's leaving some people who live here worried about their health and Seventeen's care wah has traveled around the county trying to find out if you should actually be concerned from the mountains of Tehachapi to the edge of the Mojave Desert the fear of impending 5g cell towers is spreading among small Kern County communities some believe it's a question of life or death so the question is how big of a health concern does 5g actually pose and our company is putting the lives of residents at risk just for faster wireless service we're starting our investigation in boron population 2300 it's a desert town on the southeast corner of Kern County it's not the big city we don't have the stresses the crime rate we don't have the gangs we don't have it's a nice place to raise your kids earlier this month a Verizon 5g cell tower was put up about 1,000 feet from the high school everybody's kids either have gone to this school go to the school or play football in our community so what is 5g right now if you were to download a like a two-hour movie it would take maybe a few minutes with the 5g technology in place if the less than 20 seconds what do you say to those people who say we don't need 5g for geez enough the future's here it's not only for our viewing pleasure and movies and things like that but we started thinking about other technologies like autonomous driving in short 5g has 100 times the capacity as 4G explains Nick points an expert in wireless technology at arc in Bakersfield as far as I'm concerned that's why we don't live in a big city so we don't need that the Littlefield's fear the high schools proximity to the cell tower could increase the risk of cancer for kids in the community we're gonna make it including their seven-year-old Jacob there's other location you can put those towers they can't put it yeah well there's nobody or put it up higher some may call their concerns extremists but the Littlefield's are not alone one here at the equestrian in April AT&T proposed seven cell towers in Tehachapi so this is our backyard one would stand about a hundred feet from the Bentley's window in Bear Valley Springs dozens of residents have teamed up in opposition there's just not a lot of research out there to to be able to say that this is safe not only today but down the road and I think there's a great deal of concern about that from advocating from forming this group what is your ideal outcome what you hope happens we have almost a thousand signatures from our community asking that these towers be stopped at this point so where does the fear of 5g come from the research is conflicting some studies raise alarm around 5g this is from the environmental health trust the effects include cancer risks and some reports say wireless towers are harmless in 2018 research by the American Cancer Society noted some people have expressed concern that living working or going to school near a cell tower might increase the risk of cancer or other health problems at this time there is very little evidence to support this idea but in 2014 the World Health Organization noted cell phone use has been widespread for only a couple decades not long enough for studies to conclude whether it could be linked to cancer a recent investigation by the New York Times traces the fear of 5g back to Russian propaganda Russia Today or RT America is a news show linked to inciting warnings RT America came out saying that 5g is causing it's harmful cause birth defects brain tumors cancer and and let you know from the other side of it you know there's experts saying that no this absolutely Falls however even Russia 5g cell towers are widespread as other countries you know going to 5 G's just gonna open up medical advancements it's gonna open up you know like a tunnels driving the internet-of-things so I think there's a race to causing distraction on one side so someone else can get a leg up on the other research has also stated the higher frequencies of 5g are actually less harmful less likely to penetrate through the skin and brain but the Littlefield's are still hesitant radiation is never gonna be saved not even a little bit is okay or is it safe besides health concerns the bear Valley Springs group is worried about aesthetics it's hard to imagine that a home that we've built that has a view out our backyard potentially looking at a 70-foot tower hard to imagine that that that will not make it most difficult if we should decide to sell our property and it will impact the value of this property California recently has been faced with the conflict of advancing to 5g or maintaining beauty standards in January in a lawsuit between t-mobile and San Francisco the state Supreme Court ruled that local governments can limit or even ban wireless towers for aesthetic purposes my concern is that they're moving too quickly on this whole project there are a lot of questions and they haven't been answered until more research is done there will be both sides of the argument some who continue to fear for their health and some who believe the fear is irrational but for now I'm tearing wah and bear Valley Springs 17 News
