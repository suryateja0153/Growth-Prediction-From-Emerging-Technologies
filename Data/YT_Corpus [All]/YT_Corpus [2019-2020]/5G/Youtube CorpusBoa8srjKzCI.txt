 just how fast is 5g fifth generation wireless or 5g is the latest iteration of cellular technology 5g is up to 100 times faster than today's 4G networks with a fraction of the latency and because of more available bandwidth and advanced antenna technology 5g will enable a sharp increase in the amount of data that can be transferred wirelessly 5g and our or new radio is the air interface developed for the 5g network but 5g devices will also have 4G LTE capability in addition to improvements in speed capacity and latency 5g offers network management features like network slicing to support specific use cases or business cases a self-driving car for example would require a network sites that offers extremely fast low latency connections to aid vehicle navigation in real time a home appliance however could operate on a much slower connection because high performance is not crucial 5g relies on the millimeter wave spectrum to deliver high speeds which can only travel over short distances in a subject to interference from weather and physical obstacles as a result 5g signals are transmitted via small cell stations and police's like light poles and building roofs as opposed to the large high power cell towers that radiate signals over long distances the first 5g implementations came in late 2018 and early 2019 but the technology is expected to reach mainstream adoption by 2022 other than self-driving cars and super fast phones 5g deployments could open opportunities for things like augmented and virtual reality devices smart city developments and remote surgery you you
