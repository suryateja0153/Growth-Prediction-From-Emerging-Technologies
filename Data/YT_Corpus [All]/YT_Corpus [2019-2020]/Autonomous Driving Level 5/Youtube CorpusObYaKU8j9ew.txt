 there's no question that the regulator's paid a disproportionate amount of attention to that which generates press this is just an objective fact and Tesla generates a lot of press so the you know in the United States this I think almost 40,000 automotive deaths per year but if there are four and Tesla they'll probably receive a thousand times more press than anyone else when I was 16 years old I got into this really bad car accident making a left-hand turn the other car ended up not seeing me and we ended up doing a full head-on collision totaling both cars that car which ended up catching on fire so the police came fire truck came ambulance it was crazy and it seriously scarred me for life because I was not able to make a left-hand turn for the longest time I would do anything not to make it so I always wish there was just someone else driving me because I'm such a nervous driver now because of that traumatic accident became obvious to me that in the future any any car that did not have autonomy I would be about as useful as a horse which is not to say that there's no use it's just rare and somewhat idiosyncratic if somebody has a horse at this point it's just obvious that cars will drive themselves completely it's just a question of time these crash statistics at the beginning in the video don't even factor in the ripple effects the literal millions of lives that are changed forever by these accidents and that's part of why I'm so passionate about Tesla and I think more people need to be aware of what's going on and be supportive of their mission toward full self-driving so that in the future we can drastically reduce these crash and death total numbers let's take a look at the data of what Tesla is currently doing in the third quarter there was one accident for every 4.3 4 million miles driven in which drivers had autopilot engaged for those driving without autopilot but with our active safety features Tesla registered one accident for every 2.7 million miles driven for those driving without autopilot and without the active safety features Tesla registered one accident for every 1.8 two million miles driven by comparison nits as most recent data shows that in the United States there is an auto crash every four hundred ninety-eight thousand miles and what's crazy about this is Tesla's current autopilot feature is the worst that will ever be what I mean by that is every day that goes on the more data that's fed into the computer system the better it's going to get contrast that with current legacy automakers vehicles and their cruise control it's the best that it's ever going to be when you get the car it will never get any better for the rest of your ownership of that vehicle pair this information with Tesla's being deemed of a various reporting agencies as literally the safest cars ever tested and you have a very strong case for why most people if they can afford these cars should be buying Tesla's there is no engine on a Tesla vehicle so the crumple zones are far superior to ice vehicles the roof strength and structure of the cars are also superior and have won top honors and testing the data and the testing agencies agree Tesla produces some of if not the safest cars ever tested and so if you think that full self-driving is decades away and it's irrelevant for the here and now you might need to think again if you look back in 2013 there's a couple quotes from you saying you know that last 10% is incredibly hard and you need to keep a human in the loop what's changed your mind I still think the last 10% is autonomy is extremely difficult or even the last 1% of autonomy it's really difficult then also for in defining autonomy or for self-driving I think we will be feature complete full self-driving this year meaning the car will be able to find you in a parking lot pick you up take you all the way to your destination without an intervention this year I would say that I am certain of that that is not a question walk however people sometimes will extrapolate that to mean now it works with 100 cent certainty requiring no observation perfectly this is not the case once it is future complete then your sort of kind of the March of nines like how many nines of reliability you do you want to be and then when do regulators agree that it is that that is that reliable so this future complete full full self-driving this year with certainty this is something that we control and I've managed autopilot engineering directly every week in detail so I'm uncertain to this then when will regulators allow us even to have these features turned on with human oversight but that's a bearable which we're we have limited control over that is what when will regulators agree that that these things could be done without human oversight that isn't an another level beyond that so these are externalities we don't quite control and the conservatism of regulators varies conserve a lot from one jurisdiction to another my guess as to when we would think it's safe for somebody to essentially fall asleep and wake up the destination probably towards the end of next year that's that's what I wouldn't I would think it's most likely it will be safe enough for that I don't know when regulators will agree so let's just be conservative and say that full self-driving isn't here until 2025 which would be four or five years after Ilan's latest prediction that's still only about five years away and here's the thing it's about more than safety when cars drive themselves a world of opportunity is open that's part of like Tesla has such a unique focus on fun and entertainment in its cars already with features like Netflix Hulu and twitch streaming there are already video games and music mixing apps and it's literally just the beginning as they can add new features over-the-air not having to go to any dealership can you imagine hopping in your car for a two-hour drive where you can sit back and continue to watch your Netflix documentary or where you can video chat with your family and perhaps you want to disconnect and just read a book or eat your lunch the time that we as humans would be able to use more effectively and enjoyably is incredible and how about the commercial aspect being able to buy a cyber truck to deploy on a car rental service while you're at work so it can act like uber without a driver or as a shuttle service to and from the airport while you're at home relaxing on a Saturday businesses could buy a fleet to use for grocery deliveries without having to hire drivers while not paying a dime for gas and saving drastically on maintenance costs and so even if full self-driving is years away in its current state as of today it's still incredibly useful it can significantly reduce the stress of driving small things we don't even consider like staying in the center of the lane making lane changes getting in the proper lane for highway exits it's already doing this on its own and thousands of drivers have raved about the experience when used properly and according to the stipulations Tesla has communicated very clearly so I wanted to make this video series to share why I care so much about Tesla and why I think more people would too if they knew what was going on I want to warn especially the Tesla fans about what's coming with full self-driving when this becomes more and more mainstream the media is going to obliterate any bad incident that happens while on autopilot anything to do with full self-driving so with that being said we need to as Tesla fans and supporters make sure that we bring people back to earth and share the relevant data of how much safer even now as it is Tesla is then humans driving vehicles so we should be supporting this mission to full autonomy for many many reasons but most importantly to reduce the number of people that are dying every year from driving so with that being said thank you for watching until the end of the video it means a lot I hope that I've earned a like and a comment and if you want to see the future videos in this series just click that subscribe button hit the bell and then you'll be notified in your timeline when those videos come out it will require detecting hands on wheel for at least six months or something like that from here it really is a question of like from a regulatory standpoint what how much safer than a person just autopilot need to be for it took to be okay to not monitor the car I do to me right now this seems game set match I don't know I mean that's how I almost be complacent overconfident but that's what it appeared that is just literally what did how it appears right now I could be wrong but it appears to be the case that Tesla is vastly ahead of everyone
