 Together with my team and also our co-hosts NOVID20, DeepBrainz, Sirius Global and Startup Grind Rijeka we're super happy to welcome you on this sunny day to our homebase in Linz (Austria, EU) We tried to address one of the challenges which became quite apparent as a result of the crisis and that is the shortage of mechanical ventilators We join the forces of all business advising companies and institutions on one platform every small medium-sized enterprise gets the same access to external sophisticated expertise today only big corporates have What we're actually delivering is an AI first SaaS IoT platform for automated healthcare, for level 5 autonomous driving and conversational AI UNITE was made for the purchasing needs of companies. It's really made for the demand of the officials like hospitals, like states to provide support for kindergarten or hope for elderly people So all of those have shortage on important stuff and they don't know how to get it on the other hand we have a small factory that produces masks, sure they are too small to provide for poland Austria, whatever what you can provide for a little carrier. So how do you get those two parties together? That's why we're doing that I guess my biggest achievement in the sense was to be able to make people work together from all continents, in all age groups, from very young to people in their 70s. Well our biggest achievement is definitely the team. Something that can't be replaced is the vision we all have and that it is collectively shared is something that we're really proud of What I would say is donate your skill because when we did testing in schools, we had 70 students who made it possible so there is no skill out there that cannot be used somewhere we're at a point where we can change how business works how big corporates and all our society works and when we can't change it for now that we have this pandemic, than we should at least make the best out of it for the future
