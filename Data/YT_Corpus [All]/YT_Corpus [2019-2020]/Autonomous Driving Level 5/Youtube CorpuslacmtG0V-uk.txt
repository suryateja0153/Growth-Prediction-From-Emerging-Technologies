 the future is kind of here right now we're just going to get in the car and ask it to take us somewhere oh it's not touching it a lot of you guys know about autopilot it's something where you get on the freeway you pull on the little trigger and the car will drive down the freeway stay in its lane change lanes sometimes it's pretty cool it'll even get off the freeway for you i get a little uncomfortable i don't even let it take me off the freeway i just let it cruise in the lane on the freeway and it's fantastic i love it this is the tesla model s raven which is the fastest car that you can get right now 2.2 seconds 0 to 60. but this particular tesla raven edition is unlike any other tesla raven in the world elon musk is probably the only other person that has a tesla with the capabilities that this one has the full self-driving option this is my friend eli you may remember him from the boring tunnel event where you have an incredible magazine about elon musk right yeah the adventures of star man i actually just released episode one then and just last week we dropped episode four episode four already holy smokes this is my starship wrapped beautiful stainless steel uh because i'm friends with star man so obviously this car has to look awesome tesla entrusted me with the fsd beta and basically so that i can go out and help provide them test data but i'm also given special permission to actually share with you guys and the world what the capabilities of this feature are okay what's the top things that have blown your mind so far while you've had it what's totally blown me away about this fsd beta is watching it go through an unprotected left-hand turn no lane markings like can we exit this neighborhood here it'll come up to the stop sign it'll even tell me when if you can't see far enough it'll say creeping forward to observe it'll creep forward it'll look at what's going on around and then when it's safe it'll take off and it does it with pretty good amount of confidence and a really decent speed like it's not crawling it's going okay enough talk you guys are here to watch us drive the car or to let the car drive us somewhere i'm curious to see how this is gonna work eli tells me i shouldn't be nervous because he's been testing it for a while and it works [Music] okay what grocery store are we going to uh we're gonna go to albertsons okay alversons they have good donuts this is something entirely new with this fsd beta i'm gonna double click the stick which normally you do on a street with lane lines but check this out look at that it's telling you stopping for traffic control because it sees the stop sign that is so trippy that whole sign right there okay so we are at an intersection right here there's the actual stop sign it's stopping it's turning there's no cars [Music] it sees i think it sees that there's an intersection coming up yeah it sees it and it sees the little tree island look at the tree it sees the tree it's purple okay all right we're in the right lane here stopping for traffic okay that car went by pretty quick it was like a green box on there oh we're turning right okay we're going oh we're going right here we go driving down the street we've got a uh a car in front of us that's basically a green box on the screen we're going 49 miles an hour just like regular tesla auto pilot you have your your hands close to it you can take over whenever yep uh the only thing i've been adjusting here is adjusting what the max speed is set to with a little stick um so i've got it set to like 45 miles an hour so we're pulling up right now we're already there okay it's trying to figure out its way it's turning there's lots of stuff going on oh it's not touching yet by the way look at this watch it navigate this parking lot oh my gosh look at all the red boxes those are cars what the heck that is trippy all the different colors on the screen right there hey we have fsd driving beta that's another tesla okay so it's literally pulling up it's going to stop right here because it's the final destination okay let's give it a little something else does it see that lady right there yes oh there she is she's a green box yep does it see her face mask it's a cool face mask and check out this light it's got a blinking yellow oh it's red on the other one but it knows oh my gosh it's going fast as soon as the light turns green it turns green on there it's kind of following the car in front of us it's going fast and then it's turning it's just hurting the wheel's just turning i know it's a car but it's driving my tesla doesn't do this [Music] you can see its path calculated by the dotted oh yeah the gray dotted line there's a car driving by it sees it does it see any others no no okay it's like here we go we're good go oh okay so he successfully went from a neighborhood to the grocery store a couple of things that blew my mind first of all that i could recognize the cars and make like right-hand turns that's pretty insane left-hand turns are crazy too but then once you get in the parking lot the way that it visualizes everything it visualizes the cars the people the lines on the road everything so check this out it's still coming oh it's coming oh it's coming it's tripped out by me here he comes all right it's gonna turn right there what if i'm running what happens if i go like this oh it just stopped what happens if i go like this okay so how did it do with me jumping in front of it it saw you coming across the screen and as soon as you bolted out in front it slammed the brakes and stopped and they didn't want to start going once i started going again or it waited until you were kind of clear out of the way and then it slowly started edging off i want to test this thing down the las vegas boulevard this is the aria hotel and casino we are going to get in the car ask it to take us to the tesla superchargers this is the first time a tesla full self-driving beta has been on the las vegas boulevard and we're off a taxi to our right taxi to our left upcoming lane change is coming we're driving on the road where i rode in the mercedes-benz fully automated car once oh we're changing lanes there's a car kind of in our lane and not in our lane or how are we going to navigate that [Music] look at all those yellow boxes those are all the people [Music] it can't even see that the corner is there yet but it knows based on navigation that it's going to be there so it's already predicting its path [Music] elaine turn lots going on lots of colors on the boxes that car pulled the u-turn and the car was like look out look out for that one but we didn't take over okay that was a tricky one it did it two years ago i was here at ces in las vegas and mercedes-benz had their autopilot program all of the data that we're seeing on the screen it looks like some video game that's kind of what the mercedes-benz one looked like two years ago a side note mercedes-benz has actually stopped their autonomous driving program like it's done right now they're not doing it supposedly i think that's the last thing i read about it but what the guys told me when they were there they said right now the cars are good enough to to cover 99 of the different scenarios that they're going to encounter on the roads but it's that one percent that extra one percent that they need to get collect data for and then program the car and teach the software and the artificial intelligence when a kangaroo jumps across the road what is the pattern for it how does the software react to that so that hopefully that 99 can get to like 99.9 because it's never going to be perfect but in order for people to be comfortable with an autonomous car it's got to be pretty near perfect for it and that's what the job of the beta testers are right now with tesla so i don't know when exactly people can expect that they're going to get this deployed like system-wide for production but this is a beta which means it has it can do really incredible things it has incredible capabilities but it also fails sometimes and until they get that failure rate to a very low percentage tesla's not going to push it out because they don't want anybody in their cars or anybody walking on the streets to be unsafe so i don't know about the timing but i can definitely tell you from seeing this feature that the future is here it's just around the corner and tesla's absolutely going to deliver on their promise of full self-driving this car's got cruise control school please we did it we drove down the las vegas boulevard on a busy night it was surprisingly busy and it worked we didn't hit anybody tesla good job i love my car it's so fun that it drives itself on the freeway and someday i get to do that cool thing so anyway let me know your questions down below because if we want to do another video or if he's going to do it on twitter i'd love to know what things you're looking forward to or what things you want to see him do to test it out i'm putting out video clips on twitter at eli burton underscore and also on the youtube channel my tesla adventure remember how i said that he wrote starman the comic book well there's four episodes and even a coloring book so i'm gonna take these and put them as part of the ongoing giveaway with our backpacks i'm just gonna randomly put these in the backpacks of some people that buy backpacks in november that we got the 15 off of our merch and also i'll put a link in the description if you want to go buy one
