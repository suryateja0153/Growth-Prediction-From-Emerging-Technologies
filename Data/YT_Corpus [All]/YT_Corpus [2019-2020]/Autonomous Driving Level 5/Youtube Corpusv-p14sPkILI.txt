 Hello CypherCon. How's it going? It is wonderful to see you all here, what a great event this is. Thank you to the whole team that worked so hard to put this together. Michel Goetzman who is in the back of the room not paying attention. And all the other folks, a round of applause, thank you. I would like to present to you a talk, it's kind of a thick piece on kind of where things are headed for our society. Where things are going headed for us as technologists. Some major changes that are going on. In this talk, there's stuff in here that's like from every day news, just brand new things. It's called "I For One Welcome our New A.I. Overlords: The Ultimate Insider in the Cloud". So how's that for a title? You're hitting all these buzzwords right? You got A.I., insider, cloud. Oh yes, that's where we're going. For those of you I haven't met, my name is Ed, I'm a hacker. (Hi Ed) I have a company called Counter Hack. Counter Hack does penetration testing, but we also build simulations. Maybe you're familiar with some of them, we do Net Wars. Anybody here do Net Wars? As this my team they say. Cyber City? Well that's wonderful. That's my team that builds all that stuff. I'm a pen tester, I'm an instructor with the SANS Institute. I'm also heading up a new thing we're doing it SANS on team-based training. Where people will learn how to participate in highly technical things working as a team, because let's face it, you don't fight alone, we all fight as part of our teams. And I'm a father and kind of a weirdo. So, does anybody know where the title of this talk comes from? I for one... The Simpsons, yes. Do you remember that?The Sim... I for one welcome our new robot overlords. Well let's, let's take a look. I'll play this video for you and I hope we got the audio up enough that you can hear it. So here we go. [Kent Brockman from the Simpsons talking] We're just about to get our first pictures from inside the spacecraft with averagenot Homer Simpson. And we'd like, AGGGGHHH. Ladies and gentlemen, we've just lost the picture. [Ed Skoudis] To give you some context, what happened is Homer Simpson goes up as a an average person on a spaceship that's orbiting the planet and along with him are these, this colony of tiny little ants. Now, Homer being Homer, wants these potato chips in zero gravity. And he does, but he accidentally smashes into the tiny ant colony. So the ants start floating around. And you just saw, an ant floated right up by the camera, causing Kent Brockman to think it is a mutant race of giant ants. Mayhem ensues. [Kent Brockman] But what we've seen speaks for itself. The spacecraft has been apparently taken over, conquered if you will by a master race of giant space ants. It's difficult to tell from this vantage point weather they will consume the captive Earth men or merely enslave them. [Ed Skoudis] So this is a really, I have an amazing example now. If you consider all the stuff that comes out in the news today, right? There'll be some sort of half story next thing you know the news is doing all kinds of detailed analysis of where this is headed and all this kind of stuff. The Simpsons had fake news 20 years ago. [Kent Brockman] One thing is for certain, there is no stopping them, the ants will soon be here. And I for one welcome our new insect overlords. I'd like to remind them as a trusted TV personality I can be helpful in the running of others to toil around in their underground sugar caves. [Ed Skoudis] Seems legit, right? So I for one welcome our A.I. overlords. I know we're recording this and I just want you to know I'm here for you. I can help round these people up so they can toil for you in your underground sugar caves. So with that said, let's, let's start out by talking about the cloud and cloud based data storage. I'll move into A.I. and privacy applications. Building on top of this. So Amazon S3 buckets. Anybody here using Amazon S3 buckets in their structure? Yeah a lot of people are. I imagined you would. Microsoft Azure cloud storage? Some folks too? Wow just as many. Interesting, interesting. Um and then Google Cloud Storage? Anybody using that? Okay yeah, very, very good. These are, these are amazing, amazing infrastructures. Really quite incredible. You could store hundreds or thousands of terabytes quite affordably. What could possibly go wrong? Well, in cloud based data breaches we've had some big issues. In the last two years there's been a huge flurry of cloud based data breeches that are entirely associated with just taking some sets of data, putting it into maybe say an S3 bucket and not properly marketing it as private, and exposing that to the entire internet. So people are trolling around looking to find these kinds of things. Back in October 2016 did you see this one it was a breach of Hoover so what happened there is some attackers hacked into a github account associated with some uber developers from there they grabbed some credentials that keep some access to others s3 bucket and then from there they were able to access 5757 million records for passengers and drivers very next month in September 2017 United States Army exposed to 100 gigabytes of very sensitive military data just by putting it in a public Amazon s3 bucket and focused on Amazon s3 buckets here because primarily the breach activity we see has been on that in February 2018 bombo's over by Federal Express expose 119,000 scanned drivers licenses oh that's interesting and then it was just reported a couple days ago Facebook data from an organization called cultura collective I had an s3 bucket it was marked as public for 540 million users exposed now this is stuff that was not sensitive it was just in their normal Facebook beats but all of their comments all of their lights all of their profiles right they're all sort of in multi terabyte file for 550 million users I get access to it we just go to a public s3 bucket and you could have been yours hmm Wow so most of this like I said it is due to miss configuration that's it now let's just say hypothetically speaking you're the richest person in the world ok and a bunch of people are finding miss configurations associated with one of the products that you offer that's kind of bad for your brand that kind of hurts that doesn't look so good so we know anybody you spend money yes you spend money to try to fix the problem so you buy other companies that are doing kind of this kind of thing to help protect this stuff at scale security in the hard security and security the cloud security is hard right I mean we know that we all work trying as hard as we can to secure things and doing it at cloud scale is really hard but there are some unique aspects of the cloud that we might be able to leverage to actually turn the tide in the favor of cyber defenders multi-tenancy specifically so an attack against your bucket might actually be able to tip things off so that we can defend my bucket appropriately you see there's lots of information to determine what normal aspects of access are so we can look for deviations from the norm and the AV guy 370 I'm sorry I apologize all right so the point here is your detection of anomalies in your environment becomes my prevention or at least it feeds my prevention this is fantastic oh and we have a bunch of big very rich companies I mean we live in a Gilded Age of high-tech companies right very rich companies with lots of a guy's smarts artificial intelligence that they can roll into helping us solve the problem so there are three specific cloud providers I want to focus on for this time there are many other cloud providers I understand if you work for one of them I offend you but here are three of the biggest and these are the ones that are spending some money on AI to try to defend in the cloud I'd like to go through each of their offerings and kind of compare and contrast I'm gonna talk about Amazon Macy Microsoft is your threat detection Google Google clouds a data loss prevention API so let's look at each one of those three the first examines I may see anybody here using Amazon may see many of you said you're using this three buckets so you haven't put the switch on that one yet well let's talk about what it is it goes through your native you configure it in your Amazon account and it'll start combing through your data looking for what it thinks is your most sensitive data it is applying machine learning and AI to try to find way to things you should care most about and it won't label it as such for you it's looking for PD is looking for intellectual property that uses Amazon's Cloud Watch thank you for them amazon's cloud watch to look for anomalous access to what your most sensitive data is think about this our overlords they comb through your data because you can't comb through it there's just way too much of it and tries to find was the most sensitive data finger and it will monitor access of it for you I find the pricing models of the three different offerings I'm going to describe to you one for Amazon one for myself and one for Google are fascinating because they illustrate the mindset of I think each of these companies for Amazon may see the prices five dollars per gigabyte of data protected plus four dollars for 100,000 events analyzed so notice the pricing month is based on the Danian you'll see that Microsoft and Google's are not based on the data it's based on the day how much name you got how many events to be looking all right here's some more on Amazon may see some of the logs and it generates you can see access events and what is happening inside the environment also you see automated alerts saying he's somebody granted rights to everyone on this you might not want that right that kind of thing cool let's look at Microsoft in Microsoft does your sequel database there at detection it uses machine learning on cloud bases Microsoft sequel server instances to look for anomalous access it's looking for things like the tags you know like a sequel injection anomalous queries it determines what is normal access for your given set of sequel server databases and looks for deviations from that norm pretty cool the price is $15 per database in other words this pricing model looks like it came from a company that is used to writing software for databases and selling software for databases so it charges you per database not surprising comes from it--your something right there not and then we have Google's data loss prevention API again using machine learning to look for strange flows of data inside Google's own environment it looks for context clues to identify 70 types of very specific kind of personally identifiable information Social Security numbers driver's license numbers credit card numbers and more you integrate it within your own applications that you build on top of Google so the pricing model here is really complicated I don't have a long time to do this talk here I think anybody half hour to go through their pricing model which kind of like this has proved more anxious either they give it away for free or so complicated you won't understand it but yokas cheap enough so everything just works out right the pricing model is based on inspection units and transformation units and you make API calls into them they give you 10 DP units for free and after that it's 30 cents per keeping unit so how often in calling the API this model looks like it was created by a software as a service provider who wants you to use their API so they're gonna charge you based on API calls so notice the three miles and the sign is charging based on data Microsoft is charging your based on database servers which is kind of interesting way to do it and then Google space it on API calls that you make each kind of fits into where you think they're coming from I mean with respect to what I think actually what we're trying to protect I think Amazon smart donate interesting this but I think Amazon smile try to protect data I mean also they didn't today I don't care how many databases my data is in and we even want to think about databases when I go to the cloud right I'm in the cloud for a reason but anyway those are those three four months all apply machine learning all applying ai to look for animals access notice though they've only Amazon's is focused on helping you identify where your most sensitive data is it's crawling through all of your data so let's think about that so anti tolls are analyzing your data determine what should be important to you and they're helping monitoring to see what support team getting visibility into whether the access is an element that was but what if your business competes with Amazon and you might say well we don't compete with Amazon are you sure and also you should say oh we don't compete with Amazon yet right because and the Sun is moving here so many business a look inside we've got Netflix right Netflix has built itself they're increasing trying to wean themselves off of the AWS infrastructure but Amazon Netflix built itself on the AWS infrastructure and we build stuff on AWS in my own company and how they have Travis 2015 ethic is running on AWS it's fantastic it's wonderful but do you compete with them if you're in the retail space you compete with Amazon and thanks probably also use them as this review distribution model too and if you're in other spaces I mean you see Amazon's and Whole Foods right so there's a grocery that's a form of retail but they're also getting increasingly into they're exploring doing things like pharmaceuticals so that's interesting so if you do pharmaceuticals they might get distribution channel for you and a competitor at the same time and Sun is moving so aggressively to so many different businesses who's to say whether you compete with them now or you're going to compete with them in the future if you're what my other probably pretty good and I'd like to show you this tweet anybody here familiar with the Twitter account of Goldman Sachs elevator think we've seen that it's it's a pain account of this person who he doesn't really work the goldman sachs but he imagines if you're in the elevator a goldman sachs is very big very rich coming what might you over here in the other bin it's hilarious occasionally it's not safe for work so you know but what i'm going to show you is it safe for life work on this tweet what i saw them like yes exactly thinking about amazon where it's headed you ready if Amazon is in your line of business sound now if Amazon it's not your line of business sell now your business sucks there you go noise Amazon's moving into everybody's business if it's any good if it's not enjoy your 3% profit margins okay or if they do enter into your business they're going to squeeze your profit margins down even further so a way to think about the big four companies that are providing these machine language serve the machine learning services along with a nine so forth mix thing I saw this fantastic article I created this visualization of this article was written by Scott Galloway who's a professor NYU and it helps me to think about the different companies cuz there's the big four and I'll go for what before are in just a minute but the big four companies that provide this kind of stuff it helps you sort them out based on the different models that they have and the different things that they're appealing to him so we'll start with this Google Google's your brain or your mind is what you think about what you want to learn about what where your kind of mind is going that's that's Google right have you put that stuff into their search engine and it learns about you and customizes its results based on what's in your mind fair enough Facebook is your heart right it's how you communicate with your mom or your dad or grandma or grandpa it's it's how you communicate maybe with your siblings and certainly your friends want to see what they're up to it's your heart Adamson's your belly it's the thing that you need the feeds the things that's all we need as I would buy this and Amazon doesn't want put anything between you and your ability to fill your belly or your desires one-click shopping that's like crap right I would say we had for so long around first you know they're like one thing shopping seriously and that was like if you don't take one-click shopping you're you're offended you go to some retailer that's not Amazon you say I gotta click a couple of buttons or heaven forbid solve a CAPTCHA before I buy something Japanese oh it's not gonna be you song captured before you buy something he wants to be as close to your belly and your wallet as possible so these are three of the big four Google is your brain Facebook is your heart Amazon is your belly and who's the fourth just isolate responding movies going Apple according to Scott Galloway is your sensuality it's the thing that defines sexiness and technology for you guys I'll use another say now maybe nobody down or I use some other event it's like that's fine in other words you're buying the stuff that look like emilie's products did two years ago right so it was apples defining what looks sexy from a technology perspective you might not be paying the Apple tax but it used to finding what that is in pushing that forward Jonathan I and in all the folks doing that so it's a way to think about the big four and if you think about that before each of these employees machine learning and artificial intelligence to provide a series of services to you right I mean we obviously have Google home Facebook it's analyzing everything you do to try to make sure you spend more time on Facebook right Amazon analyzing everything that you purchase and all your your activities there and then you have we called her Alice in my office because if we say amvx eighty word we were spelling in themself the oh hey Alexa I can say that right she she triggers so in my office because I have some of these devices we always say Alice we were not trying to summon syrup right just paid Alice Alice I think let's do a little survey here before you to Apple Apple of course has its series technology but just seeing how many of you guys have how many of these devices and beyond the spanis about this how many people here have at least one google home device reject at one google oh okay keep your hand up if this applies how many have at least two three or okay if there's been enhanced level 5 so 5 so yeah there's couple that had three four than 105 anybody more than okay let's let's pump up let's go to Alice Alexa how many people have at least one echo device in their home I'm having him at least two it looks like I might hand out this how many three or four or five or more down a floor six seven all right so we got a couple of sixes in a seven you wait Sarah where you lose it you see where this is going hi and now Siri this thing is serious built-in to your phone's right they look like you have Alice on my phone - I didn't count that but if you count Syria naval devices for which you actually use Siri okay I'm not say oh you know my kids have you know an iPad or something like that happen that they have a new serie don't come back how many people actively Siri on at least one of us two three four five yeah I'm about four or five on that whose name yeah okay go over so we're into this we are we're technologists it's interesting technology and it's way to think about the business for now do you trust these companies and their artificial intelligence in their sleep oh no and anyway here's the time okay so let me just show you some photos just random photos I managed to collect here and there ah this photo does they paid off this is sundar pichai yes and what is it I'm sort of trying to do he's the CEO CEO of alphabet right we shan't have Chrome's this little company called Google that's right does anybody know what this this still is taken from this movie oh then leapt out of Google yeah I was last year this video leaked that was put on a breadboard comment but then it made its problems throughout everything this was some done within a couple of days of the 2016 election it was Google's senior management talking about what it is that happened how their platform was used how unhappy they were with how their platform was used it association with the election and how they said they're going to make sure that that will never happen again interesting video next we know this person is it's not commander data Australia this is mr. Mark Zuckerberg anybody know where this still is taken from their congressional hearings which was right do you notice that every two or three years sometimes even more often gets called up to testify for congress and apologize that his entire career is apologizing for privacy violations from the very start from before Facebook itself was created right so this is him a year ago he was also up there couple weeks ago right but a year ago he was apologizing for the Cambridge analytic disclosure that was only a year ago it seems so long them do you remember what happened I'm gonna get into a little bit more detail later yes there's old and all that but it was done I mean they so apparently they tried according to the head of the the person who's in charge the project at Cato gentleman ago they tried to shock their technology for doing very detailed analysis of social networking graphs and likes and dislikes all that kind of stuff they tried shopping around primarily to Democrats in the 2016 election and Duncan said no we got this I mean we've got a bunch engineers from Google that are helping us we don't need that your small company you never heard of you and they're like okay so I went to the Trump campaign and said you want us to use this they're like well how much okay you never know if I'm any buzz let's try it so they tried it and they found all kinds of very interesting correlations and analysis and so forth and this all came out in March of 2018 just a little over a year ago of how they were able to do data analytics based on likes and dislikes to be able to understand correlations that maybe from a human perspective don't make sense but politicians can use them they've got all kinds of weird stuff they found out that you liked Nike shoes I'm just telling what their corner if you like Nike shoes there was an increased possibility that you would have also liked the expression I need Israel what why what is it and the positions don't care who cares because all they care about is they might want you to know I'm gonna put stuff in your timeline that says you should go up oh and if I don't watch it because you disapprove under some new timeline says you should know another correlation they found very similar one if you like KitKat bars you were more likely to like the I hate Israel ie what what is it with KitKat bars all that looking for is correlation they don't care why it doesn't have anything other than they're trying to determine do we want these people who vote or do we not about these people to vote and then we'll spend money trying to get people to vote or not to vote it's crazy so he's up there trying to explain this to our congressmen representatives Wow and then finally this one simply no mismanage allude to earlier let's say you're the richest person in the world yes this is Jeff Bezos showing up at a meeting about a year year and a half ago of tech titans and it seems that Jeff has been bumping up a little bit lately he's looking pretty fine there this is before the whole divorce thing and messiness came out but it's how there is so we've got your brain we've got I'm sorry but your heart seriously and and here we got your belly what do we listen we're missing Tim Cook we're missing Apple where is your sensuality it's interesting because it's different and I'm gonna talk about why it might be different some ideas here but apples state and approach and concerns with respect to privacy are different from the other three of the big four the other three the before especially Facebook I apologize right but here's what Tim Cook said back in October so about six months ago our own information from the average age of deeply person was being weaponized against notice the word weaponized against us with military efficiency we should sugarcoat the consequences this is surveillance Apple publicly at least is trying to differentiate itself from what's happening in the other of the big four and in fact there was a hand that just came up two weeks ago did you see this the privacy it's actually kind of funny hat that says hey get privacy matters to you it matters to us to NH my phone may be a complete cynic and look at this seriously you can be cynical look at this and say the reason Apple is different from the other ones is because they're trying to sell you phones and you say and I against Macintosh's but they made their money on the phones and you look at it's the phones of all the phones alright so they're trying to sell you guys say it's pumps and other stuff too and you say well that's why I wish the other ones are actually trying to make money off of your data their business models are just very different so you can be a cynic and say well of course typical you can say that cuz you're just driving cell phones in fact it's going to help you sell phones but the other ones are actually in the data business Google Facebook right and Amazon but you can also kind of counter cynic this you can also say well maybe apples not in that business because they really don't want to be in that business what they made much money on phones but they had a bunch of data services and they haven't at least publicly had as much problem with sharing that data that they're learning about from Siri and the other services that they provide right so tech nice to look at this different forms of cynicism you could take but I'm just here to say at least publicly speaking Apple is different from the other three so the weaponization of a day let's think more about that and I've had some specific examples here October 2018 so six months ago Russian firms who built facial recognition software this was reported both clean the press crawled Facebook and took all your faces why we don't know but this is good for publicly they want to be educational recognition that's what they do so this Russian firm that does a lot of work with the Russian government now has a whole bunch hundreds of millions maybe a billion or more faces that they can use for something then of course it's at March 2018 announcement I mentioned this earlier became rich analytic this self again they walked the social graph downloaded that stuff and did correlations of all kinds of crazy weird things 2017 the Equifax breach 145 million records consumer David that's this is big big data and the kinds of analysis and analytics you can do to weaponize that to improve your own business or maybe from a national security perspective go into another country is profound and that's why I put this other one in here it's a little older 2015 OPM breach twenty two million while opening I had a breach were over 22 million government employees and contractors records were stolen these are people who have clearance and they stole not only information about their backgrounds and such which could be very embarrassing but also fingerprints they so fake every day I got friends work with government made some of you guys do too who are piece I mean see work as security professionals to the United States government and then OPM leaked their most sensitive stuff when they gave so they could have their jobs in a verge crusted area and yet they can't trust the organization of Australian data this is really bad news it's a wagon ization of big data that there is another group of organizations that collect this kind of data that we don't seem to be and these publicly is worried about you to rien press like every day or two you read something about Google or specially Facebook or Amazon privacy concerns here but in addition to those organizations government tax agencies and credit card companies are also gathering and storing this kind of data but why are we here to about too many abuses of these organizations or concerns associated with them and I think it's just because we're used to that we are in the midst of a technological revolution with the cloud machine learning and AI and that right now for many of us me included is giving us an 80 miss factors like whether the carbons have this data on your far right tax agencies credit card companies think we should purchase for the last 20 30 years but now this is a new group of organizations the other big difference I think is the new organizations that have access to this data oftentimes preach that they are there to make the world a better place you see as Mark Zuckerberg talk to us a lot how connecting people on Facebook is actually going to result in a better world a better world so so I don't think any tax agency is gonna say you we're trying to make the world a better place make sure you give us your taxes or your credit card companies they're not trying to transform humanity into the next level like Facebook is but that's what's going to stay - they're trying to bring us to the next level whatever is that we're going to be hmm interesting ah so that was a class that is taught at Princeton every year and it's a fascinating class in CIBC it's wws 353 Princeton University it's usually juniors and seniors there in the class I have gone there and done a guest lecture for the last three or four years and what this is done on this class is crazy it's science and global security from nuclear weapons to cyber warfare and artificial intelligence I do a guest lecture each year on the cyber warfare market that's where I am right but they've recently added just over the last two years AI machine learning and super intelligence as a weaponry aspect that is in this class so the weaponization of big data of machine learning I mean it's their newest class as fascinating class really really quite interesting alright so where does this all hand if you think about what does this mean to you as an individual I'd like to make this more personal now let's think about this okay I might ask you to raise your hand for this next section because it gets a little weird okay what does your AI know about you so when I say you're a guy I thought most people had their hands up earlier with Alice or if you prefer to call her Alexa or you know we call steering in my office we call her Sally because we want to trigger it constantly right we don't have Google home office we just call Google all right so those people raising it before door attorney and them okay but you know who you are and you have a technology the jury I know when you wake up maybe you send an alarm using it or can tell when you start doing your searches in the morning so we kind of know is every day you wake up at 7 a.m. or 8 or whatever it is does it know what you like to eat because it sees that you're going to these different restaurants and searching for it giggling some restaurants maybe knows the kind of food that you like mine does oh my gosh how the state has its own young yeah it must know it must know does it know where you go to work maybe he's trying to run traffic or something like that does it know where you go I have to work because you're looking it up in their maps wherever that might be right or does it know you on vacation that you should do a lot of research yeah there's a noise you like to watch on TV and in your favorite movies I heard this analogy for YouTube the other day that I thought was profound so what is YouTube first of all you guys know who owns usually right yeah no okay alphabetic flash move oh right so YouTube somebody described this to me this is about two years ago they said you know YouTube is looks like what's place I don't watch videos well that's part of it but YouTube watches you watching videos and tries to give you more videos that will keep you watching it is an artificial intelligence whose goal is to keep your eyes on that screen this is you this is not like TV of the 1950's 70s or 90s this is TV that watches you're watching it and when you turn away it learns that it made a mistake and it won't make that mistake again it is hot device to keep you sharing in that damn screen for as long as possible so you as possible and they can make money have a nice day hi so doesn't know what you like to watch the TV in your favorite movies yeah it does does it know what you search for oh I know you're gonna go in there but did you have to go yes I went there all right does it know your maladies like me feel kind of sick or you know this elbows always bothered me I kind of look that up or your dreams and a dream about something you want to do a Google search for century me am I really as weird as I think of him doesn't know your fears which worried about this it doesn't know that you thought you had this horrible disease you would die of two years ago you don't even remember that but it does yeah does it no no not the best and the worst of what goes through your mind so I decided to uh to go search on the most popular websites in the u.s. I limited to the US you can look worldwide if you look worldwide there's of this bunch in there from China and some from India to write very very large projects I just focusing on the US we always talk here there's a company called similarweb and you could go there they give you free stuff they want to sell you a service so that you can do sort of micro analysis of sites that you've never heard of it stuff like that but this is as of March 1st 2019 the 11 most popular websites from nine States's perspective and accessing them and if you look the first several of them let's just say n where we don't know exactly what n equals but the first n are all search engine related and machine learning AI systems so you got a Google everybody who's playing that's number one you two search engine rights the second profile search engine in the world YouTube is number two Facebook's number three Amazon that's number four so notice here we've got three of the top four right there in fact of the big four one of them is represented twice we got got number six is pornhub I wonder what kind of machine learning and AI they might be applying to keep you focused on their screams for as long as possible we got another adult sign another adult sigh I didn't even know these existed well there you go number six seven and eight then we got number nine is eBay number ten is Twitter exciting so just doing top ten to go to 11 this one goes to 11 if they say explain that but I wanted to get Wikipedia out there to show that pornhub dominates way overweight that's that's what we are that's what we're as a society into species and think about this each of these organizations is constantly collecting more and more data about you and using it to further its business interest okay so I add this up and what does it all mean think about it does your AI know more about you than your friends to the sherry I know more about you than your clergy does thank you it tells your Google search box maybe what did you tell them and does your hangout know more about you than your spouse does like yes yes okay does your aunt know more about you than you know about yourself I would suggest abso-freakin'-lutely it knows it remembers it knows that you thought you had that sickness a few years ago did you see they that's this new feature they wanted to add to Alice Alexa Alexa this new feature they want to add so that Jimmy could actually if you talk to her sets to see that your voice isn't quite right the sense that you might be sick you're catching a cold and then as you use Amazon they'll put little things for different cold remedies up on the screen for you isn't this wonderful it's horrifying or mine so you just read I know more about you than you know by let me think about the psychological studies I tell you I think 50 years from now a hundred years from now 20 years from now they're going to date no mining this stuff to try to understand the craziness that we're going through as a society and all kinds of very interesting things are gonna come out of this data regardless of how it is exposed but it's just going to come down they finally do share more about yourself with your ki than you do with your God mm baby ah so ubiquitous and throughout your life dear me I throughout your house I think we got people here with four or five six seven of these devices and then you can do the cumulative if you add up my seer you enable devices with my Alexa enable devices it's all over the place hey I in your car you better believe I mean Alba once AI in your car right and of course if you see that's how Amazon's announced a whole bunch of car services for Alexa they want to be in your car why because you're in your car spend a lot of time there and that times not spent looking at an Amazon screen darling we can fix that problem you're a out of your pocket you're walking around I tell you I do think Apple has really dropped the ball with Siri no offence something like I said nice things on hand earlier but a series of big disappointment I look I did a whole bunch of development some of you may have seen to talk about you know automating my office I don't like 30,000 lines of code a lot of it was Siri base and just kept screwing up too much so I move over to Alexa and it is much tighter and much more optimized it just gets stuff done in a way that Siri can't but I say that as a developer get both Lascaux systems oh so you got your guy in your pocket at some point a guy becomes effectively on the president doesn't it it's just everywhere around you I tell you I can annoying when I walk into a hotel I almost said it good night my first one across the street I wanted to say Alexa turn the lights on but she wasn't there so I know I had that I didn't touch a switch these things who discussed the switch before me it's terrible it's terrible and as this AI learns more more about you and the world around you in addition to being omnipresent it will seem effectively cognition except for Siri she wasn't on our way there but Alice you walk in say Alexa let there be light and there is well not the hotel across the street but in my home there is scary isn't my buddy rod Natalie tweeted this about six months ago I'll let you just check it out think about that infant for those who can't see the battle arena my son said his first words today and they were he Google I have an awful parent this is not our future this is our now that child for that child Google is on the present and knows everything from that child from the very start this is the world we've created and notice I haven't been mentioned Elon Musk or killer AI robots shooting things are the Terminator I'm talking about AI machine learning they data and the rapid loss of privacy and the organization of big data to turn you into a product there's a wonderful saying it's powerful if you can't tell what the product is and if you're not paying for the product the product is you the product is you all right so I want you to do about this just a spare run move to okay now there are some things you need to be careful when the data that you share my recommendation to you is and I try to demonstrate his talk try to personify the a is that you interact with once think of Alexa not as a machine as a person because maybe you'll be less likely to tell her things you shouldn't tell her right or that Google search box think of sundar Pichai on the other side and a Google search box trying to sell you some services and things like that think of Mark Zuckerberg reading everything you type in to Facebook and I'm trying to personify this with a hope of it will make you a little more circumspect and a little more careful as you interact with these services okay you can also use alternative providers DuckDuckGo vein or other right I try this I tried to use DuckDuckGo which has been the practice policies on my phone for I did it for about six months thank you know my computer because on my computer I need professional-grade search which means Google but I tried duck taco and he just wasn't giving me what I needed on my home so I switched to babe yeah I switch today there you go yeah yeah it's been another three four months on that little antsy oh but there's other videos you could do video might show this presentation my son is 17 years old he's like that no the fact is penis doesn't have as much content as YouTube on any male there's numerous providers for email that you could go to but most organizations and a lot of individuals just go to Gmail because it's convenient you should also support vendors who respect to privacy and widows Adamo now what about unplugging from social media you could try you could and I think some healthy things for kids especially teenage kids to get off of social media every once in a while I mean we grounded my son emissions we grounded my son once this was about two years ago and we took this social me away from him he's 17 now so he's 15 at the time for one week I have never seen somebody fall apart they have monitor he's a wonderful boy he's amazing it's incredible but it was like even then you do for us - just like punch him in the face really hard much less painful so you see there's many American people who try to unplug from Google just Google and all of its services to all this infrastructure that I actually implement like DNS black hole inside should they try to block the 25 million IP addresses that are associated with Google and all all of its names that are associated with this various products and they see the internet kind of dissolve it's just like this messed up little kind of stuff internet thing it's hard it's hard but build your awareness
