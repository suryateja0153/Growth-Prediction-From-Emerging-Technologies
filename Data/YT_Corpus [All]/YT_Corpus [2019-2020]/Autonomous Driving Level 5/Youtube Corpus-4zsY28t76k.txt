 Hey Mercedes! How may I help you? Is everything alright at home? Let me have a look. The light in the living room is turned on. Do you want me to turn it off? Yes, please. Hey Mercedes! How can I help? I am so annoyed today. Then do things that don’t annoy you. Call Thomas. I’m calling Thomas on the private number. Accept.
