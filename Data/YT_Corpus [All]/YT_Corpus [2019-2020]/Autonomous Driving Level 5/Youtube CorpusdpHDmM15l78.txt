 Assalamualaikum and greetings. In the previous video, we have looked at autonomous driving How technology will change the car definition and the competitions between automotive companies In this video, I want to discuss in depth Autonomous Driving Technology If we look at autonomous driving technology, It is the combination of several technologies that I have shared in the previous video, right? Among the important components of technology First, is camera Camera is used to detect every object, human and movement Camera is a sensor that detects visible light It cannot detect for instance, fog or dust So usually, they will use ultrasound or radar And one more they use laser beam It is called Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) Radar technology like ultrasound and also Lidar basically can detect direction and distance This Lidar, if we look at autonomous driving we can see moving object on top of the car Most companies use Lidar It shoots laser the laser reflection will map Unlike the normal laser, it is only 2D right data can only detect distances But it can be in 3D in a very short time in microsec, microseconds it creates a 3D mapping around the car So in a car, they combine radars different types of radars short-range radar, long-range radar, ultrasound, Lidar and camera These combinations will give a lot of information to the car and the car will process it and try to understand the condition of the car and from the data it will predict and will try to control this is the part that detects but it has other elements One of the important elements is communication The information gathered will be sent to server and one more if we look at developed countries like the United States, Europe, Japan and Australia They have Vehicle-To-Vehicle Communication (V2V) It started in the United States It is like Wi-fi protocol but between cars and every continent has its frequency range with a slight difference Basically, its protocol is called Dedicated Short-range Communication (DSRC) So they will send information It is now still in the early stage So they don't send much information It said that the future has a lot of information For example, when we press the brake or drive around a corner and then angle handling There are a lot and this thing is evolving now Time to time we have more information that is communicated between cars Of course this information will be encrypted which means it cannot be simply accessed and it won't reveal personal information Now it is mostly used in alerting But like I said before if it is radar technology technology that is used to detect mapping car to car element will give new revolution If we watched Naruto Rinnegan, one of Akatsuki's friends, has special eyes He can see everything He can see everything in proxy from different angles So the same thing will happen As humans we can only see things in our surroundings We are not able to see two steps or three steps Imagine all of the cars as a network They will detect and share information like in the network and for instance, if they export they will share everything We have AI that can see from the top as a whole Imagine algorithms, Imagine what we can do with this data There are many things that we can accomplish For example, to prevent accidents and how to be efficient How to avoid traffic How to drive with optimum energy So these things can be planned It is said that 81% accidents on the road are caused by human errors If we gather all of the aforementioned technologies Lidar camera inserted into AI and we combine with V2V and future 5G Information can be sent 5G will speed up the data we can send data almost in real time, big data and least delay When we have 5G technology We can send more information to the server and request for cloud server Cloud computing helps to plan as a whole Not only for our car but for the whole community This thing will revolutionize I want everyone to understand that autonomous driving is not automated only one driver in a car It tries to optimize one community in the area and if we have 5G technology we are able to do it in remote which means it is in autonomous mode and there are places that AI cannot do anything for instance, We can use this 5G, accessed in our vehicle and maybe the operator like call centre drives by using simulator and the truck will follow or the car will follow so this thing, the experiment is being conducted and will be realised soon We have seen hardware technology such as sensor So what is happening now is the level of data collection We see how Google, Amazon, Facebook They became giant companies because of the amount of data This is happening in autonomous driving If we look at top five companies in autonomous driving The are top five because they have a lot of data They are competing In terms of algorithms deep learning, sensor has differences between companies differences in business strategies But basically, the one that is leading now is Waymo owned by Alphabet, the parent company of Google They have conducted many road testing, real driving and they have conducted simulations for autonomous driving in the simulation world of autonomous driving In these two combinations, Waymo is leading Google is leading in their driving experience They said their experience in driving in the real road is 32 million km In 32 million km, they have given experience to the cars They are collecting data and in the world of simulation they have reached 16 billion km These data will be analysed by AI and they will learn how to drive and Cruise is among the famous companies It began as a startup company operating independently Now General Motor (GM) has invested billions to them They have driven more than 1.6 million km But GM has bought them so 180 vehicles are undergoing road testing Now it is called GM Cruise Another famous company is Argo AI Ford has invested in Argo AI If I am not mistaken, $1 billion It is expanding Ford is experimenting in the United States If we notice, outside companies like GM, Ford they use open innovation concept They don't invest directly The look for prosperous start up company and they will invest and absorb in the company if we compare between companies like Toyota, Honda, the Japanese companies They are close innovation They have their own team their own partners and vendors It is said that Japanese companies are delayed excluding Nissan Nissan absorbs from outside companies They delayed due to this problem Small companies like startup companies They are fast They don't know how to manufacture cars but they focus on algorithms and with insufficient information How to produce good results? This is the advantage of startup They are very quick and agile Easy to move compared to big companies They have lots of things to decide Even though we talk about autonomous driving they also have to think about hardware So there will be conflicts in the company in the groups that will delay decision making process and will delay the starting process Of course this thing will not end now I think this competition will persist But for now, technology companies that have started, they are faster they are leading Even Tesla, we have talked in the previous video Tesla is the coolest in this area But it doesn't mean now they lead in algorithms because they are currently doing many other things But they are in the top five Their autonomous driving. Powerful One interesting fact is, Elon Musk dislikes Lidar He said Lidar is impractical because of its high costs if we want to implement it in cars He combined radar with camera He used deep learning to cover Lidar This is the direction that Tesla is taking in autonomous driving Tesla has inserted chips for autonomous driving in all of its cars now What will happen? All cars like I said before, the last thing is data If we look at Waymo Although they have run many road testings, they have many AI But in the end, who will win? Those who collect a lot of data will thrive Tesla's strategy, they have inserted chips that can update like our computer our software, Windows update We can update it online right? All of TESLA cars can update their auto-pilot and they can collect data If we can imagine, How many billion hours when there are many Tesla cars They can collect a lot of data definitely more than Waymo because they are car manufacturers There are 600,000 Tesla cars on the road If they collect data now, around 3.2 billion km data is equivalent to 2 billion miles It is said they are the first to arrive Like I said in the previous video, Not all developing countries use this car But in terms of developed countries, I think they will gather more data and valid so if we look, car manufacturers have chances to win because they specialise in manufacturing If they ignore, Perhaps, Waymo or others will license and they have to use it But in terms of data, like Toyota or Honda Toyota cars are everywhere in Asia If they create one unit to gather data This data can be put in deep learning And perhaps they can win because there is no algorithms the noticeable algorithms In the end, they must use deep learning But how they design and use AI requires a lot of data Data is king There are chances for automotive companies to win Another company that I want to highlight is Baidu Baidu is in China running big experiments It is said that it has 300 cars It has 3 million km actual experience in real driving China is good in terms of its policy Developed countries have their own hurdles the government China is easier to experiment But experience-wise is still inadequate as compared to Tesla We cannot say much about competition But in the end, all of them will share the knowledge Each company will try to reengineering and create another platform that can reach level 5 Apart from the five companies that I've shared I think there are lots of startup companies that challenge because they still have rooms to monetize the technology If we look at Zoox Zoox is interesting They are creating autonomous technology for all types of cars They are not based only for one company They can drive any cars when sensors are put They try to make their own cars Their technology is not bad compared to the aforementioned companies They are coming on how to adapt compared to other companies like Tesla They put sensors only for their cars There is a strategy by Nuro Their focus is on carrying items Small cars to deliver items That is their focus The strategies are there and other companies if we see still competing and trying to seize the opportunity, Golden chance, right? One more, I want to introduce about Autoware Foundation or is also called Autoware.AI founded by Shinpei Kato started in Nagoya University, Japan It is said that Toyota, Huawei, many people collaborate in this project What is interesting about Autoware They are open source it's like Linux, it provides an open source like an operating system for autonomous driving not only for cars the concept can be applied on drones, lorries This is interesting Those who want to do research in this area we have a platform that we can use openly Members of this foundation have the privileges For example in Malaysia if Proton or Perodua wants to do it maybe they can use this kind of platform and improve to be their own product It facilitates all researchers worldwide for research and improvement Autoware is very interesting If we look at their video they provide examples Even Lexus conducted experiments with them There is another way for countries even like Malaysia if we want to try I think, why not, right? for those who are interested can go to their website can try and make their own autonomous vehicles So how was this video? I hope we can see the picture of autonomous In the previous video, we can see it from the outside as a whole in general how they will change This time, I am more technical and how will cars change when we have autonomous driving How will it change the world landscape So we will see new thing and this thing in ten years time, we will see and 5G will speed it up Let see how it goes How we can make it beneficial or maybe it will disrupt the industry in our country and the world Okay, this is it for this video We will continue in the next video I will talk about connected car including other sensors How these things will change service and car usage Assalamualaikum and greetings
