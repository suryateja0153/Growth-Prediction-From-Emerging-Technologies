 This slidedeck is about futuretech – technology that changes our lives and everything else on the planet. Where do we come from So our planet is approximately 4.5 billion years old Humans are a relatively young phenomenon The first homo sapiens appeared only 200'000 year ago The first civilizations we know of were established around 6000 years ago What we call technology today started with the invention of the steam engine only approximately 250 years ago And what we call high tech is not even 50 years old The first commercial microprocessor – the basis for our digital age – was produced in 1971 by Intel Everything interesting technology-wise has only happened in the last few decades We can put this on a timeline We see the clear blue line indicating the size of the human population on earth over time The darker blue line shows available computing power Both lines are on an exponential trajectory today Since the middle ages our advances in sanitary and healthcare infrastructure have allowed for a fast population growth With a larger population labor division and specialization was possible So our smartest brains could invent things instead of having to grow or hunt food We eventually invented computing And then we invented transistors that allow to scale computing We went from zero calculations per second to roughly ten billion calculations per second per a thousand USD invested today We went from stone age to interplanetar age within 5'000 years. The world population is projected to reach 11 billion by 2100 That is in 80 years from now Population growth then is expected to stall, and eventually fall But technology growth is not If technology continues to scale at this rate we will reach computing power equivalence of one human in 2023 and we will reach computing power equivalence of all humans by 2055 The singularity university - where this slide is from - calls this the singularity It's the point in time when technology is more intelligent than we humans meaning more intelligent than all humans together There are a number of different predictions for the singularity the median of those predictions is the year 2045 I call this techtech – because it is a positive feedback loop The more technology we already have the more new or faster technology we can create And the more computing power we have the more everything else also gets digitized – All sectors of our economies and societies as we can observe today Technology adoption rates nicely illustrate this fact It took 68 years for airlines to get to 50 million users And it took certain services in recent years only weeks to get to 50 million users As technology drives acceleration and powers everything – Technology also outperforms every other sector finance-wise Today among the ten largest companies on the planet 7 are tech companies and some of them are not even 20 years old Where are we going from here We are on an exponential trajectory Some changes are closer than they appear Technology has a profound impact on our human evolution Today we talk about chip implants and brain implants (for example to address certain diseases) And there are already robot toys. Like this one We could soon have robot boyfriends or girlfriends for that matter Eventually we could transform ourselves into cyborgs? We already have prosthetic limbs and exoskeletons today Looking at spacetech and future inter-planetar or even inter-stellar travel it starts making sense to look at cyborgization options Travels in space will be long, and conditions tend to be unfriendly to the human body that is adapted to living on this planet, but not in outer space Our technology has one big weakness – All of it runs on electricity Longer blackouts can get us back into stone age Without electricity you can't withdraw cash, you can't refuel, you can't make phone calls Nothing is mechanical anymore nowadays Nothing works without electricity to power it The ubiquitous digitization we have today was made possible because computing power costs almost nothing anymore A similar development is happening to the energy price Not for oil & gas But for renewable energy like wind and specifically solar The price for solar power is steadily decreasing and will eventually go to almost zero until 2050 If we are able to produce energy at almost zero cost we can automate everything at almost no cost We can automate all of our industrial and agricultural production with robotics, drones, artificial intelligence, and 3D printing, in a decentralized way Eventually we will be able to do nanofabrication (that is 3D printing on a molecular scale) If everything can be produced in an automated way at almost no cost why does anyone need to work for food It will make us rethink how we organize our societal and economic systems when work is scarce and food is abundant In order to make automation work, we need to fix the resource consumption problem and be-come circular Our global resource consumption at the current level of inefficiency is not sustainable The next 30 years will determine if we can secure our long term survival on this planet And I believe that technology, or specifically what I call #futuretech will play the key role in transforming humanity into a sustainable life form on this planet There are three main areas we need to fix Industry and infrastructure must become circular, at best waste-free, resource efficient, and automated The Biosphere must be cleaned up from the pollution and the harm we have caused We need to reforestate in large dimensions We need to update our agricultural production to sustainable, circular and automated And we will need to rethink our societal and economic structures to act in favor of us humans and not at our cost Here are the eight areas where most change through technology is taking place There is a "yet unsolved" space – things that are practically unsolved, but not theoretically im-possible Advances in science will eventually get us there We need to solve the energy problem – Everything we run consumes energy And this energy needs to come from renewable sources In energy efficiency and storage one thing to look at is Graphene – a nanomaterial made from Carbon that has outstanding properties Specifically in regard to electrical conductivity – it could eventually provide us with high tem-perature superconductivity And Graphene allows for high capacity energy storage - it could be the material for superior batteries replacing lithium ion based products Off grid boxes are now available – self sufficient energy production units – that allow to decentralize our energy systems and make our digital world more robust The energy out of thin air approach is looking to turn CO2 directly back to fuel by way of atmospheric energy harvesters, bioinspired light-escalated chemistry, artificial pho-tosynthesis or hydrothermal carbonization A number of promising startups have emerged in this field It will eventually make us independent from oil and gas We need to implement circular economy solutions – to stop polluting the planet further and clean it up again Specifically we need to address the plastic pollution that is disastrous for the biosphere Nanofabricators could make us incredibly resource efficient Imagine you could break down any material into its atomic or molecular components, and re-use those to "3d print" matter on a molecular basis Already in operation are technologies that capitalize on biological organisms to break down waste, specifically plastics We have new waste-to-energy solutions to re-use waste as fuels And we now have nano-coatings that clean the air The other crucial measure in fighting the plastic pollution is making plastics from biodegradea-ble sources such as seaweed, hemp or other organic origins There are a lot of startups are active in this field And also established manufacturers like Lego have started rolling out biodegradeables Housing is becoming sustainable, recyclable, and self-sufficient Housing is becoming sustainable, recyclable, and self-sufficient The biggest changes ahead come from automation – Technology will manage our lives and do our work. Artificial intelligence, Internet of things, digital assistants are now rolled out not only for the au-tomation of transaction tasks but also for the automation of interaction tasks – A domain previously thought of requiring unique human capabilities Industrial production is on the way to be fully robotized, agricultural production is being auto-mated with robots and drones 3D printing is now able to print metals, and on the large scale print floors, walls and roofs for buildings Quantum computing may still be in its infancy But Quantum computing is by way of its nature closer to human information processing than is classical computing So we will eventually see the development of general artificial intelligence running on quantum computers Coming in the next years are fully autonomous cars and autonomous transport and logistics as extension to autonomous industrial production We finally have flying cars – in the form of autonomous passenger drones With no flying skills required Large automotive players are venturing in the field Another development to make air travel sustainable is the concept of electric aircrafts, like from eviation NASA and specifically China are working on a technology called the "warp drive" It's an electromagnetic drive, based on electromagnetic propulsion of ions or plasma It allows to accelerate spacecrafts to higher speeds and will make interplanetar travel faster and interstellar travel possible A number of companies are building reusable rockets, and space drones There are plans to harvest energy from stars, and natural resources or rather space resources from asteroids and planets We will eventually build nations in space, and settlements on other planets Food and food production is one of the largest causes for CO2 emissions on the planet We have now the possibility to capture CO2 and turn it into proteins with microorganisms Other approaches venture into clean and plant-based foods – to avoid the emissions from classical meat production Biosphere restoration efforts make deserted land green again, and reforestate large landscapes Our cities become greener through vertical farming Water from thin air approaches make fresh water abundant, and add to the rebuilding and restoration of natural ecosystems This may be the most controversial area – human health and human upgrades – to counteract natural selection failure Genetic editing is not the domain of research labs anymore You can order a set online and hack your DNA You can order a set online and hack your DNA A direct interface to the mind is under development – to extend human information processing with direct access to technological information processing – and eventually provide our minds with a direct interface to artificial intelligence Cyborgization in the form of synthetic organs, bionic limbs and chip implants provide solutions for dysfunctional physics and also extend the human body with new capabilities Delayed aging sees a great number of entities doing research with a large amount of funding Once you are rich, you don't want to die The most underused resource on the planet is human talent We need to fix access to education and implement ways to make better use of talent Education is becoming ubiquitous thanks to high level online universities and institutes Universal Basic Income is discussed and tested Despite the common belief that it makes people lazy, tests show that quite the opposite is true People who do not have to worry if there will be food on the table, start taking care of others and their environment – there is more collaboration and more happiness We will eventually see societal transaction systems based on blockchain technologies for the exchange of goods and services, without the need for gatekeepers Alternative systems and jurisdictions are being built around the globe, to test new forms of so-cietal and economic organization for the planet, not at the cost of it Today, for the first time in the known human history on this planet we have enough food, technology and resources to feed, support and evolve everyone yet it is not happening we are just incredibly badly organized we need to rethink the way we manage this planet and - it is possible.
