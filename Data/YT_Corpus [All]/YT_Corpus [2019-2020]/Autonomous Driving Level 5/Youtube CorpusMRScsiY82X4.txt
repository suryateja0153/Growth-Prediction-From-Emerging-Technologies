 this is a special episode of tibet davinci brought  to you commercial free and it is a full hands-on   look at the tesla full self-driving beta so  before we begin i want to get a quick moment   and say thank you to all of our patrons on patreon  if you want to see more videos like this and you   want to be a rockstar supporter of the show  consider supporting us on patreon or if you   are interested in buying a tesla car tesla solar  or a powerwall we would love it if you could use   our link because then maybe we'll get invited to  future betas and other cool events and everything   else also a huge shout out to tesla raj who was a  great pleasure to meet so if you haven't already   check out his youtube channel with the link in the  description all right so this is our little first   look at the uh full self-driving beta by the way  uh raj if you do me a favor and email uh elon musk   i want this new ui can you make that happen isn't  it it really is look at this door watch it open   what it's just oh wait and watch this see the  window oh yeah even the back windows goes down   wow it's beautiful it's absolutely a beautiful  ui it is so i'm not going to get this then if   i don't have fsd right this is right now this  is just for fsd bait but who knows maybe this   might be a christmas gift for the next christmas  release yeah looks like they made that area a   little bigger yeah interesting you'll see a lot of  cool things as we go on a drive uh what's changed   what's uh part of this fsd beta let's just go over  here and it's somebody's address i have no idea   but we just go navigate it's 1.2 miles away now  currently we're in a park parking lot parking lots   it's not really accounted for so what i'm going to  do is i'm going to drive towards the exit and then   i'm going to kick it on um parking lots is give or  take right there's a reverse summon that's coming   and so that will will that gives you the ability  to auto park your car but for right now we're   going to do that and you'll see the ui right now  we've got a much wider space here and a space here   but when you initiate fsd this is how it looks  right everything is vector based so you'll see   objects defined as squares or no more like  the car shapes that might be just done for   right now and they may put them in after but  you essentially see what the computer's seeing okay so right now it's on and did you put the  blinker on and it did no it did that automatically look at that i'm not doing anything right now it's  monitoring the cars it's making the turn so i'm   going to keep my one hand over here because  obviously it needs to feel the pressure of   the hand right um just the same way regular  autopilot works but now we're we're driving   you'll see the curb is defined by red stopping in  400 feet it didn't have the cameras detect that   exactly it knows that based on what gps uh maps  gps so there's a lot of them like this stop   sign on the opposite side you can't see that it's  covered now look at this this is a three-way stop no problems wow it's bold too it  doesn't like creep along exactly   and it'll even tell you too it'll  say autopilot pausing for its turn   and so what it'll do is you know we as humans  we look and we say okay that guy stopped first   he'll stop then i'll go yeah it lets you know  the stop is coming but here for this first stop   signs you know it lets like hey you go first and  then i'll and then we'll go the sound of the past let's see see the bike lanes being defined   it's pretty killer look how massive that just got  yeah um what you'll also notice too is that in fsd   look at how much real estate is taken up right now  by fsd because the thought process is oh the car   is driving what do you need the map for right  so we'll we'll minimize the map i think a lot   of people are subjective to that uh that choice i  know sometimes i do want to see where it's going   next um because it's still beta so i'm still like  you know testing out i want to know but you'll see   i've always been very fear i've always feared  this turn here because these curves are really   big so it's like oh my rims but it doesn't hit  the curb at all it always knows where the curb   is which has been very impressive to me you see  the light up ahead you see the median the turning   what i love about this too is i've even in the  year that i've had my car with with updates   you can you can see what they're doing like for  example i think very shortly after i got my car   i was driving on garbage day and you can see  the garbage cans on the side of the road and   it's like wow you know what that is and you're  actually mon and labeling it correctly yep   so you can see how they're building up to this  oh totally were you surprised by the way when   they announced this thing because i mean i  hadn't heard much about it and suddenly it's   like hey check out this full self driving  yeah because i just thought like you know   full self driving when i think of full self  driving i think of like autonomy five right   which is like oh that's gonna take a while to get  there but just drop something oh yes your blanket and look at that raj is free to help be a  good samaritan because his car is driving   itself yep yeah it's a level five so  which you kind of think right yeah   so this is hopefully we'll have some well we got  one more car so it'll you'll see it watch here to   make the turn because it sees the other car coming  it'll stop it'll make it cautiously right so now   there's no cars coming it's going to go and it's  observing and it makes that turn really good lane   yeah navigation too now we're going into  a residential street um so you'll see   some residential footage here you've got cars  that'll should be parked on the side of the road yeah here's a car that's coming up ahead that's  parked on the side of the road how it handles that   and if you remember on currently  today on autopilot it cannot do   residential roads at all like you know  i mean like you might be able to get it   to work if there's lean markings but it  cannot do it because of the curve yeah i almost don't believe you don't have your yeah  that's all i try to bring it in to show you that   i'm not doing anything i can assure you he was not  driving so the key here is like obviously if i hit   the brake um the car the car will stop it'll turn  off all the uh the automation features you'll see   there's a kid on the bike yeah um if something  were to happen here's a speed bump so you'll see   it slow down for the speed bump watch it's 25 now  visualization for it it's very light it's right   there you can see these little dots oh yeah yeah  but it slows down to 15 for the speed bumps um   if something were to happen that's not  right i've got a camera button here   a lot of people ask what that is that's a submit  feedback it captures the logs gets sent to tesla   so that's part of the responsibilities of being  an fsd beta tester that it is a beta software it's   an early release software very few people have  it and so your job is to test it out you know   look at this tight turn kept you perfectly in the  lane and it had a kind of a wide curve over there and we're going to our destination  which is this house at 35418 and uh it should bring us  straight to the uh to the door   i think that should be this house right here  will it park it will not okay so kind of where   you where you put your pen this is the house  right here three five four one eight smokes   man so let's try something else i'm gonna go  over here we'll turn this car around we'll   find another destination to go to and see what  other stuff we can uh have it do how does it do   with like freeways and higher speed driving  perfectly fine so um you have autopilot in your   car so you use it on the freeway it pretty much  works exactly the same i don't notice any really   advantages um i think because they perfected that  there's no reason to really right you know there's   probably minor stuff but harder to notice uh  that stuff you think this sort of stuff is   actually more challenging oh definitely there's  just so much going on you know like there's   you know you've you've got a lot so let's see  here this will so i mean we can do this this gets   you on kind of a major road unless you want to do  some more that sounds good okay uh so we we're at   a stop right here right and you've got residential  and you've got the autopilot so i take my foot off   now um there are uh situations some people ask  and this is one feedback that i have is i don't   necessarily feel comfortable at 25 in residential  so i always bring it down to 20. the default speed   at residential is 25. so that's just my personal  feedback so yeah i like it at 20 but the other   thing is is sometimes on occasion you know you  got to be wary of the people around you because   there's people there's still normal drivers out  there and so they might get a little annoyed that   you're taking a little bit more time you're doing  things a little bit more cautiously and slowly   so on some education occasions oh wow because it  couldn't see past that truck exactly peeked out   i don't i didn't catch to see if it said it but  sometimes it says you know pulling forward to see   that was in the most recent update is it giving  feedback which is incredible so we took a that is   that is really remarkable we took a right turn  and the truck parked on the road was actually   blocking our view to see if we could actually  pull out safely so it kind of crept forward   took a look actually could see past that truck  and then went forward that's that's amazing yeah   yeah some of the things that it does is very  human-like and you're like yeah okay every   time i feel it i kind of think you're taking  over actually like when i see you do that like   no whatever what i've started to do is let  people know so um so here it stopped a little   bit earlier than i'd like this red light  back here which one throw that back here   yeah and so it saw the green it's still  now it's referring to this screen so see   look it's waiting for cross traffic because  this is a blind left yes so now it should go   it should go it's a little slow so what i'll do  is i'll usually just give it a little acceleration   to help it sometimes it was just just kind of  cautious of the whole thing yeah so because i   don't want it to and it might be also because of  the glare the sun is low in the sky there yeah   got it so that one i gave it a little bit of a  little bit of a push um and in some cases you do   right it's it is studying and you think about like  how much this computer is processing at the time it's pretty remarkable so when would you use  that button by the way um actually that was a   good that was great yeah yeah um typically you  can either hit the button or if you disengage   autopilot it will capture it as well okay so  you've had this now for a month two man uh   i think it's been about a month now yeah yeah  about a month and i mean you've seen i've seen   things change like um you know the way it  handles people the way that um so i had a   uh oh so school area it reduced its speed um   whoa okay that was weird all right are you  good you good it's like we need to get a driving school in progress well i  do have a thing on back that says   i love that i'm not most probably not  driving what's funny is i got that before   um and now you'll see this will update to  35 because that was a speed limit there   so now it changed so it respected the  school speed limit there but it had a little now wonkiness go up to 40. okay yeah so everything from the lights to the  turning i think the most impressive for me is   watching it turn because it's like i've never  been in a car that turned for me that's insane   it chooses a really good trajectory yeah  you can even tell it's predicting it yeah   i think the the really big thing was mapping out  the curbs right is like if you know the curves   that's going to help a lot that's actually  a decently difficult computer vision   problem because really what you're going  off of is like the contrast from like shadow   so you can see the top of the curve is lit  up well but there's a shadow on that side   and these the cameras i've always said the cameras  on these cars they're not like 4k sensors like   they're they're they're pretty middle-grade in  terms of quality so what they are able to do is   pretty remarkable right and even here too i think  you know ryan was calling out before is that the   sun's beaming in the camera yeah you know i've  had can you see that yeah and they just change the   line yeah in one of my videos i was having trouble  seeing yeah because the sun was beaming right in   my eye and yet it was handling it just fine um  so that was always that was interesting how it   yeah i mean you know i think the thing is is like  there's a lot of impressive uh things that we're   seeing what this software is capable of right  and and how this is paving the way for the future   is it perfect at this point no you know it does  make mistakes and that's part of the the process   of this beta testing and understanding and  learning and perfecting it um there's so many   edge cases and when you think about it driving no  it's insane especially because we are the minority   right the the regular drivers are the majority  so you have to account for even them because   i've been put into situations because of somebody  else driving rash because they're like i need to   get there faster so i'm gonna speed by or you  know i had to change lanes at one spot and i   couldn't do it because the other guy was so hasty  he merged over the right and he's sipping by and   he blocked me from being able to change my lane  and i missed my turn or autopilot missed its turn   is it was it autopilot's fault or was it  because that is driving right erratically   but it behaved well right did it reroute you  and take you around um i think i turned it   off and then did it so one thing that i have  not seen it do right now is um uh is a u-turn   um i don't see why not because i've seen it do  things that are pretty much a u-turn yeah but   it will not go and make a u-turn release i have  not seen that happen gotcha so what are some of   the things that like you were told not to try or  places you shouldn't go in terms of testing this   out um there really isn't much restriction um  you know like nothing's stopping me other than   having a family from taking a road trip across the  country i mean i would love to do that um and just   test it everywhere but yeah you'll see people  just doing everywhere i think dan from what's   inside just did it in las vegas um so that was  the first i'd not seen fsd handle las vegas yet   um i did it down lombard street in san francisco i  saw that um i think that when you start putting in   you know urban areas like san francisco or large  cities it's going to be a lot more challenged   because there's just so much going on and you  know you've got double parked vehicles people   just crossing where they're not supposed to cross  so you know i would expect that this would perform   better um rural than in urban urban but um  you know in san francisco it did it did decent   you've taken it out there wow yeah so when  i did lombard i did drive around a little   bit in the city and um it was i think overall  right when someone tells me your beta software   my expectation is low right like whoa whoa whoa  whoa whoa whoa is that guy coming in yeah yeah   yeah speaking of the the nightmare that is driving  on us yeah on a road totally that you know he's   probably not going to like that i break there this  guy's not even paying attention he's like he's not   he's not happy about that break so i'm just gonna  apply my accelerator just to move us along and   he's probably going to zip by and be irritated but  you know oh so i'm in software so like you know   releasing beta software to get feedback is is like  industry practice right but what's different is   if we were like writing enterprise software for  some company and like you know b2b or b2c and the   users are using it and they have feedback for us  we would then say okay interesting we'll take that   feedback we'll see what we can do with it yep what  you're doing is you're providing a data like these   these neural networks are actually you're feeding  it information that it can then take and and   improve and so all 20 of you guys that have this  every time you get an update you're learning from   all your aggregated uh knowledge and accumulated  experience that the cars are totally seen for   the first time yeah and that is what's incredible  tesla's um tesla's approach to this and their lead   just by having so many of these cars that's  recording all this information but ryan you're   gonna do a video comparing tesla's approach to  self-driving versus waymo yeah yeah yeah i hope   to host a little debate with someone that has a  several several runs with waymo and so yeah we   should be able to get raj on there and just see  kind of the different thoughts at this point in   the in the race for autonomy so let's see is this  guy going to cross here let's see so it sees him   watch this it's not going to creep out it's not  going to do anything but i'm like ready you know   just in case and so now you'll see it's observing  both sides this is a trick this is a tricky one   and so it's gonna go wow and i'm pretty sure it  saw that car coming too yeah and it made that turn so yes things like that um i had an uh an  issue where you know when you go to make a   right turn you go into the shoulder right so i  had you know i i talked about this is that it   wasn't making the right turn from the shoulder  it was actually making the right turn from the   right turn lane now for people driving behind  me or going straight got irritated because i'm   like dude you're stopping and i just want to go  straight but is what we've been doing actually the   is that actually the right way to do it because  then people were saying well that's the bike lane   you shouldn't be going into that lane so it makes  you like where's our resident dmv expert yeah you   know like there's there's a lot i mean these are  these edge cases and so i might think of something   as like it not doing it right the point is is that  i think over the last like three updates i've seen   it get better i've seen it get smarter i see it  learning and it's not also about how it inter   interacts with things but it's also about the maps  the last update we had a huge map update and i   could tell things of like for example this right  turn right here see there's a right turn lane   it now merges over to that immediately  when it's available whereas before   it was going into it too late yeah and  then you might have people already in there so that one i did have to press the accelerator a  little bit because i do have somebody behind me i   don't need him slamming into me so you got  to be cognizant of that kind of stuff that   i put it as like this is a kid who  just got their learner's permit   yeah that's probably a pretty good analogy yeah  like and i think what i was saying before is that   you know beta when i think beta i think like oh  this is gonna be buggy it's gonna be all bad for   what i was expecting to what was delivered i  was blown away like this does not feel beta   some of the stuff that it's doing i'm like whoa  seriously like that's you're able to do that wow   and then when it does make mistakes i'm like okay  i mean it is beta it's still learning you know   but i don't feel i would say  that i don't feel like my life is   is in jeopardy like this is your first time  experiencing it i've been driving for a while   you can see how comfortable my leg is just like  chilling otherwise like in the beginning i was   here i was like ready now i could still move it  pretty fast but still you know like i feel i know   what times to be a little bit more cautious and  what times just be like hey i know it's got it but   how do you feel do you feel like do you feel that  your life is in danger being in an fsd beta car   no i i think that's just having autopilot  for a year yeah the very first time even my   wife was like are you sure about this we were all  freaked out now it just feels really commonplace   we trust our car yeah and that is a great feeling  yeah um it appears to generally take the more   conservative approach yes and be cautious there  was one there's one exception there when it took   that left turn it looked like it was um a little  little hasty out the out the gate there yeah   largely it seems to do the right thing yeah it  there it's funny to see it when it's aggressive   and then when it's more cautious it's it's very  picky and choosy but what's funny is is that you   know coming from the autopilot world like it's  necessarily not really as aggressive as we'd like   it now maybe we're more aggressive drivers but it  usually is not even it's set at mad max but here   i'm seeing like some terms i'm like whoa you're  pretty confident about that turnout okay sure go   ahead look at the cones it has it all figured out  yeah there's stuff going on and even when it like   merges over if somebody is like sticking out too  far um there was one instance where a vehicle had   like you know changed lanes and so it was sticking  out a little bit into our lane and it kind of just   nudged over and went around it um there's a lot  of those and what's funny is you know we i try   to get you know have my camera on but there's a  lot of times i'm driving without my camera on and   i see things that just aren't captured you're like  oh man but you could do the dash cam thing and you   have that at least right true you could you could  i could start saving a lot of dash cam footage you should you never know we all know how  easy it is to sort through the dash cam   you know the first time i turned on sentry mode i  was like oh two events what's going on let me take   a look you know i come back like 12 events like  yeah that's good yeah 12 is good number at least   we could view it on our screen right away true  true what they should do now is some ai and say   here's a potential event and otherwise leave it  alone like if someone walks by yes yes like a   person was there but enough footage just happened  where a guy is key in your car doing something bad   and have that um distinguished totally here's  the thing when you bought your tesla what you   really did is you know those really brilliant  people over there are gonna have that soon and   maybe in six months they'll have that where  it'll be hey there are 12 events one suspected   oh yeah problem and then you open that one thing  and they go holy crap look at that and someone's   key in my car even when you think about this  like sure this is a unique software that's   only available to you know 20 people at this time  of recording but how many teslas are on the road   today where it's just feeding data to the machine  the monster that it is and that machine is just   sucking it all in you know translating it machine  learning like identifying what objects are   is what's also driving behind this as well so  you know like there's there's a lot in there   that i think a lot of people don't understand is  that like we're all feeding this and that's the   primary way for this system to get better and  learn is all in this machine learning and the   only way to do that is having cars on the road you  cannot just sit behind a computer and program this   i agree and this actually gets to one thing  i've i've said several times in my channel   which is if you bought a tesla early on you are  literally doing the work of aggregating data   yeah and what they should do is give you a break  on the full self driving and instead you know it   doesn't appear that way nothing they just keep  on checking up the prices and maybe this is me   and my sour grapes because i haven't bought it  yet you have you're good um but yeah this is uh   this is groundbreaking stuff and there's really  not much in the way of competition for it so i   think they they're entitled to to price it as a  as they see fit but i love seeing that there's   real progress happening yeah they elon mentioned  with the rewrite and kind of this kind of going   back to the basics one of the reasons was that  when they when they classify things they were   previously taken like a like a screen capture so  the problem with that these cameras are not the   highest resolution you've got motion blur it could  be night time maybe the aperture is open bigger   the shutter speeds a little slower so as a  result those pictures could be pretty blurry   and one of the things they found is just instead  by making like a two or three second video clip   you have enough data there that people  can say yeah that's a bicycle that's a car   that's a bicycle towing a car towing a bicycle  and have the sort of fidelity to make those   decisions but seeing this and and watching the  visualization which is amazing by the way i'm   so glad they made that bigger yeah you can  see all that kind of playing in look at that   yeah it tracks it all pretty well even that guy  who's starting to cross the road over there that   was a little blue yeah there he is oh my goodness  this would scare me right here yeah seeing a   curb and a car and it did all that yeah it did  all that i'm just always ready to like kind of   pull it left but um i don't think i've ever run  into an instance which is this is shocking from   beta 1 from the first time it was released and i  got it left turns and right turns have never been   a problem and that's to me i feel like that's  the tricky part especially when you have like   two cars making a left so it's it's seeing that  and it's accounting for it so i have noticed   that aggressive yeah late changes where you're  like wow i would have sped up and taken it but   is that is that a california mode you can have  you know that that's where i feel like okay mad   max is definitely happening by the way so you  mentioned beta one how what has been the uh the   update frequency been like with um i feel  like it's been about like every two weeks   um so i know that one's expected this  week and that's supposed to be a major one   the one that comes out this week depending on  the on the data that comes from that will dictate   whether more people get invited to the fsd beta  that was that's not me that's elon saying that got it so we'll see we'll see what kind of huge  leaps and bounds comes on this next release this   week um i actually didn't even notice that this  is a no turn on red um next time i come back   here i'll have to see if i'm the only car if it  actually fits into it yeah after pause and he just   broke the rules he just did yeah yeah so now  it gets even more complicated because sometimes   let's just turn green yeah sometimes it's no turn  on red from these hours yeah look at the size of   that curve that always freaks me out because i'm  like don't hit it but there you go yeah and i   know what it's like to be in the passenger seat  because my initial was in the passenger seat so   it's hard to believe that like you're really not  doing anything like i'm really not doing anything yeah at these lower speeds i'm not really  like thinking about like our safety it's   more about like oh you're gonna curb rash  something or exactly we just drove eight miles   something like that yeah we just drove  eight miles and i think you intervened   a couple of times yeah it looks like but largely  it did all that by itself stopping at stop signs   i love it tells you like stopping at 800 feet  around a bend you can't even you wouldn't   even know that it should come up in a second  there it is yeah it can't even it has a little   clue here but but yeah you can't see that  stop sign but and it starts to slow down   look you can't see it and it's already  slowing down it knows it's there wow this is pretty incredible yeah it this definitely  shows you that this is this is a giant leap i mean   this is a huge huge leap so my my reaction hasn't  been too crazy and the reason why before we met   here today we watched like we binged three or  four tesla rogers videos so i kind of knew what   to expect but i will say if i hadn't watched your  videos i just got in the car and saw this look at   that right the marker showed up and it moved over  so the previous software update when i needed to   go straight it actually went in this lane and i  had to correct it really submitted the feedback   now look it does it perfectly fine when i need to  go straight it stays on that lane waited its turn   making the turn proper right stop so obviously  here is a little bit tricky i don't think it's   going to be able to do this but i'll leave it  on until but technically we're back to where we oh because this is the destination oh and there it is have you had any experience with  rain i don't i know you're a californian so you   might not know what that is but it's when water  falls out of the sky i hear it's a thing i've   i hear it's a thing too but um not yet there was  a little bit of rain but i didn't it wasn't enough   to like really do some solid testing gotcha um  well keep me updated maybe we'll we'll check   this out again sometime yeah for sure but i will  say like first you know reaction having been in   a car with the beta it is remarkable and i can't  wait to see like what comes next or what emergence   from all this who knows maybe i'll have to go  buy the uh the full self-driving there you go   i try to convince my wife of it raj thank you so  much man that was an absolute pleasure absolutely   we'll have to come back on sometime for  sure dude absolutely blast that was great
