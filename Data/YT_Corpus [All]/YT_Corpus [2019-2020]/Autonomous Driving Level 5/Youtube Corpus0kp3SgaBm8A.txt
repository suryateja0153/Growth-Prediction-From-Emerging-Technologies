 More than a decade ago, we set out to improve the future of mobility. That challenge became our mission at Waymo - to design and build the World's Most Experienced Driver. So Waymo Driver has experience learned from over ten million miles of data. Using that data, it learned how to recognize everything around it - cars, pedestrians, curbs, traffic lights, even how to listen for things coming from any direction. So that when it counts, Waymo sees what matters. It's just great to work with really talented people - engineers, scientists, researchers, designers - working together to solve one of the world's toughest problems. No one can solve any piece of this by themselves. It all requires working together. We're all driven by one common goal - making our roads safer and easier to get around for everyone. When you ride with Waymo, it may look like there's no one in the driver's seat, but on every single ride all of our passion and hard work is there behind that wheel.
