 so instead of sport folio we have different sensor types beyond cameras we have radars and I'd ours this sounds a bit like aerospace surveillance but actually radars and lighters work by emitting waves radar in the radio frequency and lidar is light emitting and then processing the echoes from objects in order to get the precise systems position or velocity measurement we start with basic safety so that's typically a radar and a camera used for basic safety functions like Pegasus if it comes to ad on a pest car it's called level 2 plus so it's drivers in responsibility but the vehicle can do a lot on its own but still the driver owns the responsibility we had multiple radars and cameras if you go to level 4 means the driver is not in a car there is no steering wheel anymore that's like robot cars or people movers shuttle cars we add all three technologies so radar lidar and camera in order to have a highly redundant system to get maximum of reliability and safety so CFS experience with the sensor product is from basic safety up to level 4 dedicated product all the products are in a ready to application state for example one is the imaging radar that's a high-resolution radar that covers more than 300 meters range in detection and has 192 channels which is about factor of 16 more than a traditional radar today another product we have is a solid state lidar the solid state light our covers the 360-degree picture around the vehicle in a very high-resolution 3d manner so future trends ICS we extend the performance of the product to higher prefer higher resolution higher performance for table range so if you look it two-trucking application for automation you need even more than 300 meters or if you look into lidar application you might add even direct velocity measurement so called frequency modulated lidar so that's all features we add or improve to make the system even available for more situations and more use cases
