 In vehicles with Operating System 7, the Speed Limit Info and Active Cruise Control work even better together. The settings regarding the Speed Limit Assistant can be found when following “CAR”, “Settings”, “Driver Assistance”, “Driving”, “Speed Assistant” and “Notes on speed limits”. Please select “Adjust automatically”. In this automatic mode, a detected speed limit is automatically adopted for Cruise Control. When available, also map data is used to detect upcoming changes in speed limits. You can press the SET button to switch back to the last value set. If the system and the Cruise Control are switched on, a green symbol is displayed in the instrument cluster. Continue watching our How-To Series to get the most out of your BMW.
