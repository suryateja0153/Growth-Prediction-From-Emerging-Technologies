 Hello As you can see, I'm in my car Driving But not by me By my car It's a self-driven car How it works is I install openpilot and it smartens it up So that it automates my drive So what I plan to show you guys today Is how much of my drive is actually being self-driven and how much is being driven by me So I plan to do a short video of me driving to the city and to give you guys a percentage how much I will be taking over and how much is actually being self-driven But in short let's get the video rolling As you can see, I've cropped up the openpilot's screen here Right now I'm still driving my car You will see the ring here in blue Once the ring turns green, like now, my car is self-driving At the bottom of the screen, you’ll notice a bar that is increasing throughout the drive. This bar shows how much of my car is being self-driven Green means it’s on Blue means it’s off So the more green, the more my car is being self- driven Please don't mind me using my phone I was trying to set up a conference call Please ignore that part So, let’s have a look back at the openpilot’s screen You’ll see how it recognizes the road and draws the line It also shows the path my car will be driving When the lane turns, you’ll see the path turning too So, I’m not driving the car, totally hands free I'm just gonna speed this video up Right now, I’m going to cut to the left to exit So I pressed on my brakes and the  openpilot disengages So right now, I'm manually cutting to the left Everything seems safe I re-engage openpilot Here I am, in a traffic jam You can see I'm totally relaxed and let it go Openpilot truly shines here But still, I’ll speed this up I’ll do another video only on traffic drives, next time So what do you think? Looking at the bar below, I think you can guess roughly how much was self-driven right? My trip was 30 minutes and I manually drove it for 4 minutes That’s a whopping 87% of my car driving me to the city Basically, the only times I had to drive myself, was when I needed to cut into traffic lanes or taking exits So I hope this gives you guys an insight That’s all for now.
