 Hi everybody, my name is Joe Nathan VP of Marketing at our been Our base is starting radar technology to make autonomous driving both safe and affordable and to jumpstart the autonomous driving revolution Well, the revolution is actually happening it started in the today because on the road have level two meaning drivers can take their feet off And this will evolve all the way towards level five in 2050 where will have no drivers at all. So the revolution is started. It's very exciting however a recent study by triple-a have shown that the ada s the driver assistance systems a on the on the road today are not safe enough They can't handle very common scenarios a curvy road a busy intersection A vehicle in front of them changing its lane All of them are too challenging for the autonomous solutions on the road today, and why is that happening? This is because of the sensors the sensors in the autonomous vehicle are typically a radar in a camera in some cases also lighter They're all very limited in functionality The radars today have low resolution This means they rely on movement to be able to track the environment around them what we're seeing here I'm kind of locking the image is a Tesla running into a fire truck How can you miss a fire truck? Right it was part it wasn't moving and this is how it they get it So they fail to text engineer objects, and they're very limited in their field of view So if the road is curvy or steep it's hard for the vehicles to challenge in addition cameras Very trustworthy are limited through a line of sight and to light you can't operate in dark and in bed weather and lidar Sometimes is entered into the combination but lighter is also limited by a bad weather and we need our sensors to be available Throughout the year in all weather in lighting condition and it's also very expensive So, this is our BAE, we believe our base the missing link towards level 2 and level 5 autonomy, we basically to crater a trustworthy Technology and infused it with high resolution with advanced capabilities and we're transforming the role of the radar from a supportive sensor to the backbone of the sensor suite So what have we done? Those are the advantages the over Bayes radar. If a typical radar in cars today can spot between 30 to 40 objects We track hundreds of object we can track 450 objects in parallel In addition, we separate the environment in high resolution This means if two objects are close to one another by one degree. We can separate them and realize their - in addition We're the first company to separate the environment also by elevation The environment of the road also happens with bridges with leads on the road So we need to know where stuff is located also by its height We look to a wide field of view - a long range We do all that in parallel in a in real time 30 times a second and we bring false alarms to it close to zero The advantages of this solution are enormous first of all, it's very effective for autonomous driving We separate stationary and moving objects were effective on steep roads and and curved roads And we're a deal for come our fusion the fact that we can identify and map environment in such detail enables fusion So the car can only get one set of instructions from different from the different sensors in addition. It's very safe This is the only Raider that's able to spot humans Bicycles and motorcycles around the vehicle and last it's very accurate A radar is actually an imaging radar is more accurate than a GPS in localizing the car into its lane And how did we do all that? 14a We wanted like everybody else who purchase chips radar chipsets This is what the whole industry is doing but we realized the chipsets in the environment are not In their level is too low. We don't have the resolution that's required And that's why we developed our own chipset free chips are receiving transmitting and processing chip So today we basically bring the same level of radar capabilities that are available for an f15 or an f-16 fighter jet Into automotive meaning we took a millions of dollar raider made it smaller and more affordable So re there is less than 200 in some configuration even less than $100 per vehicle The advanced safety we achieved a turbine would result all the factors behind the recent car accidents that happen in the last two years by separation in elevation by high resolution and by the elimination of false alarms If we look at our market the market ahead of us We all know that sensors for automotive is a very lucrative market and it's pretty much split between light on camera and radar Then market are the same camera in the radar evolving quicker, but it's very interesting to see the number of players So while we have hundreds of the providers in lighters and close to 100 in camera There are only 5 players trying to innovate radar so the Opportunity is very big Especially because what we hear from the market is that an imaging radar like our it will actually replace some of the lighter systems out there And if we look at the growth our plan is to surpass 100 million dollars in annual sales within 5 years and to be profitable in 2021 We've raised so far 23 million dollars and we're now a actively raising around be looking for both strategic and financial investors and this is us we were founded at the end of 2015 were 75 people a Were based out of Tel Aviv with sales and business development happening in Silicon Valley and in China Our product is now in beta stage meaning it's being tested by OEMs automotive companies and your ones around the world Thank you very much You You
