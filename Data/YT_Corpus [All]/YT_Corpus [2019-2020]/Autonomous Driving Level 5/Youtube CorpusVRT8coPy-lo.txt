 hi friends the release of full self driving  beta is out like a few days ago it's amazing   so who do you think will emerge the winner  tesla, waymo, cruise comma.ai or mobile eye?   do note that all this technology used it's really  impressive i've been looking into this technology   for quite a long time the different approaches  and i made my conclusion watch countless hours   of videos presentations read into papers and in  this video i'll cover my thoughts behind all of   these technologies there's one important question  you need to ask to solve the answer and so i'll   come to that later i'll spend a short time on the  charts in this video too full self driving saves   lives removing human error and reaction times  instead of driving we could use the travelling   time to work or rest if you think about time spent  traveling like over a lifetime that's like years   gone also full self driving enables robo taxis  bringing the cost of transport drastically down   and the need for less cars on the road as the use  case for each robot taxi goes up drastically so   let's talk about the tech waymo and cruise mainly  uses lidar laser technology i'll cut the story   short here else is going to be a long video lidar  is not weatherproof it has lots of limitations   spacex uses lidar to dock crew dragon and yet  tesla doesn't use this technology both waymo   and cruise have operators standing by to intervene  every like five to ten miles an operator needs to   intervene that's not full self-driving i wasn't  the one that gave the stats they did i'll link   a 25 minutes video by cruise do watch it to judge  for yourself if i put it here i may get a copyright strike   because i'm not praising them anyway  waymo and cruise will fail or end up spending   lots of money perfecting this technology waymo  started 11 years ago and 3.5 billion dollars spent   cruise started seven years ago and spent about two  billion hey dude it's not going to work let's talk   about the third option coma.ai is great but it's  only front sensor ai prediction using 2d images   frame by frame this is the technology tesla and  mobile eye we're using prediction using 2d images   frame by frame has many limitations mobile eye and  tesla both use somewhat of a similar technology   mostly vision sensor means it's the same camera  used in your smartphone and place these sensors   all around the car though the input is 2d  images frame by frame the software will convert   multiple frames of images to a 3d image if you  think about a human brain though it's not that   obvious we use our eyes to see in 2d and our brain  converts these images to 3d in doing so tesla and   waymo has much more accurate scalable solutions  now the argument is who will reach full autonomy   first? as always my approach has always been first  principles asking the right question at the end of   all the questions i listed down it only came  down to one question. Which company has the   ability to solve the most amount of edge cases wins.  that's it there are millions of corner cases or   edge cases it's crazy the infinite possibilities  of edge cases it's like you you cannot count it   it's like when you train the ai to recognize a  bicycle and avoid the bicycle but you get cases   like bicycles on the back of a car on the  truck or multiple bicycles what do you do   how about construction zones or debris on the road  or animals you see my donkey appeared just to test   the ai over here mobile eye has an advantage  mobile eye has 50 plus million vehicles equipped   and mostly other automakers are using their  technology so again it sounds like a david versus   goliath situation tesla has much fewer vehicles on  the road this is a reason why i took a real long   look into mobile eye technology and watched all  their presentations and look through everything i   can dig out of them so here is my conclusion tesla  has one advantage and just this one advantage   brings tesla to the lead which is vertical  integration think about it when an edge case   is detected these cases will be uploaded to tesla  the autopilot team will use these cases to train   the ai and re-upload this program back to the car  done all these steps done in two to three days   as we have seen in full self-driving beta testers  doing this. Can mobile eye do this technically yes   they can but i don't see that coming anytime soon  traditional automakers have to make their cars   that come with over the air software updates  seriously tell me if you are able to to see   that coming soon over the air updates it's not as  simple as it sounds like all systems in the car   have to talk to one another in the traditional  automakers engineering they have the like   aircon department suspension department engine  department frame department. Sandy Munro mentioned   it's almost impossible to make these departments  to get any change done i want mobile eye to   succeed it's because it's good for the world. i  hope they take the active steps to address this   problem else tesla will be the only one doing  this [ __ ] in the future and it's going to be   a problem competition is healthy let's take a  quick look at the charts you'll notice that on   last friday's closing there was a huge rejection  below 420 how do we see that you notice this   tail over here is a very long tail compared to the  body of the candle this is a very big rejection   below 420 and if you look back in time see there's  a lot of bounce around the 420 region somehow   this number keeps coming up if we were to draw a  horizontal line across 420 i'll just change this   color to light green you'll notice that tesla has  been range bound for a little while so frankly any   entry near the support line is an awesome entry  it's because technically you are buying in low   before the next shoot upwards there are a lot of  sell orders at 452 and a lot of buy orders at 420   and as mentioned in previous videos and multiple  videos we need a full candle above the 452   range above this line here for tesla stock to  make its break upwards wrapping up not really on   topic but i would like to say for the next decade  plenty of money will be spent on decarbonization   regardless of administration or government if  you are not invested in tesla i highly recommend   you to take a deep dive into this rabbit hole and  emerge less of a donkey appreciate the thumbs up invest safe take care
