 [Music] autonomous driving is changing the requirements changing everyday and I think the infrastructure needs to change also autonomous driving is one of the most infrastructure consuming topics which you can currently work on it's a huge amount of data but then the data needs to be worked with only those companies who are able to master these data's will be able then to succeed in the autonomous drive development so they have to master the new fuel as we called it an automotive that is the data and transform from a mechanical engineer into a software company the BMW of high performance data center there we call it the d3 platform data driven development platform is an essential part of how autonomous driving will become reality we got asked by mw2 enforces a large amount of data but also run a large amount of simulations diggsy draws leaded openshift to be a part of the diggsy robotic drive offering and therefore also part of this high-performance d3 platform so that we can have the enterprise component of new Panetta's cluster which enables us HDC tell overloads for micro services for deep learning but then also we are able to run our simulation workflows we want to bring the developer out of the car on their desk so they can work on their functions and we can simulate over 240 million kilometres on the platform directly where the data is it's a very big threat and openshift to cluster and more than hundred thousand course is massive connected to 230 petabyte of usable storage the amount of time he had to build or that phone was about three months from an empty room to being in a productive state and so this was really amazing that shows the ability to execute Big C together with red head that we can actually pull this off it's always a win-win when everything is oriented on a target and all the partners are jointly working open-minded then you can be successful we have really a sourced one new global platform specifically made and it contracted for that purpose and I think this project is a very good example where I infrastructure solutions can really help enable the business to do what they need to do much better and it's a real view of digitalization [Music]
