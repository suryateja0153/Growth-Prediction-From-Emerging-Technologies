 [Music] so again thank you for great talks for three speakers and just in case I prepare some back of questions but let me start with the one I got Wow it's not easy to translate it to English exactly translation is the primary target for AI I guess here's the question I think everybody can answer in some sense but the question is about when the strong AI who can think by him or herself will appear and how about the kind of T the legal position of that area is will it be will it will he or she should be treated as a human was still part of this machine so who is the best it's really talked s to me maybe a professor we can start oh I guess yeah thank you that is actually a very difficult question so the first question is when will strong a real reality yeah I guess I don't quite know how to answer that question because I don't know if we have a clear definition of what strong a real AI is in terms of kind of at what point do we consider it to be kind of akin to or similar to a human being what are the metrics or the mechanisms by which we can make that assessment so I don't know I'm to be honest with you I hope never but as we've seen the like the amazing productions of music and the ability for these algorithms and and these neural network models are AI models to be able to mimic humans it does raise the question what is what makes us human and the algorithms have come really far because in many respects we were all fooled it's is hard to distinguish so I don't know to be honest with you I hope never and and so perhaps we will never have to address this question of from a legal perspective you know how how we interface with them but and I think professor you will be able to adjust this better is when we actually do have autonomous driving I think there will be a lot of legal implications and questions that do arise and so you know as AI becomes more pervasive in our daily lives I think society is going to have to make a lot of hard decisions it's going to have to grapple with what it means and whether it's from an insurance perspective or ethical moral perspective we will have to grapple with it at some point in some manner but specific dates honestly I have no idea Wow professor another speaker kind of brought up another question to another speaker yes so actually related to the the question regard so the question is about when the level-5 autonomously kuvira reality and what is the technical huddle of that happening can you first kind of pre pre mention of different levels of the autonomous vehicles there are five is fully on mental most ridings so that that depends on the driving environment for example for the limited area for some campers then we can now implement rebel five auto most riding vehicles but in the case of the very complicated urban environment it will take times ten to twenty five some export imagine that then maybe all the rebel 5 bottommost riding will be available by the year of 2016 but but in some some limited areas for example general public was rains or some limited areas for company campers then in the in that case we can implement level 5 autonomous driving very soon so now actually in seoul national university developing new smart campus and now our groups developing with collaboration of the industry smart mobility 4 or 5 level 5 water was driving card is the mobility social system so thank you very much the next cluster will be I guess professor Qiu Li might answer and this is about some political were the non technical question so if AI advances in this pace then there will be kind of more people will lose jobs and the kind of that we were poor poverty people and the the strengths and the wealth will be concentrated to a few people there are some general concern about that we have any kind of opinion about that aspect yeah I mean I read many articles regarding their way through all the resource will be yeah focus on very rich and powerful people only and the rest 98 percent will have nothing but yeah I don't know but as I briefly mentioned in my slides when the the Chi fool Lee who is a very leading scholar in a call in the businessman and scholar in the area and he mentioned about for jobs and the first one was create jobs I talked about but the fourth category is as yet unknown jobs I think there will be created I mean invented by these technical advances as well because I mean we have many new jobs that were not present and path but with the development of technology and technology that we have new jobs as well so I think there will be many more new jobs for example if we lose jobs because of this Amanda UAV what drones delivering products in front of your door but there is somebody is not fully automatic yet so there are we need somebody to control the drones right this is a new job actually so I think there will be not as many yes but there will be some portion of new jobs who I mean and the jobs will require very soft skated and skills that can be achieved only by humans like create jobs so that's my guess in my home yeah professor yeah Gil GUI is really positive or the about the future of AI I guess one of the jobs that will be replaced by Isis in trouble so the next question is actually all the professor's might answer in a very different kind of taste of Labor so the question is about the BA the question is basically about the course of data if you use the Facebook or Google or YouTube then based on the that their recommendation system actually instead of providing very personalized recommendation they tend to recommend very kind of few categories of how can I say there's the petitioned info competition suggestion which is not really personalized but they just categorized so and also if you have some same political idea then you recommend the similar kind of things to the people what is your kind of idea about how to make kind of make the recommendation more diversified or the better tales this it's kind of problem tailing I guess can you start with these on your thought about sure what no they never get the hard questions no no everyone around so but since I did speak about recommendation systems perhaps this is appropriate so a lot of AI machine learning it's dependent on data right and so there have been examples for example where there were these chat BOTS created and it turned out that these chat BOTS were extremely racist because it was trained based on chats that had read throughout the world and so I think you know the because these recommendation systems are only as good as the data that's used and the way in which humans interact I think perhaps what will happen is people will start interacting with some of these services in a different matter or they'll be demanding different ways or different kinds of services and recommendations that are provided so for example this whole like echo chamber the news echo chamber that has existed that has led to perhaps even a further kind of biasing of political views as you know by humans by us recognizing that this is occurring then we're gonna be motivated to look for news from the other outlets from the other positions and and try to have a more whole list or a diversified kind of uptake of information and by doing so then perhaps the recommendation systems which are really just trained and developed kind of based on the behavior of humans will also then change as well so I guess the the technology is still very early right it's only been but at most 10 years I think we have a long ways to go and as Professor they suggested as some of these AI capabilities do take over some of the kind of traditional menial jobs perhaps there probably will be a whole host of other opportunities and then well I think our jobs gonna be safe because I think we're gonna always be looking for new AI gears and and and then we're gonna have to develop them and create them so our graduate students especially those graduate student self and the audience you have a bright future you know keep studying and we'll all be good topics so so that's where the the transparency or expelling ability come into a very important issue in AI or a are recommendations because people I mean and users don't know why this summer this product was recommended by this algorithm right so I think I I remember I remember reading on reading a news article on Amazon recently they kind of tweaked their recommendations to sell some specific products more widely so because and people don't know because they don't know about the PR in the process why this book was recommended to me because I was interested in finances but why suddenly Harry Potter so I mean if algorithm can explain or justify why this product was recommended to you then it'll solve a little bit of this problem of these like the diversification I don't know what the opposite word mean but yeah okay thank you so I got many questions I don't know whether I have enough time to dress them or we were gonna stop the time when time's up so the net fist next question is to you the professor we the question is about so for the AI hardware development it takes long time but as you know AI algorithm change every day there are new kind of the algorithm come out they claim that they are the best and a month later they're another great people came over and we are the best so if the algorithm change every day or every month but the harder develop as you know takes years what is the right kind of approach for that so this is I guess something that our research group faces on a regular basis in kind of the early they I don't even know why I call it early but in within the last ten years when we started looking at building hardware for AI we just were trying to understand what are the core computations what are the bottlenecks and what that led to was very specific architectures and very specific circuit designs but then what we found out very quickly was that our approach and our solutions was immediately outdated because he had a new model came out so the specificity or making and building very very dedicated custom hardware for AI I think does play a role in specific situations where energy efficiency is critical but there's also a need for more general-purpose flexible programmable Hardware in order to be able to accommodate the broad diversity of models and you know technology keeps on changing but also was really interesting is there are other approaches in machine learning and AI where I've been trying to convince some of my students to look into this but there's this notion of teacher-student networks transfer learning where if you have a new algorithm perhaps what you can do is use that in order to make really good predictions and then trance construct yet a different model that's better suited for the hardware that we have to learn from this new model that emerge and so I think we have to be flexible as we try to build next generation hardware great so that's next question is given to Kyung soo professor kyung-soo e so ai lon from mistake right and for the autonomous Pico unlike the other area of like just image recognition and long by mistake is quite costly right they involve the human being injured what it calls a lot from the damage of the car but and the simulation may be the way to the help training but it's not perfect what is the your experience and what is the kind of your idea about kind of lawn by wrong from mistake yeah definitely so what am i driving although most driving areas we can greatly benefit from the AI technology but as you mentioned good data I can get good data so in how can generate good algorithm structure architectures that that is very important for the domain domain domain knowledge so good collaboration between AI technology and domain technology is very very important so some people says complete a is the uttermost riding from data the older into data to full full control but still that is far far away so we need to step by step development step by step application of the air technology very very important so for example a article it's very very effectively applied for the detection and perceptions and also expanding the technology to the decision and predictions and then finally the control so complete development of the AI based autonomous driving will take time but in the mean times we need to find good combination of the control technology and technology that is the solution sizing yeah professor Kyung superbug emphasized the the combination of a traditional and AI based approach the next question I try to combine two questions to Professor googly so it's a little related but are the different tone or self are there little demands for AI generated arts it's very it sounds really interesting but I wonder whether it's it took too much niche market and the next question is actually what is the positive or negative negative implication of a I'll application voice is a kind of some fake I think you have many things to say answer the the second one because that is easier ah yes very negative impact of course yeah you know ami give a kazoo we encounter everyday be video clips who are voices who have never been said by a actual human but it sounds or it appears surreal that we immediately recognize it well this is real and test one very important issue so and we are trying to actually prevent that as well I mean how to tell the real voice from the fake voice so it's always a fight between the hacker and the defenders yeah like actual hacking and the first question so who will benefit from this AI singing well so my example did the singing voice in the sea research was introduced to the public through the recent news article and there are a lot of the comments some of them more positive like the one I for the reason I just described and many of them were very positive actually so I was surprised and one comment was about wow if I could only listen to perfusion we're famous male sing male singer sing every song in the world in his voice then I would die yeah so test yeah there is a need so yeah that's my answer ok let me move on into some hard question even I have no idea how to answer that the question is about what might be the ramification or implication of machine learning and coupled with quantum computing so it sort of it out of scope but I guess the the professor we may answer tough question [Laughter] so I don't I so you know machine learning neural networks is in many ways inspired by the way that the human brain is constructed and kind of the neurons that fire and and how that leads to certain traits or you know tasks being accomplished I don't think we have a full understanding of how the human brain works we just only have kind of examples and and and you know and notions of oh there's some things that we can do so like for example how do our brain stored like have memories I don't think we actually even know exactly how that works so perhaps and I've heard this from another professor at seoul national actually who was suggesting perhaps there's actually some kind of quantum mechanical effects going on within the neurons that explains you know why we have seemingly such low power consumption with all the processing that our brains can do relative to our computers I mean our chips have billions of transistors and yet they burn so much power and our brains consume so little power to do amazing things so I think the cloning computing is still in its infancy I think also we don't have an exact understanding of exactly what's going on there and then the same goes for AI and machine learning so this becomes a very interesting in and new opportunity for research for our for our young researchers and engineers and scientists out there to be able to to merge those two but I'm I have no idea okay any of you want to kind of add up to that it's very hard to believe that our brain has some components like quantum mechanics but I don't know if we can integrate some of the inventions done in the area computing then maybe we can kind of merge and you can kind of develop it new a totally new Bureau laughs or something like that using quantum computing but yeah but I don't know bit about quantum computing okay so the next question I think all three speakers may have their own opinion so the question is about it starts with the professor with presentation the holistic approach so the many a kind of AI companies or the ICT companies are taking the same approach as well that one of the key differences of academia and industry is that the industry has lots of data and they have tons of people in different area it gets harder to compete with them from their academic perspective with industry how do you kind of how do you how can you compete with them or collaborate with that where's your general take for example professor chemistry's Wallace has D the result of great collaboration with many kind of Korean companies as well right so where's your kind of opinion on D the gap between academia and industry about the holistic aspect and data aspects I think collaboration is key we as you said data is very you know carefully and it's protected in industry and it doesn't make sense to to open it widely but there may be ways to make available certain certain you know the personalized data that allows academic researchers to to make some significant contributions but collaboration can take various forms it could be by having our students doing internships at companies it can also involve having experts from companies coming and working with our researchers in our research labs where they provide that specific view like oh don't go there because that's not of interest so we know from an you know that's not the right direction to go so yeah I think collaboration is going to be the key point and and and you know there is a little bit of competition that does occur I think between the researchers in academia and in industry but when I speak to our friends in industry there's just too many things to pursue there's too many questions to be answered that even though they have lots of people they can't pursue all of them and then I think it's also the role of us academics where we have the luxury our output is papers we don't have to necessarily succeed right a negative result is not a bad thing because it then tells the the domain or the discipline don't pursue this idea because it's probably not as fruitful as and other ideas and so I feel like there is you know different types of contributions that the academic can make that may not be as attractive for folks in industry professor comes with any idea about any any thoughts about actually industry difficulty in getting very good research engineer in in these AI areas so good collaboration between academia and it is very very important also in the in the field of automotive most driving motor vehicle area as you imagine there's so many different areas of technology should be combined and integrative so so collaboration is very very important to you so yeah the huge companies Google Apple Netflix me yeah they have Patera I think if eg which is probably most important they have resources computing infra and they are the sinkholes for the old good grad students right so they everything so I cannot agree more with Professor we were on that we have we have to collaborate with them we cannot compete with them we must not compete with them and as Professor we said we are very at the very liberty of doing whatever we want because nobody cannot make forth with the any products we I mean any research results we have because it doesn't do I mean hopefully it doesn't do serious harm to people although I whereas the industries directly with the industries outcomes are directly related with the I mean everybody I mean every human being so we are at much we have much more freedom in doing what you want to do I mean purely based on like a curiosity Academy curiosity so that's one key different thing between us and the industry oh people yeah okay second to the last I guess is to professor we the philosophy of Cody giant has been already internalized by Apple the company like that but still the market share is a lot larger on personal computer or Android device side which approach is more efficient just making everything internally or also sit in collaboration I think in this regard competition is is very important and so it's I think we all benefit from the fact that we do have these competing technologies between Apple and Google and all and Samsung and all the other manufacturers because you know as even though I've been of advocating this notion of a holistic code design that is not the only answer right there new technologies come from out of nowhere all the time and so having a more distributed kind of environments also will enable some of these new technologies to to come in and you know I guess from my personal experience when I look my interactions with my Apple devices is they do a really good job of fine-tuning everything but they're not necessarily the first in proposing a new technologies actually startups and the more that and other companies that tend to be more aggressive and so I think there's I think we benefit from having the diversity in there's room for for all the competing players okay the last question of the session is given to young suhee that's not too much technical question so professor Lee you can shoot a lot of the animation of your self-driving car what if we have an accident with the tasked self-driving car in the Special Zone you mentioned is somewhere in Korea in Korea right now why should we do fool should we play it's not the person right sure yeah definitely all the data are recorded for the although most rising so in the case of the extent is we can clearly identify the problems of the solutions sensor or actuator a software or so I think we can identify the problem source and definitely we can clearly make clear duty for the externality that's more about technical side not not about the technical side more about say that I got accident and the in front of a car there's nobody nobody drive then who should I play shall who should I talk to actually ensure installed all the driving data are collected in the data center provided by the mobility sobs company or automotive manufacturers so you don't need to worry about that has a problem okay thank you thank you that for answering all the tough questions let's finish the session or bye thank you then then all the speakers thank you thank you speakers for your insightful session
