 so you mention what you are saying that there has to be a mode where the system should say there's something wrong some person should take control of the vehicle. So when it comes to autonomous driving we're talking about 5 Levels, and the highest level, level 5 is no driver at all. The driver should not, even gene model, even pattened one design where there is no steering wheel. There's no way a human can drive that car. So in that scenario. It such a mode will be difficult don't you think? then there will be another chance than disable the vehicle that such. So we say, hey we got we encountered something really weird here, it's not behaving as expected and then we can't let it go. Or it can just go at very slow speed or something like that, we don't know. But it always a matter of well in a vehicle with person on board, there will be a matter of life and death probably, that kind of consideration should be taken. In safety, we called it a safe state. Yup, exactly. put it the safety whenever such a thing happens. so yes, so there should be something monitoring what is going on inside that vehicle. And judging whether we are still good to go, or not. And just the type of baseline that should be known, the for use that this thing in moment so that baseline has to be followed. If something deviates from that baseline that means, okay this known as an exceptional situation and we should do that
