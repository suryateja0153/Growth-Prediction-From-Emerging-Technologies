 hey there i have a question for you when was the  last time you vacuumed or even mopped your floor   don't get me wrong i've been there if you're  caught up in all sorts of work normally the first   thing you're ditching is cleaning so today i'm  showing you what smart gadget i'm using to keep   my mess in check so i can focus on  more important stuff than cleaning   what up guys welcome back to another episode my  name is AttiBear and it's been a while since we   talked about smart gadgets so i thought i'd  show you one of the most important members of   my household the deebot OZMO 950 from Ecovacs the  OZMO 950 is the second robot vacuum i own from   Ecovacs and i've been using their robots for about  two years now full disclosure Ecovacs was kind   enough to send me their Deebot OZMO 950 so i can  review it for you probably not too many of you are   familiar with Ecovacs and their Deebots but most  of you will know iRobot and Roombas well in my   opinion lots of the Roombas are overrated and way  overpriced the Deebots mostly are significantly   cheaper can mop your floor while vacuuming  and they come with a wide variety of software   features with that said in today's episode i'm  showing you what comes with the deebot OZMO 950.   i will give you tips for the installation and how  you can improve its cleaning performance and i'm   showing you some of its most important features  so let's begin by checking out what's in the box within the box we are greeted quite prominently  by the OZMO 950 which as you can see is covered   all over in self-adhesive foil so you will  have to remove all of these before you start   your first cleaning additional accessories are a  mopping plate which has a reusable cleaning cloth   already applied to it also included are some one  time used cleaning cloths but honestly i never use   these because i always stick to environmentally  friendly reusable ones then we have the OZMO   950s charging station which not only charges  the OZMO but also enables it to find its way   home once it's done cleaning naturally they also  included a power cable and two side brushes which   are distinguishable through the color coding  on the top in the last box we can find a bunch   of paperwork which sometimes is definitely  needed to get all your ducks in a row here   you also find the necessary air filter a direct  suction option for let's say if you only have   hardwood floors and last but not least two spare  side brushes if for whatever reason you don't   want to use the brush that is included with the  Deebot you can switch to the direct suction option   by removing the brush and replacing the lid when  installing the side brushes it's important to   check for the color coding so the red brush goes  to the red socket and the green brush to the green   socket once you removed all the protective foil  you will find on the inside the dustbin which   actually has a quite nice size because it's big  enough that my 90 square meter apartment can be   cleaned around two to three times before it's full  and i need to empty it you probably noticed by now   that the dust bin comes with a pre-installed air  filter so you have one additional spare filter   within the packaging under the lid of the OZMO  950 you can find a cleaning tool which helps you   to remove entangled hair and dust particles now  before we begin with the setup the most important   thing there is to know about the OZMO 950 is  that it only supports 2.4 gigahertz wifi and   the ssid must be visible also make sure once you  are entering your wifi password that the app does   not put a space at the end of your password trust  me i've been there and this weird behavior gave me   quite the headache before i figured this one out  begin the installation by turning on your OZMO 950   once you heard the welcome music select the qr  code scanner within your app go ahead and scan the   qr code located underneath the lid of the robot  vacuum enter your password and hit next now select   i've switched on Deebot and hit next after that  press the reset button on the Deebot for one   second once you've heard that message select i've  heard the sound and continue now head on over to   the wi-fi settings of your phone and select the  hotspot emanating from your OZMO 950 once the   connection is established head back to your app  the next step takes quite some time but once it's   finished your deebot OZMO 950 is ready to clean  after you're done with your initial setup you have   to choose whether you want to operate the Deebot  in normal mode or advanced mode in my opinion the   normal mode should not be even an option through  advanced mode the Deebot will create a virtual map   of your home where you can create custom areas  set virtual boundaries and no mop areas this   way you are able to precisely define the areas  where the OZMO 950 is allowed to clean and where   not this even gives you the ability to operate  your robot vacuum on more than just one floor if   you're having a house to enable advanced modes  select the three dots in the top right corner   select advanced mode and make sure it's set to on  there are three additional settings i think you   should pay attention to cause they can improve  the overall cleaning performance of your Deebot   number one the water flow level i have set mine  to high cause i noticed when it's set to medium   i'm not getting the best cleaning performance  and especially in combination with floor heating   i think the mop is just too dry and this way  my floors are cleaner the second option is the   cleaning cloth reminder previous Deebot models did  not have this option its functionality is easy yet   super effective after a designated cleaning time  the robot will tell you to switch the mop this   way your floors will get cleaner and you are not  mopping all your floors with a dirty mop the third   option is the auto boost suction feature this  way your Deebot behaves pretty much like a dyson   vacuum cleaner the moment the robot vacuum is  detecting a carpet underneath it it will increase   the suction power and therefore increase cleaning  performance once everything is set up it's time   to start your first cleaning and that's the moment  where the OZMO 950 is going to map your apartment   before you start this process i recommend you  to tidy up your place as good as possible and   remove any unnecessary objects from the  floor this by the way also includes all   sorts of cables and if you're wondering how  the Deebot is actually mapping your apartment   well it's all done through this spinning laser  located in this disk on its head i also should   mention that the cleaning process of the Deebot  is pretty straight forward it first starts with   the boundaries of the room and then continues by  going through straight lines up and down through   the room so it's not going to pace randomly  through your home like some other robots do   after the initial mapping is completed it's time  to leverage the biggest advantage of the Deebot   virtually cutting your home into various  rooms and specifying virtual boundaries   this is something other manufacturers somehow  still evade to implement the Deebot vacuum robots   don't need physical infrared watch towers to keep  them from entering certain areas in your home   just draw a line and they won't cross it in  this example you can see that the Deebot was   not able to distinguish certain rooms so now  we are going to cut up our home and specify the   individual rooms for this just select divide  area and select the area you want to split   now continue by adjusting the line you see here  until it is cutting your room where you think your   room boundaries are and don't worry if you are  not able to cut up your room at the first try   as you wanted to because over the course of time  the deebot will optimize this map and sometimes   if you leave a door open or it recognizes a new  part of your home it will rearrange the rooms   and therefore you will have to get back here every  now and then to correct any adjustments the deebot   made on error and as i mentioned before you can  either draw a virtual boundary with a box or with   the help of a line so if you are using these  the Deebot will not cross any of these lines   okay so much for the features but what about the  cleaning performance does the OZMO 950 reach into   corners and is it going to eat all your charging  cables that are lying all over your place well the   first answer is yes thanks to the two side brushes  the Deebot can reach into corners and areas that   are too low for the robot to reach but of course  the cleaning performance is the best where the   main brush is touching the ground for the second  question there is a short answer yes unfortunately   most definitely it is going to eat every single  small cable that is lying on the floor regular   power cords on the other hand in my experience  were no big issue but every now and then the robot   still tends to get entangled in them one time my  robot ate the cable of the microphone and it has   a serious scar from that encounter which won't go  away anytime soon when it comes to mopping there   is a certain gap between the wall and the mopping  plate so i wish they would make the mopping plate   go further to increase the cleaning surface but  overall i can say that it does a good job cleaning   up minor stains for more severe kitchen incidents  you probably want to run a custom cleaning job   so your robot goes over the surface multiple times  and here's a little tip for you wet the cleaning   cloth before you put it onto the mopping plate  this way you are mopping your floor right from the   start and you don't have to wait till the cloth  gets soaked and yes i'm also using a super mild   universal cleaning detergent in the water tank  even though Ecovacs is only recommending their own   cleaner for me the deebot OZMO 950 is one of my  most valued smart home accessories and thanks to   all of its features and its cleaning performance  it really helps me to win back some precious time   so what about you are you still cleaning yourself  or have you already invested into a smart vacuum   robot let me know if you handle all your tedious  household chores yourself with that said don't   forget to like share subscribe thank you for  watching and i see you in the next one peace
