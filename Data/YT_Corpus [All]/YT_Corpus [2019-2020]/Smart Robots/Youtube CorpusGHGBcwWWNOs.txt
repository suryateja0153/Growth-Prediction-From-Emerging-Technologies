 Theia is a mobility device for visually impaired people. Essentially the best way to describe it is: it is a guide dog in a machine. In order to use Theia the person simply says 'Hey Theia, take me to' - for example - 'Cabot Circus'. From this voice command Theia will then program a  oute much like a car's GPS system but instead of telling someone to turn left or turn right at the right time Theia leads the users around corners and past obstacles. This is done through a unique force feedback system and the best way to describe it is it essentially feels like holding a guide dog's brace or a friend's hand or elbow and that's the key thing - making walking more automatic... making people think less about what they're doing so they can concentrate more on the better things such as where they're going to go in the end. I mean they could be going shopping, they could be going to see friends so it'd be nice to not think about actually walking and think about you know where they actually going. I really do hope that Thia at least becomes an inspiration for people to develop more innovative solutions for blind people to enjoy a greater sense of freedom and mobility that is only previously available through guide dogs. The main intention was never to replace guide dogs but instead to provide an alternative ways or means of giving enhanced mobility options to visually impaired people so for example people who live in high-rise blocks, people who for example can't afford dogs depending on where they live and there aren't any charities... this device is aimed for them and at about ten per cent of the cost of a guide dog it aims to be a more affordable solution for people who can't get their hands on them.
