 welcome back to Bmonster Laboratory today we're going to take a look at really rad robots remote control turbo bot it dances it tells jokes it responds to your voice let's check it out well this is turbo bot i call him turbo for short he's uh we've had a lot of fun with this robot um it's kind of heavy so i do like that about it and i do like the fact that it has this little stopper on the back it adds a little weight to it and it allows him to or it to shift weight and turn and helps do tricks and stuff so that's a good addition so what you'll do when you'll first get this robot is you'll put the batteries in this takes three double-a batteries and they go in right here you just stick your three double-a batteries in there and uh i hope you're still using your uh keenstone battery charger because i absolutely love that charger if you haven't seen the video on that click on the link above and then you'll take your remote control and this takes three aaa batteries and they last quite a while in the remote but in the robot they absolutely drain pretty quick if you use it a lot like we have so this robot has some uh some thick wide wheels and they they're kind of squishy too not real squishy but they have some give to them which allows them to absorb the impact when it falls off the table i had it on while i was doing something and i didn't realize that he just takes off if you don't play with him for a while and that's what he did he rolled off the table and started rolling around the floor saying funny things so that was pretty cool so yeah i do like the uh the nice quality rubber and the thicker wheels the chunky wheels i think that's a great addition to this robot the speaker is also pretty good you can hear him quite a ways away you can hear what he's saying the noises that he's making the thing i don't like about the speaker is that the playback when you when you record your voice it's kind of hard to hear it's distorted a lot kind of muffled sometimes and i played with that at different distances and i still get the same result it's a little bit better kind of like four feet away but really if you're too close it's really bad if you're too far away you can't hear it so so this thing was really built to absorb impact and that's what i like about it and we've crashed it into everything we've been rough with it as you can see we've taken it outside rolled it around in the concrete and it'll get those marks on there you can see the point of contact where it rolls around uh you just wash that off with i use isopropyl alcohol it seems to do pretty well and don't forget to take the uh the sticker off the eyes when you first get it otherwise you won't see some of the blinking and and the different colors in his eyes this robot operates on two channels as you can select the channel one or channel two on here and it needs to correspond with the channel on your remote control right there select first or second channel or one and two the remote control has pretty good responsiveness we can be i don't know 30 40 feet away and it still works so a distance is not an issue and it's comfortable to hold although i think if you dropped it standing up you may crack it and tear it up so keep that in mind you want to be careful with it so on the remote control you've got the speed button here you can go regular speed or you can do turbo so this switch over here controls the sound effects the jokes and the playback if you want to do playback you just switch it over to the play symbol hold that button down and speak so you're in vicinity of the recorder on the robot and then when you press that button it'll play back what you said hello turbo hello turbo hi there how are you how are you how are you okay not the greatest sound also if you switch it over here and you haven't hit the playback button yet he'll tell jokes over and over the jokes are kind of corny dad jokes but i think they're funny hey what's my favorite snack fast food the responsiveness of his voice commands and our experience is that you can't have a whole lot of background noise you have to say it clearly you have to enunciate you know turbo and then what you want him to do so keep that in mind don't get frustrated if he doesn't do it right away turbo dance you gotta say turbo and let him say yo dance so that's an excellent feature we do enjoy that it's fun so this robot will run over different types of terrain it'll run especially in your house it can run over carpet just fine although it's a little slower than if it were running over wood floors it does tricks best on wood floors and doors the thing with that is it goes fast enough to maybe do some damage to your furniture so you don't want to crash it inside that would be a case in which you would slow down the speed on the controller to regular speed if you if you want to use it indoors or if you don't care about banging up your furniture that's fine if it if you're outside with it it does not roll in the grass it rolls great on pavement blacktop concrete whatever anything with a flat surface where the tires can get some grip it'll run on so this is an excellent robot the only issue that i have with it is that it doesn't have enough power sometimes to jump a ramp or go up an incline that may be a little steeper than than normal there you go maybe like 30 degrees you need to really have a run and go at it if you want to make it up that incline especially if you want to jump a ramp or something so the ramp has to be very subtle uh maybe 10 or 15 degrees at most that's good that's a good one do that again and you may also want to keep in mind that as you use it i've noticed that the wheels kind of slow down as the batteries die instead of just flat out shutting off it will lose some power it seems like at least in our experience but this is an excellent robot i would absolutely recommend it to anybody we've had a lot of fun with it and we continue to have fun with it and we'll continue to have fun with it the most interesting thing here is that it says it has 60 plus functions and sounds obviously i haven't explored all those but it definitely makes functions and sounds which you'll find entertaining or kind of disgusting well that's all i have to say about this robot i hope you're having fun with it i know we've had a lot of fun with it it's definitely a recommended buy fun for the kids fun for the family it was programmed by a chicken you know i have sorry about that turbo dance as always thank you very much for watching if you have
