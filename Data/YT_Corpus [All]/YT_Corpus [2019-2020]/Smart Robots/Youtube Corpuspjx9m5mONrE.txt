 Okay so this is King Louie he is an inflatable robot designed by Pneubotics and so we've designed all of the code and controllers that we upload to him to make him move how we want him to move our soft robot research is about making robots that are safe around people,  around people or anything else that you're worried about breaking, so traditional robots are pretty dangerous there's lots of places where we think that soft robots have nice applications when people see King Louie they definitely think the movie Big Hero 6 the hardware was definitely  part of the inspiration for Big Hero 6 and we started our work well before the movie came out the soft robots that we work with are fabric and on the inside it's kind of like a bike tire we have an inner tube in there there's different air chambers you have some that make the structure of the robot and others are what make it move around you can think of just like blowing up a balloon you inflate this chamber on the bottom and it makes this arm move up and to make it move down you inflate this chamber here which moves it back down this research with King Louie is funded in large part by NASA one of the reasons that we have King Louie to be completely inflatable because that means we can collapse him down into really small spaces so for NASA that's interesting because if it's small and if it's lightweight it's cheaper and easier to send it up into space most traditional rigid robots can't take impact so if you're thinking of hammering or trying to assemble things together a lot of times that's dangerous they're gonna break their gears they're gonna hurt themselves we don't worry about that with a robot that's full of air if you look at typical robots in an industrial setting, they're usually behind cages because when people get around robots they get injured a lot of times that's one of the main ideas here is that because he's completely inflatable he won't hurt you obviously King Louie's a research robot but we like to use them to increase interest in STEM fields and so we'll take him to elementary schools and the first thing kids want to do is hug him or punch him that's pretty much okay because he's full of air there's not too much they can do to hurt him and there's not too much he can do to hurt them which is a big change so our goal really is to have soft robots that can interact and work in people's lives we're interested in soft robots that can actually help those with motor impairments that can work in your house because they'd be safe to be around your children or older adults King Louie and just more generally soft robots will revolutionize the way that people interact with robots King Louie really is inherently safer and so that's going to mean that we can take robots out of factories and bring them closer to people and in people's lives interacting with people and helping them in their daily life that's pretty exciting
