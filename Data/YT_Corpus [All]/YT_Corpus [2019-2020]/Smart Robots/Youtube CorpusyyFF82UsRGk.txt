 THE MAKE A WISH FOUNDATION. THE BOYS SAID THEIR EXPERIENCE WAS AMAZING, AND THEY ARE GRATEFUL FOR THOSE WHO MADE THEIR WISHES COME TRUE. IN THIS MORNING'S TECH MINUTE, MOST ROBOTS ARE PROGRAMMED TO CARRY OUT A SPECIFIC FUNCTION, BUT RE SEARCHERS ARE DEVELOPING A NEW SET OF SKILLS. IT COULD CHANGE HOW WE WORK AND LIVE. Reporter: DROPPING THE BALL THROUGH THE HOOP MAY NOT SEEM LIKE A COMPLICATED TASK, BUT IT'S IMPRESSIVE WHEN YOU CONSIDER THIS ROBOT LEARNED HOW TO DO IT ALL BY ITSELF. WE PROVIDE IT ONLY THE GOAL, NOT THE WAY TO ACHIEVE IT OR THE MEANS TO ACHIEVE THE GOAL. Reporter: ASSISTANT ROBOTIC PROFESSOR HENNY MOORE IS LEADING THE STUDENTS WHERE THEY ARE DEVELOPING MACHINES THAT CAN LEARN INSTEAD OF BEING PROGRAMMED TO CARRY OUT THE TASK. THEY USE MACHINE LEARNING A COMBINATION OF ALGORITHMS AND SENSORS THAT MAKE THEM TEACHABLE. THEY CAN ADAPT AND REACT TO A SITUATION, LIKE THIS ROBOTIC ARM THAT TRIES TO CATCH A BALL BY ANTICIPATING WHERE IT WILL BE THROWN IT DOESN'T ALWAYS GET IT RIGHT. OH! CLOSE! IDEALLY THE ROBOT WOULD NOT TAKE A WEEK, BUT RATHER HOURS. Reporter: LOOK AT THIS ROBOT THAT CAN LEARN THE FLOOR PLAN OF A HOUSE OR BUSINESS AND BE TAUGHT TO PICK UP MISPLACED ITEMS IT FINDS. RESEARCHERS SAID A DEVICE LIKE THIS COULD ONE DAY CLEAN UP YOUR HOME, AND MACHINE LEARNING IS BEING ADAPTED FOR MEDICAL USE THIS ROBOTIC ANALYZES HOW THE USER WALKS AND ADJUSTS AS NEEDED. IT'S LEARNING THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE HUMAN AND HOW IT SHOULD REACT.
