 Hey I'm Jason Everett, regional manager at Amatrol. Welcome to ACTE 2019! I'm located here at the Amatrol Booth, and we're showing off our Tabletop Mechatronics, and the unique feature of this Tabletop Mechatronics is it's integrated with the FANUC robot. So this is the first prototype, but one that we are so excited about. This is not only Tabletop Mechatronics but it is a Tabletop Mechatronics that includes Smart Factory, so each point of the manufacturing process is collecting data sending that data down through the industrial network, and network is sending that up to the cloud to a data analytics. What you see up here is iGear Squeaks software, and it's it's an online dashboard that helps technicians see the real-time information from the process. And you can see it's a graphical in our interface that shows the status of the manufacturing cell. That, in a nutshell, as Industry 4.0.
