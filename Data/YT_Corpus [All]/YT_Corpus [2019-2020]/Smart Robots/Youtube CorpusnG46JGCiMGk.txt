 welcome to discovered curiosity my name is Dan and today we are talking about robotics as I can't cover everything about robots in one video hit that subscribe button and bring that Bell and be notified for the future videos that dive further into the world of robots so let's get started did you know that some of the first robots date back to the 3rd century BC while not the robots we think of today they still meet the definition of a robot likely programmed to perform tasks with gears poised or even ropes the human race has this astounding need to surround themselves with technology always wanting the next new thing however surveys find that some 70% of Americans have this fear of robots taking over our lives come on we have all seen the Terminator. And as technology evolves so do robots, today most households have some sort of robot in their home that helps them in some form or fashion we have robots that vacuum our house lower lawns and even play with our children we even have robots that are cars that drive us around and drones that help us perform a multitude of tasks from play to military. Looking at how far robotics has come maybe the Terminator isn't that far-fetched of an idea especially since studies claim that when you're 2030 robots could possibly take over 20 million jobs, but on a positive side hey look these robots they still need to be built they still do be programmed by none other than first things we need to have a good understanding of what makes a robot a robot so a robot is a machine or more tasks most robots do fall into 15 major groups aerospace this category includes flying robots the smart bird seagull brave and surveillance drones and also robots in space such as the Mars rovers and NASA's Robonaut consumer these robots are the ones we buy just to have fun or help with tasks and chores such as the Roomba vacuum disaster response robots these are the ones that we put into the dangerous jobs that we don't want to do such as search and rescue for survivors aftermath and emergencies for example an earthquake and tsunami struck Japan in 2011 that we sent the packbots to inspect damage to the nuclear power station and drove we all know what drones are by now unmanned aerial vehicles drones can come in many different sizes and have many different levels of autonomy education, a broad category that is aimed in the next generation of roboticists for use at home or in classrooms gives you hands-on programming skills and building skills entertainment robots these robots are designed to invoke an emotional response and make us laugh or feel surprised or an awe you'll mainly see these at most your theme parks exoskeletons robotic exoskeletons can give the where more mobility endurance or capacity to carry heavy loads humanoids this is probably the type of robot and most people think of when they think of everyone industrial the traditional industrial robot consists of a manipulator arm and these are desire that perform repetitive tasks over the ones that we don't want to do medical medical and healthcare robots include systems such as the DaVinci surgical robot military and security military robots including such robust as pack five are used for scouting and carrying heavy loads and also research a mass majority of today's robots are born at universities and corporate research labs these robots are able to do useful things they're primarily intended to help researchers well do research self-driving cars many robots can drive themselves around and a greasy number can now drive you around telepresence if you ever wanted to be somewhere but didn't want to be there this is for you Skype ahead a robot this would be it and lastly is underwater the favorite place for these robots is in the water they consist of deep-sea submersibles like aqua not diving humanoids like ocean so if you want to learn more about how robotics work such as components and programming please consider hitting that subscribe button this way you'll be notified when the next part of this series comes out when I dive deeper into the components that make up robots and how they work until next time see you later
