 Hey everyone I built this robot a long time ago this is a simple obstacle avoiding robot with a servo. So I'll just show you how it works I'll first plug in the batteries. This is a pretty simple robot but what I want to do is like add a lot of functionality to it I want it to be intelligent and have like behaviors and certain functions and act according to what's happening in its environment for that I need it to have a few sensors similar to like us humans have like six senses like vision, hearing and a few other so I want it to have like a sound sensor to like detect the noise in its environment I want it to have a light sensor to detect the light and of course it has an obstacle avoiding sensor and I want it to have a temperature and humidity sensor and I want it to like detect edges I want it like so that like I want it to have a functionality that like when it's on a table it won't fall off because it will have edge detection sensors it will have IR sensors to detect the edges and like avoid it from like falling off of a table so let's get started So this is a pretty basic chassis with like a arduino uno, L298N motor driver, 18 50 batteries and I've used this sensor shield it makes it easy to attach sensors because it has all of the positive and ground pins available beside each signal pin and the chassis is like a standard like four-wheel-drive chassis these types of chassis are very popular and common this is a simple voltmeter which shows the amount of voltage left in the battery so it's easy to know when the battery is running out of charge so first what I'm gonna do is like I'm gonna like move the L298N motor driver inside the robot like underneath so that I can like mount the sensors here so I have put the L298N motor driver underneath the robot now as I said before I need the sensors so I need a sound sensor this is one the KY-038 I think and a temperature and humidity sensor it's the KY-015 DHT11 and I need an LDR to detect light this is a module so it already contains the resistor so I don't need to make extra connections I would also use a buzzer so that I can like make the robot do beep beep noises depending on the situation in its environment it would be cool and I need IR sensors to mount underneath the robot so that it can detect whether it's falling off of a table or not so that it can prevent that so for that these are the IR sensors I wanted to like mount the sensor like directly underneath the robot but these won't make it possible to do that and I can't use these as these are for line following it won't work so I need to hot glue them I need to hot glue these underneath like this so here's the hot glue and I'll get started so I will now connect the sensors to the pins of the Arduino with jumper wires so I have connected the sensors into the robot except I have left the temperature and humidity sensor I'm not sure yet whether I'll use it or not so what I want the robot to do first what I want to figure out first is make the robot work like this if the robot does not detect an obstacle it will like move forward like it usually does and if the IR sensors in the back and front detect that if it's falling if the front sensor detects that the robot is falling then it will make the robot turn and then the robot will continue other operations but if the back sensor detects that the robot is falling when the robot is going backwards when it detected an obstacle then it'll just like move the robot front the code will make the robot move forward for some time so I'll figure that out first then I'll like try to integrate these buzzers and these LDR'S and the sound sensor so I'm going to connect the robot to the computer so I have connected the robot to the computer and now I'm going to go to the arduino IDE and edit the obstacle avoiding code and make it work with the sensors and integrate different behaviors into the robot here the robot is on the table and it's reading around like 6 to 10 the values. I need to adjust the sensor when the robot is on the edge of the table the IR signals of the sensor is no longer hitting the ground and bouncing back and the LED has turned off the values are now around 1,000 so that's how we can know that if the robot is like near the slope and is about to fall so let's test the back sensor now instead of serial.print front sensor I'll just do back then upload the code again I haven't adjusted this also .I need to do that so now when the robot is on the table the values are around 7 to 10 and then when I like put it on the edge of the table the LED just turned off and the values are now 1,000 around 1000 that's how we will know if the robot is on on the edge of the table and it's about to fall what I'll do now is like first copy the code and paste it onto a different file and what I'll do now is like figure out how to like adjust the code use some if statements or like how to make the robot avoid obstacles and not fall off from tables like detect when it is about to fall and then prevent itself from falling so update on the robot so it was working kind of like most of the time these sensors could like prevent the robot from falling off of the edge of a table but sometimes it failed sometimes it failed I think because I think I need more IR sensors on like the left and right corners too so I also like broke one side of the robot when testing the robot failed to prevent itself from falling off of the edge of the table and like it fell on the floor upside down and I broke this. I broke this when I like tried to integrate all the different sensors the sound sensor, the LDR and also the buzzer when I try to integrate them into the code at that time it was more glitchy the sensors had a harder time detecting the edges of the table so I kind of like was able to make it work to some extent I need to like improve it in this video I tried to like document my process of like coming up with an idea and like creating something and failure is one of the things that happen in the process of creating and making something so yeah this video was about that kind of I would probably like try to like make a better version of this robot in the future and like make it work completely so for now it's like this I should come up with a name for this robot let's just name it MiniBot 1.0 so probably sometime in the future make this robot better and make a newer version of this robot, MiniBot 2.0 and I would like try to make it completely work with all of the goals I had at the beginning of this video like it having like behavior it's completely broken next time I need to use a whole new chassis, something like metal so that it won't break when it falls when I'm testing the code and stuff like that so a quick note if you want to directly support me and the work I do the videos I create on robotics and electronics please go to patreon.com/aymaanrahman05 and please go sign up for a membership whether it's a $3.00 per month tier,  $5.00 per month tier or even if you want you can go with a $10 per month tier they all come with different benefits and the higher you go on the road of tiers you also get the benefits of the previous tiers as well so yeah if you want to support me directly please go to patreon.com/aymaanrahman05 and sign up for a membership I would really appreciate your support so yeah that was it for this video bye
