 well the increased amount of artificial intelligence used in our DV gadgets is becoming more pronounced by the day its Spartan debater and whether the technology will benefit or threaten humanity as their Oh Sooyoung reports it's giving rise to one more human centric artificial intelligence here's the very bottom that predicts what you want and fetches it for you using a sensor to track your gaze the arm moves towards a box of candies that it thinks you want before you select it this is one way that Professor Henry mone is developing intelligent robots to empower human lives my dream is to have a robot like this help someone have a social meal so you know social meal we're eating but we're also talking there's a lot of conversational dynamics and social dynamics I would love to be able to get this robot intelligent enough that it could help people spear or scoop or twirl food into their mouths when they wanted it and not interrupt them when they were in the middle of having a conversation with the proliferation of artificial intelligence mimicking and emulating humans ability to think perceive and make decisions the notion of human centric AI has become a goal for scientists and the manager of tech companies like Samsung the picture shown here are created by artificial intelligence without specific direction from human beings it was also created without replicating existing work or scanning real-life images it's really a depiction of how autonomous systems are growing in intelligence and Sensibility a large part of that means training AI to understand human behavior anticipate our needs and that's autonomously and even creatively for instance suggesting relaxing activities and bringing over a cup of tea if its sensors were stressed or taking over the role in a self-driving car but a crucial skill of learning to read between the lines and understand nonverbal cues and different contexts is very difficult for machines to emulate through computer vision sensors and algorithms scientists are aiming to optimize this skill and increase collaboration between robots and humans if you're in manufacturing it may be impossible to build a single robot that does all the tasks that a human can do but in coordination with the human being the productivity might be significantly higher caring for the elderly is for sure an important application and building soft robots that even carriers or feeders and help us locomote these are very important robots that we will surely be living with in the not-too-distant future the world is increasingly running on codes from smart speakers to robots that bring us toilet paper and that technology needs to be programmed to work with us and fit seamlessly into our lives Oh Sooyoung Arirang news Pittsburgh
