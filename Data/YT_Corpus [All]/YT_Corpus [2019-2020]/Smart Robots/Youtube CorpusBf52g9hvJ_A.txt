 When we use robots in the lab, if it doesn't do its job, if it breaks, if you need to go and do something with it to get out of a corner, it's not that big of a deal. But in the field when you're when you're talking about these, literally life-or-death situations, then it really changes the equation; really changes the balance of what you want to try. Anything that we do with them can't have any potential for reducing the quality of care. From the College of Engineering at Oregon State University this is "Engineering Out Loud".
