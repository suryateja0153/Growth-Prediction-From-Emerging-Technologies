 anyone who's ever tried talking to their smart vacuum knows that robots are horrible at conversation when is it ever gonna ask me about my day well this robotics engineer is making robots much more personable our robot invasion is upon us prepared to surrender to artificial intelligence these dangerous machines won't be stopped turns out I was wrong about robots so I'm talking to dr. Ayanna Howard she runs the human automation systems for humans lab at Georgia Tech I guess it's not an invasion after all about the age of 12 I was into science fiction so anything that has superheroes and action heroes and robotics and at the time there was this one show where there was a woman she was horribly mangled in an accident and they put her together with Bionic parts and I was enthralled and fascinated and so that's what I wanted to I won at the bill the Bionic Woman which eventually became doing robotics her latest mission is to program robots to be more human-like so they in turn can be better teachers to humans confused I'll let one of dr. Howard's robots show you firsthand my pleasure to be here with you today I am a humanoid robots I can walk talk see here this is how I express happiness Hey okay this is how I express fear no no everything's okay and here is how an express confusion it's a really good impression of me that was incredible how long did it take for this robot to learn how to do all of that I would say the robot with the grad students to three months what role playing isn't the only thing this robots being programmed to do let's take for example turn-taking I may want to teach you how to take a turn like how do you exchange information what if I gave you something what would you do if I held out I would take it exactly so how do we take that interaction and teach our robot how to do that knowing when it's appropriate to basically take something versus just grabbing it I wish I had a robot when I was a kid I didn't learn how to take turns until senior year of college how will it be useful for robots to interact more human-like so what we know is that when a robot is emotional and can do things like sharing knowledge turn-taking listening I give a question listening for the answer the children learn better they teach the robots human interaction by showing them tons and tons of data in this case it's images of people sharing that way the robot learns the social cues associated with sharing like offering food or panting someone a toy that way the robot learns to share and can teach the children how to recognize the social cues of sharing whenever we have a experiment what we do is as we bring in cameras to observe people moving and so we collect data in terms of visual we click verbal in terms of how we talk because there are some cues we look at gestures and our hands moving and we take that and we classify what happens in the moments that something happens in terms of turn thinking have you found that maybe adults interact in ways that are more difficult to get data from or difficult to track what we see so far is that adults are actually easier to track but they are different in terms of how they interact much more subtle well with you at the helm I'm sure pepper will have no trouble picking it up with ease thank you so much dr. Ayanna Howard for having me you have a really really cool job if you need any actors for the robots to watch you know to be like really super humans I'm really good at acting like in humans yeah so just hit up my agent or manager I'm gonna be huge in the robot world
