 steam series championed by your Southern California Toyota dealers every week we're celebrating people making a difference with steam careers today's focus is math and engineering and cbs2 meteorologist Amber Lee takes us inside the lab of a professor of mechanical engineering these kids in this room are the brightest of their generation we essentially turn on a zero radius this is the mechanical engineering design lab at the California Institute of Technology it's one of the toughest classes at one of our nation's most selective universities we don't go for a second place you go for first you go to win professor of mechanical engineering Michael Mello is guiding teams of students as they prepare for competition they've had to develop MCB aspherical we took the Toyota mobile weather lab out to Caltech to see how dr. Mello is preparing the next generation of robotics innovators not only do they mechanically fabricate a robot they have to come up with ways to digitally communicate with the robot this class teams if students have to do it all their assignment create robots from scratch that can shoot Falls and retrieve them while moving through the campus pond I don't care what your widget is you need to devise a widget that is going to withstand the rigors of the environment that it is meant to live in the team that scores the most points by hitting their targets will win throughout the design and building process there are plenty of tough decisions like speed versus accuracy also materials that may be easy to fabricate could break when a robot goes fast a scissor lift like this which has a shooting advantage could topple if it's windy dr. Mello says dealing with these dilemmas are great practice for real-world careers what we want to produce our engineers that enter the world understanding the challenge is to actually translate a design into something real innovators who understand as they design a product what dimensional accuracy can I reasonably attain what can I expect a machinist one day to do for me of all the steam disciplines successful robot creation relies most on engineering and math we never can get away from those foundational courses dr. Melo says it's the mathematical formulas that help mechanical engineers speed the future that's the foundation right why things fail as these students work to perfect and predict how well their robots will perform in competition dr. Melo is working to make sure he's doing his job pushing these future captains of innovation and Industry to realize every bit of their extraordinary potential and there's an enormous obligation to these kids that I feel every day it keeps me up at night many students in the program have gone on to work in robotics for companies like JPL and nasa for more on steam careers go to cbsla.com slash steam
