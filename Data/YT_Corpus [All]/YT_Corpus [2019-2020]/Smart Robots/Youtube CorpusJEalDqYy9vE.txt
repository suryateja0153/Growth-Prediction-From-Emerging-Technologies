 imagine working with the robot colleague or a boss now this might have seemed far-fetched in the past but now with the fast-paced AI development it might become reality faster than expected but where does that leave the human employee and their role in the workplace our Oh Sooyoung has more face for the future of automation taking over the workplace how can we safeguard human jobs as artificial intelligence combined with smart devices and very BOTS continues to evolve it's not only manufacturing jobs that human workers are expected to lose robots and automation are about to leave controlled environments like factories and warehouses and enter into unstructured environments like schools our highways and streets our hospitals and in that transition robots and automation are going to start to affect lots of new sectors of the economy by 2022 the World Economic Forum projects 75 million jobs will be lost with data entry clothes and administrative workers topping the list of replaceable positions there seems to be no way to prevent automation but only looking at the jobs themselves may be counterproductive experts are suggesting we should focus on tasks rather than jobs so for instance if you think of radiologists a radiologist has many tasks so the task that relates to looking at an image and making a diagnostic can perhaps be done by a machine because machines now are very good at at image recognition replacing that task image recognition by a machine would release time for the radiologist to do other things perhaps perhaps better it's not all bad news automating repetitive tasks frees time for more creative roles and even new occupations that don't yet exist some 133 million new positions according to the World Economic Forum experts say businesses shouldn't only set out to maximize profit with machines they must proactively seek new rules for their employees and for training on support to help them sharpen their skill sets I think that people will see very rapidly this displacement start to happen in about five years so I think there will be a lot more pressure on governments to move once people start seeing jobs displaced because ultimately the economic incentive to displace people is going to be unlike anything we've seen since the last Industrial Revolution social protection is also needed in the form of policies to ensure workers and their livelihoods are not displaced by the wave of automation Oh Sooyoung Arirang news
