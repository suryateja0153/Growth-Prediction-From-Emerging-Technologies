 machines have been taking on human tasks for centuries and people and societies have always adapted what makes today's digital revolution different what does the increasing role of automation of robots mean for how people do their jobs we found some answers in a Portuguese metal joining factory about fourteen percent of jobs in osed countries are highly automated Oh another 32 percent of jobs could face substantial change in how they are carried out Automation is mostly affecting manufacturing jobs in agriculture but some service jobs are highly automated too and we have found that the highest risk is in routine jobs with low skill requirements and often low wages help ease by performing these steady and constant very demanding fast we're doing such a repetitive work translating that you're tired probably not very happy in Valle de Cambra a rural area in northern Portugal a small company is testing collaborative robotics for humans and machines work together exactly with the advanced algorithm portals by planning and illusion avoidance it's reality not only could employees benefit from automated help but companies benefit to using robots can improve productivity and boost profits robots are built to work even when humans cannot qualified performance they would have investing in technology investing on people's know-how people here to make this happen investment in innovation and training within small and medium sized companies is needed creating stronger links between schools and Industry can help it is estimated that more than 3 million industrial robots will be in use and factories around the world by 2020 a global figure it's says a 14% of jobs are at risk of automation but when you deep dig deep into the regional disparities that ranges from 4 to 40% so I think the emphasis needs to be in terms of what we do to support those areas that are at greatest risk what's happening in Valle de cambra shows us that technological change can be about collaboration rather than elimination Automation is a risk and it is higher in some regions and communities than in others but at the same time we know that new tasks and jobs are also being created and these are often ones they're more difficult to automate so we need skilled workers for these jobs and firms that are ready to use them to not only help lose productivity but to improve workers lives [Music]
