 Brace yourself the future is coming faster than you might think. Welcome to MojoTravels, and today we're discussing how robots are taking over travel are you a fan of our videos be sure to subscribe to mojo travels and ring the bell to be notified about our latest videos for this list we're looking at the various ways in which robots futuristic tech automation and artificial intelligence are poised to drastically change travel both at the industry level and for people embarking on a trip robots behind the counter as robots become a major part of the travel industry the biggest and most in your face change that travelers are likely to notice are well the robots various hotels cruise lines and airports have already brought robot employees into the fold to serve a wide variety of roles the Royal Caribbean cruise line has introduced a Bionic bar where two robotic arms can mix up a wide variety of cocktails in record time including custom orders over at the Marriott Hotel in Ghent a robotic concierge in mascot Mario helps at the front desk perhaps the most famous such example is the robotic front desk staff at Japan's Hana hotel which is staffed by robotic humans and dinosaurs to handle check-in the hotel opened in 2015 and it's inhuman staff members are notably imperfect but the novelty largely makes up for it and regardless of their shortcomings it's not hard to imagine them being quickly replaced by far superior such examples as the technology is fine-tuned tech-savvy employees behind the scenes slowly but surely we're gonna be seeing robots filling a wide variety of travel related roles understandably like with many industries automation and artificial intelligence within this domain has people feeling concerned about their employment prospects globally across all fields the McKinsey Global Institute estimates that automation could claim up to 800 million jobs as soon as 2030 within the travel industry specifically this will likely result in a substantial shift in what skills are required of people being employed by hotels Cruise Lines airports travel agencies and more a large segment of the human workforce will no longer be making customer service their top priority but rather work behind the scenes knowledge of digital technologies will become essential for people currently employed in the industry this is likely to be a difficult transition though a robo dominated feature may seem far-fetched many believe it to be as inevitable as when computers were placed typewriters a balance of high-tech and human touch while robots can do many things better than humans adding a personal touch to a hospitality experience isn't among them right now robots that interact directly with customers are largely coasting on their novelty factor - employed by InterContinental Hotels and a loft hotels Butler handled basic room service and deliver toiletries directly to your room these little robots are adorable but problem solvers they most certainly are not similar room service and luggage carrying robots have been employed at various hotels but again they have notable limitations luxury comfort and attention to detail for many travelers can make or break the experience these are the cornerstones of the hospitality industry as such we expect to see a specialized division of labor moving forward robots and AI will be charged with doing the heavy lifting grunt work and bringing high-tech touches like voice commands smart recommendations and more humans for their part will be freed up to be more focused on customer satisfaction than ever ensuring that travelers get an unprecedented level of individualized attention a new burden for guests and customers there will always be an important role for human employees to play in the travel industry but if we've learned anything from the widespread adoption of voice menus it's that cost-cutting automation is often rolled out even when it inconveniences the customer so while robots and automated systems will make our lives easier and more efficient in many ways it does all place a burden on the customer or guest you need to adapt to the robot and communicate on its terms and using its language much like we've had to do with Siri Alexa and Google home a human has the ability to interpret what you're saying and appreciate tone and body language with robots at least for the next few decades it will fall to the consumer to ensure that they're communicating what they want clearly and unambiguously many interactions or offers like recommendations will need to be sought out rather than brought up because the concierge thinks to mention it increased efficiency and productivity we already seen how technology can vastly improve the efficiency of the travel industry for companies this has taken the form of everything from online bookings to inventory systems for the consumers advanced check-in and travel apps mean far less time spent waiting in lines or doing rigorous research as robots are brought into the fold and artificial intelligence becomes increasingly common we can expect the entire travel industry to become more efficient as far as robots are concerned they are streamlined and single-minded approach to various tasks while not without its drawbacks will see many tasks take a fraction of the time they currently do with robots doing the more rudimentary tasks hotels are likely to be cleaner than ever but this is true of many subsets of the industry airports are beginning to employ self-driving buses and snow plows to clear runways robotic luggage is also poised to become the next big thing in consumer travel tech and be it at an airport museum hotel or on a cruise ship a robot that can communicate in dozens of languages is a major asset apps chat BOTS and AI recommendations this is all arguably both a blessing and a curse as previously mentioned dealing with a computerized menu no matter how they dress it up tends to be frustrating but a robot or automated systems ability to pull from the entire internet of knowledge well there's no concierge travel agent or industry expert who can compete with that even more compelling is the ability of artificial intelligence to make personalized recommendations based on your own travel history and preferences if you regularly fly with a certain company stay with a particular hotel chain or use travel apps that personal data can be used to personalize not only your experience with said company but also help you to get the most out of your trip robotic travel agent assistants like Amadeus can similarly get the ball rolling in terms of trip planning from restaurants and bars to sites attractions and live shows robots and programs armed with the right resources can make all the difference and while chat BOTS may be imperfect they keep getting better when given the choice between waiting on hold with an airline for an hour or speaking to a machine the latter doesn't seem so bad design will become increasingly Robo friendly perhaps will one day have robots that are more mobile than humans but for the time being they tend to be rather bulky and limited in their bill to navigate an environment as such though it often goes overlooked the increased presence of robots within businesses and spaces associated with the travel industry will see those spaces undergo a fundamental shift in design philosophy hotels airports and even airplanes will need to be laid out in such a way that enables robots to get from point A to point B and complete their assigned tasks to run and maintain a robotic workforce the facilities need to take into account space for their storage maintenance and any auxiliary equipment or systems and it's not just as simple as building a dedicated robot elevator hallways dining rooms and lobbies we'll all need to be laid out in such a way that the robots can do their job without ever getting stuck or bottlenecked by guests or passengers for existing hotels they'll either need to renovate accordingly or bring in robots specifically designed to work within the limitations of the existing infrastructure it's gonna be a robots world do you agree with our picks check out this other recent
