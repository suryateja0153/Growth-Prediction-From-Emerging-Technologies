 hi my name is shane king i'm a phd student at  vanderbilt university today we'll be discussing   the question what are robots sometimes our brains  quickly jump to sci-fi movie-style robots when we   hear the term such as this robot made by honda  called asimo and while some robots like that do   exist many more exist that don't quite resemble  that concept for example these are manufacturing   robots constructing a car very different  from asimo so then what makes a robot a robot   generally robots can be described as something  that works on its own to help complete tasks and   as seen in this clip these are tesla manufacturing  robots that are helping to construct a car   this allows for cars to be produced easier and  more quickly with substantially less people   working on the task but completing tasks isn't all  that defines the robot i'm sure you guys can think   of many things that complete tasks that aren't  robots and sometimes robots aren't even any good   at the tasks they're supposed to be completing  and make a lot more of a mess than they're worth however another way of thinking about robots is  what makes them up robots are a combination of   three parts mechanical electrical and computer  programming the mechanical parts consist of the   structure and the components that make it  move such as motors and drivetrains and the   electrical parts consist of the electronics  and sensors used to control the mechanical   parts and take in information on what's happening  around the robot finally the computer programming   is like the brains of the system and it tells  the electronics what to do to control the robot   another key concept to understanding what robots  are is understanding the difference between   passive and powered devices passive devices  don't do anything on their own they always need   someone's or something's help and generally  are made up of only mechanical components   powered devices however can act on their own due  to the addition of electronics and programming   think of the difference between these two  scooters the scooter on the left requires   the user to push the scooter with their  legs while the scooter on the right is   electrically powered and therefore can  move on its own with just turn of a knob   robots much like the scooter on  the right are powered devices   another way to think about robots is to compare  them to ourselves we too are powered devices so   to speak however we rely on our intricate network  of muscles to provide that power and make us move   our muscles and our skeleton are our mechanical  components while our nervous system and sensory   organs are the electronics and our brain is  the computer programming so to speak that   controls it all unlike us however robots use  actuators such as motors instead of muscles   to produce their movement which can be used  in many different ways such as to create   movement that looks like human movement  like the robot from the beginning asimo or   to make movement that looks very different  from ours say like a self-driving car another important element of robots is that  they're made up of inputs and outputs inputs   control the robot and tell it what to do while  outputs are what the robot uses in response to   complete its task by interacting with the world  some robots such as this washing machine are   simpler than others in that their input tells  them when to start and then sets them off on   a predetermined path until the task is presumed  to be accomplished in the case of this washing   washing machine is no way of knowing if your  clothes are clean it just does the same thing   every time and assumes that it will result in  clean laundry it is no feedback to let it know   if it's actually accomplishing its task this  is referred to as open loop control because   there is no feedback to close the loop to ensure  the task is complete on the other hand a roomba   would be considered smart by comparison because  it's able to use sensors to map out a room and   determine where it is already cleaned and where it  is not yet rather than randomly moving about the   room hoping it covers all the area this allows the  robot to ensure that it has completely cleaned the   room before moving on or stopping this is referred  to as closed loop control because the feedback the   robot receives ensures that the task the robot  was assigned is actually completed so this has   been a brief overview as to what robots are  however if you want to learn more about what we   and at vanderbilt do with robots check out  rachel teater's video on wearable robotic devices
