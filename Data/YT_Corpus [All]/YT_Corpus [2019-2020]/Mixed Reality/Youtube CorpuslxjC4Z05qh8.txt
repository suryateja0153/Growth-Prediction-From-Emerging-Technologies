 Airbus is a company designing, manufacturing and servicing commercial aircrafts, helicopters, military aircrafts, satellites and launch vehicles. For the coming years, our challenges are huge. We have in the last four years delivered 10 000 aircrafts and we have to deliver twice that amount in the next 20 years To face this challenge, we intend to make an intense use of mixed reality. And that's why we've started partnering with Microsoft. Mixed reality can help us to increase quality, safety and security. By having the right information in front of the eyes, the level of human error is significantly reduced. And in aerospace, an increased quality is an increased safety. I think the maturity of the services like Azure remote rendering, of special anchors is key to give us a guarantee that we adequately use the Hololens 2. I mean it's key to have the right data flow, it’s key to have the right rendering, it’s key that the person using it, finds himself or herself in the right environment with the right quality of data and therefore, quality of visualization. So it's absolutely essential. The advantage of the Hololens 2  in the design process is mostly in the validation phase when the designer needs to know whether his or her design is really fit for industrialisation. And this is hugely accelerated by 80 percent. On the manufacturing side, we use Hololens 2 to enable the workers to achieve complex tasks or tasks that require an intense reading of documentation while finally they’re hands free and they can access complex areas, they can handle heavy parts while having all the information they need right in front of the eyes. So we strongly believe that mixed reality can bring improvements up to 30 percent of some of our industrial tasks. So this device, as such it’s very powerful and thanks to Azure mixed reality services, we are getting the power of it.
