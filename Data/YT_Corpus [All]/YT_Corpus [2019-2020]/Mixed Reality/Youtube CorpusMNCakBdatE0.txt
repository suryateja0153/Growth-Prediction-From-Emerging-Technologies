 My name is Judith Merritt and I am the Head of Talks and Exhibitions here at the National Theatre. First of all just to say we are so overwhelmed by the amazing speakers we have here today. It's so brilliant to have people that you aspire to, that you read, and think: Wow! They are here in the room with us today, so how brilliant for us all. And for us an organisation like the NT it's really vital to have good relationships and strong relationships with organisations like UAL. We spend most of our time preparing for 2,500 people to come every night to see a show, to see something. You know [we are] in rehearsal, and there's another 20 being teed up. There's three in rehearsal, there's three on the stage and there's three being made, so our world is full of that. It's not full of thinking about what we're doing and analysing it, so that's why it's brilliant when there's people here who do that as well as making, and also kind of considering, and they have time to pause. It's no wonder that a place like this is known as a factory for theatre. Some people do call it a factory. It's all made on site, as you may or might not know. You can see it being made as we speak, right now, upstairs from the backstage, Sherling Walkway. So it's so important for us to join together and very much have a vital, kind of two-way relationship. Of course the NT has an ongoing interest and I guess [a] relationship with what design is. And right from its kind of early origins has [done] so. From the deep history of the Jocelyn Herbert archive which is situated just a couple of minutes away, and the NT archive to the Linbury Prize for Stage Design, which you can see the exhibition upstairs at the moment where twelve young emerging designers get the opportunity to work with a UK-based theatre company and then one is realised as a production, so we're still in that thing up with what was design, what is design, where is design right now? Before I hand over to Eileen in a second I wanted to just tell you about three things that are available for you to see today as well as in this room out in the wider world of the NT. If you want to see props as I said being made right in front of your face right on today - upstairs on the Sherling Walkway, you can see that you can see the sets being constructed and put together. It's always open, so if you are at the NT at any other time, nip up there and just have a look and see if you can work out which show is being made in front of you before you look at what show is being made in front of you. As I said the Linbury Prize is on upstairs. One interesting thing from the Linbury Prize, we did it two years ago, and we do it this year. Two years ago one of the students that was involved in the finalists, the twelve finalists, chose to use AV in a production, this year [it's] four. So you can see where things might be going as we move through to our future. The other exhibition that's only in the NT is 'Costume' at the NT. Really important obviously. For a lot of people with clothes, come to theatre. Question for us all myself and colleagues are around order to help you we have lanyards on there's no plans fire alarm and the thigh that we all know like to welcome a little bit I mean I'm hoping pasture and fine arts and theater and the symposium is a second series it's part of the public program of Camberwell Chelsea and woodland and the person is staging real which address different approaches to representation and reality both price and presence and today we explore the boundaries between real and virtual worlds on stage I'm going to say something very briefly about the designer Australis and without her remarkable archive and funding from the roots in Hopkins foundation and Olympia trust we actually wouldn't order it sitting here today and I'd like to acknowledge her influence and the organizing the organizer of today's symposium dr. Matthew first came to take Dustin's archive in 2013 right it was at Wimbledon as Judith said it's now at the national theatre archive circuit designs for Samuel Beckett's plays and George davines correspondence about the productions I'm going to quote Matt now I'll admit I went there with little knowledge about Herbert or set design more broadly so what the archive did quite emphatically was introduced me to the world of theatre design and wavered I had a Caprice eh at the for the artistry the clarity and the elegance of those designs has made a lasting impression on me and it's not an exaggeration to say that working on the archive then in subsequently as a postdoctoral fellow has reshaped my perspectives on theater design theater practice and teaching theater chemistry's another colleague has used Dawson zartra archive a lot is on prize-winner design I've got Pacific Jung he was sweet nature today about her performance company Seven Sisters she worked on Dustin's archive on her PhD which examined key developments in theater design in Britain between 1935 and 1965 and when she was a Justin Herbert fellow she produced an interactive website about the role of the theatre designer I asked one of his daughters Sandra rusada what she thought Justin with no food at all and she said her first reaction which I think that they were all completely mad but then she would perhaps secretly be very pleased that her work has remained relevant I sure that Justin would want to raise a glass probably at senior we celebrate the fact that sophie has been appointed as the senior lecturer and for being a theatre designer at Wimbledon and the match has been appointed as lecturer in theatre at red and University she would be very cheered at her work has contributed something to those two achievements she would have very much liked the project that we do it here with PhD students from when we're going in the archive the project combines research into Justin's work understanding historical works in their social and political context getting students to create new work from materials from the plants they also learn how to use an archive and to make presentations one of which you will see later today there are lots of plans for the future rememberings partnership with the national theatre archive will support the latest developments at room with them which all to do with creating an integrated environment the collaborations between all the theatre courses design acting technical arts and performance I thought to thank all the speakers in advance and the setting that and our administrator Gabrielle rigor Java who is always fantastic to work with thanks also to inspiring colleagues National Theatre jutted marish and Aaron D and finally my lovely co-conspirator and Charlie Thank You Eileen who is the Dean of camber well Chelsea and performance he has identity politics he's been called away to an urgent meeting at UA L the topic of which Simon was going to say I think in terms that thanks so I'll cut to something I know that Simon wanted me to mention on I'll do that very briefly which which are all the recent developments across camber world Chelsea and Wimbledon and the formation of a new school of performance based at Wimbledon a performance school basically staging mixed reality which is now the norm in so much theater production has prompted much thought about how these new materials of the stage affect a performer and we asked the question are the old ways of training actors fit for purpose now so into the well-established and I say internationally recognized mix of design and making courses at Wimbledon we've now introduced two new courses ba acting and performance and be a contemporary theatre and performance I suppose part of the questions underpin those courses what does it mean to be an actor working in the midst of these multiple realities on stage as Eileen says that the courses adapt adopter an integrative approach with young actors working alongside stenographers and video designers and designers for film and TV I think what it shows is that the interdependence of all the elements that make up the performance event how changes in in one element have a knock-on effect on all the others including the performance and of course also in including the audience and I think that's one if it's going to be one of the threads that might run through today how do these new they're not new but how how is that now these technologies which are so common how are they affecting our ways of seeing and hearing what happens on the stage or in other the actual environments so how we see and how we hear and I'm really looking forward to listening and seeing the stellar stellar cast of of of practitioners and scholars that we have with us today I know it's going to be a fantastic
