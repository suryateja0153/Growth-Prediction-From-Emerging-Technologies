 hi I'm John Tran from Carrasco mines today I'm showing you the first step towards making mixed reality group of medication adapter to the human mental world imagine a scenario in which you are collaborating with Arabic teammate in this certain rescue mission if the robot senses are highly ambiguous target it might use a complicated description what it can be confusing research has shown that the use of physical petting gesture suggests pointing enables more natural and effective interaction however not all was a pond what if we pair language with rigid gestures such as arrows so that targets are picked out in a humanistic view we have ah decide that pairing lain with with these gestures can simplify the robust language instead of saying a complete description they're working to say I find a victim over there in point to the heart to describe target additionally our previous work suggests that vicious gestures in language may be highly sensitive to the humans mental wonder if you have a hard time identifying a target the robot might want to use only verbal language if you're not able to hear the referring expression the robot might want to rely on visual communication my crane will try some acid is two overarching questions first how do different types of mental workload impact the effectiveness of different robot communication modalities second how can a robot select the effective robot communication modality given information regarding his human teammates level and type of mental work note as a first step my Latin is an I design a human subject experiment in which the participant gets to wear microsoft hololens and play a game with their whatever the participant is main task is to pick and play some virtual objects into virtual pins as suggested by the robot to test how human perceived searches the robot occasionally interjects with a secondary task it would use a combination of language and visual Chester to ask participant to place a different plot into a different bit further we want to test how these strategies are affected by the users mental workload we systematically vary several elements within the primary task to manipulate the participants enter world we are still analyzing our data but our brilliant Emily result suggests that different communication styles were needed to enable better task performance and the different types of mental workload thank you for listening to find a more read a favor didn't have any question or suggestion let's chat by email or Twitter thank you
