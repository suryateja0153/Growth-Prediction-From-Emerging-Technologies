  Mercedes Benz has been around for 140 years and we always strive to deliver the best technology and the best experience to our consumers. Our technology is advancing; how we communicate with our dealers, and how we communicate with our technicians. I think the biggest challenge technicians have now is the complexity of vehicles. We deal with hundreds of cars everyday. Whenever we need help with a vehicle that we can't figure out, we will get assistance from MB USA. Sometimes it'll take awhile to go back and forth between a case because I can't make it to my computer or they're busy with other cases. Using Dynamics 365 Remote Assist, it's allowing our technicians to be able to service a vast number of dealerships in multiple locations without them having to leave. So we're able to actually cover the country in a much more efficient way, which increases customer satisfaction. The most important thing is efficiency. We can have an engineer from Germany, we can have an engineer in Jacksonville, having all the support in the world combined at the dealership. I can just put it on, get immediate support. They can literally point things out to me as I'm looking at it. They can circle it, they can draw lines. It's hands-on, it's literally right there, I can be talking with him going through the vehicle in real time. It's very intuitive. It's already cost savings for us, but it's ultimately a bigger cost savings for the consumer and the dealer. This is probably one of the single most important inventions that I've seen. The HoloLens and Dynamics 365 Remote Assist has just been a game changer in this business.
