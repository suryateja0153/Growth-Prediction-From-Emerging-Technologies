 I dream and I envision. I work with amazing craftsmen and artisans that help me out in finding the best pillow, the best stitching, the best color, the best way to give shape to these dreams. And what we want is our people, our consumers to live that dream. I've been working with our partner, Hevolus, on a new customer journey using Microsoft HoloLens 2 and Azure Cognitive Services, giving consumers an idea of their ideal homes in a way that makes them fall in love. We let them walk their home virtually. We give you the emotional side that makes you feel that, "Yes, I want to buy it". We know that we will reduce the closing ratio, at least one-third, which is what we really want. The HoloLens And Dynamics 365 Mixed Reality gives us the opportunity of showing the collection without boundaries. it gives us an incredible opportunity to lower the stock and inventory of every store, to lower the space and architectural investment to set up a store and increase dramatically the sales per square foot. We are looking to expand into downtown areas where spaces are too small to have our classic store format. With HoloLens 2 and mixed reality we could have a very tiny space. We could be opening a store without products anymore; less inventory, less people moving product, less back and forth of floor sample, so the concept of a store clearance might die because your inventory is going to be virtual. Microsoft has been a great partner, we've been quite fast in translating a vision into something real. When you see what you dreamed and what then came to reality, and you see the reaction of people appreciating what you did, saying, "Wow, unexpected," that makes our tears and blood and passion worth the time that we spent.
