 (funky music) - Are you acing Expert Plus in "Beat Saber?" Bringing the heat in "Superhot?" Well, it's time to show the world. The Oculus Mixed Reality Capture Tool from Facebook is an application that lets you capture full live action video with your actual beautiful self superimposed right inside VR. You're going to need a reasonably powerful PC, at least 16 gigabytes of RAM, SSD storage, and a 1080 graphics card would be a good place to start. You'll also need a camera that shoots at least 1080p, and 16x9, and an Oculus headset connected to the same five gigahertz wireless network as your PC, plus a green screen and good lighting. A lot of people assume that you need the Oculus PC link cable, but you don't. First, you'll download the MRC tool from developer.oculus.com. Open it up and connect to your Oculus Quest device. Follow the steps to calibrate your headset's position relative to your camera. Once that's ready, you'll set up the other important application, Open Broadcaster Software, which is also available at developer.oculus.com. Then, it's time to dive in. Make sure you have an MRC compatible game actively running in your headset. There's a list at oculus.com, and voila! You're ready to start creating awesome and engaging VR social content. Good lighting of the green screen is key, and don't worry if it doesn't look amazing at first. You're, you know, green. You'll get there with a little practice. And before you know it, I'll see you in VR.
