 [Music] hi everyone and thanks for joining today's insight Tech Talk I'm David Iger with insight public sector which is the government facing side of insight and with me today is Matt fedorovitch it's a national lead for immersive technology within our digital innovation solution group Matt how you doing today good how are you no not too bad not too bad so today we're here to talk about mix reality in microsoft's hololens - both from a commercial and from a government perspective you know really to kick things off Matt can you tell us a little bit you know define mixed reality versus maybe the better known virtual reality or augmented reality and which are really the better known terms in the industry yeah so we definitely have a lot of alphabet soup in district today and mixed reality and hololens - Hollande's - is a mixed reality device or what's also known as a spatial computer so we have this spatial computing spectrum and if you thinking about VR virtual reality it's basically taking - a fully immersive environment or removing your physical world which is one end of the spectrum and when you go to the complete opposite of the spectrum there's obviously a reality there but within mixed reality we're gonna basically take you as close to reality as possible within an immersive environment that's leaving your physical environment to basically have interactions different types of activities and immersion and so on so it's more of a mixed reality kind of way yeah well I know that mixed reality at least the concept has been around you know for years really and I know devices like the hololens - have done a done a lot to really move it to where it's more of a reality in using in business cases today and really helping people enable the benefits of mixed reality but what are some of the other differentiators that you've seen come out definitely the first party apps that are being built and the applications that are being built for the device itself are the differentiators for instance remote assist is one of the biggest applications out there today it's personally I have a conversation about that pretty much every single day and remote assist is really in a hands-free collaboration tool that leverages existing infrastructure that business is already using today but gives you a fully hands-free mixed reality collaboration experience which is really helpful in today's world where we're unable to fly experts to locations we need experts to be on call all the time essentially and remote assist is there to help well I think that's a good transition you know because of the current state we're in with travel and what are the applications for this device that you're seeing in the marketplace yeah there's a lot of different applications for this and there's different segments and different industries I mean is that this device can be used within any industry right we talk about manufacturing retail healthcare is one of the biggest the federal space if you look at healthcare today for instance we're working with a lot of major hospitals today to provide that remote assistance perience basically to take one doctor place the hololens on their head and have a team of 14 doctors and another part of the hospital who aren't going to be exposed now and that one doctor is floating around the hospital going patient to patient while those 14 doctors are talking to them giving them the instant patient information things along those lines and collaborating so it's really really powerful in that industry also when you talk about training you know you look at the federal space for training you take a look at soldier based training whether that's it kind of in the in-flight in the in-house or actually on the field there's two different things there you can do a lot of a lot of data interfacing as well there's a lot of data on the battlefield specifically and all that needs to be translated in real time into an interface that's going to be easily consumed and something like a mixed reality tool is really powerful for that yeah yeah you know you mentioned military I was talking to a major in the Air Force and she as a fighter pilot training and she was saying that because of applications like the microsoft hololens and the data that they can get you know they can determine things like fatigue for example or response times and what this enables them to do is really have more of an objective response so if they see someone training to be a fighter pilot it's no longer subjective saying well you know I don't think you're going to make it you know maybe let's focus in this area now they can get real data where they can say hey you know because of the fatigue level you get we see your response time slowing down you know this really probably isn't the right area for you to be and so it saves a lot of time it takes out a lot of risk because you know you don't want to find out when you're thousands of feet up in the air and a fighter pilot and and something goes wrong so definitely you're right on the military application I think it's a great way to one save a lot of money but also really help target people in in that real-world environment without without putting them in harm's way so no that's fantastic yeah and you have to think about return on investment yeah in efficiency as well right because you think about there's two different types of efficiency that I see quite a bit it's either we're gonna go towards machine efficiency you know uptime downtime how are we gonna manage that and then that's all around data visualization and understanding data in real time but then there's also the human efficiency model where the device itself could be a tool to help you help people basically be guided through a large facility you know he guided through the battlefield providing different visualizations and data points that they've never seen before because they've always been invisible you know they were stuck in in the cloud or on IOT devices and not really present and that's another piece that mixed reality brings the play is all that visualization power essentially right on your head yeah yeah no definitely and I I see a lot of that from the training aspect being able to incorporate device with remote assist you know getting people out to where they're training and and being able to work on what would normally be you know millions of dollars of assets doing it in more of a mixed reality to again cutting down the price enabling people to mess up without it having catastrophic consequences so no I agree 100% there's also the question in terms of reliability security scalability of the cloud AI services how does that factor in yeah it definitely factors in when we're talking about enterprise you know a lot of the times when we have conversations with clients I make sure that their internal IT groups are always on the call because we always have this conversation about device management network security you know user profile to the information sharing how are we gonna deal with privacy and things along those lines and there's a lot of tools that Microsoft already has in place like a tune for instance where you're doing all your network security and provisioning and stuff like that with Microsoft devices today like surface and that's easily translatable onto hololens to because it already is a Windows machine essentially and then we're also bringing out new products to light like autopilot and things along those lines are going to make mixture out even more powerful and a lot easier to consume from your team essentially so you put the device on and you're ready to go out of the box so it's it's definitely something to think about when you're dealing with scale I'm gonna start bringing this to your business today yeah definitely a big time saver so and the time we have left really where do you see this technology having new or future impacts yeah I is we live towards you know the the middle of the decade and towards the end of the decade the adoption rate is going to be exponential for the enterprise space we're gonna have a lot like you know new devices that are gonna come out there's going to be an acceleration in that side but then we'll also see the consumer side start to trickle in as well and that's going to be kind of the same pattern that we had with mobile right which is you know turning it into bring-your-own-device moving into the enterprise space so it might turn out you know not only are we gonna be bringing devices from the enterprise specifically but there'll be personal devices that are gonna have to start accessing things so it's just a new generation a new wave of computing that we just need to start managing and I think it's going to be really interesting as the consumer the enterprise spaces start to heat up where a lot of this technology is going to land and a lot of this data is going to land yeah yeah and I see the same in the federal space as well the government is is really taking advantage of these technologies getting people trained quickly in a safe environment but making sure that they're fully ready to do their job when they they get out in the real world so I agree 100% well hey Matt thank you very much for your time I think it's been very insightful pardon the pun thanks everyone for joining today and we look forward to seeing you in our next Tech Talk yeah thanks David
