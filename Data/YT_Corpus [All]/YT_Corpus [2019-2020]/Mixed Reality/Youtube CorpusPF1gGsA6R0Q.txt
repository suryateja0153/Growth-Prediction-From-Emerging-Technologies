 so hello everyone my name is Dan schmidt from the University of Hamburg very happy to be here today and to share one of our latest projects with you which is about blended agents and I think a good starting point to explain this concept of blended agents is to think about the realism of virtual agents in general so if you think about realism of agents you may think about their visual appearance so do they look photorealistic or not or you may think about their movements or their behavior is it natural do they have a natural gazing behavior or is it more like a robot or you may also think about the quality of speech so is it more like a real speaker or more like artificial sorta fued synthesized and actually in all of these dimensions of realism virtual agents became much better in the last few years so I think it's reasonable to assume then at some years or at least in some of the Cades we can achieve results which are very close to recorded humans so here for example you can see that we already have the methods and computer graphics to create results which are very similar to humans the only thing is that it's not in real time but I'm pretty sure that we can achieve this in a couple of years so somehow we could assume okay in some years we have a perfect copy of a real human but I would argue that's not a case because there are still some differences between virtual agents and our real humans and one of these difference is when you leave a virtual environment as a user usually not only the virtual agent is disappearing but also everything the virtual agent did in the virtual environment so every proof of existent of this virtual agent just disappears when the user is removing his headset or if he is leaving a cave for example and the reason for that is that we have an assumed three between real interaction partners and virtual interaction partners so real interaction partners usually can influence both physical and virtual objects so for example virtual objects by using tracking systems or sensing technology but on the other hand virtual agents usually can only influence virtual objects so it's much harder to implement interaction between a virtual agent and a physical object and with the concept of blended agents we want to fill this gap between the virtual and the real world so we define Lennard agents as agents that are capable of changing properties of real-world objects and actually there are only a few examples of similar concepts two of them on this slide and actually both of them are from the group of our session chair rick welsh so he can see two examples of virtual physical interactions the first one is to walk the table and the second one the physical virtual table and in both cases the virtual agent was able to change the position or the pose of a real physical object so on the Left example it was the table itself and in the second one it was a small token physical token which was used in the context of a tabletop game and in our project we want to extend this work by introducing a second form of virtual physical interactions so these interactions were focusing on the location of an object and now we want to introduce interactions without which are focusing on the surface material of such objects and we do this because we think that if a virtual agent could change the surface material of an object then we could have a change which also persists when the virtual experience is over so for example if he could ride on a real piece of paper and this is resistant then a user could take this piece of paper out of the virtual environment and we think that this could add a new quality to virtual agents so these are the two forms we wanted to consider in our experiments so we wanted to compare them and therefore we implemented two setups the first one was a robotic ball and the second one at other thermal table and I want to show you very shortly how these prototyping setups looked like so you can imagine how they worked in our experiment first the robot iqbal and this was something we didn't invent ourselves it says farewell mini so this is a robotic ball with an outer shell in the shell there's a weight which is motorized so by moving the weights you can create a weight shift and therefore the entire balls moving on a crowned plane the contribution in this case was that we implemented a JavaScript API so it is now able to we are now able to send controls from a humiliation in order to synchronize the physical movement of this ball with for example the animation of a virtual agent the second prototype we build was a little bit more engineering work so we wanted to find a material which as affected by external stimuli and we tested a lot of different smart materials materials which were sensitive to temperature to UV light also to fluids and in the end we decided to use thermochromic ink which is an ink that is invisible if you heated up above a specific activation temperature and our case it was 47 degree of self degrees Celsius and if you cool it down again then it gets visible and in this case we used a particular meant so you can see it here it's right below the surface of the Talmud table and by a microprocessor we can change the polarity of this pecky element so that it both can heat up or cool down and the idea of the setup was that you have to prepare a sheet of paper with something written on it with thermochromic ink then you can heat it up so it gets invisible and during the experience when the virtual agent is writing something we cool down the Petit element and therefore this writing gets visible again so you can already see that there is a limitation because in this case and now we have to prepare the writing otherwise we cannot make it invisible invisible again but I will talk a little bit more about this at the end of the talk so we have some ideas to change this but this was the first proof-of-concept and now we wanted to compare both forms of virtual physical interactions so we conducted a user study and for this user study we invited 40 participants to play mini golf match against virtual or blended agent it was a little bit of a tough decision if you want to use within or between subjects design in the end we chose between subjects design because we think that if you have a direct comparison between a virtual agent without any virtual physical capabilities and a blended agent then the results will always be biased so we used between subject designs although we know with 40 participants it's more like a pretty preliminary study because for final results we would need more than 100 participants we designed the study with four different conditions so we had these two prototypes the robotic ball and determine table and with these we could have a golf ball which is physical or virtual and we could have handwriting which is virtual or persistent when the participant entered the virtual environment in this case it was a cave he first saw a mini golf course and this was also physical so we had physical obstacles a physical hole and also the participant was playing with the real golf ball and a real Golf Club and then he prepared a scorecard on the terminal table so he came into the room there was this terminal table with the empty sheet of paper on top and together with the experimenter a scorecard was prepared so a table with the names on it and length spaces for the scores so the user could see that in the beginning there was nothing on this paper afterwards we had different rounds sometimes the participant was playing sometimes the agent and he can see a condition with a blended agent so in this case the agent was playing with the real golf ball and we used motion capturing to have animations which which are synchronized with the predefined path of the physical ball when the virtual agent puts the ball into the hole he then went to the terminal table and he first Rhoads discovered surely so we wanted to do this because you can see here we wanted to have to write an animation path so not only the end result but we wanted to have a smooth animation so first discovers virtual and after some time it was replaced by the physical score so the virtual score faded out and physical scar appeared so in the end when the user was leaving the cave the virtual environment if he had this condition with physical writing he could take the scar cut and still see the scar after this experiment we measured two different things so we had some observational data but we also asked the participants to fill in some questions regarding social presence facial presence and also ecological validity engagement I just have two examples here but I think they are quite representative for all of the questionnaires because as you can see the results are very similar for all of the four conditions so actually we couldn't find significant main or interaction effects for these five subjective measures and somehow this was of course not expected so we thought that there will be a difference and what was also strange for us is that we had additional open questions in the end and in these questions the users who experienced physical handwriting or also the physical ball were very enthusiastic about the experience so they said okay it was very memorable it was more meaningful that without a physical handwriting you are very surprised and many of them also mentioned that it made the virtual agent more realistic but in the so this is not matching the subjective response in the questionnaire and of course we were wondering why is this the case and we have different aspects discussed in the paper one thing is that maybe you saw in this diagram there are some ceiling effect so for example for engagement we already have scores which are very close to the maximum but one thing I think is very important is the expectations of users so do users expect virtual agents to have physical virtual capabilities and I think the answer's no users don't expect this so none of our participants experienced something before which was similar so usually the experienced virtual agents which are only capable of influencing virtual objects so they don't expect that and this is what's also shown during the experiment because some of the participants even tried to fill in the score for the virtual agent because they assumed he cannot do it himself so I have to help and out of the twenty participants who experienced the physical handwriting only seven even noticed that the handwriting was persistent so 13 of them took the score card went out of the cave and then they didn't notice that this score was still there so we asked him afterwards and then there was super surprised and that was super cool but during the experience they didn't notice it at all because they didn't expect it and I think if you don't expect this then if it's not there you don't read it great it's worse than if it's there so this may be a difference to within subject design because they have the direct comparison but for between subject design you don't have so for future work we want to do a follow-up studies I know that you always have to tell that you do some follow-up studies but in this case we really want to do it because of course we see that there is potential we got a lot of positive feedback but we couldn't show any differences so what we want to do we want to measure objective things so we did it a little bit in the first study but now we want to focus more on its like the gazing behavior of users so we already observed that users seem to focus more on the virtual agent if he has some virtual physical capabilities we also want to change the scales of the questionnaires a little bit so what we observed is that usually when we had a scale from 1 to 5 for the realism of an agent for example people wrote in the open question like ads was much better than any agent I experienced 4 out of 5 and then we had others who said like ad it was better than a robot 4 out of 5 so it was quite similar and we think that maybe we have a higher crannie hilarity and mistress in these scales and maybe the responses are more meaningful to us and the last thing we want to change is to make the interactions a little bit more meaningful so in this case the scorecard could be taken home as a souvenir so this was suggested to the users but they couldn't use it afterwards so maybe if you have like a map and the virtual agent is showing you the directions to a specific place and this might might be more useful and also then it's not only interesting when you experience it the first time but also for the second third and the fourth time so this is something we want to work on and the second thing we are currently working on which is maybe not super scientific but we really want to have a terma table which is interactive so this was a huge limitation that we always have to prepare this call before we can show it and now we are working on an extended CNC machine so you can really write something during the experience and I think this adds a lot of quality if you can say hey my name is Susana and then he's just writing it in real time I think this would be a nice thing to have and why we want to do it now yeah and this is what we plan for the future so thank you a lot for your attention and if you have any questions I'm happy to answer them [Applause] it's so stimulating I really enjoy that I have questions sorry thanks for what is my I've been working with connoisseurs versus naive people in VR and there's a big difference in VR I think the overwhelming experience of just being in the cave for some people might be why your result potentially can be skewed have you tracked experience of your test subjects we didn't track it although we excluded everyone who was working in our group or in the rear in the context of our group because we think that this would change the results completely so we only asked students our visitors from other groups and most of them experienced it for like first two third time I think so there were not regular users of virtual reality applications but you're right what I was a little bit surprised of that even when it which tested it before with our group members they were really excited so even for them it was something new and they didn't expect it but you're right that maybe it would make sense in the future study to also track that so how is the experience level of those participants and yep now thanks for the question beautiful work and so I have a question I might have missed that when during the experiment when the agent was manipulating the real golf or versus virtual golf is the human participant the same like playing a virtual or real actually the participant was always playing with a physical golf ball but this was also something interesting interesting maybe it would be a different result if you have like a shared interaction space so that the virtual agent is using the same object as the real user in this case it was just a little bit difficult to implement so we thought about it but we really think that this robotic balls are not made for using them for playing but maybe the other way around would be interesting that the participant is also using a virtual ball and yes good question yeah thank you another way to do the writing would have been with a tablet right and you could make that sort of interactive user could write and the virtual agent could write do you think that would sort of suffice as an interactive component or do you think that the physical writing where it seems magical is better we had a lot of discussions about this my personal opinion is that it makes a huge difference if you can see the technology or if the technology is hidden from the user so I think for helping users so for example of the virtual agent is working in the tourism center and helping the visitors a tablet would work as well and I think for some applications this is also the future because you can just maybe also take your own smartphone and get the directions on your own personal device but I think and for having this additional realism of virtual agents it helps that you don't see the technology at all so that it's hidden from the user that experience walk away piece of paper that had been pulled up put in the pocket and take out favor I will get me that people after that experience just somehow something that happens persist encouragement or something actually many of the participants of the physical handwriting condition took the scorecard home although it has didn't have any value I think that many of them did it and I think this is a good time actually
