 Hello everyone, thank you so much for being here. This is the last presentation of the conference so today I'm going to be talking about designing for mixed reality at Osmo. My name is Tony Aube and I am a staff designer at Osmo. I've been working there for about around four years now. For those of you who don't know what Osmo is it's basically a mixed reality gaming platform for the iPad for children and the way it works it's super simple is that we add a reflector on top of the iPads camera like this and from there we can see what's happening on the table and we build all sorts of puzzle and educational game games and application for children so we have like the puzzle game we have the word gamer so we have coding games number games and so on so the way it works is very simple as I said it's just a plastic mirror that we put on top of the iPad and from there we can use computer vision to understand what's happening on the table so Osmo has been around for about four years we've grown to about 80 employees and we've been selling in more than 50 countries and we're being used in more than 30,000 schools so I think we've been fairly successful and today I want to break down basically all the design decision that we've made in the past four years and basically try to understand why these design decision made was most successful and also talk about some of the lessons learned along the way so here's how asthma began Osmo is the brainchild of primer and Jerome were the two cofounders of the company and I really want to mention then because a lot of their super early stuff I'm going to be presenting today was done by them and I just want to make sure that proper credit is given to them so the project began when promote was at Google working on the technology that scans thousands of books per day and the idea was very simple it was to use the same technology but apply it to the iPad so this is the very first Osmo prototype as you can see it's the same idea with the plastic mirror and from there the it's the idea that you can interact with the iPad using any types of cards or hardware and so the founder started with this idea and they wanted to create a real business and a real product around it so they asked themselves a super important question basically it was what's the purpose of Osmo and to me this is probably the most important question you should ask yourself before you start working on anything and usually the answer to that question is much harder to define than that you might think but when you find the answer to that question it's just going to make the other design decision along the way so much easier so for Osmo the purpose the whole point of doing this is that it's a hands-on product that allows you to interact with technology so from this understanding came all of the other decision for example this led to the decision and focusing on younger children because as you know it's super important for young kids to be interacting with their hand to develop the key motor skills and hand-eye coordination all of that so at the time that was also it was about the time where iPad were becoming to be very popular and parents were starting to realize that this is a really addicting device and there was this whole problematic of screen addiction so there was an opportunity to make Osmo a healthy kind of compromise between screen time and healthy real world play so this idea of building a hands on product led to all of the decision of making a product that's for kid that's educational at that's fun something super important also that the founder realized is that Osmo is a completely new type of user interface and I mean in the same way of a mouse or a keyboard or a touchscreen these are all user interface and while we're pretty able to use a keyboard or a mouse today ozmo by the fact that it was completely new at the time there was not a really strong mental model on how to interact with it and I think this is the same thing for any type of VR or AR projects basically for most of the user that's going to be a completely new type of interaction and thus it's super important to focus super early on on design and user experience so from here the design the founder made five key design decision that looking back I believe made us more and much more successful product the first one was to remove the vision markers on the hardware so as I've just shown these were the first tiles from Osmo and as you can see there's all this small a kind of QR code on that on the tiles so the team works super super hard to try to remove the DS and as you can see as soon as you remove them the product becomes so much more magical and so much more beautiful and the reason for that is that whenever you work on mixed reality or augmented reality it's a bit like making a magic trick people don't really understand how it works and that's kind of the way it should be if you show all of these small QR codes that's a little bit like a magician revealing its trick and it's a bit unfortunate also another key decision was to remove the whiteboard so as you see here the first version of the game had this plastic whiteboard on the table and once again the team works super hard to try to remove it and suddently the product becomes so much more magical so much more interesting it just opens up the play area to the entire table and this kind of enabled many different new type of interaction for example this idea of slide sliding the tiles on the table however the whiteboard was very interesting in the sense that it kind of helped the user to understand that for example if a tile is outside of the whiteboard it's not going to be picked up by the iPad so if you remove the whiteboard then you have the problem that it's not so clear anymore whether the tile is within the play area or not so the way we solve this was with the design of the Osmo base so as you can see the base here has two very sharp edges on both side of the bases and this kind of naturally subconsciously communicate to the user the size of the play area so this is a good example of using Hardware design to solve a software problem another very important decision was to remove electronics so a lot of people will come to us they ask if we've been using for example Bluetooth or any types of electronic with hoor hoor hardware and the answer is no the only thing that we use is computer vision and this gives us a super important competitive advantage compared to some of our competitors such as make our blocks for example so there's a lot of projects on the market that tried to do a similar experience to asthma but they use electronics and this means that the hardware is super complicated and costly to produce and manufacture and on the other end ozmo all we do is using plastic and wood so the piece the hardware is super cheap to produce and in the end we can sell a similar experience for the same price but our profit margin is much better which means that we've been able to survive for the past four years whereas a lot of other projects just went silent and the darky design decision was to remove the screen interaction as much as possible and this goes back to the idea that was mu is a hands-on product so it will have been a little bit on for tonight to have this kind of product where you interact mostly with the screen so and this is also a great way for us to differentiate ourselves from other products from for example games on the App Store that don't have a very good reputation among parent so for example this is a pizza cooking game and the way it works is that the character asked you to cook a pizza and you just add the tiles on the hardware and it would have been very easy for us to add a big green red button on the screen like this that then sends the pizza to the oven but because we want to stick to the hands on interaction we came up with this solution which was just sliding the pizza on the table which pushes it on the oven in the screen and this is just a simple way to keep the children focusing on the core of the experience the experience which is the table another super important decision and this one is a little bit more of a business decision is the idea to sell the hardware and give the software away from for free so the way Osmo works is that you can buy the physical pieces in store both on Walmart or Target or online and once you buy the game basically all of the apps that come with that game are completely free forever and this goes back to the idea of trying to build a healthy product because we're being paid upfront for the game we don't need to resort to all these kinds of microtransaction to try to get more money from the users so we don't need to do this kind of dark patterns that a lot of other games employ and this helped us to create a much healthier type of product for children and this is something that's very dear to the people at Oslo because a lot of these mechanism that games for children that what they use is straight up from the casino industry and you will never bring a children in the casino but for some reason children are allowed to use the apps on the App Store for example which are exactly the same so in short Osmo has no vision markers no whiteboard we just open it up to the table no electronic we try to minimize as much as possible the screen interaction and we sell the hardware to put the incentive to have a healthy product next I want to talk about the design process and once again I go back to the idea that asthma is a hands-on product so whenever we start designing a non small game we always start with the physical pieces and then we build the software around it and not the other way around and something else that's super important is that the hardware must be fun on its own so no matter what we work with whether it's play-doh or puzzle piece or pencils we always want to make sure that the interaction is fun on its own and then we can make sure to build a nice experience around that cards are a very fun type of material to interact with so when you give cards to children they're going to shuffle them they're going to throw them on the table and it's just a lot of fun to manipulate so that's what the reason why the the very first Osmo prototype used this kind of cards and so this one was another of the very early as more prototype and it again it's a super simple idea you have musical instrument on the table and you push them in front of the iPad and then the iPad is going to play the music so we tested it with children and all of the children just hated it so it was a complete disaster it didn't work and the reason why I didn't work is that the children just didn't understand why they couldn't just tap on the screen to make the music play and this kind of made a lot of sense to us like why go through this whole process of using AI and computer vision and tires and all of that when you can just tap on the screen and get the same experience so this led to the third realization which is probably the most important thing you can keep from this presentation is that whenever you work on some sort of mixed reality or AR the combination of the digital and the physical components must be better than the sum of its parts and this is what led us through the first well done Osmo prototype which was the tangram game and the idea here is super simple you have the tangram puzzle on the screen and you build the the puzzle on the table and along the way it gets on feedback and when you complete the puzzle you get some nice rewarding moment and maybe you get a little bit of score tracking and then you get the next challenge after that so I think this was the perfect first game for Osmo and there's a lot of reason for this the first one is that this is super intuitive I can just show this picture to anyone and they immediately understand how the game works and so this is something that I always try to keep in mind when I work on these games is I try to think of it in terms of that photo and I ask myself if I show a photo of the game to people are they going to understand the interaction but even more importantly the combined experience is better than the sum of its parts and what I mean by that is I could just go to the store and buy a tank run puzzle with a ten game book and I will have a lot of fun on my own or I could go to the App Store and download an tangram game and I could also have fun but to me combining the two is a very good example where the experience is better than the sum of its parts basically this is where the digital and the physical multiply each other so every time we try to create a new a small game and I think this is a sign for AR we always ask ourselves the question could we create a better experience that is screen only or could we create a better experience that is only hardware and if the answer is yes to any of this question then we're just not going to do it because we know it's not going to be a great Osmo game now I want to share a little bit of tips and tricks about designing Osmo games so the first one is super simple it's basically paper and cardboard so whenever we have an idea and we want to try it really really quickly what we do is that we just build the prototype using paper drawing on it and then we're just going to play it out on the table maybe we can bring events on new people to try to experiment with it and it's just a quick and easy way to explore the idea the second one which i think is something that's super important to me and I use it a lot is the use video so for this one I'm going to give you a concrete example so about six month ago I was most lying a partnership with Disney and the challenge was to try to make a drawing game that will make drawing fun and accessible for young kids so we tried a lot of different prototypes and most of them didn't work out but this one was very successful so I'm just going to play you the video can you draw some hair in Angers head turn it again have hair so what's interesting with this video is that it's basically completely fake the way I produce this as I just sat down on the table in front of the green screen iPad and I printed out a sheet where I just pretended to be playing the game and then I brought all of that into after effect I just composited the UI the animation I did some voice recording with some of the Osmo employees and ultimately I ended up with a very nice video that I could then show to the stakeholder at Disney or internally at was Moe and just ready everybody behind the idea and personally I come from the web and mobile design industry and in web design or mobile design you got a lot of awesome tool to create prototype like envision for example where with maybe five minutes of work you can get a fully working prototype on your phone that you can just test with anyone unfortunately in augmented reality and mixed reality you don't have any of that so you kind of need to find clever ways to explore the problem space and communicate your ideas with the team so to me personally I think video and after effect is such an awesome tool because that shows it allows you to show not only the digital experience but also the real world experience in front of the screen so this interactive drawing game idea ultimately became Osmos super studio which we just shipped last month another idea that I like a lot is what I call Wizard of Oz so this was another eye that I came up with when working on the on the Disney game help Dory find her friends use the magic pencil to find them so as you can see this is kind of five words we'll do with a mixed red tea twist and I really love this idea and then I wanted to try it with children to see how they will react to it but once again at this time in the project there was no engineers it was just me as a designer mostly working on stuff so I still went ahead and produce interactive prototype to try with children but basically what's interesting here is that there's no working prototype the way did that is I just connected my computer to the iPad and I was mirroring my photoshop up into the screen and I was just looking at what the kid was doing on the table and was trying to match the proper feedback on the screen and this completely worked none of the children I tried this with understood that they were not playing a real game and so to me this was a very good example of a way to quickly test an idea without requiring any engineering work if I try to build a prototype like this using for example unity and computer vision this will have been probably like a week or two of work only to test an idea whereas this prototype which I build in maybe four hours was enough to try out the idea and so the way did that is I just used an app called duet to do screen mirroring and photo shot on my computer and ultimately this look and find game became Osmo detective which is another game that we've just shipped actually last week so I think the lesson here is to always try to find locus way to explore your idea and communicate your ideas with the team and the stakeholder and also try to avoid going with engineering as much as you can because engineering is very time consuming and in this space you need to iterate very quickly to find something that works and usually if you can bypass all of this it's going to go much faster another thing that we use a lot internally at Oslo is QR codes so earlier on I show how we try to hide the QR codes from the hardware but when we're prototyping our games we just embrace it so this is an example of a music game and as you can see we just printed some like visual codes that we just stick on a straw and some like piece of hardware and from there it's very easy to build working prototypes so the way it work is that we just had our engineers build kind of a support for this different type of QR codes like these ones and then it's possible for any engineers to just implement the game with unity using this code without having to do any deep computer vision or AI work so the lesson here is to try to build the infrastructure that's going to help you iterate as quickly as possible even on the engineering side finally I want to talk a little bit about play testing I think play testing is super important and that's something that we do very nicely I think we play tests every week so every Thursday no matter what I'm working on there's going to be children coming into the office and I can just try out any idea that I have to make sure that it's working nicely so something that's really nice about that is we have someone internally with the coordinator who's going to take on the whole logistics of making this play test happen and so we reach out to Paramount on Facebook and we just come chat with them and we make sure there's a constant stream of children coming to the office every week and from there we can just test the game and we realize that like plenty of stuff that doesn't work like children cheating like this to progress faster in the game and we also record all of these these play test sessions and when they're play testing everybody can just tune in on their computer to watch the play test and everybody does it because it helps everyone from the team to build empathy for the problems and for the users so play testing I think something that's super important to understand is play testing should not be an event it should not feel stressful it should not feel like something that's complicated it should be something casual that you just do every week and the best way to do that is to remove the burden of figuring out the logistics from the creative team and also something that's super important to me is everybody should play this the designer obviously but also the engineers the project manager everybody should try to build empathy to the design problem and try to figure a way to solve them and finally try to record everything it makes it makes it so much easier to go back to the video and watch where the whole thing break down finally I want to talk about some of the mistakes that we've made over that time and more particularly the first video that we tried to ship the game with so this video is a complete disaster it cost something like $30,000 and we never use it and as I'm going to be playing the video I want you to try to understand why it wasn't working so sign note when we launch the product the company was called tangible play and at the very last minute we swapped it to us mo so it was kind of a crazy time so did anyone figure out why the video wasn't working yes that's true we got this comment as well yeah I think the big problem with the video is basically we just never took the time to explain how it works so when we tried to show it to parents they just didn't even understand the product and there's a couple reasons for that the first one is that nowhere in the video did we show the iPad I think we show it like twice for like one second at these two months and one time it's in the back super hidden and the other time it's super zoom in so you can't even recognize that there's an iPad in the video and the second problem was that we tried to convey the magic of Osmo and the way we did that was by adding all of this kind of like weird visual effect on top of the video so that was kind of the way we poorly try to communicate the magic of experiencing Osmo for the first time and that didn't work at all because when we show the video to parents for example they thought that the pieces when you connect them they actually make lights effect like this and at first this kind of blew us away but this was also a super humbling experiment for us because we understood that like when you work on things unlike mix reality or augmented reality for most people like they've never seen something like this before so whatever you show them they're just going to assume that's the way it is so it's super important to think about this and be super careful about the way you communicate your idea and your projects so what we did is we went back to the drawing board and we we shut the video and other time and this one was so much an improvement over the last one so as you can see in the video we really take the time to break down how the product work how to build the set up we show the mirror we also show the hardware we show that this is an iPad game so you see it tapping on the screen and when the girl is playing you see a like we really really take our time to show how to build a 10-gram and we also focus on the iPad showing the feedback from the screen and the lesson here was that like you don't need to add any type of like special bells and whistle you can just break down how the product work and if the product is good it's going to speaks for itself so I think the lesson here is just whenever you come up with something that's completely new that hasn't been done before it's super important to communicate to your consumer how it works and why it worked that way and also let the product speaks for itself so you don't need to add like crazy things or crazy visual effect just show it like it is and it's going to work and finally it's super important when working on these kind of projects to always try to communicate with photo and video so mixed reality is as much about the digital component as it is about the real world and I find that photo and video are just the best way of communicating that so in conclusion today I've shown a lot of different tips and tricks for designing for Osmo some of the lesson that I've shared is to always start with the hardware and build a software around it not the other way around hardware must be fun in its in itself if not then no matter how much software or game mechanics you add on top is just not going to be as fun the combined experience must be better than the sum of its parts that is super important if you can come up with a better screen only or physical on the experience then it's not worth trying to do a mixture at the experience video is your best friend both for exploring the problem space also about communicating the problem the the project to your teammates and also to the stakeholder and also about communicating the idea to the consumer as well play test every week try to make play tests a casual thing it should not be stressful it should not be bored and Sun and finally let the product speaks for itself you don't need to add crazy visual effects to make it more interesting that it is already and finally always start with the purpose like why are you going to work on this and finding the answer to this question is pretty hard but once rabbit super-easy it just helps with solving all of the other design decision that are going to come up later down the road so thank you so much is there any questions we have five minutes and there's a mic here if you want to ask questions yeah yeah we work with teacher we have a lot of people that interact with us they asked us for different games and we always try to build the games whenever possible that try to match the curriculum of elementary schools yes and also I want to mention we have a SDK so if you ever want to try to build for Osmo you can just visit that link and we're super collaborative and we can help you achieve your ideas using the Osmo platform thank you so much the iPad has changed quite a bit since you first started has any of the camera improvements or anything like that change your change the code you needed to write or anything like that so yeah the camera has improved a lot which is great because right now we support all the way down to iPad 2 by the camera an iPad 2 is extremely horrible so it's a little bit of a miracle that we can make it work so every year our works become easier thanks to the new camera and also at the new technology for example that Apple is making like a our kit and however the design of the iPad I've changed a little bit over the time for example they just came out with a completely new iPad which as the camera is much higher up so that might cause some problem and we're going to need to solve that on the hardware side of things but we're also constantly trying to improve the hardware to make it work with as many device as possible have you had to make any of the hardware obsolete not now so I serve the first version of the hardware and it still works but probably for the future iPad which have a much lower bezel we're going to need to come up with some different and yeah thank you so much
