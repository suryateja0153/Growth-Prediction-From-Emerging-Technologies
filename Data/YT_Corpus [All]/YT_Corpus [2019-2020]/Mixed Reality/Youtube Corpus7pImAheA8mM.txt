 all righty so how's everyone doing good um by the way guess what's next you ready for this you ready for this power apps but also mix reality at the same time so I've been waiting for the session all day because I want to make sure that everybody in our build audience understands how amazingly epic it is to be able to make low code apps for mix realities so that anyone in the world can use mixed reality to solve their own business problems please welcome our two wonderful friends Michael O'Connor and Ken eluate hi folks hello hello hello Wow no good you look on this like fancy screen this is cool yeah I don't see you again you nice to see you again so poor Michael has been called by me like 10 times to come speak it's tough because I always say Michael you gotta come show this team or you have showed that team so thank you so much for doing this again um you know it's the unfortunate part of working on the coolest tech in the whole world just saying so yeah so tell us tell us a little bit about ok so I will go on talking about mix reality forever but rather than that Michael do you want to just give us an overview on what is even going on how this technology works and then Ken if you wouldn't mind just you know showing us some stuff or whoever wants to show us some stuff as you know Microsoft has several investments in mixed reality I'm a halogens of course is the most well known and we were just looking at some of the professional developer capabilities in terms of building experiences for that so what we're here to talk about our house citizen developers who have no experience with mixed reality can it can release mixed reality apps within their experiences easily I love it so how does this tech work what's a built on well what we've done in order to start with is is we've built a abstraction layer on top of a our core and AR kit on smartphones and then we've typed that through the power apps Native Client and built PCF controls on top of that and so that means that we can take advantage of everything air core Eric it has to offer and make that available - - citizen developers within power apps longer-term will be will be investing in other technologies like WebEx our and Babylon native in order to help extend those capabilities and make development simpler I love that that is super cool and for all of you who don't know you know anything about pcfr all of these things these are power apps component framework where anyone any dev in the world can make components stash them in a component framework and then citizen devs can just use those components within their apps without having to open up visual studio but this is really really cool because you've taken it a step further and said not only are these just normal components but they are actually mix reality components so now people can bring in 3d objects into their world without actually having to you know make 3d objects and bring them into their world so that is fantastic do you first of all anyone can now do this right you're in public preview it's in the in the power apps settings page I just saw it that's right this is available as an experimental feature right now in all production environments around the world okay fantastic do you want to show us some stuff because the visuals on this are so exciting sure so I'll just share my desktop here real quick and show you and can you please jump in and say things yes I I will keep talking forever um so I think Michael is gonna show you the power apps gallery control that we have so this is the standard control that's inside of power apps in the canvas where this is a scenario where we've loaded a series of models they can be anything from a bookshelf or robotic arms it's a forklifts I think the last episode we should connect with that Plex team for sure when the gallery is loaded we're looking at images the first place we started was adding a 3d viewer control yeah and when we can consider certain Saros here that are gonna be helpful or customers when they just want to look at the model inspect it but I can take that further with the mixed reality control and place this robotic arm into my factory yeah and this is just an example of how someone can go through a placement scenario and drop in a model into their space and this is such a useful scenario for everything like factories and manufacturing plants like this but also Julie Strauss showed the hospital beds in Swedish hospital this morning I thought that definitely goes through a whole range between products sales manufacturing space planning there's a whole wide route use of these and part of the reason that we've approached this the components the way we've done it is to extend power apps there's a basis for how we looked at it there's a single component that you can make for power apps to allow a citizen developer to make something there's templates like the gallery which link things together to get a wider range of capabilities and we went one step further and Michael will show another video where it's more in the end-user experience there's a full like a simple thing for someone to add into their power app and they get a full on experience and it's a good way for us to get signal from customers and see what's important to them okay fantastic so Michael show us the other one the end-user experience well I think the idea was here we have the studio experience and so that is is that we wanted to make the mixed reality experience is something that we're really easy to plug in and immediately add value instead of having to go off and build some complex scenes and those sorts of things so the example here is we're taking one of the sample apps that's provided by my power apps and we're just giving it a mixed reality capability in a very very simple way so in this particular example it's all about doing estimation estimations of the size of a room so that they can provide estimates and so traditionally of course they would do this with the tape measure and we've added this new mixed reality measure in M our component that allows them to just drag this button over here put it on the page sort of resize it and style it the way we want to so in this case it's a convenience feature or so so we're just going to go with an icon and get it up there next to it next to the link then we'll make a copy of it that we can use for the width and we can set different different things on here of course like the unit of measurement and so whether it's inches or feet or meters or centimeters and those sorts of things and then of course there's different types of measurements we can do as well so here we're going to demonstrate doing linear measurements but of course you can do volumetric measurements if you need to figure out how much space something takes up but all we've done here in order to add this functionality to the app is drag the button is over we we renamed one of them and then we're going to change the on change event within PowerPoint and put a formula in there and say take the value that's coming back from the mixed reality component and plug it into some variables and then we'll associate those variables to the different text boxes and that's all that's all there is to it and now someone can ship an app that has this functionality in here as soon as they hit that button it drops into the measurement experience yeah they hit the button you're in measurement and then it auto populates into that field right soon as you confirm your measurement that is cool that that is amazing that's so helpful so you're not running around with a measuring tape asking someone to hold the other end right well of course this is just one of the examples you know measurements to a 3d object adding a 3d object placement to your app if you wanted to do for instance the sale scenario if you wanted to be able to visualize products for customers and those sorts of things that is just a matter of pointing people to the GLB that they're gonna use in that experience and again adding a button in a very similar way so it's very very easy to get started I love this this is so fantastic so what kind of use cases are you seeing that you think are really really cool it's really interesting there's some like Michael you could cue up the next video and we could talk about how we lever this let leverage this sorry into fitment testing is what we call it where a customer has the space has a they want to see that something fits into it oh no this could be anything from a commercial place with a retail the example we'll use cooler for soda drinks but in the same case here the person is basically measuring the the footprint the the object they can lift up and define a volumetric a 3d volume of what it is and they can take this now as an object and place it through mixed reality into their space and there's tons of scenarios that are around this we've heard from existing customers or is like how we can fit things into spaces and just general needs so it's pretty exciting I love this I hope your minds are blown cuz mine are this is so good this is just wonderful I also like that Michael is also creeps around like me into random public spaces and measure stuff and says oh just leave this hologram here and see what happens no big deal yeah that that's that's wonderful so cool so what we always ask our guests to assign homework to the audience what do you want everyone to do because actually anyone in the world can do this you don't need to be any sort of advanced skill dev yeah I think it's because we're in preview right now it's a great opportunity for customers to go in turn on the experimental flag try these components out go on to the power-ups community forums hash tag mixed reality into your ideas submit things to us give us suggestions it would be a huge start for us to kind of understand what more people want to do with these kind of controls that's right I remember Michael you told me I said what scenarios do you want us to try and you said what scenarios do you need because the businesses really do understand better what kinds of scenarios they have that involve 3d visualization placement etc etc I thought some of the geospatial stuff that your team was doing was also very very fascinating like where in the world you are yeah we've talked so first of all what we've done so far is lay the foundation that's four out of this sort of capability we've talked to customers about a lot of the more complex scenarios that they're interested in that we'll be able to move towards much more quickly now that we have the foundation it and so some of those are are things like the the sorry advanced placement scenarios so so if we look at things like in or maps and and spatial understanding and then we can create experiences where we have persistent augmented reality mixed reality experiences where we have shared augmented mixed reality experiences and then things like data in space where I can I can walk around a building and I can you know I think the machines and I can see information about how those machines are performing or I can get instructions relative to those things I can place annotations or on objects and those sorts of things so these are some of the more complex experiences that we've been working towards I love both very much interested in hearing what customers are interested in ok everyone see you heard them first install power-ups second go into the settings look at the experimental settings so by the way power apps Microsoft calm okay I guess I haven't said it 800 times so I should power up stop myself at home install power apps go to experimental settings this works on iOS and Android also or okay perfect look works on both right now go to experimental settings turn the setting on use it try it do these things go to the power apps forums write the power Apps users forums hashtag mix reality go to the ideas tab submit your ideas so thank you thank you Ken and Michael so much for being here I honestly we should just do like a one-hour session on where I ask you a hundred questions when make you do 100 demos and that will be next time for build so thank you all so much thank you for being here audience go do the thing now let's go to one of our innovation spaces talks to learn about how all of these videos are created with Azure Kinect
