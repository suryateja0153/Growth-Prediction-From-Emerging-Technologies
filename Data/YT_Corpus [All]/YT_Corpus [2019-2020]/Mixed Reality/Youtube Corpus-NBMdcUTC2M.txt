 should you save up for a valve index or should you get a cheaper VR device instead in this video I will compare my valve index with a Lenovo explorer one of the cheapest VR setups you can get to see the compromises you'd be making by getting one the cheapest way to play VR is with a Windows mixed reality device like the Lenovo Explorer in America before the half life ALX rush at least these could be had new for about $250 in the UK they're not so easy to come by but I was able to pick one up secondhand on eBay for 205 pounds that's less than one quarter the price of the valve index I'd say compared with that it's 90 percent of the immersion 75 percent of the visual quality 50 percent from the comfort for 25 percent of the price of these things I will distress that the most important things to note here are the immersion and a price because I've noticed this strange phenomenon with VR more than in most things where people think you need a premium device to make it worth having it's odd the average person wouldn't insist on a luxury car if they wants to drive somewhere nor would they insist on a 4k HDR display before they watched something ultimately you'll be reaching the same destination or viewing the same content either way and yet when it comes to VR for most people it's either the most expensive option or nothing at all not because the most expensive option is so expensive most end up settling for nothing at all instead I guess people don't want their first VR experience ruined by an inadequate device so I just want to clear this up you will still get the VR experience with a Windows mixed reality device it will let you play the same games and you will still get to experience what makes VR special wmr devices maybe the minimum spec but it's a well-designed minimum spec that will still get you what's important so I just want to make that clear because I'll be spending the majority of this video explaining how it's not quite as good as the valve index but that might make you think it's not worth having obviously it's not going to be as good as the valve index but what's important is that if it's a choice between nothing at all and this yeah if you have an acceptable gaming PC already I can't think of many $250 PC upgrades that will open up as many new experiences as this one well let's start with half-life Alex yes this headset can still access steamvr and anything for it and my first reaction when I loaded up half-life Alex was it's half-life Alex well of course it is it's not like it's going to be a different game a Zed but I guess I was expecting something to be missing reserved for premium setups but it's still VR looked around and it was authentically 3d and smooth I look to my hands and they moved okay I can interact with items and shoot at things with about the same level of accuracy - the per finger tracking you get the same experience - the solid premium feel of the valve index equipment the graphics look similar but less warm and with a slightly smaller field of view the tracking as far as I'm concerned is the same I have no problems with the Lenovo's more basic camera tracking and if anything its button covered controllers were often easier to use than valves more natural but less quickie knuckles controllers in almost every way the experience with another isn't quite as good as the valve index but it's good enough that you can forget about the differences and actually get on with enjoying the game the one exception being comfort that's one area where I did find this Windows mixed reality device to be inferior let's talk details since I said that comfort is the one big difference we might as well cover that first the headset with the lenovo is extremely light which I would say is a good thing but the foam padding for the nose is pathetic it's all loose and does little to shield you from the headsets hard plastic that plastic is nasty managing to both crush my nose and dig into my face I struggled to breathe through my nose with this thing on I really don't know what they were thinking with a design here the best solution will be some kind of homemade padding if you're using this device regularly you will end up having to do this that plastic becomes unbearable you have been warned get creative but until then I do have a sort of half solution the trick is to pull the strap on the back further down your head and to tighten it so the front of the headset rests more above your eyes this makes it acceptable comfortable that you're still missing out on the valve indexes extra padding and stability the next thing that's different is the cable it's four meters long compared with the valve indexes six this will be fine as long as it's plugged in at the edge of your play space however mine's bugged in around the back of my PC which itself is quite a long way underneath my desk I suspect most setups will be similar and in a decently sized room this will cause it to pull you back if you stood in the far corners I would have liked an extra meter for comfort but it's workable if you don't mind turning your PC around so that connection is close to your play space where the cable meets the headset is horrible in its default position here this will cause it to get caught on your ear I don't know what they were thinking with this but attaching the clip is far back around the head strap as I could solve this you will do the same within minutes of setting the device up and last other controllers I don't have anything against them but like any controllers other than the valve indexes knuckles you have to be holding them at all times which can tire your hands out faster than valves ones which strap around your knuckles so you can let go of them whenever you want just something to be aware of right that's comfort out of the way probably the thing you're worrying about most with buying a budget device is the visuals and like I said at the start it's 75% of the valve index the biggest difference is to the colors the valve index has a warmer image while the Lenovo explorers is greener when you're in VR you have nothing to compare it to so I didn't notice this until I quickly switched from it to the valve index and that's when I noticed how green the lenovo screen had been the footage you can see here has been color corrected to be like what I saw using the lenovo and if i disable this it's like returning to the valve index again it's like stepping out of the matrix isn't it this difference is most noticeable in sunny outdoor places which feel more neutral with the lenovo rather than sunny it's a shame because it's not like this lenovo can't pump out vivid Reds valves intro logo looks as red as ever it's just that I couldn't figure out a way of configuring the color balance while in VR and I say that knowing that hundreds of you will suggest things that I've already tried to which I'll say no that didn't work and if it does then good for you but aside from its color balance visually the lenovo wasn't dramatically different to the valve index this refresh rate of 90 is fine it's smooth and I couldn't feel a significant difference between that and the valve index is 112 to 144 I did spot more motion blur when moving my head quickly it's not distracting it's just that I'm aware that with the valve index the image remains as sharp in motion as when I'm stood still I actually thought that the Novo had a sharper image than the valve index did despite having a slightly lower resolution if you want to imagine the difference if the valve indexes image uses fxaa then the lenovo uses MSAA and i think i figured out why it looks clearer the lenovo has a smaller field of view so what can be seen actually appears to have more detail than it would on the valve index I really could notice this in the outdoor areas so while they didn't look quite as sunny any lines looked a bit more in focus which was a welcome surprise from a budget device that being said the lines between the rows of pixels are more noticeable on the Lenovo there in staggered rows that you can make out against the white backdrop or when navigating the game's bright yellow menus it's not like it's visible enough to see lines across the display but the image appears a bit grainier than with the valve index I'm going to sound like a broken record by the end of this video but again it's not something that will ruin your immersion but it's there if you're looking for it field of view how far does the screen extend off in all directions further is better since it fills more of your peripheral vision and is thus more immersive I didn't think to test this until the end which I guess says that the manoeuvre wasn't bad in this regard it does have a better field of view than some of the other windows mixed reality devices it's apparently got a field of view of 110 degrees while the valve index is adjustable with this dial on the side at its farthest away the valve index matched the Deneuve then got better as I dialed his end closer I came up with a test to describe this with your eyes make them look in the largest circle you can without straining them the Lenovo screen stretches up as far as you can look they're not quite as far in the other directions but close at its best the valve index matches my eyes vertically in both directions but stretches slightly beyond where I can look either side which allowed the experience to surround me better remember I'm describing where the image ends but in your peripheral you'll see the void beyond the last thing I checked was the dark areas I couldn't make out details here white as clearly with the Lenovo which would fade out just a bit before the index dead which I measured by Counting planks leading off into the darkness so a slight win to the index here though both headsets are known for having relatively poor black levels Tracking's an interesting and important part of VR although you might think it does your kit doesn't just magically know where everything is it needs cameras or laces of some kind to help it the valve index is currently regarded as having the best VR tracking that you can have it uses base stations dotted about your room to fire out infrared lasers everywhere if set up properly these will almost always be able to track the position of your head and hands for the Novo on the other hand uses cameras mounted to the headset itself some headsets like the rift use a lot of cameras but with just to the Lenovo has the bare minimum the benefit of cameras is that it's a lot more practical and easier to set up it says you don't need base stations set up around your room it just remembers what your room looks like and uses the bright lights on your controllers to track where they are the downside is that if these cameras can't spot something the tracking fails so you'd expect it to stop tracking your hand if you put it behind your head or if you came in complete darkness and yet the lenovo's tracking was superb in general gameplay had functioned perfectly well and it was only when I started trying to break it that I discovered its limitations the cameras tracked the position of your hands but even when the cameras can't see the controllers it seems like the controller's themselves continue to track the direction they're pointing in precisely and to a limited extent they still seem too capable of figuring out where they were I was able to aim at and to kill a combine soldier when my gun was behind me the only thing I couldn't do in this state was to throw objects since I guess it needs to know the speed that your hands are moving at when letting go to simulate that successfully but like I said this is all when I'm trying to break it when I was just playing the game normally I had no problems at all throwing stuff and shooting the general tracking wasn't shaky or jittery I was in a well-lit room which probably helped but regardless the cameras worked brilliantly putting my gun hand right into my face with lose the positional tracking but as you can see the directional tracking continued to function successfully I might look stupid with a gun in my face but I can still shoot like that if I choose to and at one point during gameplay I started floating downwards into the floor when I was stood right at the edge of my play space staring straight into a mattress this could probably be avoided by mapping the play space out to be marginally smaller than the area in my room to give the cameras more information to track my location from though saying that the same applies to the valve index there is no sound with this device but there is a 3.5 millimeter connection for you to plug some earbuds into the valve index in comparison comes with speakers so good you wouldn't want anything else so the sound quality with the lenovo is ultimately determined by how good the earbuds you use are its hassle to have more cables dangling down and I didn't find a 3.5 millimeter connection to be that tight so if I wasn't careful I could pull them out if my arm got caught in the wires if you have corded earbuds it would be worth constructing some kind of ghetto duct-taped device to hold the cables out of the way the control isn't look big bulky and primitive the cones at the end are huge and flexible when pressed from all the scratches on them I suspect they were well acquainted with their previous owners walls but they seemed pretty robust since everything's still in perfect working condition I have rather large hands and my fingers all comfortably settled on the buttons they're supposed to better than they do on the valve controller actually the buttons all have a satisfying feel to them with the exception of this middle one which is mushy and I struggled to tell when it was pressed it situated further down the controller than on the index suppressing this wall holding down the trigger cramped up my thumb an example of this combination in game would be with grenades where you have to hold them and press the button to activate them at the same time the thumbsticks surface feels cheap on the lenovo but in use they feel practically identical the trigger button is smaller than the one on the valve index and doesn't have that final fully pressed in quick but it squeaks less and feel similar in general use until it's fully pressed and this middle finger button feels good to use but is only used in hell 5 Alex to drop a magazine out of your weapon and last the thumb circle bit clicks when pressed unlike the valve index 1 which is touch only this button opens up the weapon menu in half-wave Alex and I found it a bit more reliable in use on the Lenovo valves knuckle controllers deserve credit for trying to make in-game actions feel more natural and for not needing to be continually gripped but there are definitely occasions when I prefer the more reliable audible clicks of the more traditional controller type my experience with the game was good with these controllers the controls were vastly different from the knuckles but they made sense and felt intuitive valve has taken the time to optimize ha 5 Alex for all major controller types so this isn't surprising as for the rest of VR titles I honestly think these windows controllers will be better supported than the knuckle ones since they're so similar in design to the oculus controllers which I suspect most games are designed for back to half-life Alex there are certain actions in game where the shape of these controllers will cause problems if you a gun like so your two controllers will collide and less you change how you'd normally perform that action there is a button to perform this automatically the other situation where they collided was here where you're pressing a button on something that you're holding in the other hand this happens because these cones are massive is less of a problem with the rift controller since they're more compact and of course the valve knuckles are designed in a way where they rarely collide at all like I said these controllers seem robust enough that withstand the odd condition in situations such as this one which is just as well something worth mentioning is the batteries these controllers use two double-a batteries each double what the rift requires and far more hassle than the valve indexes USB charge 2 controllers I don't know how long a set of fully charged batteries will last but I will say those LEDs show glow bright it's a given that you should have at least eight rechargeable batteries so that you can have four uncharged at all times if you want to be able to use this device unhindered unfortunately this being a Windows mixed reality device it has Windows software that tries to take control every time you put the headset on I let the Cortana mascot in VR and it is not a pretty sight I get the feeling that VR isn't as important to Microsoft as it is to oculus or valve so while their software works it isn't as polished or as nice to use it all feels a bit loud and intrusive still it works with steam VR and that's the important thing this can be done by downloading the windows mixed reality for steamvr software on Steam it feels a bit like needing you play and steam to play a game only worse than that because you need to prefer a peace agreement between the two before they'll cooperate with each other just make sure you have a working Windows button on your keyboard because it's the only way you can take control back from it what's their software starts up shout out to the headset for not requiring an extra power socket by the valve index to us somehow this entire thing is USB powered with the other cable plugging into an HDMI port yes HDMI but don't worry it's a magical HDMI that's capable of high resolutions and refresh rates and being HDMI it'll be better compatible with laptops and such than the valve indexes DisplayPort will be the initial setup screen worked great for sadly once it's done it wants you to be doing everything in VR at all times even when the thing you're trying to do is getting the controllers to be recognized again I could do without the 3d world it forces you into it's just irrelevant because all I really need this steamvr the room setup was quite silly to do I had to hold the headsets that it was facing the monitor while tracing the shape of the room which resulted in some silly maneuvers but once I had it set up it worked for the rest of the evening even after having switched between it and the valve index several times the same couldn't be said about the controllers though these are controlled by a Bluetooth USB dongle you plug into your PC but to sync them up you need to remove the battery cover and press this fiddly little button down is not that obvious or reliable the room boundary was not as good as the steamvr one either it shows a square on the floor to outline your playable area and when you get close enough to the edges it generates a ripple pattern to warn you this managed to be the unlikely and unlikable combination of less visible yet more distracting IPD the thing that measures the distance between your eyes is done using software I don't care how clever this is I automatically consider this to be inferior to the valve indexes proper part where I beat the adjustment which physically adjusts how far apart the eyeholes are I never really thought about what software IPT adjustment would do exactly but it just alters the point where the focus of your eyes converge after a second of adjustment I could use any setting with my eyes but if your eyes are too close together or too far apart to line up with the eye holes then you're going to have to go seriously cross-eyed or thousand-yard stare to see what's going on which is not ideal I'm not exactly sure how many people fall into this category but you might struggle a bit if you look like a Bond villain I ran into a few bugs which I'll mention the solutions to here because those of you who haven't yet bought a headset I want to know what to expect those of you who have one will be thankful for the solutions this device does not like NVIDIA DSR that is super resolutions above what your monitor can display so disable that before you plug the headset in the most annoying problem I found was that when I hadn't had the headset plugged in for a while applications wouldn't detect the controllers until I went to window settings Bluetooth and other devices at Bluetooth mice and keyboards spend to remove the controllers and to add them again with practice I got this process down to about a minute and last before you try to play any VR games on Steam get your headset and controllers working in the windows mixed reality homepage first and then load Windows mixed reality for steam VR and then the game that you want to play in that order these three issues perfectly summarize the price you pay for a cheap VR headset although they're easy to get around once you know what you're doing there's still extra steps that I don't have to go through with the valve index I get fed up with people complaining that half of Alex costs $1,000 to play obviously with that that dismissing any VR device other than the valve index but I'm never sure that's simply ignorant if they're afraid of investing in a subpar experience or if they're aware that their argument is weak so are using a large number to convince bystanders that they've got a valid point whatever the reason they're wrong and they should be happy about that at 400 pounds you have the rift S which is a good all-round device with excellent software and down the bottom of the price range are devices such as these any headset you buy at the moment will come with kagra the valve index comes with few of the most well the windows mixed reality ones come with more but the important thing is they still land above the mark required to play and to enjoy today's VR games and that's really what I mean when I say it's 90% of the immersion of the valve index it's 3d it's responsive and it's interactive that's the magical VR formula right there the Lenovo Explorer is 75% of visual experience of the valve index and 50% of the comfort for 25% of the price fortunately with a bit of homemade ingenuity you can probably pump those comfort figures up considerably it's the 75% visual experience that you're stuck with only you will know if you're happy with that actually I'm in a better position that you are since I own both devices I hope I find some way of adjusting the color balance using software that would be nice but even as it is the situation that the norvo finds itself in with its color vibrancy is similar to where the valve index stands with its black levels if you directly compare it to a high quality monitor it falls short but put the headset on if you have nothing else to compare it to and you soon accept it as reality plus on a technical level it offers a similar resolution at a good refresh rate and the field of view is smaller than on the valve index but not the extent that I put the headset on and think my only worry is that even if my judgement of its visual quality is right if you opt for a Windows mixed reality device you may be left asking yourself what if every time you see a beautiful view you will wonder what it will look like with more vivid colors and every time you wrestle with the fiddly software you look over at steam or oculus and think what if still if the choice is between this and not experiencing VR a windows mixed reality device definitely wins just be sure to look up reviews of the headsets that are available to you they all have to meet a minimum requirement but some go further than others and I can only speak the lenovo which happens to be the first one i bid on and got i've sung its praises but here's the real question knowing what this headsets like would i have gotten it instead of the valve index well I would have bought one of these a few years sooner that's for sure and once I had it it would have been much more difficult to justify buying the valve index since the feature set is so bar a few bells and whistles I think ultimately I wouldn't have gotten the valve index she's a how little time I actually spend in VR if there was enough content for us out there to warrant 20-plus hours a week than the valve index would probably be worth it for the extra comfort but at the moment when a VR game worth playing only comes out every few months I still think a Windows mixed reality device is the easier option to justify I'm not saying that the valve index was a wasted purchase because I am still treating it as an investment as something that will pay for itself over the next few years hopefully as more VR titles are released and since I have one I'll be using it to experience those new titles and I'll do my best to appreciate the premium quality I feel a bit sorry for Windows most reality devices they've been neglected by Microsoft and are overlooked by most gamers who immediately dismiss them in favor of a premium rift S or a top-of-the-line valve index even if they can't afford them from my testing the Lenovo Explorer is a great little device that if my valve index supposed to die on me I would happily use as a backup device sounds kind of mean I've been happy using it to play half-life Alex with even when the valve index has been working the game still works as intended don't expect the same premium level of build quality or the same intuitive software but if you're prepared to put up with a few rough edges and MacGyver esque alterations this kind of headset will let you into the world of VR gaming for less money than you might have anticipated also if you want an above-average Windows mixed reality headset then consider the Samsung Odyssey plus it's better than the other Windows headsets in several ways close respects to the premium oculus rift s just a thought if you can find one for a decent price
