 hey what is up everybody welcome back to the prodigio games video channel uh my name is gareth and uh today we're gonna do some learning so i wasn't planning on doing tutorials so quickly out of the gate but one of the videos that i just put up was actually over on the facebook page i did a kind of mixed reality setup which is where you take your live footage and you overlay it with vr or vice versa you put yourself into the vr environment and this generated a lot of interest which was good but uh one of the main points of feedback that i got was you know how do you do this and so i ran a couple people through it you know via text but i uh i just wanted to put together kind of a quick and dirty tutorial just to give an idea of how this process goes now there's a couple of assumptions that this particular tutorial is going to make and that is first of all that you have a video editing software of choice because everybody works with something a little bit different depending on if you're on mac or pc or mobile or desktop so that's all very variable so i'm going to assume that you have some background of that and how to do things like chroma king or as it's more commonly known green screening because that's kind of the key to this process so in addition to that the software that i'm going to be doing this for is medium by adobe which is what i use i assume that something like tilt brush or gravity sketch would have a feature like this but having not tried it i can't speak to that so with that being said let's go ahead and get into the process of how this is done and of course if you have any questions about the process or if anything's confusing to you hop down in the comments below and i will answer it as soon as i can or if the community doesn't handle it first so um definitely give it a try see what you can do with it but let's hop over into voice over space so i can walk you through the process all right here we go so first things first you want to set up your physical camera that is right here so when you set up your camera you want it to be centered on the build area not actually on yourself which is an understandable thing to want to do considering when you're filming yourself that's what you usually do but really the art should be the kind of focal point here so try and center it where you're going to be sculpting and that's about that for the physical camera now let's hop into vr and get medium setup so the first thing you want to do is get the background keyed to your chroma key color normally that's green obviously it's the industry standard but if you're doing trees or anything like that then it makes sense that you'd want to do something like i have this hot magenta that i use sometimes to kind of remind myself that i need to finish texturing something or in this case it needs to be keyed out so use whatever color is best for you and of course take out the skybox take off the ground plane and then it's just a matter of getting the virtual camera set up now this is kind of the tricky part because the camera itself obviously you can't see your physical camera overlaid on your virtual camera so trying to get them in the same position and looking the same way it can be a little a little tough but if you can get them in the same general area it usually looks good so what i'll usually do is take a peek out from under the vr headset and look at where the physical camera is and then from there kind of eyeball the the virtual camera to where it's roughly should be and then the little trick that i've found is actually go up to the physical camera and touch your offhand controller to it now what this does is it gives you a representation in the virtual world of exactly where the physical camera is in relation to you so then you can take that and using that as kind of an anchor point put your virtual camera where you need it to be there's still some guesswork when it comes to the pen and the tilt and other things like that field of view but for the most part you can get it set up pretty well and um the results that i've gotten have been very satisfactory for very little effort so i definitely suggest you try that and at that point you're ready to start your capture so let's go ahead and get some footage of sculpting now this is not a sculpting tutorial so i won't do anything crazy but just just enough to show kind of what it looks like as you're working with that all done then we move on to the next part which is the compositing now there's three steps to this and i can't really walk you through the exact way to do it because it depends on what software you're using but essentially the first thing you want to do is chroma key out your color which is already done in this case as you can see side by side we have the camera footage and the virtual camera footage so key out all of your chroma key color and then the second step is to synchronize the two together again this is already done some programs are great for it this one that i use powerdirector for android is uh it's it's so so but then the next step is the fun part this is where you actually overlay the footage from the virtual camera onto your physical camera this is where powerdirector is actually really good that's super intuitive you just kind of scale it and play with it until it works so that is really all you have to do so what i suggest is that you you render that out and then you cut that footage as you need to and then go forward from there so after that you have your video you can do it as elaborate as you like or just something simple uh it's really up to you there that's kind of your own artistic taste so i hope this has been helpful and uh i look forward to seeing what everybody does with it so let's go back to the workshop and that's how that's done so as you can see it's not super complicated but at the same time it's got its little nuances so you just you know give it a couple of runs see how it works and then uh you know from there you should be set so uh we'll talk maybe a little later about the reverse process which is taking yourself and green screening yourself into the footage which is something i would love to do to kind of show off the games as i'm working on them but uh that will be something for down the road so yeah hopefully you got a lot out of this and go ahead and shoot me the videos that you make with this process i would love to see what everybody's doing with it and until next time keep being awesome and making awesome games hey everybody i hope you found that useful if you did go ahead and hit that like button and remember for every new subscriber a touch controller is spontaneously made whole
