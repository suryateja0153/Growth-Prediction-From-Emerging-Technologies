 good morning good afternoon good evening wherever you may be thank you so much for joining us for this digital breakout session how lockheed martin is advancing space flight with mixed reality my name is matt fleckenstein i'm the senior director of product marketing here at microsoft responsible for mixed reality in just a little bit i'm going to have a great colleague of mine shelly peterson from lockheed martin join us and we'll have a lively discussion about how lockheed is leveraging mixed reality to really change the way that they work but before i invite shelley to join us i want to spend a few moments sharing some of what we're seeing at microsoft to give you a little bit of insight into where mixed reality is driving significant roi in value today i think we can all agree that cloud computing is arguably the biggest secular trend in computing over the last decade it's fundamentally changed how we build manage and deploy our applications and it's really been essential to letting every company become a technology company and while cloud computing has gotten us most of the way there it simply can't overcome the law of physics such as the speed of light as more and more people are connected online and billions of devices get connected online there's a need for ultra low latency computing at the edge to enable the next generation immersive experiences and that's never been more true than today in this world of mixed reality where ubiquitous computing at the edge blends and transcends the physical and the digital worlds if you go back to the 1970s computing really started with mainframes when business users were literally tethered to a terminal at their desk in the 1990s gave rise to the era of personal computers and eventually laptops which gave us some level of computing mobility for the very first time but that promise wasn't really realized until the 2000s when smartphones came into being and for the very first time we had the power of a computer in our pocket to take with us anywhere we wanted and additionally we got to understand the importance of contextual awareness things like location as we navigated through the world all of that pales in comparison though to what we're witnessing now in this era of mixed reality by blending the physical and the digital worlds you really get to this notion of ubiquitous computing for the very first time a computing experience where instead of looking at your screen your heads up hands-free looking at and interacting with the world overlaid with digital content in this world of mixed reality is having a fundamental impact on transforming how we work let's take a look they are the first line a global workforce 2 billion strong the first to see the product take shape the first was the opportunity to address an issue the first to touch customers getting an understanding of their needs and the first to create a lasting impression on their hearts and minds examples include call center reps field service personnel production workers maintenance workers retail clerks and healthcare providers in this time of digital transformation their potential can be unlocked with mixed reality in whole new ways they can be more connected to data to each other into your customers than ever before given more opportunity to grow their skills and thrive in their work in a 2 billion strong they can meet customer needs at an even deeper level they can tap into each other's expertise and become even more efficient but these two billion first-line workers have largely been left out of the digital transformation era and there are some very good reasons for that often times because of where they work they're disconnected from the team in the headquarters they've got many outdated and obsolete tools and processes because you're deploying technology at the edge there's oftentimes uneven security practices and governance they require bunches of new training and upskilling and onboarding they're slow to receive information and of course we've got a multi-generational and diverse workforce many of whom are now at retirement age which leads you with a bunch of historical knowledge and expertise walking out the door and mixed reality creates a game-changing opportunity for these two billion workers for the first time digital information and assets are being overlaid onto the physical world bringing real-time data and insight to the front lines where they're performing their jobs and it's doing it in a way that's heads up and hands-free enhancing their work not disrupting it so i just spent some time talking about the importance of first-line workers and the impact that mixed reality can have on digital transformation efforts but i want to talk a little bit about the broader mixed reality market opportunity the global mixed reality market opportunity is about a six billion dollar opportunity today growing to 34.3 billion by 2025 a staggering 41.3 compound annual growth rate if we look at today's market it's largely comprised of two segments consumers and then enterprise customers specifically those first-line workers we were talking about the vast majority of the market as you'll see is made up of consumers today primarily dominated by vr sale device sales and gaming but we're seeing this emergence among these first-line workers growing from a billion-dollar opportunity today to about a nine billion dollar opportunity by 2025. what you'll also notice as we move out five years from now is the emergence of another enterprise segment information workers individuals who spend their days sitting behind a desk who will benefit from the power of mixed reality for things such as collaboration scenarios virtual meetings and design reviews however as i mentioned the large enterprise opportunity today is really with those first-line workers we talked about the power of that 2 billion or 2 billion strong workforce and you can see not only are they actually making up a big portion of the marketplace today they're highly concentrated in a number of key industries discrete and process manufacturing make up the bulk of this market but architecture engineering construction retail and health care are also fueling the mixed reality market today and among those industries there's really six primary use cases that we're seeing emerging in mixed reality these are really the use cases being adopted by enterprises across many different industries all over the world primarily because they have a very fast time to value and a significant proven roi these three across the top are where we see the majority of mixed reality opportunity today training and simulation educating and providing continuous learning for your employees upskilling uh you know your existing employees onboarding new employees using a learning by doing approach guides in task management walking employees step by step through self-guided experiences to complete specific activities tasks or assignments in real time and then remote assistance a very powerful scenario that we're seeing heavily adopted in today's world where travel is more and more difficult enabling your employees employees to remote in an expert anytime they need it wherever they are and it's not just promoting it in as a phone those who are actually participating in the experience remotely can actually see what the person is seeing through a hololens and actually engage and interact with and annotate the same content that you would be able to see as if you were there on site and then these three across the bottom are really emerging opportunities that we're seeing starting to take off in the market things like designing and prototyping converting your cad and your bim files to 3d digital twins to really quickly iterate and collaborate on new product designs sales assistance enabling you to carry less inventory and close sales faster using mixed reality to demo any configuration or customization to your customers and then this final one is a broad category around contextual data overlay you know enabling uh your employees who are in the front lines to move faster and make more informed by decisions by having pertinent real-time iot data at their disposal overlaid on top of the real world to make this all happen we've got a rich set of mixed reality offerings at microsoft we've really focused on building a comprehensive mixed reality stack that all starts with the power of azure our azure mixed reality services enable developers to build applications and rich immersive experiences without having to tackle some of the most difficult problems that we've taken on by providing these services things such as allowing you to render high fidelity high quality high polygon count 3d content at the edge on a mixed reality device without decimation made possible by our azure remote rendering product or azure spatial anchors which enables developers to build applications that can map and persist 3d content to anywhere in the physical space or our newest service azure object anchors which is just going into private preview now which enables developers to anchor and persist content to physical objects in the real world these past services coupled with our extensive application development investments leveraging middleware providers such as unity and unreal which are the well-known established players for creating 3d content coming originally out of the gaming space all leveraging the power of azure and our own mixed reality toolkit which provides rich libraries and components of many common used tool sets and frameworks to make it easy to get started voting for mixed reality applications because of these investments we've really been able to build a very large and vibrant ecosystem of mixed reality applications both both our own first party microsoft dynamics 365 mixed reality applications as well as a whole ecosystem of third-party partners and isvs who are building on top of our stack and all of this you know can render these rich experiences across a wide array of mixed reality endpoints and devices for us at the heart of those devices is of course hololens 2 the most comfortable and immersive mixed reality device available all leveraging the reliability the security and the scalability of azure and on top of this a world-leading device is this rich set of isvs who have built out the largest ecosystem of enterprise ready mixed reality applications in the world across nearly any use case serving almost any industry we've got a rich set of solution providers ready to help you enter into the mixed reality space today i want to tell you a little bit more about one of our partners scope ar and their worklink product together that offering our hololens device and our full mixed reality stack are helping lockheed martin to send astronauts back to the moon in 2024. as you can see in the images here on the screen you see a picture of the orion spacecraft which is at the heart of that mission you'll also notice lots of little colored dots those little dots are signifying specific places where certain fasteners need to be applied the mixed reality product work link is helping those assemblers to identify exactly where those fasteners need to go and the color coding indicates exactly which fastener needs to go where it sounds like a pretty minor deal but when you actually hear the story of lockheed martin and the roi and the impact that it's having i think you'll be quite amazed but rather than me tell you about it let's take a look at this quick video so imagine you know you're crawling inside a spacecraft and you're trying to do the work the last thing you need is is to have to carry paper or tablets or laptops into the environment being able to have data readily available without having to hold on to anything is significant i'm shelley peterson my role is principal investigator for augmented and mixed reality at lockheed martin we work with orion which is nasa's spacecraft that will take astronauts out to the moon and even into deeper space such as mars on the orion spacecraft there's 57 000 fasteners and normally the technicians would have to measure to know where to place those fasteners with mixed reality they put on the device they see the digital version of the fastener hovering over the surface they know exactly where to place this when we do this we save about 90 of the touch flavor we take an eight-hour activity of marking locations and they finish it in 45 minutes or an eight shift activity they can complete in six hours it also reduces the potential for errors because the instruction is just so clear when they see it overlaid on the structure in front of them over the last two plus years that we've used the hololens on the shop floor we haven't had one error and that's significant it's just pretty powerful it takes what we think of as a laptop or computing to the next level feels like magic look i told you those little fasteners were going to be a big deal and i knew that you'd enjoy that story but rather than hear more about it from me why don't i invite shelly peterson out to come tell you a little bit more about it hey shelly it's great to see you again why don't you start by maybe introducing yourself i'm shelley peterson i'm the principal investigator of augmented and mixed reality for lockheed martin hey shelly i often times tell people that i've got the coolest job in the world but i look at your job you've got augmented and mixed reality you've got spaceships what more could you ask for why don't you tell us a little bit more about what it is that you do at lockheed martin as a principal investigator of augmented mixed reality um we're looking at augmented reality and mixed reality technologies how they could benefit our programs we shape the technology so that it meets our program's requirements and and challenges we deploy those solutions out to the programs so that we can produce spacecraft at lower costs um with a higher quality hey shelly at the end of that video earlier you talked about how hololens and mixed reality feels like magic i've got to confess to me the orion spacecraft feels a bit like magic could you tell us a little bit more about it so the rhine spacecraft is a nasa spacecraft it's the only spacecraft that is designed to take humans into deep space like the moon and mars orion is the spacecraft that will take the first woman and the next man back to the moon so ryan orion is a unique spacecraft that has taken a while to develop it's been in development for a while but we're at this exciting point where it's about to go into production hey shelly i know microsoft and lockheed have been partnering for a while now in the mixed reality space and you guys have taken full advantage of our mixed reality stack and i know that you've been using hololens for quite some time i'd love to have you tell us a little bit more about exactly what you're doing with hololens and maybe a little bit about the journey that you went on to get to where you are today so we started using hololens in about 2016. we're using the hololens one we started using the hololens on the shop floor in 2017 the fall of 2017 looking at manufacturing processes on orion for the ford bay cover that activity it was drilling activities where they would use the hololens to supplement the additional data that they had they used the hololens for torque applications for running torque all the details that they need in order to fasten the panels to the structure then we progressed into using the hololens on the heat shield in the full assembly of the heat shield um bringing a 1600 hour activity down to about a thousand hours then we found that we could use the hololens to place to know where to place objects on on the structure things like fasteners and strain gauges and heaters and thermistors we could place with accuracy thanks shelly it's really fascinating to hear the history of how lockheed martin has been an early adopter of mixed reality and our hololens product as i mentioned earlier we have a rich ecosystem of enterprise-ready isv applications they're really designed to serve any industry and a wide variety of use cases i loved hearing the story about how lockheed martin has really evolved how they've used hololens and our mixed reality stack to meet many use cases in many different aspects of your business i know one of those isv partners scope ar has been with you since the early days on this journey why don't you tell me a little bit more about your partnership we use the scope of our worklink platform to build the augmented reality content we use on the shop floor which also has elements of azure mixed reality integrated scope ar has shaped their technology in order to allow us to build the scenarios much more efficiently for many of our activities we can build the ar content about 30 minutes 15 to 30 minutes so we had a chance to talk about the important role that hololens 2 is playing at lockheed martin and how it's helping to create a new reality for work and of course that partnership with scope are seems incredibly strong and it's amazing to hear the progress that you guys have made together and really making it quite easy and simple to produce content to train the next generation of workers one area i'd like to dig into a little bit more though is the role of azure and our mixed reality services in the work that you're doing in lockheed martin at azure we're developing a suite of mixed reality services to assist developers in building mixed reality applications two of those services spatial anchors and object anchors are all about anchoring 3d content into the real world our spatial anchors product lets you map and persist 3d content to physical spaces this is really the backbone of sharing and collaborating on 3d content much as you order the physical object you want to be able to place 3d content on a tabletop or in a specific location and let your colleagues see it exactly the way that you're seeing it and you want that content to still be there when you show up the next day object anchors is our newest service it just came to market here at ignite as we launched private as we announced private preview whereas spatial anchors lets you map 3d content to physical spaces object anchors is all about aligning 3d content to physical objects so with mixed reality with the depth sensors and and the knowledge of the device it understands the the environment so we can overlay the content directly onto the structure it's anchored to the structure and um that allows us to place content within the environment that combination becomes very powerful we can animate the environment we can show specifically the instruction very quickly very clearly to a technician who may be very new to that position shelly i know anchoring is a concept that you're quite familiar with at lockheed martin why don't you tell me a little bit about some of the work you have going on in that arena we have really skilled technicians and engineers but it comes even more powerful when they can communicate with each other when a technician is working on the shop floor and they have a question they can call out to a subject matter expert with a tablet so having that collaborative communication from the technician to an engineer allows us to move more quickly in solving the challenges and helping them continue with their work effort we also have scenarios where the engineers need to collaborate on a design and being able to see the same design together being able to envision the structure that hasn't been built yet and look through different options allows us to make those decisions more quickly hey shelly before i let you go i want to ask the question that everyone's wondering about do all these investments in mixed reality really pay off let's talk numbers what kind of roi are you seeing at lockheed martin so at machu we we had two to three technicians working for two to three shifts marking the locations of 309 click bonds when we use mixed reality we can do that same work with one technician in two and a half hours and that's a 93 touch labor reduction and so we started to use that same type of use case and technology at other sites in other areas of the orion program and what we found was that we could take an eight hour activity and reduce it down to 45 minutes marking strain gauges on panels we could take an eight shift activity marking locations of click bonds inside the orion structure we could bring that down to six hours each one of those is a 90 plus percent reduction in touch labor and we've seen that consistently over the last several years we're also able to take standard work instruction step-based work instruction we can reduce touch labor by about 35 to 50 percent and in the three plus years that we've been using mixed reality on the shop floor we haven't had a single error that's been documented while we have ar mr and use it's exciting to see the effect of mixed reality on the programs hey shelley on behalf of myself and all of us at microsoft as well as all of those who have tuned in and listened i want to say thank you for sharing the lockheed martin story and for telling us all about how you're leveraging the power of mixed reality to send astronauts to the moon and beyond i hope that all of you who tuned in enjoy the rest of ignite thank you very much
