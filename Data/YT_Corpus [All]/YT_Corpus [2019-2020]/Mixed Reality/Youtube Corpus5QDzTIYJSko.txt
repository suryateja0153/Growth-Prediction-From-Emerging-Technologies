 yeah thanks a lot just in time thank you computer so I'm max my co-authors are Brian hall and Michael nibbling and this work has been conducted at the University of Michigan School of Information and however I'm now with CNA as a user experience manager so I got back into industry how why did we do this research so we we talked to people we talked to friends and we talked to students we talked to colleagues and fellow researchers about mixed reality and it seemed like everybody had kind of a different understanding of what mixed reality is and then also some devices popped up and told us well we're not open to reality we're mixed reality that's totally different so we got confused and we asked ourselves what is mixed reality then it seemed like an unsolved question and I can tell you that we did not find a one-size-fits-all ultimate definition of mixed reality rather our work has two contributions so first of all we're going to present six breaking definitions of mixed reality and from these six working definitions we're gonna derive a conceptual framework to classify mixed reality experiences to make them better comparable that are understandable and to make it easier for you actually to put them into context and the working definitions we found results first presentation is a mixed reality according to the Conan continuum that many of you might know mix reality as a synonym for a are mixed reality as a combination of air and we are mixed reality as a stronger version of augmented reality as a type of collaboration and as alignment of environments I will get into the details later obviously and then the framework we derived has seven dimensions the number of environments the number of users the level of immersion the level of virtuality the degree and interact of interaction input and output now how did we get there first we interviewed ten experts from academia and industry to inquire into what what they think how they perceive the different concepts and after that we conducted a lit review with 68 sources that were related to a mixed reality research and also specifically to the difference between mixed reality and augmented reality step 1 for the expert interviews we designed a questionnaire that was intended to really inquire into how would experts define different concepts and we were also trying to push the boundaries and see like what is enough to constitute mixed reality that's why we're also enquired into different aspects of reality that are relevant beyond the purely visual so for example we asked them is listening to music is that mixed reality is tilt brush mixed reality where you have this fully virtual view but you have a motion that's translated from the real world into the virtual world and also Super Mario Brothers where you push a button in the real world and somebody jumps on in in a virtual environment might that be mixed reality additionally we also ask them will these concepts still exist in the future will they be different might they just disappear and also whether a single definition of mixed reality would actually be useful also especially for the HCI community as I said we had a ten experts five of them were from academia five or ten were from industry and they included professors the head of an AR lab a CEO of an AR company the CTO of a new company and I write are in the executive and some more all of them had at least two years of experience in the field and eight had more than eight years of experience and what we found was that augmented a mixed reality were much more difficult to define for the experts than virtual reality so we are Ville was always pretty clear it was like you have a fully virtual view and it was also mostly concerned with specific devices say that were in this place but for mixed reality that we at least found that it seems that according to the experts spatial registration was necessary to constitute mr and also that seeing at least part of the environment is necessary that's why tilt brush even though we had this motion that was true dated from the real into the virtual was mostly seen as as we are because you are fully immersed in the virtual view they also stated that simple input is not necessary it's not not not enough not enough to constitute a mark again the example toothbrush so the motion capture was perceived as simple input and they said like that's that's not enough to constitute a mark in general they said a single definition would actually be useful but they also agreed that this might never be happen or at least is highly unlikely and also from these interviews we derive for initial working definitions of mixed reality the first one mixed reality according to the continuum that was first presented in 1994 by Mike Roman casino I which basically just means mixed reality is anything in between completely real and completely virtual and now the experts couldn't really agree on whether the extreme account into mixed reality or not so it's both possible the second working definition mixed reality as a synonym for augmented reality so some experts said mixed reality that's just like a new marketing term for augmented reality but other than that there's no difference so not a lot to add here mixed reality as a combination of air and VR this is more interesting so one specific example would be Pokemon go where you have a fully virtual overworld which is which could be we are and you catch pokemon in an augmented reality view so you have one system that combines both some expert said that's mixed reality and then finally the fourth one we derived from the interviews mixed reality as a stronger version of AR where they said that while you are just an observer in simple AR where you just view seen through your through the camera of a smartphone in mixed reality you can really walk into the scene and also the devices have a better understanding of the environment than simple AR devices so one example that was given here a lot was hololens then in step two we did later to come these things we found in the in the interviews and for this we selected papers from Chi Chi play wisdom is Mark between 2014 and 2018 that included mixed reality in their title or abstract and then we added four other sources that we knew were dealing with the specific differences between a R and M R so we looked at all of the papers and in the papers we tried to find the point at which the authors define their understanding of mixed reality and we also looked at which papers were cited as definitions of mixed reality so this is the citation graph for the first round of the lit review and as you can see for example in bukhoma casino 94 decided quite a lot in general on a high level the findings we derived from from the literature review was that different conferences seem to use different notions of mixed reality so for example while chi seems to be more about collaboration i play seems to be more about aligning environments overall there were 22 sources that were cited to define or explain mixed reality and America and Casino 1994 the continuum is indeed the single most cited source for mixed reality but it was used by much less than 50% of the papers we reviewed so it is to sing the most popular notion but it's not Universal and also finally we found besides confirming the four notions we already found we found two additional working definitions of mixed reality so the fifth one was mixed reality as collaboration where an AR and/or VR system is used to facilitate the collaboration between more than one user so in this specific example good we have an AR user and a remote viewer user and the environment of the air user is recreated in watch reality for the remote collaborator and then finally these six working definition we found is mixed reality as an alignment of environments where we have two distinct environments that are synced through some sensory tracking or in so this specific example is an earthquake table where we have building blocks on the earthquake table and a projection and whatever happens to the building box is synchronized with the virtual view in the protection so the environments are synced so that gives us a total of 6 working definitions of mixed reality that we found to be in use in the wild and according to the continuum as a synonym for AR as a combination of AR and VR strong AR mrs collaboration and as an alignment of environments now we took all these working definitions and we wanted to make this conceptual framework all of them so we try to find the dimensions that would uniquely identify the specific differences between the different notions so that each one of them could be classified and ambiguously and what we found is that the number of environments is important the number of users is important especially for the collaboration aspect and the level of immersion so how immersive feel the level of virtuality which is independent of the immersion but it tells however to the how much virtual content you have actually experiencing and it's also very important to distinguish between implicit and explicit interaction in all of these experiences but imported that and we also inquired into the relevant aspects of reality that might be considered 4mr beyond the purely visual both in the expert interviews and the lit review and what we found is that audio might be relevant for mr motion haptics taste flavor some people have started looking into smell and geolocation can be an input or how the temperature is important and basically anything sensors contract can be an input to mixed reality and any stimuli or sensory modalities that you can feel and experience can be an output to mr systems so we took input and output and we also edit it to the framework and now these are very important on for experience basis to define certain experiences but for the working definitions input and output can just be anything so it's an e pendant of the notion but very important on for for specific applications so to get back to the example with the earthquake table here we have many environments we have one to many users because obviously more than one person can play with the earthquake table the whole experience is not to partly immerse it because we have this earthquake table it is just a purely real environment and we have a projection where you can argue how immersive it is then it's also both not and fully virtual so earthquake table versus protection we have implicit and explicit interactions because you can just walk around the whole mixed reality scene but you can also explicitly interact with the building box and just push them down and the environments will be aligned so therefore the input is motion and the output is real and this is how would we would classify this very specific mixed reality experience according to the conceptual framework we just came up with so to conclude well then what is makes reality according to one of our interviewees it's all marketing Mahmood rambo at this point in time however we believe that as of now mixed reality is one of six things and all of these six things are well it but it just depends on the background and the specific experience of which of these six things constitute the type of mixed reality you're describing also it's an evolving concept so some of these working definitions might disappear there might be new ones coming up also the conceptual framework that we came up as of now I think is we got a pretty complete picture but also this one might change in the future but most importantly mixed reality is something we need a common vocabulary for first of all so that we can put our work into context and so that different works based on mixed reality are better comparable better understandable and also just to avoid misunderstandings when talking it's reality in the HCI community but also in the research community in general and yeah we were hoping that we can provide a very good basis for that and thank you for your attention [Applause] Oliver Cheryl Arthur so the experts said that it usually involves sight we often think of ER and Travis having headsets or screens but what would your approach would be for people with sensory impairments for example people who are blind or visually impaired even in your classification for input/output there's all sorts of possibilities there but you said in addition to visual feedback no no what I meant was beyond visual so yeah beyond visual so none of this is restricted to to wiggle out it so could be could be anything if you if you are talking about impaired like visually impaired users you could still have some spatially registered audio and that would be mixed reality according to this concept of framework for the whizbee impaired user so that it visual is not a necessity here okay great give any ideas of how this might inform work in to because I still think we're very headset and screen focus with with any with star reality right so any insight into how we might have this framework might help us when we look to people who for example have these impairments we did not specifically look into that I mean we're hoping that it will facilitate facilitate work into this direction and probably help yeah thinking outside this whole headset box that you're describing but we've not asked specific questions about that we'll just we'll just see what happens right so and we're actually hoping to contribute to getting outside hey Jenkins Lee Cornell University and actually being a little more of my NSF role right now so first of all I really appreciate the work to try to define this because when I see proposals on mixed reality come in and often is totally unclear what's happening and it's like the rest of the chi community saying cyberbullying or crowdsourcing you're a meaning everything from like Wikipedia to uber okay so I really appreciate this I like the work to move towards definitions and I'm just curious if you have any sort of preferred personal definitions that you would like or terms for certain classes of this that you'd like to do to carve up this mixed reality term a little bit to help create that vocabulary because you get to be prescriptive a little bit when you do an analysis like this and tell me what you think I have a least favorite working definition which is simply using mixed reality as a synonym for augmented reality that I mean that is kind of lame right so but I mean it's out there people are using it so we have to consider it but um it's also kind of odd to have two different terms for the same thing with but which is like acknowledging that people are doing this but yeah so working definition number two is definitely my least favorite and I think that one should maybe go away at some point for less confusion but I think all all the others are absolutely well it because they just describe they are kind of competing and also kind of overlapping but there are other definitions and yeah no favor there it's just very important to be clear about what you're talking about and that's why we did this concept of framework thing right and there um things girls walk and you known from University of Constance Germany so your paper just answers one of the questions from my several months ago I asked this question to one of my colleagues because like during my master I only know a are I work mobile AR devices applications but after like the hololens came out i start to know the concept mr asked you I don't see the difference but now like for many people I ask them that what kind of devices do you think it is AR or we are so from this point of view have you asked your participants like which kind of device they think is AR or VR for example for hololens for me it's a Stewart and AR so I I can tell the difference it's head-mounted they are yeah before I forget it I want one more thing Michael says hi to his mom hi Michael's mom and to get back to your question so we did not specifically ask about devices but in the case of this strong a our definition of mixed reality some of the experts explicitly said like this is probably it bound to a specific device which would be hololens in this case other than that head mount at this place where you have really a fully immersive view or usually seen as we are so the only specific mixed reality device mentioned was the hololens anything else head mount
