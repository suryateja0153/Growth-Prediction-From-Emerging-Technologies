 [MUSIC].  What is Dev Days and why should I come? Dev Days is our conference that we're doing just before Build. It started off last year with something called MR Jam at Build. We had about 100 people come in for a little mini-conference inside of a conference and it was super successful all mixed reality related content. This year we decided we want to up it, bring in more people. So May 2nd, 3rd we're going to have a conference here on campus in Redmond, in our building 92. We really want it to just be a kind of a really close encounter with our engineers and our project managers who have built the products and the software that runs on them. I'll let you guys experience the Hololens and Azure Connect and all the different stuff we announced at Mobile World Congress this year, and really just be hands-on and close with us start building a relationship. So right now you can register interests by signing up for a dev program and then we'll send out application shortly, and start inviting people to the event. We really look forward to having as many people show up as we can and kicking off this event and making it bigger and better every year. [MUSIC]
