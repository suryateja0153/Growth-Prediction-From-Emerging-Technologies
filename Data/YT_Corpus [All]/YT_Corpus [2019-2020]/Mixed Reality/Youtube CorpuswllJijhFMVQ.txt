 in game in Maximus chaos max prayer this was developed between a spin-off of Alta University called Bella motion and Alta university itself in Finland so if you've seen my previous talk saying if you haven't you should know that people are not exercising enough so that's a problem I'm trying to solve one way to solve that is to increase your motivation that exercise and that said can be tackled in a lot of different ways the way we tried to tackle it is through satisfying their innate human needs and these are posited by self-determination theory as autonomy competence and relatedness autonomy means that you're feeling in control of your own actions so you have a lot of agency you're able to control your own actions competence means that you're able to chant a master some sort of challenging task and really this is a way of being able to just have a sense of belonging a sense of feeling of closeness to other people games are actually very particularly supportive of this because well in Ptolemy's you can extremely explore a game world you can have different characters that you can choose different abilities to enhance and of course they're built around challenge so you have different things that you can accomplish in the game that allows you to feel more competent and multiplayer games can particularly support social interaction how well they do it depends on the game so when I say empowered movement I'm actually talking about exaggerated movement there been number of papers have dealt with exaggerated movement but really this is being common in game since the days of Mario so super human movement exaggerated movement if you think of Mario doing somersaults wall jumps that sort of thing in the game I'm showing here kick-ass kung-fu it was developed back in 205 but I'm showing that it's a both exaggerated movement in the horizontal and the vertical now the reason that we're showing both these is that the horizontal movement actually made it difficult to judge how far you weight our way you are from the opponent but the vertical movement was more feeling like you actually had some control had these superhuman abilities so where can that translate is the next question so this has been actually shown in these sort of papers to support confidence and more recently it's been shown to support and autonomy we developed a game in super stuff his name of the game which was the first multi player movement empowerment extra game first design and study of a multi player trampoline video game so that's where this vertical jump is coming from and first in the wild study of movement power in general so the design challenges actually come from the trampolines themselves trampolines may motivate physical activity there are a lot of trampoline parks in the world you have backyard trampolines people seem to like them the problem is that jumping on trampolines can be dangerous there have been recent studies done saying that especially having more than one person jumping on a trampoline at the same time can cause severe injury if you get bored after jumping for a while doing just simple up-and-down jumps you may want to think you have to do tricks like summer sauce which can also be dangerous so we had to find a way in order to make sure that people could do simple jumps and also be able to connect more than one person at the same time without being dangerous so how do you do this sort of switching from jumping or to standing to walking that's going to be slow so we can't actually say tell them that okay now you have to stop jumping and do something else now there got to be continually jumping throughout the entire game so how do you make it engaging how you make it safe when they're jumping all the time I won't go too much into the drag a bit in but there's more in the paper but how do you awesome an enable multiplayer interaction that's meaningful despite this lag that you may encounter as I mentioned the platform the ballet jump platform was developed by Bell emotion which was a spin-off startup company from Altos research it consists of a display screen which shows the game it also has a trampoline obvious reasons a camera which tracks the players motions they also has proprietary software for tracking that has beyond what the connection can do it can actually track motion based on proprietary software and touch screen display on the right here you'll see a touchscreen display for ministry of purposes let me get my laser pointer on there so super stumped it was developed from earlier research in earlier research we found that this very simple act of jumping up and down can actually be engaging if we allowed them to stomp on things so in this video I'm showing the very simple movement that they had to do is jump left right and then they're stopping and things but this was found to be very engaging so this would be the single-player games that were just have very simple jumps and all they were doing is jumping on enemies and obstacles and they loved it so from that we can in the this stop mechanic became a big part of what we call super sum which is the multiplayer game and we wanted to emphasize this stomp mechanic because it works so well so we did this through air particle effects you'll notice some park effects coming out from this person here who is dumped you know that you won't notice here but strong sound effects we have we have a camera shake effect so the whole world will actually shake as they're jumping and we shake and shatter the ground and there's also this band of light that just penetrates throughout the entire game world as they actually jump and to show a bit of that in action so instead of jumping now on on a obstacle to jumping on each other so you notice here that we actually have two setups we have two different trampoline steps and we have to connect them through a network and that's how we got this to actually be safe so they are no longer jumping on the same trampoline they're jumping on two separate steps now in earlier experiments with super stunts we noticed that in it's this sort of networked atmosphere with this these video images if you transfer the whole image the the bones it's the skeletal structures it actually has a la lag and so it's very difficult and if you are actually allowing people to do these precise movements like if you allow them to someone who punch someone then that can actually result in random flailing so people would just try to flail against each other instead of doing a meaningful kick and this also becomes impossible to dodge and one of the reasons is that is because when you jump you casually can't really change your trajectory midair so that actually creates this sort of dynamic by using the simple jump the mechanic being able to say okay now I have to predict where someone's going to be so we evaluated this using a single session in the wild study and indoor activity park where it's super stomp is played every day we recruited 26 participants and we only recruited them after they finished a game because we didn't want to interrupt their act with her autonomy we wanted to get them afterwards so that their whole game play was not interfering with their autonomy we could measure it accurately we had an age range of 6 years to 42 years old mostly the parents for the elders but mostly children median age was 10 years old and we measured this through three three minutes is the one was a physical activity enjoyment scale which is a validated questionnaire which spin validated in children as well the Ubisoft perceived an experience questionnaire has been validated for adults but not children just though and we also conducted semi-structured views and now the question years have been standardized so we don't know if a walk across all games but they are been validated and what we found was they actually did have high autonomy confidence and relatedness in fact when we actually asked questions that were not directly related to railay and as they they brought up the multiplayer aspects what were the best part about the game well - I get to play with a friend or crushing a friend but we also asked about spectators because if you'll see we actually had people lined up all the time people were lying up to see people play this game and someone to see how exactly did that affect their play experience and what we found was that it didn't negatively impact their experience it gave them motivation to play better and according to the pace of the interview they actually had favorable attitude towards the exercise as well and finally we actually asked about the exaggerated movement the movement empowerment did you feel like you have superpowers and one quote I particularly like is yes because one can jump so high in it that looks like you're in some freakin jumping world where there are only characters at jump like all the way to space or something so they know this that they had this exaggerated movement and for the most part they really enjoyed that the key takeaways here we have a multiplayer trampoline game we developed it it's feasible to be both engaging and safe we do support autonomy I'm that's more in the paper about this and when faced with design challenges it still was the lag and we empower movement to support human needs and I'm going to leave you with a short video and take questions after right so thank you questions all right yes rooster yeah you're in front well I'll give you my microphone that's fastest hi thank you rob for the presentation it was it was really really interesting Annina market seguro ala University I'm wondering about a couple of things one of them is about the size of the display and I'm thinking about it in terms of how it may affect the way that they are looking at it it's lower and small than smaller than the jump right and even how that affected the way they were moving that's one and then the second one I was noticing that I mean there is this small delay between their jump and the avatars jump right and I was wondering if you saw them trying to watch the other player physically jumping there's there's not much maybe that they did that they could see from the way that they were positioned but if that was a strategy that you saw happening and if you're thinking about using that maybe to rearrange the space that they can actually like monitor each other's physical actions okay 60 first part of that first so you're wondering actually what was it for besides it's great yes there was a bunch of testing done with positioning and sizing of the screen we found that placing it directly to the trampoline was actually made it too low to for their field of vision so we needed to make sure that they had the field of vision the other screen at all times there in the jump so there was a lot of testing done to determine what the best size was what the best placement was more about that in the paper but yes there was testing done to determine that we found that it was best to have it placed a few centimeters away from the trampoline and a little bit vertically up not directly attached otherwise you can't see it as you're up as far as strategies for looking at the other player we didn't come across because of the way it's positioned that might be something that Bella looks for in the future though okay okay we have another question there the left the other side of the room thank you making be too outrageous I mean so it feel too unnatural so you feel attached to the actual movement of the character on the screen so I will preface this by saying I'm not the game designer I designed the study the barrel motion people decide the game so I don't know the technical details behind some of the actions that they made I do know that there has been a lot of testing done even before super stomp but when they started developing toy watch in the first games that showed where they tried to do all this calibration one thing I will note in the paper that we mentioned was that this random flailing part we couldn't transfer the entire structure of the player but we could transfer the outline and so what we that's why we made it to so that any player can use any pose to make a jump and make a stomp so if you have if you're crouch you can make you can jump and still hit the other player if you're it you know you can do this sort of thing you can do it from any sort of direction you want in the stump estampa will still count we had to do calibrations to determine who made the stop and that was a little bit more technical bit yes we did do calibrations to figure that out okay right I see that there are some other questions but I don't want to have the evil look of my time keeper so we have to move on thank you okay and while the next presenters are setting up it's actually a co presentation of Roland and Pallavi
