 bonjour hi welcome to the stream i'm frank boucher  cloud advocate and today with me another cloud   advocate you know hermie b because it's their  second apparition on this channel i have with me   april april how are you hi how are you hi everyone  i am feeling okay trying to wake up my device here   half robocop robo right i do  feel like a robocop actually let's see i think it went to sleep needs  to be working it might turn it off yeah   yeah one second for that but very excited  by today uh today's topic will be fun yeah sorry about that it's not a problem   so in the chat let's let us know if you saw  the first episode of uh april with us uh it was   last week right yeah last week yes it was last  week wednesday last week on tuesday last week hey surety dev oh robo vogue i love that hi smiley dove i haven't talked to you in a while okay it's coming back on it's getting it's  getting back yeah it's like a little nap you know   technology likes to take naps when  you need it most right totally fine   i will be patient because i  really want it to work later so first time well welcome welcome super happy to  have you it's a very special day today because   we're mixing cooking reality and azure  how can you imagine that even if i try   really really hard i will i wouldn't have think  about that mixing those things but it's working   that's all that's it this is how you  can see that april she's a genius but apparently she's also having tech issues that was working few minutes ago it's restarting now that's fine nice to be here i'm happy  you are it would be fun today so i don't know um so for those who didn't  see last time show with april we did   she she's she shot a little bit sorry that's my  english it's monday monday is always difficult for   me in english and i'm kind of rusty so on the last  stream what uh april was showing us is she built a   game to learn french uh she wanted to learn french  shows she built a game in augmented reality where   the game display cards in front of her and then  she need to press a button to and then say if it's   showing like the word dog she need to say it in  in french so it's she and then if she pronounce   it correctly the card will turn green and she  has it also the other way around so she read   the word in french and then she must say it in  english and like to make sure she understand both   so it was very very interesting and she's  using azure cognitive services with that   and a few services it was pretty cool so she  shared all the links um yeah so if you follow her   on twitter or follow me on twitter when i will  put uh the video on youtube right now i'm i'm   battling make sure i have the good name and i'm  respecting all the rules to put content online   but uh soon i promise we'll put that online and  you will be able to uh to read more about that yes and third time's a charm  i'm restarting it again let's see wow we have plenty of a new person  today that's awesome welcome aboard doo dah and that's how you know it's live because now  i need to make times and tell stories and stuff   and she cannot even hear me right  now because she remove her headset maybe she does so uh tomorrow let's let's check chat a little  bit so tomorrow another uh part two tomorrow   tomorrow is uh joining back again uh he will we'll  continuing in this case we're continuing to build   a notification application that he built last  time we spent a lot of time making sure that uh   the application was working on android  because he's doing the application and xamarin   so tomorrow we continue to push the infrastructure  setting a hub and then that's the notification   hub will send the message to all different  devices so it will be very very cool too tell us a joke in quebecois our quebecois  song ah you guys code in in this channel   yes yes yes we do code it's just that right now  uh april is having some technical issue and we   will need her to have her setup working so that's  why we're chit-chatting but yes like it's heavy   on the moment unfortunately i don't think i'll  be able to show it in the device i'll have to do   it the unfun way and show it in the unity editor  because every time i turn the device on and off   it's not fully turning on so i'll just show  it in unity editor instead one second because   i just put the piece off one second it's  live she must go on so we'll do what we can just sad for you oh goodness yeah probably i never  play with those things myself but uh yes this this the chair has  bunny hair bunny here sorry yeah i know someone who must be really upset  right now i can show you one thing okay so i bought this thing earlier today i'm not sure  is it showing up correctly this way just uh   it does bunch of uh if i press i  can change channel and it show a   gift and stuff like that pixel art kind of thing well that one is sad it's a gun but uh   come on switch there's a few uh and  you can control it with your phone okay let's let's do this while  it works okay okay social cherish   uh one second let me make sure i'm logged  in thanks for your patience everyone   yeah halloween a little sky they're getting tired  of listening to me oh almost there almost there   i just need to pull up the page i need  you to see hey michael how are you uh surely they have for for the little frame   uh you use the app and you could pre-select a  bunch of um animated gif or image that you want in   there's some alarm there's a bunch of stuff  it's called uh pixu pixel i think there's a few   different variation of that there's one  model that is a speaker too okay let's go   i will change scenes and i'm ready whenever you  are oh yeah i'm just waiting i was a making time so we're now transported in april's house yay  welcome to my crib all right so it seems to   be everything is working so ignore the dog in the  background barking so the app that i created that   i'm showing this week is a um a recipe book if you  a recipe app that you can use while you're cooking   i made everything of a larger scale just so that  way you can see everything but essentially if   you're using it in real life it would be smaller  it'll start off with recipes that you can select   so for this one i did one for cookies and as you  can see what it looks like there's some buttons   here on the left that has some functionality that  we'll get into in a second in the middle though i   have the ingredients list for my chocolate chip  cookies and so first i have the prep time cook   time i have all the ingredients that are here as  well and then what as but you can see here i can   actually click these they're check boxes so if i'm  cooking and i'm walking around my kitchen trying   to make sure i grab everything i can say oh i  just grabbed two large eggs let me check that off   and okay i got the vanilla extract so on and so  forth i can also view instructions and that will   take me to the instructions that i have here as  well one cool thing with this particular uh app   the way that it's been built is that what you're  seeing in front of you this text is scrollable   so depending on where your eyes are  it'll actually scroll up and down   so yeah it should yeah it's done it  right now actually as soon as i move   my head and then i moved it let's see  if we can do it again you see that yeah   yeah so now i don't even have to scroll and so  we're using eye tracking for that i do have a   bit of a bug on this because right now the  text is like going to the sky as you can see   but um essentially it works both directions so  i can scroll back down it says star wars teams   yeah pretty much right so it's a feature it's  not a bug it's a feature it's just like it's   this is exactly exactly um i also have some voice  activation in here i have a feeling that my mic   permission was not set because when i say i see  timer yeah it's not set so let me exit out of   this and then come back into it and she asked me  for permission to use my mic um i noticed that   let's see oh i hope it lets me do it because  the voice is the important part of this   this is so cool okay so it didn't do it right you  really want a normal lens um okay so we'll see if   voice works in a second let me see timer nope all  right so somewhere my mic settings aren't turned   on right now but essentially i have everything set  up to take regular uh voice commands in english   and that's something that's native with mrtk  if you're using the windows universal uh   platform or universal windows platform but the  way i untied azure into this is that i can also do   voice commands in a chosen language so in my case  that language is spanish so if you've probably   seen to the side i have some like spanish phrases  and i have a button over here that i can click to   say something in spanish that's just so i can make  sure i'm saying the right word the most important   i can also see what it comes out as and so  we'll see if that works in a second since my mic   um i don't think my mic permissions have been  granted but in any case um if i do quick timer   um i have a timer that pops up over here now in  theory you would want to select whatever that   time might be i have it um hard-coded right  now to be at 90 so um i can start it and   did it start uh-oh it's not liking me right now  i promise you working earlier and we could take a   look at it in a second over in unity but i have a  feeling right now if i try out this spanish thing   it might not it might not let me do  it let me see let's see instruction is oh it does okay yeah it worked so as you can  see i said instructions in spanish and it   switched to the instruction screen let me  try again and say ingredients ingredients i didn't say right ingredient ingredients there we go so now it's  switched back um if i wanted to   uh let me see if i wanted to go  back to recipe book i would then say does it do it nope also this is why i have  this here to debug with regards to how my   pronunciation is because spanish is not my first  language it's my second actually libro de respecta ah i think of everything i said libros de mercedes there we go and so it can pop up here um and  i also did the same thing with using spanish   as well as here to do different controls  now essentially what would be even more   cool is if you didn't have to press some button  off in the distance and with mixed value toolkit   we have what are called solvers and um there  are ways that you can attach objects to follow   whatever the designated target is so for example  um i could use a solver to have this little mic   button pop up whenever i show my hand so as you  can see right now probably do you see kind of   like holographic looking hands frank oh yeah and  since the beginning i thought it's really awesome   so what's really cool about this you can kind of  see there's little joints in here you can attach   um a solver to any of these joints and that way  i can attach a mic to any of these if i wanted   to attach it for example to like my wrist even i  could put one there and then just tap my wrist and   that'll turn on the mic so i can say whatever  in spanish so that's what the ass is i am now   going to turn this one off and we'll go  see how to build this yeah over in uh unity   wonderful it is awesome april i i didn't  thought you will be as advent on on on that app   uh yeah i didn't think so  either so that makes sense okay so to be fair because people don't know  but how long have you been work okay i will wait   say that one more time yeah i just paused  i realized you didn't have your headset   so just to make everybody knows how long have you  been working like how long did to arrive to that   prototype how long have like how many hours  or how many days or a week or whatever yeah   so uh for this i would say it  took me two days to make this   um two days being that i was really starting  from scratch so it was a matter of figuring out   what the heck i wanted to do and then trying  to figure out how things work in unity   um but last night i literally rebuilt all of it  and i got it done like super fast because at that   point you already know what needs to happen where  so uh that made a big difference let me just turn   my green lights back around but you know these  experiences the ones that i typically share   they don't take a lot of custom code yes we'll do  some coding while we're here today but um a lot   of it is using what we have with the mixed reality  toolkit and so um frank if you can share my screen   since you are talking i put you a little bit  bigger but oh thank you it's like we could see you   yeah i don't know like i was asking because  bunch of people were asking hey are we coding   like you know what is it and like oh it looked  more advanced and uh i know you like to make yeah i laugh about that um as it not being  really advanced because i personally like   to create content for beginners so that way for  those who are starting out they can build these uh   these different experiences that might look really  advanced on the outside but once you start working   on it you you come to realize that um it's it's uh  it's more approachable as opposed to some of the   more advanced things that we could be building now  with that said because i myself i started working   with this last summer this being this entire space  and of like extended reality and spatial computing   and so i have come to fall in love with  using the mixed reality toolkit and that's   what you see here on the screen now the mixed  reality toolkit um it is designed to help you   really speed up your development process if you're  creating um anything with a virtual reality and   augmented reality and so i would highly suggest  that if you're interested in learning more about   this and this is what we'll be using while  we're creating this check this out frank if   you could share the getting started with mrpk  link in the chat so that way the folks at home   will have access it's getting started with mrtk  should be the first one in my list of links   uh hl 2k tutorial getting started  i'll be getting started with mrtk it should be a microsoft.github.io link i will find it where is it why i don't see it no worries um worst case scenario if you're  trying to find this page you can have it okay   perfect yeah i'm sorry i'm just just slow oh it's  okay so that particular link will land you where   i am right now and this is uh instructions on  how to get started with mrtk highly suggest   taking a look at this if you're brand new  to working with the mixed reality toolkit   this is what we'll be using and as you're getting  started with this the instructions here will walk   you through how to import that into your project  about how much experience do you need to create   what we're doing today you need some familiarity  with unity with regards to understanding what the   different windows are and how to do different  things in the inspector for example but   the documentation we're sharing also has that very  thorough walkthrough as well so it's so long as   you can follow the instructions and match  the picture to what you're seeing in unity   you'll be able to do this as well um one more  thing with preheading community i'm spending some   time tomorrow actually placing these projects into  a github repo so that way if you want to try these   out on your own build on top of them do whatever  you want feel free i personally create these   projects for you all so that way you can take them  and run wild with them and build whatever um this   was the third mixed reality project that i've had  that i've created but i'll share more of that on   twitter once that's available so let's head over  into unity since i keep talking about it so i have   uh my scene here it's nice and blank and if you're  wondering for this one i'm using unity2019.3.14.f   for my version of unity now when you're using  the mixed reality toolkit but more important   when you're doing development for windows mixed  reality you do need to set up your computer for   that and so um i'm not going to do all the steps  here but just to walk through just briefly where   those areas are in file you'll need to switch  to the universal windows platform very important   once you've done that change in player settings  you'll need to add in the windows mixed reality   within the virtual reality sdks there are  some settings that need to be adjusted in   there and i can share documentation on where  that information is once you've done that   beyond that you'll head over  into window for text mesh pro   and you'll import that and then you'll also import  the reality toolkit into your project you'll do   that by going to assets import mute sorry import  package custom package and then wherever you've   downloaded the mixed reality toolkit and so if  that sounds like a mouthful don't worry because   there is a link that will walk you through how  to do all that and frank if you could share the   hl2 import mrtk link it's aka dot ms slash perfect  so this link will take you to the page that i'm on   um i think it's the one that i'm on right now and  if you go to page like two while you're on here   it'll walk you through every single step i just  zoomed through in unity and i prefer looking at   the docs when i was getting started because  it's really step-by-step instructions there   so that's how you can set your projects up now  with regards to mutuality toolkit once that's been   imported you're going to add that to your scene  and configure and then that's when you're going to   get um these two new objects that are created over  here one's the mixed reality toolkit the other   one is the mixturality play space your camera if  you're wondering where that went is inside of i   believe the mixed reality play space it goes into  there and then the mixturality toolkit itself is   the mixed reality toolkit so when i created this  app i um knew i wanted to add in that eye tracking   that i showed you which i think is super cool  i know the first time i tried out a hololens um   that was one of the things that i actually tried  out for the first time was uh alisa hollywood too   was seeing the attack scroll and so we actually  have um a example scene where you can go check   that out if you want to try it out on a device  and that's part of the mixed reality toolkit if   you import the example package i'm not going to  import that because i already have it imported   but what the reason why i bring that up is  because these example packages already have um uh   fully built out versions of probably what you  want to build and so when i personally want to   build something and i don't want to start  100 from scratch i like to go to um to the   examples and in this case it's going to be the  eye tracking one and in scenes we actually have a   navigation one which is what you saw so rather  than again rather than me reinvent the wheel   i go find that object that has what i need it and  i know this one is the eye bass scroll and so if i   come up that's going to be this one that's right  here and i personally take this can take this uh   this game object copy that from there and then  i would head back over to my actual scene which   i've made earlier for you all and then here i  would just right click and paste and now i have   it so i don't have to start from scratch with  that that part there is literally copy and paste yeah that part is like nice and fun um what uh  one thing i need to make sure we do is make sure   we have the right configuration profile that just  makes sure that we have a really good experience   when we are using this on device and it'll  also change my background now because i have   that example package already imported into  this project i'm actually also going to get   all the other all the other configuration profiles  that have been set um i'm going to use the eye   tracking one because now i don't have to go in  and modify all the different profiles because   it's already set up the way it needs to be as  you can probably see my screen down here has   turned black and that coincides with the hololens  2 configuration so that was the other thing now   back to this uh scrolling thing what we need to do  let me close teams i guess i thought it was closed   it might not be closed all right so what we need  to do from here actually frank give me one second   let me put teams on do not disturb can we take  away my screen share for a second yep thank you   okay you're safe now thank  you thank you and let me just there we go all right cool okay you can  bring me back now yes ma'am i hate it   i still don't have any icons i have a  stream deck like i have this bunch of button   but i didn't put images so i need  to read the text and make sure yeah oh i also realized my head was  blocking notifications so that's perfect too   all right so all right cool so now that we have  this in here um from a setup perspective what   i had were two different um with unity calls and  quads if you will and on these quads i have text   and then i have that whole checkbox effect for the  ingredients and so when we create those i'm going   to first and foremost reset where this is located  because i like to keep things centered so i'm just   going to reset that and then i'm going to bring  it to 0.8 so that way i can see it clearly in   front of me and then once i open up the eye bass  scroll area here i have title and subtitle let   me actually show them on the same there we are so  title and subtitle we're not going to need these   so we can delete those and now what we're left  with is going to be the scrolling thing here so   what i suggest doing is first and foremost making  use of what's already there and this one already   has a text um object so what i've done is just  duplicate it line it back up this way if i need to   and then you can move that down and around  however it needs to be so we'll just do a very   very light example here let's  say this one said cookies   and so we changed the text there to say cookies  here we can edit that text in the unity editor so   that way we don't have to open up any code  to do that which i really personally like   then down here we have the additional text let's  say i wanted that to say prep time uh 20 minutes   so that's good heading back to that cookies  one that's a little small so let's make it big   essays this is two to a size two we can bring  that over so now it's centered that prep time   one we need a cook time so we can duplicate that  and you can do that i'm using a shortcut ctrl d   and what you'll need to do for there is just  change the text mesh property to cook cookie time   cook time make that 15 minutes and we can slide  that over so already that quick frank what we just   did was recreate essentially that interface that  we had in the beginning for where the ingredients   was and yet i haven't opened any code editor to  do any of it i did all that in the unity editor   now just below that we have this canvas  object where it has the scroll view   here in the viewport in the text mesh pro text  is where you have this text that's in there   now for what i'm making i don't need that text  because for the ingredients where it's just a list   of ingredients and we don't need to scroll that  so um i actually removed this completely because   there's no need for it but to make my life easier  because my instructions page uses the same setup   i want to duplicate this particular object and  i'm going to just call this one instructions and i'm going to turn it off so that way it's  hidden i did that so that way i don't have to redo   everything all over again when we get to the next  part but opening this back up since i don't need   that text um at all really i don't need any of  this actually so where it says canvas down i can   delete that and now it's blank now that checkbox  effect that you saw earlier they're buttons within   mrtk and so you can find those they're going  to be in the sdk ux interactable prefabs folder   and there is a list of buttons to choose from what  we want is going to be for the check box and let's   see if i can find it i think it's the first one  there drag that up into the scene and now it's   there i'm going to make sure you can see it by  putting it at a 0.8 and so here it is is that   checkbox now if you recall i had a couple of them  and so what's great here is that i can duplicate   this again let's just add four ingredients using  ctrl d we duplicated that four times and so rather   than me have to space this out and making sure  that it's like perfectly spaced out what i'm   going to do instead is use what's called a grid  object collection in mrally toolkit i'll show you   what that does in a second i'm going to create  an empty object let's just call this ingredient   and i'm going to reset this  so it's at a decent position   and all these check boxes that we just made i'm  going to make them children of this ingredient   and then here in ingredients we're going to  add a component that's going to be the grid   object collection what that's going to do is place  these check boxes on a grid so right now we have   four of them we'll need to update this so that  way um they they align vertically and vertically   in a row so there's only four so we'll say it has  four rows this is where it gets a little tricky   is the width and the height because uh you might  play around with this until you get exactly what   you want i'm going to start with point two and  click update collection you have a question yeah   i have a question um could you like right now i  like we are putting all those manually like for   a prototype it's good but like could we add that a  little bit more by programmation i'm assuming yes   we could create those for these parts um you could  uh but what's really great about unity and working   with the mixed rally tool kit is that it does  minimize that need to do a lot of custom um code   which i think is really helpful so like even  right now what i'm doing with this grid object   collection that's a script in itself it's just  that i didn't have to create the script because   with mrtk it was provided for you and so now from  there you can work within the editor to do things   when we start with the uh the speech component  which we'll get to in a second that's when you'll   do more things with um with uh adding stuff  with codes but over in mixed reality toolkit if it was more like let's say i want to add  more recipe like let's say i want to add   the chocolate oh like that so like like i could  add like a maybe in a database or a specific   format like you know uh so it's sucked in  the application and like show the proper   list of check bar like assuming like  it's possible possible yeah yeah possible   can i do it probably not not in two days not in  two days that's totally fine like yeah we all do   that right when you protest prototypes you focus  on different specs so of course some stuff are   just curious because i i don't know yeah from a  scaling perspective i think that would be more   efficient if you are playing from a database and  making sure that everything sets appropriately   because if you were to do this manually for like  however many recipes that's a lot of clicking   and dragging and so on and so forth which for me  that's why i think that could work because um what   you're seeing right now for the ingredients list  it's really just like the template that i created   and then from there just add your ingredients  so i think if you have the template already made   using code in some way like using a script in some  way you probably could pull that in and adjust as   necessary um database it could be like a json file  or something yeah i think it's possible um i would   be interested to see if i could do that though  um for this one though using the active script   that we have here at least for the great object  collection when i click update collection i should   see all four of the boxes now so um i'm just going  to adjust this until they seem to be about right   let's do this one more time there we go and i see  that cory's in the chat so hi corey how are you   happy to glance over and i saw your name in  there um all right so with these check boxes   you can add the text to them open them  up button content there should be a   label and here let's say there's something  that said egg let's say the next one said milk also shirley dev was asking a question and i  totally miss it so sorry about that sorry there   i was asking would you had an application  windows in a view such as notepad or calculator   and uh while you're in the when you're in the  hololens i'm assuming um so you could have   um multiple uh multiple things open  i've actually also seen demos where   folks have had um have had a what am i trying to  say have had multiple things open at one time and   it's just a matter of uh assuming that you have  the app for it on the device and you could do   that like i could have opened up a browser  for example while i was in the recipe app and   browse the internet if i wanted to so i don't  have a lot of apps on my hololens just primarily   because i like to keep it as free as i can but as  long as you have the app on there you can access   the windows store as well on hololens and so if  you use the app in there you want to download   like onenote for example then as soon as you  downloaded it and it's on there you can pop it up   and you'll be able to see it as well all right  so this is our ingredients list we made that   um relatively quickly and so if i go into play  mode really quick what you should be able to see   is when i bring my hands up you can stick these  on and off so here's my hand i can quick that   i have eggs click that i have milk because i  have sugars i have a typo there and flour so   that's good that's created i'm going to fix that  typo in sugar because it's just a sugar not sugars   and the next thing we'll  add in is the instructions   and then after the instructions we'll just  get into some coding there we go and let's   just say this because it's a sad day when  you don't save and everything closes on you   so yeah so we got ingredients out  the way and now uh let's move that to this so that way everything's grouped  together i like being pretty organized   and now let's do something with these  instructions let's bring those back   bring those back i think i turned off the wrong  thing come on there we go so i'm not going to   change anything in here but i will show you that  if you want to adjust this text that's in here   um because i'm using what was already created  from the example of that comes with mixed   reality toolkit that text area is going to  be down here in scroll view in the viewport   and then where it says text mesh pro text  this is all that text that's there so   this is where you can in my case insert the uh  recipe so right now we have two different things   that pop up when we have ingredients the second we  have the instructions and as you saw on the demo   you can navigate to them using buttons so  i uh briefly lied i'm going to do one more   thing before we get into the code and that's  adding these buttons because the buttons is   what we'll um need to add the code to as well so  we can use some speech so fortunately with mrtk   we already have buttons i'm going to drag in  this uh this one that's already a vertical bar   i think i only used i used to use the wrong one  there should be one that has four buttons on it   yep there we go and then i'm going to  reset it so it's at the right place   i was clicking the wrong button all right so there's that i want to scale this up to  a five i think i did for the last one   so now that's pretty big i have aging eyes so i  need two tiny things to eat bigger um all right   so there were four buttons in general and you can  edit them in here we have pressable buttons it's   going to be that button icon in text in this text  mesh pro the first one says ingredients what's   awesome is that we have icons on in here for you  to change your uh your buttons so where do they go i think i lost where's the button icon thing is it  should be in here oh here it is no maybe it's not   we can get to that later but most important  what we need to do here is at least change   the text that's in here oh wait there it is so  where are you ah okay so here's where you can   change those buttons um for ingredients i did a  check box because we're checking boxes in there   you can use your own icons i for the sake  of prototyping i use what comes with mrtk   um but let's go ahead and update all these  so this one will say instruction this one   will say timer and the final one will say  recipe book and that'll take you back to   like the recipe book page that we haven't created  but it would be the page that has all your recipes   if this was an actual um recipe book so we  have the buttons we have instructions and now   we are getting into some code so the  very first thing that i want to create   is the ability for us to switch between  these themes so let's create a new script   and i have a script folder that's already created  but we'll create some new ones in here just for   the screen for the stream so you go to create  c sharp we're going to call this one twitch   and then recipe management pages only because  i don't want to mess up the ones i had before   and so while that compiles uh we'll open this up  in visual studio and then we will go ahead and   create a script so that way we can switch between  ingredients versus instructions so that's the   first thing and this one promise you it is a  very short script it does not take a lot which   is lovely when you create scripts in unity if  you're brand new to this they do give you um this   template if you will um to to start with it has  these things at the top and then there are there's   a start method as well as an update the start  is what's called when the scene first loads and   then update is what's called every single frame  so if you want an action to happen every frame   that would go in update if you want something to  happen at start then that would go and start you   don't have to keep these and as an example we're  actually going to get rid of them for this script   because we don't need them what we want to do is  create two methods one that opens the ingredients   that ingredients panel and then one that opens the  instructions panel so to start what we need to do   to start you know what i will ask right go ahead  and ask because because i have my glasses but i   i still can yes you want to zoom in yeah let's do  that let's see let me know is this good yeah it's   good well that's that's perfect yeah keep it like  if it's too big that like everything is scroll   you could zoom out a little bit but like it's  you know that way i'm sure everybody can follow   okay yes perfect thank you for reminding me i was  the one that was just talking about my aging eyes   so all right so we're going to create two public  game objects reason being is that we want to be   able to assign objects that are already in unity  to these fields so that way we can ensure that   um this is what's being referenced so in visual  studio we'll start with public game object   we'll call this one ingredient page make it make  sense the next one that we'll do is going to be   called public game object and we'll call this one  instructions page and those are two public objects   now from here we'll create the first method this  one's going to be to open that ingredients panel   so we'll do a public void we're going to call it  open ingredient and here we are and then inside   that the logic that we want to have is that if  for the ingredients page essentially we want to   make sure that the instruction page is hidden  so therefore when we have the ingredients page   method called ingredients should be open and  instructions should be closed but in unity terms   that means that ingredients page should be set to  active and then for the instructions page that set   the active value is going to be false and so what  that looks like in code is ingredient page dot   set active to true and then instructions page that  active is going to be false so you got to love   boolean values and right below that we're going  to do the inverse for the instructions and so   anyway make sure i close that and then  down here we'll do uh open instructions and sorry oh i knew i was missing something  i was like why is it squiggly all right   yeah those tricky parentheses so for this  one we'll do the inverse as i said above   um this one the instructions page set active  will be true and then the ingredient page set   active will be false i think the only person  i know who type everything again i would have   copy paste it and just change the  name and like move things around right i will say for someone who like just learned  c sharp late last year this has been like the best   way for me to get familiar and acclimated with  everything because um i you know we get used to   copying pasting so much and then when you  really don't have something to copy from   then it's like oh shoot like for me it's like  shoot yeah so um i found that is for me it's   better to retain knowledge um this way so um i  mentioned in the beginning this is a short script   and this is literally like the script so this is  good to go we'll save it we'll head back over into   unity let that compile and then we're going to uh  add that script to these buttons so this way when   we click the buttons things will flip back and  forth now just to prove that we're actually doing   something if i click play here and if i click  this ingredients button nothing's going to happen   you see that i can click it and nothing happens  and that's because you need to add that script   um also i was already yeah i was running on  the instructions page technically it should   have took me two ingredients what i'm going  to do is turn back on the one that needs to be ingredients i just need to name that properly  i'm going to turn off instructions and then   down here where i have this button collection  that's where i'm going to add the um that script   we just created so this one is called manage  recipe pages nope it has switched before it   there we go so now that's been added and then  right below that these are those two public game   objects that i mentioned one was the ingredient  page the other one is the instructions page and so   hmm yeah sorry i said oh yeah i said it i i answer  you but in in french oh okay so we're going to   drag that ingredient here that ingredients object  from earlier that's holding all that information   for the ingredients and then the instructions  we're going to drag that here to the instructions   page and then the next thing we need to do  now is make these top two buttons do something   so the first the first pressable button i  like to rename these so that we know what the   heck we're even talking about and let me just  say instructions there we go so starting with   ingredients um because i'm using what are known as  prefabs in unity and these are going to be objects   that already come pre-configured with mrtk we have  a lot of prefabs and these buttons are prefabs   with that said they have a lot that's already  attached to it already which is great so you don't   have to do that from scratch now what i need to  do is add an event for when that button is pressed   what you'll notice is that we currently already  have some actions that happen when the buttons   are pressed one we have um an indication that  something should be triggered the second we have   here that um that's on the hand press the other  we have here the sound that plays so what we need   to add now is when i press this button change to  this other panel so i'll click one to add to list   i'm going to drag in this button collection here  because that's where i have the script sitting   on that component or that object and then here in  function we're going to go to twitch manage recipe   pages and we're going to find that method that  we created for switching to the ingredients page   so that one's going to be called open ingredients  and guess what prank that's it for that part very   quick doesn't take that long um we'll do the same  for the instructions we're going to head here to   button press dragon button collection there  we're going to do twitch manage recipes pages   this one is open instructions so now assuming  that i didn't mess up somewhere when we click play   i should be able to click instructions and the  instructions one should pop up and when i click um   on ingredients ingredients to pop up so by default  i have ingredients as the first thing that shows   and let's make this a little  bit bigger for the folks at home   and let's bring it on over all right so moment  of truth let me bring my hands up and if i click   instructions it works our script is perfect and  if i click ingredients let me click that one   yep it switches so that was the first script that  we created we made um two methods that um yes   definitely a lot of claps we made two methods  that can switch between these two different scenes   so uh there's another thing that you can do as  well if you want to add that voice functionality   to it because i like using voice and things that  i make because realistically you can't always use   our hands to navigate between different scenes now  it's not the best thing to do in every experience   that you create but if you do have the ability to  do it and it makes sense i would highly suggest   adding it um now as i mentioned during the demo  that if you are using the universal windows   platform there is some voice functionality  that's already built into there that we're   going to make use of before we add that azure  component to do stuff in spanish so for this part   um this part doesn't require coding which is  great but you could do it with code if you want it   you want to head to that mixed reality toolkit  object and then here in the configuration profile   we have input and the input here has a speech  area this speech area has a list of keywords   and you can add keywords to here and assign these  keywords to the objects using what's known as a   speech input handler so that way if someone  were to say that word then whatever action   would um be defined to it would happen now  because i'm using um a unity layout that i   use for the actual example i don't need to add  these all over again but as you can see i have   um keywords for instructions and ingredients  so on and so forth so that's just to show you   where that lives um one thing i do want to  do is move over this cookies thing because it's so weird that they are sitting right there  let's see ah forget it nope i'm gonna do it that was bothering me that uh where is it  i just want to give you a heads up since   we spent enough time uh struggling at the  beginning with the hololens we are one hour   in right now gotcha so the last part  i can definitely get out in 30 minutes   let's where's my oh there it is i just  want to move that over to where this is and there you go and jordy that's it i'm  okay if you want to bust the schedule i'm going to try to stay as as close as i can  um all right so what i what was i saying we're   adding the speech to the two buttons and so for  ingredients if we open up that button again what   we need to do is add what's called a speech input  handler script and that's going to give you that   voice functionality that we're looking for so  we're going to add a component it's literally   called speech input handler and then let me  collapse all these so that way it's in a better   view and in here you can set it so that way  focus is required because if you think about it   if you enable the ability to just say  commands with voice in your experiences   it might be the case that you just your user  accidentally says the word and now they triggered   something so what you can do instead is say that  focus is required what's going to happen is that   the device will check that they're actually  looking at whatever that button is for example   and then if you were to say it then it will take  whatever action um because i didn't for me in   building this i didn't mind not having that focus  i just unchecked it focused required but that's   just a heads up if you're building something  that has voice we want to add the keyword   this one's going to be ingredients which we've  created already and so that's why it populates   it and then here in the response we're  going to add an event and we're going to uh   assign that button collection there similar to how  we just added the functionality for pressing the   buttons we're going to come to that uh that same  script for twitch manage recipe pages and this   one's going to say open ingredients and then we'll  do the same thing for the instructions we're going   to add that speech input handler script and then  i'm going to collapse this again so you all can   have a better view we're going to make focus  not required and we're going to add the keyword   this one is called instructions and then we'll  add the event we'll put that button collection   here same as before this one's going to be  open instructions all right so now what's to   happen is i want to use voice when i go into  play mode to switch between the two different   panels versus me actually touching  it so let's confirm that works instructions ingredients   all right voice works so that's good um so far  we're only one script in and we're about to add   the next one which is going to be your ability  to be able to do this with another language   now i haven't done the research into it and i'm  not 100 sure but i haven't found a way to do it   so that's why i did it this way um i know that  when we do the keywords as we just did in unity   they're in english if there is a way to do them in  another language i'm not 100 sure but fortunately   with azure we can add that ability on our own so  that way we can instead use our language of choice   and it's going to take very similar steps but it  will take more coding fortunately we have a script   available for you that you can use so that way you  don't 100 have to guess and start from scratch um   frank if you can share the let me get the name  of it before i tell you it should be the unity   speech to text which is the aka dot unity speech  to text perfect so it's ready i know it was coming   perfect so that will take you to um what  you should see on my screen which is a quick   start to recognize speech from a microphone and i  personally would suggest switching to c-sharp and   then down below and choose your target environment  going to unity and this will actually give you   a script right here that you can use you're going  to copy that paste that over in community and then   we need to do some manipulating in here to get  it configured for what we need to use it for   now in addition to this you will also need an  azure account so you'll sign up for that you'll   get your credits if you're brand new to using  azure but what needs to be created is going to be   um a uh a congress service resource i believe  it's for speech but more information regarding   the service in itself um it's on our azure page  this is the one link that i just never gave you   frank and i don't know why but for those  at home i will say if you do a search for   microsoft azure cognitive services and you'll go  to the speech services that's where you'll find   the speech to text and that's what we're using you  can even try it out here in the browser as well   you can choose your language of choice and  try that out there are a lot as you can see   so even though i'm just using spanish that's  because i only know three languages in all four   languages and spanish is one of the easier  ones so that's why i'm using spanish but um   you you can really choose whatever is um available  but the way that speech to text is working   is when the user presses that microphone button  the service is looking for an utterance from that   user so that utterance let's say it's ingredients  that will then be sent to azure who will then do a   transcription from speech to text and you're  going to get back a stream and that string   is what i'm using to validate whether that stream  equals whatever if it equals the same exact string   that i create in the code so that's how we're  using the service i'm going to show you how that   works in real life so heading back over into unity  let's create a new script and we're going to call   this one twitch speech and then we're going to  head back into visual studio i'm going to grab   that script that i showed you just a moment ago  and i'm going to copy and paste it into here and i   let's see i'm gonna do it step by step actually  because some of it we don't need to bring over   so let's open up visual studio and here we  are so first things first we need to make   sure that we can actually use the commonwealth  services speech sdk and so here we can do using microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech and that  doesn't look right because none of it looks   like it's registered microsoft cognitive huh  services dot speech and then we also need unity scene management that's what's  going to be able to enable us to uh switch to that recipe book page  that doesn't exist right now   okay so we have the right usings in here  and then we need some uh some public game   objects here as well i'm going to create these  for us one's gonna be a pressable button and this one is going to be the button  that we use to activate the microphone the next one ah i'm in the start  method let me get out of there okay there we go   okay the next one that we're going to  create is the something's not right it's not one second where's my intellisense let's see let's exit  that let's open it back up because this as much   as i like typing everything out from scratch  that's like really making me type everything   dot dot is always interesting right dot and  then you scroll and let's try that again   and if it's still doing that it's okay  because we can do the copy and paste method   well sometimes it takes a little bit of uh  time when the the lib like you're using maybe i wonder oh it didn't even pick up   i don't even have let's see anything  microsoft there we go it's working now okay now i should get pressable buttons  quickly why don't you go away perfect okay   now we're back in business so the next object  we want to add is for that ingredient page and let's call it ingredient page we do one for that  should not be a possible button that should be a   game object because it's not a button there we go  and this one and i saw the ingredient wrong sheesh   i'm making up words over here and i still didn't  celebrate ingredient angry now i can't spell angry d and wow i was completely off okay would  you believe would you believe that i'm like   a spelling bee champ like i literally am and  sometimes i just can't spell words i was reading   it and like i couldn't see what's wrong and i  was like i know it's not like that but like what he's like i know it's not like that but  it's one of those thing where like you   try to not think about the pink  elephant and of course you know   that's the only thing that stay in your mind so  yeah yeah yeah no it's wrong but how do you spell   ingredient yeah it's the same in french right  so like it's except there's an accent but like   yeah anyway we got it now um what i did i also  added an object for the instructions page i added   a stream for the theme name and we're not going  to implement that so you know what i can probably   get rid of it that would be if you were switching  back to that recipe book page that i didn't create   but i did add a text message i thought  it was for star wars teams i know yeah and then what we have next is the text mesh um  we're using that one for the output i use that   from def from a in use debugging perspective if  you will um just so i can make sure that what i   said in spanish is what it should be and it helps  me to keep track of where i said things wrong   in a real world app you wouldn't need that but  it's just for me to make sure that i'm pronouncing   things correctly especially when you realize  it's not working when you're streaming about it   yeah you know whatever you're thinking  about it right so everything is recorded   yeah so the next thing i'm going  to add is going to be references   to um oh i guess a reference i'm only doing one  of these a reference to the twitch managed recipe   script so that way we don't have to recreate that  method those two methods that we have in here   so i'm gonna call this here we go and we're  gonna call this twitch manage recipe and   okay so that's good the last things i am not  going to type out um i'm going to actually now   bring in that script that we had over in um in  on docs and i'm going to just walk you through   what's happening in there before we get to the  good stuff and the update method so i am going to   do paste ctrl v oh did i just start something  i still don't know all my shortcuts in here   so i end up i always like end up doing  things that i shouldn't do in visual studio   i always mess up somehow all right so  this here is where we've added the um   that script that was back over on docs and so  here we have some more um variables that we create   what's going to be important here is the other  julio the boolean is boolean to see if we're   waiting for the recording and then we also have a  stream that gives us that message that comes back   from azure which then gets reassigned to this  output text component that we created earlier   now as we head down we're also checking if the mic  permission has been granted in the demo earlier   you probably heard me mention a million times that  i don't think i granted permission to use my mic   that's uh that's where this comes into play  because typically well not typically but all   the time if you hadn't granted permission to use  your mic then you can't use your mic in the app   it's also a really good thing to do your building  experiences is to build in that request to uh ask   for permission same with the eye tracking we  didn't set it up um today because i'm using a   profile that already had it set up but if you're  using eye tracking in any of your experiences   get permission from the user um that's going to  be really important otherwise you can't use it   so uh the script that i'm using also is capable  if you're doing anything with the android platform   or ios so throughout here you might see some  references to android and ios and that's just   what comes with the script that we have over on  docs here in this awake method we need to grab   that uh that script that i referenced earlier  so that way we can use those methods instead of   having to create it so that's going to be  that twitch manage recipe page and let me   what did i even call it i  did it twitch manage recipe dot find object of type and i will say for me  personally whenever i'm doing anything with   unity with scripting and i don't know how to do it  i always head to youtube because someone somewhere   has recorded a video on how to do something so  like i didn't know how to reference other scripts   for the longest and like i felt like i felt like  it was a possible thing i just didn't know how to   do it unfortunately there are videos on how to do  that and reference variables and other ones so um   i will always suggest youtube if you're getting  started with scripting and unity unity also has   a really good um scripting tutorial that they also  have um coupled up with this but when it comes to   scripting in general um if you want to try out  something that we have at microsoft i actually   checked out i don't have a link to it but it's  over in channel nine and if you happen to head   over to the c sharp docs um scott hanselman and  kendra did a video series of the intro to c sharp   highly suggest checking that out because literally  that's how i learned c sharp so um scripting's not   your thing and it was not my thing when i started  there are a lot of resources out there for you to   check out so we just referenced that one uh twitch  manage recipe pages one so now we can pull in the   methods from that and then down here we have  a button click this is where we're setting up   the uh speech configuration um before we go to  press play on try this out i'm going to put in my   my key from after as well as my region my region  is west u.s too so i can fill that in right now   um and then down here is what's also going to  be really important this is where i'm actually   selecting spanish as the language now there  uh are a lot of other languages that you could   choose from once you do final one i know we have a  chart floating around somewhere on docs that has a   list of all the um correct syntax if you will to  use for the languages i'm using spanish so it's   going to be lowercase es and then capital capital  um or uppercase es i know for french it was like   lowercase fr capital fr german lowercase ce  cable ge so on and so forth so that's what   we're setting in here mine right now is set to  spanish i have seen ways of being able to switch   languages all within one script i haven't gotten  there yet so for now we're just going to do just   one language which is spanish but the reason why  i did spanish over french um and frank maybe you   might know can i include special characters in my  script like could i put an accent over something   in a string yeah yeah i can't okay i've  never done it so i have to try that out   because that's why i did spanish over french  because when i was doing a lot of translations   in french i was like oh there's too many too  many two symbols in here some of the shorts   you can do that uh no problem um and then the two  characters you know the first character are the uh   the country and then the  second one are the language so it's super helpful thanks for that because  like in french you will have multiple french   you could have frfr or cafr or like b-a-b-e-f-r  or like there's multiple version of the french   gotcha gotcha i wish i had that link because i  would share it but i happen to have like stumbled   upon it one day just where it like lays it all out  um okay so we did that config and then down here   is where azure starts to work its magic we have  some if else if else if statements happening here   to check whether speech was recognized we have  some messages that instead are passed over to the   user if nothing's recognized and then down below  we have um that message variable that i said we   created earlier that's going to be assigned to  whatever stream comes back from azure and then   here we have is it waiting for a recording then  it's false that just changes that boolean to false   now here in the start method um we have some more  um conditional statements as well and so these   check to make sure that you actually have objects  assigned to these particular elements in unity   otherwise if you don't have a mic then you can't  use it so you might as well catch that before the   event even proceeds and as we continue to go down  past the android and platform ios we have that   we're checking that the mic permission granted is  true and then the message itself i changed it to   say say something in spanish um again i'm using  that that view of what the language is in the app   for my own sake just to check my own pronunciation  but in theory you wouldn't have anything on screen   saying like speak spanish the user would press  the mic and be able to speak spanish so what's   going to be great and what we're doing down here  is in this update method now there's probably a   much more efficient way of doing this and with  regards to how we code this but because i am uh   i try my best with making sure  that i have nice clean code   we're going to do it the april day today and you  can always clean it up later so starting down here   i just copied over the rest of what was in that  script from docs that have that update method   and here we have that output message now  just below that i am using if statements   is it missing one somewhere  something's not right i'm a missing one   right maybe for the name space or something like  that i was missing a clothing bracket when i   copped it over i forgot one all right so we have  that and then this is where i put my long list   of if statements you only have me to use two of  them right now so the first one that i did for my   conditional statement is if message is equal to  instruction is which is instructions in spanish   then what we want to have happen is we're  going to use that method we created to   open the instructions page so the first thing  we're going to do is reference that script so   i believe i call that switch manage recipe  in here and then we're going to get that   script which is called open ingredients and  then that's it so we can do that again for   ingredients this is where my coat starts to  get probably not the best way to toast so   uh definitely do better than me but  this one will be ingredient days   and we're going to say this  one should manage recipes close open and stretch but open oh i  did them backwards my bad everyone   this one should say open  instructions nobody saw say anything all righty so this is the most simpler  version of what i did um i had more um   more conditional statements in here but in any  case this is really like the last part of the   coding so what we need to do now is i need  to pull this screen off and save it so i can   plop in my uh my azure key and then  we're going to try this out in unity   and hope that everything works so let's give  this a try and let it compile all right so   oh i'm not gonna click save there  we go and we're gonna put that   script on that button collection that we have here  that long vertical bar and so here where it has is that where i put it here and we'll put it  here and we want to pull it up it's called   switch speech and then we have some things  that we need to assign to it because if you   remember we created those public game objects  that we need to assign to first of all we need   a button because right now i don't have a button  in here and let me just grab a button really quick   this is the last thing that we need to do to  set this up let me slide this over because   i want to get a circular one because i'm  being picky there we go close out of that all right so let's bring that over it out there i can't see it because it's not an  idea okay and then we can bring you back over   so we just added the button let me zoom in on  that so you can see that it exists there it is   and the other thing we need is just that text so  that way we can see that uh what the output is   so i'm just going to take one from somewhere else  drag it on down and move it on over this will   give me whatever i say in spanish and i'm going  to say spanish phrase or i'm calling transcription all right and then i now need to come back to  that script so we can find the output text is   going to be that text object we just created the  instructions page is going to be the instructions   page that we have that's initially set and  that's active ingredients page is going to be   ingredients page and then the start reco button  will be that circular button that we just added   so we have all that added and now frank are  you ready for the moment of truth oh yeah   all right i'm going to speak from spanish  and let's hope that it works the first thing   i'll try out is instructions and we'll  see if it switches so here goes nothing all right instructions nope i said it wrong instruction  is no said it wrong instruction on it yay it changed let's try ingredients ingredients yep it works so what we did  was we made use of what was already built   in using um speech that comes with if  you're doing work with windows uh with   the universal windows platform and then we  also added in some azure to it so that way   we can choose whatever language we want to use  and use our voice commands in that way as well   so if you uh are interested in giving  a try like i mentioned i'm working on   creating the repos tomorrow for the projects  that i've shared so far so you can take these   open them up in unity play around with them make  them your own go make fun fabulous language stuff   because that'll make me happy but overall that  is how i recreate it or it is how i created this   recipe book app that i shared with you today how's  that frank oh it was it was awesome like i think   you know like when i'm cooking always like if you  are having a book then it's hard to keep the page   if you're having your ipad or something other than  like you don't want to mess up so having those   things like he could cook without messing around  and and i was just you know when you said like oh   i think it's a good idea to have voice come and  i just see myself putting pancake mix everywhere   because i'm trying to find in the menu yeah  definitely and i and i will say because i can't   take all the credit for the idea um one of my  teammates uh m she had the idea for a recipe book   and i was saying i need a project idea and she  mentioned it and i was like oh i can build that   and so thanks to her like that's where the idea  came from because to your point she said the same   thing when you're cooking your hands aren't always  free you know so laser walker she's in the chat so yeah it's um it's a really really helpful way  to do things and that's also why i like adding   voice because sometimes it's it's um it's a  better experience for some of the things i   like to personally do to have voice but also it  helps me practice my language learning because   you really learn that you're not pronouncing  words correctly why did i do the typo oh yeah i don't have my shout out  automation here it's not my channel   i need to bring my uh my bot oh yeah oh yeah  how's that coming along it's pretty cool we did   a bunch of stuff on last stream uh pretty happy  about it like javascript is uh coming his way   so eventually i will add more uh of course  i will bring some azure in it that for sure   you know me yes yes yes fingers crossed i  might have a bot for you next week so we'll   we'll see fingers crossed fingers  crossed it's like can she code it is it next week already you  come you're coming back next   yeah next week that'll be my final week until i  have more ideas so yeah that's awesome so you know   and now that uh you break the heist  maybe uh m will come and show up yeah definitely m has like a crazy in a good  way um like really extensive deep background   and working with gaming and so i would love to  see her on here sharing some of what she's doing   as well because she's she built some pretty  interesting things as well i would say so yeah   so okay so well it was super fun having you  i'm pretty happy any questions uh before   chat before we go we still have a few minutes  where we can uh take some questions if you have   yeah i'm checking it out or at least now i am i  didn't get to look at it much during the stream   um do the translated text come back with  full stop at the end yes it does and so as   i was coding i'm not sure if you happen to have  caught that but i did add um periods at the end   it also listens for information so uh if you  happen to end your sentence in a way that you   would if you were to ask a question you know how  your voice kind of inflects and goes up um it will   also give you those question marks um i  discovered that by accident earlier so   so to make the motion with the uh the shoulder too   yeah you got to do the motion too but yeah it  will it will give you it will give you punctuation   um also it will take away any filler words like  um's and likes um and uh well i guess um's and uh   it will take away those words when it does give  you back the transcription so do keep that in mind   excellent yeah well thank you a lot  it was a pleasure again to have you   looking forward to see you again next  week yes yes the goddess of hololens let's make it a thing like i should make a t-shirt  and ship it to you yeah yeah so big thanks big   thanks to all of you in the chat spending uh your  time with us today was really cool and um yeah   so if you wanna know more follow her vogue and  code on twitter and she's been posting all the   time very interesting uh pictures and stuff yes  i am there um definitely i do appreciate all the   my friends that made it to the stream moments i  could look over i saw your names so thank you for   thank you for coming i appreciate it okay have a  bite have a good day everyone bye bye everyone and
