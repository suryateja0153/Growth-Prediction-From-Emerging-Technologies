 name is Alex link and I'm head of a CPUs experience today I'm happy to welcome Danish liar he is head of SCP mixed reality solution he will be answering some of the most frequent questions in regards to business software in spatial computing hi Dennis hi Alex hi everybody watching thanks for inviting me it is a real pleasure to be here and gives you some more insights about what we the ASAP mixed reality solutions team have been done in the past are doing nowadays and what we will go for in the future so Dennis let's start right away with the first questions isn't virtual and augmented reality made for gaming and entertainment only Alex the Kieran's has no yeah vr is not made for entertainment and gaming only just imagine the possibilities endless possibilities that you will have if you can use to the whole space around you let's just talk about one example what whereas ap is really good in dashboards data lets show real-time analytical data predictive analytics for example the carbon footprint application with this data that we as I said purely hack we can help our customers become more sustainable another example enhanced warehouse management project that we did with automated route trains so trains the drive by their own through the production hall they got loaded unloaded and all the planning happened and then 2d spreadsheets and now we can do this in a virtual environment I will really see the stops where it should stand without having to drive them what is a CP story with mixed reality as IP started pretty early I think early 2016 already but the first use cases ideas how would as ap software be used with this technology with that we build our one of our night has implications the SMP future office which is a combination of several stuff occasions like we do have our copilot and he will open ARIMA right away he will show you the available monitors in a real size you can even pick them out put them on your desk so you see if they suit the desk right before you order them Conqueror which is also part of the SP future office when booking travels and imagine you have a 3d map of the location you're going to do so you see all the surroundings plus you can work there in parallel with other users like take your colleagues invite your colleagues to the session and work together and finding the perfect hotel for you guys best of all you can even have a look into the holes and room already up front that a very big important part is of course collaboration so we developed something that we call hollow beam where you will be in real time scanned as a 3d point cloud and on the other receiving side be shown on the goggles as a 3d life-size hologram so it's really kind of a face to face experience what are the real business values and use cases right now we are identifying customers that will together with us work on pocs that will be used on their shop floor in their offices on their production lines wherever you name them we have a list of like 10 people in line waiting so far of course this is something we work in a close relation with our standard development with our custom development so everything that we built here as a proof of concept with the customer will sooner or later also become standard and all of our customers will leverage the power of these applications to give you some examples talking about transportation management so when we talk about the truck loading app that we have already on a 2d screen now we can have this as a special application and can really see the truck as a 3d model now on the table for example work together on it have a look at where the goods sent to how can we pair that range and even for example on our carbon footprints so what are the better for the trucks to go to the customers which customer might be on the way to the next one so that's everything that's more easy with the spatial than doing this on a normal PC or tablet what will the future bring by when are you expecting a are we are to become standard so for the future I don't think the applications will change them much but I think the technology will become much better so think about smaller devices that you can wear on your head 24/7 autonomous cars or even cell flying drones it's like our friends right next to our headquarters volocopter and now you are in this car you're in the drone and you have nothing to do but you have a huge windshield why not use the windshield for augmented reality and show all the applications that we are building on this windshield for example the possibilities are there I don't have a crystal balls I can tell you by when it will become standard I can just tell you that from the bottom of my heart and there I speak from a whole team we think that this technology deserves to become standard and we think that this will be the new smartphones and that's why we at SFP want to be prepared and deliver everything so that our customers can leverage power thank you and expanding [Music]
