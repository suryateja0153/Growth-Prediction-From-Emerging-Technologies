 I'm sure there are many questions on the tip of people's tongues so perhaps I'll open it up straight away to questions. i just wanted to ask about costume and how that helps you appreciate has costume enabled this negotiation, specifically costume, with the individual and the animation. we've worked with a dear friend for a long time on it who we knew from the very very early days at cabaret days she normally makes costumes for giant insects. it's her world so it's it was very easy to transition to the 1927 world and the the cut of everything, the colours she'd loads of animation stills and then design the costumes based on on them normally so it's really integrated and because we've worked with Sarah on three or four shows now it's a really nice easy realm. yeah so they, their costumes aren't too restrictive but how they kind of use them on stage is sometimes quite important and we have a lot of lines cut into the costumes again so that they merge with the animated characters. they're hugely important and quite a lot of the time the costumes they have to sort of puppeteer them which is something we're telling them all the time puppeteer your props puppeteer your costumes be aware of it. now and then when they first started doing the show they come and they've got a crumpled dress and the hats not on and again it's getting them to think as performers is really think of every single aspect of it so you're always looking at the set at the screen at your costume at the angles knowing that it's all part of the same thing. i guess for our work, the costume bit is the only traditional design. so i feel like im designing the space but the costumes are visible . for me its always been really important. When youre working with the lakers between the real and the virtual, you can play quite fun tricks where you have several people dressed the same and they appear in different places magically, silly things like that but we've worked in places with rats running around and everywhere it was freezing cold. when we were in the lido it was, we went with ballet dancers so we suddenly discovered this whole world of these people that are like racehorses, they have to be treated very carefully and they wouldn't go outside if its too cold so i had to buy them all thermals and then it got to hoot so we had to deal with that. i suppose costume is kind of really important for us in terms of creating a story. What struck me about your two presentations was that even though I suppose in theatrical terms you're from two different worlds in terms of performance styles, what was interesting was that this idea of discipline kept coming back time and time again in terms of how you were constructing these versions of reality through be it costume, be it the performer, be it digital means. is that idea discipline absolutely intrinsic to both your performance styles? if it isn't so specific, do things start to unfurl if you like? it's really complicated I mean I feel like there's a fraud to be it because actually it's not very technical what we do we basically make a film and that order to press go but the technical thing is working out the kind of cycle of the performance where they're going to be at any particular moment how many people you can get to go through and what intervals so it's like you know it's like clockwork you have to get people to go through the order the performers don't do cycle so the audience aren't gonna see exactly the same thing at some point they might see something different to see that yeah if once things start going wrong if the performer go to the wrong place what gets out of their sidewalk the audience go through too quickly to pieces yeah it disciplines a difficult word isn't it I don't know I used I'm reading discipline and punish at the moment as well so I'm thinking a lot about and so maybe it's not the right word really tight choreography is is important and boundaries when we're creating as well I think I think sometimes those boundaries can make you so much more creative it's it's like working with a small budget sometimes if you've got a massive budget and you want a crocodile on stage and you can have a crocodile on stage it's perhaps not quite as inventive as what you could do with the tenor or as magical but yeah it's funny that thing of oh it could all just go wrong any minute that side of it is sometimes that do you think it is a bit mad and we were doing a gig with this guide dr. Brown he's a clown and he does he's really loose everything he does is loose and he was saying we had a set which was lots of little windows opening and closing and he said but what if one one of your performance just doesn't quite close the window properly and and don't don't talk about that and whereas he said how can you work like I so strict you know when I'm on stage it doesn't matter even kick that over I can throw things around I don't have to set and reset everything and he found that so restrictive as a notion on stage that things would be so tight but think of 1927 work with something almost cartographic because you're you're so specific in terms of the locations that you're trying to get to the overall stage image when they don't speaks to you as well so you're saying but this idea of mapping a journey for those performers - yeah the temperature hits them somewhere in the public are there you have the potential for incidental means to kind of happen that you weren't planning that make it magical as well it will be start really key people they have to say the observation we should have obviously subtitled this symposium staging mixed realities and negotiating even calls it a distributive presence it seems to me that that's what your work does and your work does as well Suzanne is that the notion of the presence of the access which becomes the central focus for you gets distributed and just sort of spread across the space so that what we're looking at is something which is we're not focusing on mimimi look we're focusing on a bigger picture and i know our work is shallow in terms of space but I find your work very moving because it is that bigger picture. you're not locking into one individual performer we are looking at this distributed precedes across the space. it's really yeah it's a great point and it's also as an actor I think it's a really wonderful challenge and I found that most actors do really enjoy and get into it and they love the idea that they're also listening to all the music that they're on rhythm all the time that they're in the right place and certainly one of the things I was inspired by was the Grand Guignol which was a theatre of fear and terror in Paris and what I loved about reading about the the Grand Guignol was that the actors were doing 25 things at once so they're doing really intense horror acting but they're also pulling out some fake red blood here that's about to be used and they've got a sheep's eyeball that they're just about to operate and I just love this idea of a performer as a technician that you're doing everything and you're not just turning up with your script with your lines highlighted and your cappuccino you know and lots of actors do do that and that's complete that's how you know the read-through it's held so many rehearsal rooms begin but I found actors really enjoy just getting in and getting our hands dirty and and distributing themselves in different ways the songs negotiation question so what is your personal for me I happens all the time that the idea is most of the time we're all in such a position together that we all kind of come to that conclusion it's very rare that a performer saying know that I must fling my arms up here can you not see that it's better it's we all tend to come to the same decisions and it makes sense there's a lot of play a lot of good humor in the rehearsal room which is essential no one takes themselves too seriously and there there's a lot of mucking about taking the mick out of ourselves and I found that essential Emma rice talks about always saying yes to actors I just love MRIs I just want to hurt it just in my life all the time she's so nice but and I can imagine in a rehearsal room she's just the best and she'll always just say yes she lets the actors come to their own conclusions when something's wrong they'll work out for themselves don't say no just say yes and I have I do try that without our team and I said no I'm being analyzed today I'm only saying yes and they're like can you just tell me what what you think please so I try I tried to do it just can't but yeah good humor and just everybody coming to the conclusions and trust in the performers to work it out. the process having to be quite a long one and that the way you set up the relationship from the beginning will help ni those negotiations later on so its really important. sometimes you are just playing but thats a really important way to get to know each other and getting to understand what everybody is about so that when those moments happen you can negotiate it with humour and work it out together. I've got a question well for both of you actually but I was thinking of you and because you've developed the technique of quite a long period of time I was kind of like out how long it was since you said you did your first production but it's over 20 years it's under but thanks for ageing me dick well 2007 we've been doing it I'm sorry okay in 1997 okay fine it's very my mistake but either way you sort of you've grown up and developed the technique over a relatively long period of time well if and this is something I'm it's slightly rhetorical because it's kind of happened to me as well what if something came along like Steve with with some new technologies and said well you actually you don't have to do that and you don't have to do that and you don't have to do that we can just kind of like run this bit run this bit of software and it will do it all for you could could you kind of adapt to a completely new way of working that didn't allow your process that you've grown up with to kind of take over your your future productions if it meant working in a different way but where the technology just did a lot of it for you yeah Janet generat Jenner I'm thinking for my point of view there's software available that will just generate water smoke flames trees and and it's real-time generative 3d visual effects and I don't have to go away and film it edit it do the post-production what you know what if what if your style of or so I can say Paul yeah yeah if his if you could just kind of like request his style of animation now just like bring it on more time at home just reading books it I mean the thing is I don't think I think we're so far away from that happening I mean even just trying to generate fonts that we can use that are our own poems fonts is it's hard enough and it's one of the problems and again it's about us having to make the technology work for us all the time and I think one of the charms and what we do is is utterly flawed and it's all hand-drawn and its really wonky but if the technology could come along and yet could just recreate exactly what we want like that'd be British definitely try it yeah Paul's got three kids now I mean like how much time would we serve you know it's really painstaking what we do it takes bloody ages if there was a way of short cutting it I think we'd take we'd hit shortcut and but I just don't think there is and and also in that process in that long-winded painstaking process and and as knowing each other so much loads of the ideas are generated there so until we're at the stage where we've got the roald dahl machine where you can just hit the buttons you know horror show, three actors you know until we're there that's probably a big part of it. yeah but it's actually I think it's a very profound question because it really touches on the rare kind of their creativity and their the relationship between technology and making and thinking. well you mentioned the mistakes yes just come out a process you know that's for me software doesn't provide, most of the things I like are accidents and then you work on them but the technology doesn't make those accidents in that serendipitous kind of way. but my tip I mean there's a serendipity app you can get which sends you off on a serendipitous journey for the day and I wonder if the tech is getting to the stage where it can really really recreate Paul Barrett's really unique start drawing will it also be able to bring in all those mistakes. i mean it would save you a lot of time.
