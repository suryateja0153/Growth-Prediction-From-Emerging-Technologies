 i've been working on this project for a while now  and i'm so happy with how it turned out so far   i always wanted to make a mixed reality headset  like the microsoft hololens or the magic leap   and this is what i came up with as of making this video i have completed the  hardware of the headset which is mainly 3d   printed apart from the electronics as well  as two separate softwares one which runs on   the device itself and one which runs on my pc but  before i show you how i made it and how it works   i want to show you what it can do so far right  now i got the position tracking of the headset   as well as the image tracking running and i'm  able to after some calibration project a fully   three-dimensional cube onto my image target that  you can look at from any angle i will now give a   very simplified explanation on how this works we  first have the image target which is picked up by   the camera of the device which in my software  calculates the angle and distance the headset   is looking at the target it then will pass on  that information to render any 3d file from   the same angle and distance and then repeat the  process but with a slight change in perspective   depending on the distance for the second eye  to trick your brain into seeing an actual 3d   object in front of you these two rendered images  will then be displayed on the screens which sit   above two lenses that shift the focal point of  the image further back then the actual distance   between the screen and your eyes after that  the image is reflected of a piece of glass   after working on and perfecting this project for  about five months now i can say that i'm pretty   satisfied with how the objects are looking right  now if you're wearing the device it actually looks   and feels like whatever object you're looking  at is actually there in full 3d of course the   tracking process can be perfected because right  now it's still a little jittery but i'm confident   that i can fix that in the future now i will talk  a little more about the device itself it has an   arm processor running a version of android which i  modified in a way where it will only boot straight   into my own application when i was designing the  headset i was thinking about ways to control it   and i came up with three ways to get an input one  was to have some sort of touch panel or buttons   on the side of the actual device but i regarded  that pretty soon because i imagine it to be a real   pain to every time you want to interact with some  setting you have to fidget around on the side of   the device to try to find the right button where  you can't see what you're doing the second one   was to build some sort of gesture control into my  software where you can interact with the device by   doing gestures with your hands but since software  like that is extremely complex and i didn't want   the already complex project to get any more  complex i postponed adding this feature to   when the device works like i wanted to the third  way was to make a separate software which runs on   my pc to control the headset and that is what i  ended up doing for that i designed my own little   communications protocol if you're interested in  that let me know in the comments and i will make   a separate video about that when you start that  software you will land on a little login page   and to be honest i only made that because i was  bored one day and i didn't have anything else to   do the thought behind it is that different users  can make their own profile which saves all their   calibration data so you only need to calibrate the  device once but it's not done yet after logging in   you land on the main page in the top left corner  you can see the connection status of the device   right now it says no connection because the  device is off but when the device is booted   it will show that there is a connection which  is really helpful because if you're wearing the   headset you can't see the connection and status  light on it by the way if you were wondering what   VISOR means it's what i named this project  since i have a lot of files associated with   it i gave it a uniform name so i can find  everything linked to this project very easy   under the connection status you can find a section  called device status as of right now you can only   request the battery level of the headset but  i'm planning to add more information here as   i go under that you can find the button to  enter the two-dimensional calibration mode   once you're in the mode two crosses will appear  on the headset there are three steps to calibrate   the device the first one is to close one eye and  use the wheel on top of the device to change the   distance between the display and the lens you do  that until the cross is focused and then repeated   for the other eye after that when you're looking  through the glasses you should see two crosses   and now you need to use the software on the pc  to move the crosses until they overlap and you   only see one cross in front of you last step is  to enter the three-dimensional calibration mode   and place the image target in front of you  by the way this is the second version of my   image target that i designed the first one didn't  have enough random lines and was too symmetrical   the more random and unsymmetrical the image  target is the better the software can track it   back to the calibration you should now see  a cross which always stays in the same place   you now need to use the software on the pc to  get the cross in the middle of the image target   and then you're done with the calibration right  now the only thing you can do right now is to   display a cube on the image target but that is not  why i made this device because if i wanted to look   at a cube i could have just 3d printed it i want  to not only display the objects in front of you   but i also want to interact with them i'm already  working on a little mini game which you can play   on the headset and interact with the holographic  objects in front of you so if you don't want to   miss out on that please make
