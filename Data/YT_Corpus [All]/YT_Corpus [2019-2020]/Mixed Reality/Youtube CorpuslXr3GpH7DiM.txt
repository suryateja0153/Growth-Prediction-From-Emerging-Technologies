 good morning everybody let me go ahead and get started this is mixed reality 101 an introduction to mixed reality normally I do this deck and we have it all put together it takes me about an hour I have 20 minutes so I kind of reduced it a little bit so we're gonna cover a few points here first it's gonna be why me why am I the one talking to you then why you why am i interested in talking to you why now so why not why is now an important time for you to get it started with mixed reality and then finally how do you get started so why me my name is Jesse McCulloch I'm a program manager on the mixed reality developer ecosystem team that means I get to talk to developers and make sure that I have a good path of communication to communicate Microsoft's message to developers but also developers have a really good path of communication back to Microsoft so we can get feedback and start building your feedback into the product this is my third build but my first is Microsoft employee my first one was to to builds ago and I came here just as an attendee and had a great experience and got introduced to the mixed reality my got really involved with mixed reality a couple years before that and decided to make a job of it and I'll talk about that here in a little bit then last year we did the thing called Mr JAMA build where I work with the Microsoft team and we put kind of a sub conference on that was all around mixed reality here at build and now I'm here as actually as an employee so made history working backwards I started at Microsoft about seven months ago previous to that I was a freelance mixed relay developer head of community for about practical VR this is me with Alex kipman who invented the whole lens and was one of the primary inventors for Kinect and this was in San Francisco when they opened the build reactor or the mixed reality reactor down there previous to that I was a technical consultant with here on consultant group working on server-side JavaScript framework that was a custom work that was about twenty years old before server-side JavaScript is really a thing before that I was in tech support for a company called IHS and before that I was a mountain rescue EMT some of the things you won't notice there on there nothing about college no triple gay game studios no 3d artist training this is technology that is accessible to everybody which brings us to my next point of why you I specifically want you guys to get involved with mix rally because we have tools for everybody no matter what technology stack you're working on and no matter what your interests are so right now Technol or right now our stack at the very bottom we've got devices we've got things like the azure connect DK we've got our mixed reality headsets VR headsets the new hololens 2 but also things like drones and phones all these devices have rich sensors on them and are part of this Azure cloud mix rally cloud and edge story on top of those devices we have a rich set of mix rally services to Roger Azure digital twins a geospatial anchors and our Azure remote rendering on top of that we have the more generalized cognitive services I'm sure you guys have seen some of these - speech and vision services that let you do facial recognition or speech length and language recognition and and whatnot and then built on top of all that we've got a really rich partner ecosystem and also a dynamics 365 offering so no matter what you guys are doing for your business we've got a space for you and we've got tools for you specifically looking at our our services things like our mixed reality or a sure spatial anchors let you place digital content in the real world and have a persist cross platform so it works with hololens hololens - but also with phones and tablets like a arcade and a our core so if you've got a business use where you need digital content to live in a specific place in the world and we realize that not everybody needs a $3,000 ho lands on their head to get their job done we can do it with a phone or a tablet we have tools for that same with a cognitive services these are these are valid across all devices whether it's a phone or a PC or a headset of any sort we also let you build with the tools that you choose and what you guys are already using if you guys are C++ developers our open XR and our DirectX integrations will let you build for mix reality if you are a AR core and AR kit developer we've got services that work with your your mix reality there if you are on Linux we support you there if your visual studio or unity or unreal basically no matter what toolset you guys are already building on we've got solutions for you and ways for you to build for mix reality so the sooner we can get you on to this set the better so why now we're really via mix rally is the third computing platform the first was personal computers back in their mid 70s Altair hired a couple guys to build and port their ms basic system over those couple of guys later turn around and built Microsoft from that that was our kind of the first wave of personal computing we saw them move from businesses where most people primarily interacted with pcs and then into the homes ok the second wave of computing is the one that we're mostly in right now with smartphones were huge to to make you computing ubiquitous across the world everybody has a smartphone and computer in their pocket and it made the tech super accessible and we see mixed reality as being this third wave of computing where we're using these devices that have rich sensor sets to talk to that to the cloud and services up there that can understand the world around them and then take that understanding and feed it back out to those devices to enrich experiences we're looking at in the next six years about a hundred and forty four billion dollars in market capacity that we see this is based on a study that Microsoft did with an independent research company right now we're very much in the enterprise tasks and processes space this is where we get a lot of our signal right now but we definitely are starting to see social entertainment and productivity and collaboration if you guys saw the spatial demo on stage yesterday or over at their booth they're fitting right nicely into this productivity and collaboration space so there's lots of money still to be made in this space we have a whole bunch of partners to us a whole bunch of partners I should say it's about 130 that are in our mix rally partner program but when you look at that across other mix trail or other Microsoft platforms 130 partners is next to nothing so there's a lot of space so you guys to come in and build a business in this mixed reality world so how do you get started I'm going to leave you guys with one short quick link AKMs /m are from there you can go in a register interest for our Developer Program this will let us know more about you and your profile and give us permission to contact you when we have events coming up we just had an event last week mr dev days we had 400 developers from around the world come out to our Microsoft campus and spend two days immersed with our engineers it was a really great time they got hands-on time with hololens and Azure Kinect DK but those are the kind of things that we're gonna let you know about through our dev program I'm also when device availability comes out at Hollins - and I should connect DK we announced at Mobile World Congress this year and so as those devices start it'll be through those channels that we let you guys know from that link we can also get you we also send you out to where you can actually build for these different services so as your special anchors is in public preview right now you can use it today publish ops with it and it's fantastic we've also got a lot of tutorials and and quick starts for these as your remote rendering lets you render super high quality holograms to phones and hololens that ones in private preview but you can uh sign up for more interest there and then as your digital twins that you marry your your data from these machines and IOT sensors you have in your companies to those machines and be able to view them through mixed reality and that's also available there and then it also points you to our documentation we have a ton of documentation samples it's open source I'm in control that repository I make the updates to it almost daily and so we'd love to get you guys in and and working on this and working with us to build the platform and and you know elevate the entire thing so that I know I went way faster than I was expecting to I usually do that if anybody has any questions I'm more than happy to answer questions now nobody has questions about mixed reality zamarons support yes so xamarin has a mixed reality engine called yo sharp that they have so you can actually use Amran and to play out to the whole lens and whole lens to with it right AR yeah so the whole lens I don't know if it works with a arcade AR core I'm not sure I will I will get your information and get back to you on that yeah mm machine learning great question so the question is is is our machine learning model supported on Holland yes last year we released that you could run onyx models directly on Holland's I not sure on Holland's - I know we've got an AI chip on there but I'm not sure how exposed that is so I will get back to you on that and we also have an FAQ on our documentation so I'll make sure these questions end up on the FAQ so that everybody has the answers to them as well any other questions digital twins yes so digital twins is a way to recreate your physical environment and overlay your data from physical machines into that environment and then be able to view it through it either a phone or a tablet or a our headset so if you're or say you're in a manufacturing facility and you've got a bunch of machines that are all instrumented with IOT sensors what digital twins lets you do is go through and layout the data from the sensors on top of the machines in a nice layout and persist them there so that you know as a supervisor you might be able to come by with your tablet and just look at it and see all this data from the IOT sensors directly in context of them of the machine that you're looking at why is it called twins so basically you're recreating your physical environment in a digital way and marrying them together so it's you're almost like creating a digital replication of your environment yep any other questions for these to be the third computing platform I see the cost of enter the device is too high what's your take on how are we going to so the question was for this to be the third wave of computing the cost seems really high and how do we work through that and and make it more affordable and more available to developers and and enterprises yes absolutely true I would say that we've had this problem in every way for these computing though the original PCs were not $400 like you can get them at Best Buy today they were multi thousands of dollars so as this technology evolves in and the process of manufacturing them gets cheaper and also you get scales of economy the prices will come down we did just announce our developer SKU for Holland's - last week which actually has a an option for a payment plan type so that the barrier of entry is a lot lower instead of having what the original Holland's it was $3,000 up front I know because I had bought one you know having a payment plan option lowers that barrier of entry and lets people not have to front that money upfront any other questions so not hololens like phones and tablets and whatnot or the VR headsets okay so the question is where where do other non hololens devices fit into the whole ecosystem such things like VR headsets tablets and whatnot really it comes down to the right tool for the right job you can have extremely immersive things happen in a VR headset that you cannot do with an AR headset and it doesn't make sense to do in any our headsets sometimes you want to be deeply immersed in that environment but if you are wanting to interact with your physical world where you've got items that are either placed on a surface or are interacting with a real-world object then AR makes more sense and and then with AR again it's the right tool for the job a frontline manufacturing worker who may need both hands to work it absolutely makes sense to have them in a headset a supervisor who's coming by and looking at data it may make more sense to have them have a tablet which is a much cheaper option for them to be that same data um so this is why it's important for us to have this cross-platform tool set and allow you guys to decide what the best tool for the job is no matter what that job is anything else field of view it's bigger so hole ins one would put it out there got a lot of feedback once some of that feedback was the field of V is too small depending on who you talk to you yes or no but we it was universal feedback we got and so one of the things that we did with Hollens 2 is increase that field of view it's now 52 degrees diagonally it doubles the actual area and it's great and I suggest that if you want to see it for yourself we are doing Holland's two demos in the back of Hall de f you know a lot of the stuff with Hollens 2 that we made improvements on was based drought and direct feedback from Holland's one we had people saying that when you're at a demo space the voice commands don't work so we put beamforming microphones on the bottom of the headset so that we get better sound volume also you couldn't hear when we were how to audio experiences so we've upped the volume for the view is bigger so all the feedback we get from the previous generation of devices we feed into the design of the new generation and and hopefully we continue to do that and keep making better and better devices anybody else thank you guys for your time
