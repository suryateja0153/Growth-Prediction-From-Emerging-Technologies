 hey there guys is that careful window central and welcome back to another video though today we're taking a look at some of the improvements coming to Windows mix reality in Windows 10 1981 so it's been a little while since we've taken a look at Windows mixed reality and we're back today in one of the latest 1981 bills to see what's improved and quite a lot has changed actually starting with the portal as you can see here on the left now we get a recommended what's new sort of hub area sidebar and it's recommending not only Windows mix reality-based games which are the native Windows 10 Xfinity apps and games but also steamvr apps and games in fact they are first and foremost we have seen VR up here and if you click on one of these it will simply take you to the Microsoft edge web browser or your default web browser to install them and then if we scroll down here we have Windows mix reality as well which will then launch us into the Microsoft Store as you would expect but that's the app itself now let's dive into the windows mix reality experience I guess and show you what's new in that regard so if we have put on my headset here you'll see that so if you've watched my previous mixed reality videos you'll see that quite a bit has changed in this space it's a little bit different than before a few things have been changed have been swapped out for other things and overall it's the layout still the same but there are a few different notable changes so if we come over here you will see that we now have Hollett or super hot and free the something all on podiums here and if you click on one of these they will launch you into the Microsoft Store app to download we have halo recruit over here and then we have the mocha Store app pinned here by default there's also masterpiece for yatha new trial version at least we have a forum demo we have space pirate that was there before the movies app if we come over here we have this guy floating around this allows you to adjust your height say if you're standing up and you're kind of a bit too short or you're sitting down and you're a bit too tall you can change that by tapping on there and then we have mail over here and Explorer web VR which if we click on there will launch us into this other floaty thing which gives us a bunch of different websites that we can use BRN have the blue season-one 360 videos if you click on which pulls up a buncha different videos wish but yeah so more or less the same just that they've looked at a bunch of the old objects for new objects see groove used to be sitting over here but now they sorts out for my masterpiece for ya so yeah a bunch of these apps are not they're not pre-installed so if you click on one so if we click on halo infinite here it will pull up the Microsoft Store to download it but once it is downloaded if you click on it again it will grant you straight into the game which is very nice what is the blue CNN one I don't want to quickly check that because I don't know what this is so like a TV show I get season suggest so the Brewers are deeply immersive VR series that allows the audience districts to experience the Wonder and majesty of the ocean through different habitats ah so yeah they say it's a virtual reality feel most TV show I guess about let's see which is pretty nice and it's pinned directly to the mixer as the world which is fantastic so in addition to changes to the mixed reality environment Microsoft is also updating Bui a little bit as well for the Start menu and for title bars within which you look at in a minute say this is the new Start menu and as you can see it has changed quite a bit Texas sort of hovering above the tiles now and there's also a bunch of different things up here as well so we get our name I'll use a picture the time mic status so on this device I haven't got a mic plugged in then we have Wi-Fi States as places which gives us access to a bunch of different places available in mixability right now you have Cliff House and Skyloft which was introduced in one of the previous Windows 10 updates we've already taken a look at that so check that video out if you want to see what the other environment looks like then we have our volume control here which allows you to control volume as you would expect so yeah we have we have a volume as well then we also have our apps list here which gives us access to everything is stored in the mixed reality environment which would then allow us to launch each app so if you want to launch office here I can do so and I can pin that up there why not there you go and there's also this new flash file option which I believe was introduced from the last update but we haven't seen it before so let's demo right now if we click on this you can see that I can now see what's happening in the real world through the VR so this is great for those of you who would just quickly want to see something in the real world without take the headset off you can do that now and then quickly go back into VR like that and then turn off the flashlight option and that will go away pretty nice indeed so as I mentioned that sort of floaty text thing that you can see in front the tiles here that is apparent in a lot in a few places now also the sort of context when you have changed quite a bit they look like that now so if you come over here you can see the X and the sort of move button are floating above that what I call the title bar and that's a pound in a lot of places now so if we make this small and when it closer to us perhaps we've got it easier to see please come here there we go you can see there that it's floating off the tight spot just a little bit which gives it a sort of 3d holographic effect same for the text on the other side here and also of course we can still resize our things like that so I'd say yeah that's kind of a new effect that's introduced in 1981 I assume this is the UI we're going to see on hololens - when it gets announced in hopefully this year so 1981 is still in development it is a little rough around the edges I think at least this UI could be improved a tad but it is I do like the hovering effects and this is probably a good look at what we can expect to see running on hololens - I wouldn't be surprised at this UI isn't so different from that but yeah so that's a quick look at the UI changes coming to mix reality in 1981 I kind of liked them I do like the hover effects on title bars and stuff it's a very subtle effect you won't notice it unless I points someone place at you like I just did which is pretty nice now I also want to quickly take a look at the emphasis on web VR in 1981 because previously you didn't really get to there wasn't really any sort of focus on the web layout content but now that there's this entire bubble here which gives you access to a bunch of different web for your content that's Microsoft recommending you try out and what this does is you could have one it launches Microsoft edge and when there for you and whenever you want a website which has BR content you will see this little icon down here in which when clicked on will pull you hopefully into the an immersive experience you can see here and now this webpart website is now running in full 360-degree mode I'm immersed in it entirely as if it's running as if it was a native apple game running locally on the device it's running through i'ma download you know that anything to get this running but it's working just fine here so this here is a game it's a sort of a musical punching game so you punch the things to the music and let's give it a go I guess so we got like that there we go probably can't play too much of this for copyright reasons but oh I missed Donna oh oh I've really messed up here there we go no I'm doing it I'm doing it with my shop hands okay there we go oh yeah I want to be careful here cuz I wanna punch my actual PC there we go we're getting places now I probably really can't play this for long about getting a copyright strike Christ this is quite typical oh yeah oh look at that are hungry to get this this is actually really quite fun I don't even download this this is just a website you can play this for free right now Oh christ almighty on the stretch in Microsoft website yeah it's called sound box or something and I'll show you the URL in a second this is great I'm not a great time people should have to pay for this this is amazing I don't want to stop this is amazing oh okay now I'm definitely play something okay that's so just grout that so to quit out VR content you press the start button and press the start line again on the actual start thing and that will pull out there like that so this is web for your sandbox inko so if you want to try this out go for it and it works through ah so it just pulls up YouTube videos and just sinks it to the beat that's hilarious if true so yeah I've recommend that game that game is hilarious let's try another one let's try a within what's winning all about BR dot with dot in pretty simple URL I'm guessing this is video content enter VR here allow fear to use immersive view yes and there you go so yeah I'm pretty sure this is just video content mister yeah mr. variable that sir whichever virtual reality experience play I'm assuming this is copyrighted as well so you probably can't show too much of this yeah so I'm getting into sort of like a mini so part of the show or maybe a specifically short part of the show and lately our experiences come on let's get through the tiles it's at least seen some people walking around I will probably yeah okay so there's there's the so yeah that's a quick look at the updates coming to Windows ministry obviously quite soon pretty exciting stuff I'm very excited to see what's coming for hololens too specifically but mixed reality devices in general the VR stuff as well it's always improving with every release Michael doesn't talk about it much anymore but it is still being improved then honestly I think mixed reality is one of the best parts of Windows 10 these days it's a very refined VR experience it just works you plug it in and it goes it's not like the HTC vive or the oculus devices where you have to have all these different cables and stuff there are cables still has this one cable I believe for the most which windows many headsets it's a very simple setup you don't have to have any extra sort of light sources or anything or you know sensors it's still built into the headset so it's great for casual users who just want to consume content and stuff will play sound box because that was an amazing game I'm gonna play again anyway thanks for watching guys I shall see you in the next one bye bye
