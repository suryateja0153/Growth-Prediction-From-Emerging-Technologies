 Mixed reality laboratory is the  place to be for visionaries. Based on a 3D model,  we build a Virtual Reality where testing, experiencing and educating  becomes possible in a fun and immersive way. Working in the virtual laboratory is  cost effective and it also saves time. It makes it easy to test and do  corrections already in the design phase, to take care of work safety and  operate future concepts remotely. As the pace of research and  development is speeding up, VR solutions help bring products to  the market faster than ever before. The virtual laboratory is the ultimate design  and testing ground for future innovations.
