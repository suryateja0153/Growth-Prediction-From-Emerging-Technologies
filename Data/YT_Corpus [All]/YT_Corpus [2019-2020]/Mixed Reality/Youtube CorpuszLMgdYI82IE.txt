 [Music] in this lecture we are going to give get a brief overview of augmented reality and virtual reality in the context of a IOT so augmented reality and virtual reality here and vir they are popularly known as year and vir are quite you know important technologies that have been adopted and are being adopted at present in different IOT context in pi different industries because of different advantages that they offer there you know they are there they have some relationship between them they are interlinked but they are they have some distinct differences so in the next few minutes we are going to understand the specific attributes of air and vir and the different challenges that are there in the adoption of air and via technologies in a IOT settings so from a technological perspective both air and fear they can be used in different context different contexts they can be used different industry sectors they can be used and together they can help in improving industry 4.0 goals so they are very important they play a very important role they play very important role in the primary stages of manufacturing where optimization and productivity are important considerations because in any manufacturing industry it is not just the manufacturing manufacturing of the product optimization of the processes improvement of the productivity these are important considerations the efficiency of where warehouses is also very important and these can be improved using different air applications both air and fear are are also important in safety scenarios so for example there are situations I will also talk about a scenario where VR as well as air can be used for training of industrial safety so we will talk about that in another lecture not in this lecture so I will showcase how a our fear can be used to improve to improve the training of safety in industrial plants so these are very important technologies so that is the reason why I thought that a basic understanding about these technologies can help in improving the IOT infrastructure in the industries the different use cases that are served by air and fear for IOT are things like machining and production these technologies AR VR can be used to improve the overall machining processes production processes and so on in education training collaboration assembly line safety security of different infrastructure in the industries and digital prototyping factory planning maintenance and inspection these are some of the different uses of these technologies in a IOT settings so these are very important but remember one thing that through this half an hour lecture you are not going to learn about how to use the air and how to use veer so here you are just going to learn about the different features of air different features of here how they can be used where they can be used where they cannot be used so these are the things that you are going to get an understanding about you cannot learn through this half an hour lecture how to become a master of use of these technologies air and fear so this is basically the overall you know this is the overall scope of this particular lecture so let us now try to understand what is air so augmented reality basically you know as this name suggests augmented so physical reality is augmented with certain information typically some computer-generated digital images augmented with that kind of information to give a better feeling better you know perception to the users improve perception of the reality to the users so it air basically will improve the feeling of the reality the physical reality of the world in which the user is operating and that improved feeling at the user as I just said can be offered with the help of computer-generated technologies typically different types of images videos etcetera so these digital elements are added to the actual environment and together we have an amplified environment the present perception of reality is improved this is what air is all about so some of the key features of air it lies in the middle of the mixed reality spectrum so we are talking about we are talking about different types of reality we are talking about augmented reality we are talking about virtual reality we are talking about you know no reality at all completely physical environment we are talking about completely immersed kind of environment so air is some kind of mixed reality kind of environment here provides mixed reality environment so it provides multiple sensor modalities which can be visual auditory or haptic haptic means what by touch through touch basically you know you have different sensors which are added to the eye to the ears to the fingers which can give the user an improved feeling and these users could be any user and in industrial settings in a IOT settings we are talk talking about industry users typically different you know let us say a mechanic of a particular machine an operator of a particular machine can be trained with ear with the help of these different types of sensors that I just mentioned visual auditory haptic sensors can be attached to that particular user or the mechanic or the operator of an industrial machine and different computer-generated images can be shown and that basically will give a better perception of the physical environment in which that particular mechanic the operator is operating so they will have improved augmented reality of the actual reality so that is going to be generated out of it so this is the whole advantage of the use of air in industry settings so let us now go through the history a bit so air has become very popular in the recent times but it has been there since long starting from early 1900s so in 1901 the idea of electronic displays and spectacles came into being frank baum basically proposed this kind of idea use of this kind of thing in 1980s published heads-up display for teaching real world five right skills we're done this publication of public publications of this kind of heads-up displays was made available by Linton in the 1990s Boeing researcher Thomas Cordell coined the term augmented reality in 1992 Louise Rosenberg was the first you know he came up with the first functioning ear augmented reality system in 1999 the US Naval Research Laboratory came up with the burst system which is the battlefield augmented reality system and in 2013 Google came up with the Google glass which is very popular and everybody knows about it at present so this is basically the overall history of augmented reality so it has been there since the last century 1900 early 1900 till recently augmented reality in different forms was there but now it has become much more popular because of its used in different industry settings and different other settings as well so different applications of augmented reality in tourism entertainment retail industrial design medical environments hospital settings for instance flight training educational military training and so on augmented reality reality has different applications so here in this particular picture there are different you know pictorially the different augmented reality systems are shown so on the left hand side we have the augmented reality eyeglasses this is the augmented reality eyeglass this is the hit sub display as you can see over here the individual is wearing it the display unit hits up display unit and then we also have like you know medical applications for instance as you can see over here the doctors are performing some kind of a heart surgery and can see using the display the different aspects of the heart on upon which the surgery is being performed so these are some of the key components of these different devices that are used for air there are sensors and cameras projection screen processing unit reflection systems like mirrors etc so these are some of the different components that are used for air so let us do one thing we will now try to some of the key features of how these air systems work so you know so what is important so what we have let us say we have these sensors right we have sensors these sensors basically are the ones that gather real-world information then we have also the cameras and these cameras they scan the environment they collect the data from the environment from the surroundings then we have the projectors these projectors basically they project the information about the environment to somewhere and then we have the mirrors this is basically the reflection system so these are some of the different components of air and how together the air systems work okay and these mirrors are very important because they can basically you know they can change the orientation based on how the users eye how the users eye changes its position so these are the key aspects of here and how it works so sensors collecting data cameras also basically know projecting in the information into collecting the information and then together the sensors cameras you know collecting all these information and then sending it to the projectors and this projector basically projects all this information and then then you have this reflection system which is the mirror so this is how the air systems what holistically but as I said at the outset that you know through this you know half an hour lecture you cannot become an expert of air or fear right this is just to get a brief expository idea about how the systems work and what is in there so now let us look at the different types of augmented reality we have marker based augmented reality marker less augmented reality projection based augmented reality superimposition based augmented reality these are some of these different types of augmented reality marker marker based augmented reality gives an outcome when the reader is sensed by the camera and the visual marker so there are two things one is the camera and the existence of marker so these markers basically will help in recognizing simple distinctive patterns which can be easily processed and the camera is well understood what is the functioning of this camera the marker lists augmented reality unlike the previous one doesn't use any kind of marker and these commonly used things like GPS digital compass or accelerometer which basically help in offering information such as the location of a person or a device then we have the prediction based augmented reality that gives an outcome by projecting light onto the real-world surfaces and it allows the human interaction by sending light and it differentiates between the expected position projection and the altered projection expected and the altered so this is these are very important things these are very important things in expectation and altered projection this differentiation is very important and is key to here then we have the superimposition based augmented reality which partially or fully substitutes the original view of the object with the augmented field so here object recognition basically plays an important role and the application cannot replace the original view with the augmented one in this kind of superimposition based augmented reality so these are some of the highlights of air and how it works at a very high level what are the different components of it now let us look at what is VR and later on and after we have gone through the different highlights of here we will see that how air and fear they compare between each other what are the similarities between air and fear and what are the differences so VR is a mixture of interactive hardware and software based artificial environment right so it's an it's an interactive hardware unlike the previous one here it is interactive and it offers a three realistic three dimensional image a realistic three dimensional image is created and the user in fear feels that the user is actually present in the physical world which is being simulated but is actually not being present so it's a virtual environment that is immolated but the user feels that the user is acting in the actual physical environment so it's a virtual immersion kind of experience that the user gets so this information to the user is presented in such a way that the user feels that the user is operating is acting in the real Hall or physical world so the key features of veer are that it creates and enhances an imaginary reality imaginary reality this is very important right so this is very important imaginary reality it is something that is not real in fact but is a virtual reality virtual reality imaginary reality then we have it gives the perception of being physically present in a non-physical world this is also very important physically present in a non-physical world it is actually not a physical world it is an emulated one a virtual one but the user feels that user is interacting with the physical world which is being innovated so it incorporates auditory and visual sensory feedback all kinds of sensors are used in this case also auditory visual touch haptic interfaces are also used so user can hold devices and feel that actually the user is holding the device for example a user might feel that the user is holding the steering wheel of a car but the actually it's a virtual environment and in immolated environment there are certain sensors which will give the feeling to the user that the user is holding a particular steering wheel of the car but actually the user is not feeling I mean not actually holding the user is not actually holding the steering wheel and is not driving the car so I hope that this basically makes it clearer to you how it is going to work not I mean not the technical details of it but and overall impression about how fear works so it allows the users to get naturally absorbed into the virtual environment so this is also very important in veer so in terms of the chronological order of virtual reality how it you know it has evolved over the years so in around 1960s early 1960s the filmmaker Martin Heilig he created an experience theater so that basically you know started the works you know the initial works on virtual reality then the sword of Damocles was created by an EMI MIT computer scientist in 1968 and he is considered sort of like a father of virtual reality displays then in 1987 linear and American philosopher philosopher and scientist coined the term virtual reality so actually the virtual reality the the the popularity of virtual reality started with this term in 1987 the virtual reality term started in the 1987 and then David e/m was the first artist you know who died in 1984 he produced the navigable virtual worlds and any call it 1919 1979 created the leap system which is the large expense extra perspective optical system and in 2015 Google created the first-ever resident artist system and that is a quite popular system it is a virtual reality system so the Google glass we have talked about earlier in the context of air and Google's in this system the resident artist system is another system which is an example of the virtual reality system these are quite popular systems in terms of air and we are being used in in in our society so there are different applications of VR in terms of you know used by real estate agents entertainment industries robotics astronauts astronauts use of here a lot because you know even before and you know and a space craft is sent to the in the space the astronauts are trained in the virtual environments using vir systems there's - not sir trained similarly for the flight pilots as well fight pilots are also often trained in the using you know virtual reality systems and in health and safety healthcare industries we are used so doctors are trained before actually performing a life critical surgery the doctor can try to practice that surgery in the vir environment in educational environments it is used by 3d artists here are used for mass surveillance also you know here has found applications so before going any further let me just try to show you how overall how these VR systems are going to operate so here also we have these different sensors here also like before we have different sensors these sensors can detect the motion the direction in space motion space you know the position in space all these things can be detected using these sensors and there could be different different types of senses that would be used so then you also have they've different lenses which could be used to capture and reshape the image of each eye then we have the processing units these processing units which basically will process the data that is captured then we have finally the display screens these are very important components you know display screens which basically give give the user the feeling of being in the physical world so these displays are very important so these are the overall the different components of a vir system some of the different components and these sensors are very crucial different different types of sensors are used these sensors the display system these are very important and of course the lenses the processing units processing units are very important and you know you need to have high-end processing units high-end very high-end processing units are typically used in these vir systems because otherwise that feeling will not come if there is a delay between performing a certain action and actually getting the experience the perception if there is a delay then we know this fear system is not going to be much useful so I was telling you about the different applications of virtual reality earlier so virtual reality you know here we can see few pictures this is a VR headset that you can see here as you can see over here virtual reality sets are being used by a military person to you know to get trained with some combat operation or something very similar so there are different components of these headsets these headsets are very important these headsets are very important so this one this one etcetera these are very important and there are different components of these headsets like different types of sensors like magnetometers accelerometer gyroscope etcetera the different lenses display screens processing unit all these as I was telling you earlier these are the important components of a vir system different types of virtual reality one is non immersive simulation semi immersive simulation fully immersive simulation these are different types of virtual reality environments non immersive as these name suggests the user enters into the virtual environment through a portal or window and this basically allows the users to have a peripheral awareness of the reality outside the virtual reality simulations so this name has it suggests non immersive simulation basically utilize only a subset of the user senses not all of it you know it's a non immersive but only a subset of the user senses are used in this kind of simulated platforms non immersive simulated platforms semi immersive again partly you know it's not like the non immersive but here partly partially or fully immersive experience is gathered by the users through these different sensors and the users use of these different sensors and the senses sensing up through these different sensors this is what is done in this non Semmy immersive simulations and here basically these are powered by high-performance graphical computing systems coupled with large screen projectors these are some of the things that are used for semi immersive platforms fully immersive is high-end basically here it you have complete immersive experience complete realistic experience is offered through some simulations to the users and these simulations offer a delivery of a wide field of view using different head mounted displays motion detecting devices and so on so this is basically the high-end platform for virtual reality fully immersive platforms so let us now having understood here and veer so far let us now try to understand the similarities between here and here so there are many many different similarities they are very similar so both of these they create new artificial world for the users both of these technologies can help create this artificial world these serve the user with enhanced experiences that is also very similar and also what is similar is that there is great prospect in the field of each of these air and fear in fields like medical science in astronomy in you know flight simulations and so on there is lot of similarity I mean there is lot of use of air and fear technologies in these different types of application domains so this is how these technologies compare augmented reality and virtual reality augmented reality adds digital elements to the actual environment it delivers virtual elements as an in as an interest of the real world and virtual reality it offers immersive application it you know unlike in the case of augmented reality in augmented reality what is happening is the you know the physical world is augmented with certain you know high-end ICT features so that the user gets some kind of improved experience in improved perception of the reality and in virtual reality on the other hand complete or partly partial or complete immersive experience is obtained by the user so user feels that the user is there and he is operating completely immersed or partially immersed in the physical environment but actually it is not a physical environment it is a virtual environment in which the user is operating but the user feels that the user is operating in the real physical world which is not correct which is not the real one but a simulated one so it offers a digital recreation of the real-life setting which one the virtual reality platforms so here are some of the references that one can go through so here I have given you some of the web references but there are many books on air and fear there are many research papers on air and fear but I think for this course that you know going through in detail of each of these technologies is necessary it is not easy to understand each of them in detail unless you want to really you know get an in-depth understanding though about air and fear but then again you know this will not be a right course for you to get you know the complete understand more about air and fear you need to register for some other online course on air and fear and so this understanding about the different features of air and fear systems the different advantages the different aspects of it this way is sufficient for the industry persons the you know the the learners to know about how these things can be used in an industry setting to create an IOT platform in their respective industries so with this we come to an end thank you
