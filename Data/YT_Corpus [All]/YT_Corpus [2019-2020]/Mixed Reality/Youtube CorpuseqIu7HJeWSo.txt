 [MUSIC]  Will mixed reality replace your phones and your PCs? The answer for me is broader and allows us to look at the entire technology space. I like to think about the technology space as kind of going through seasons, think about it as spring, summer, fall, or winter. It takes a long time for you to go through all of these seasons, and at the end of the day, all of these technology eras exist at the same time. We still have mainframes today, but I think it's fair to say that they're kind of going through the journey of being in their winter. On the other hand, you look at it and you say, look, mobile phones, those types of things is pretty easy to say that they're no longer in spring and they're sitting in their summer. I look at mixed reality, I look at AI, I look at the future of computing, this third era of computing, and I place it in the spring. The end result is, people will have all of these devices. We're still doing cyclable, accurate simulations for our holographic processing unit on mainframes. I have a phone in my pocket. Of course, I have a HoloLens, and I spend a lot of my day as a knowledge worker in front of a PC. So to me, it's not about an 'or', it's about an 'and'. I'm super excited about the third era of computing, the era of mixed reality, but I don't think it's a 'replace'. I think it's an 'augment', the types of devices and the types of experiences that we already have. [MUSIC]
