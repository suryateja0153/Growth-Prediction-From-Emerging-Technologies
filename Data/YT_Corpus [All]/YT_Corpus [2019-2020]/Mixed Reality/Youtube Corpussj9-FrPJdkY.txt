 Hello and welcome to Mixed Reality Curriculum. I want to tell you how this curriculum works. Every lesson has four sections. First, we go through the core concepts. Second, we work on the hands-on project, step by step. And after that, we discuss what could go wrong. And finally, you have more resources to deep dive into the subjects. Let's take a look at the lessons. The first lesson has the core concepts and the project step by step and you can follow along in this project or download the project from the link on the lesson and move to the next step. Finally, we have the "what could go wrong?" section and you have a A lot more resources to go through. I hope you like it. Let me know what you think. Thanks!
