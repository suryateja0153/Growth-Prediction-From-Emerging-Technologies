 we also use VEA for cultural events scheduling parties or planning or even some personal things from ordering things online so at the end of the day what what I find is the biggest asset to VEA is having them really free up the time was a lot of minutia tasks that you can kind of get bogged down with on the day-to-day so I would highly recommend their services for anybody that's looking to free up some time to tackle some bigger issues within your organization
