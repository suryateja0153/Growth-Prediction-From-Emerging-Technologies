first interview question that we need to prepare for is tell me about yourself why you want to become a sales assistant so my tip for answering this interview question highly is in your answer demonstrate you are a positive enthusiastic and self-motivated person because these are the key qualities needed to become a great sales assistant so let's take a look at a high scoring answer to that interview question tell me about yourself and why you want to become a sales assistant I am a very upbeat and positive person who enjoys both working as part of a team with others and also on my own I would consider myself a people person who enjoys helping others through great customer service I want to become a sales assistant because I feel the qualities and the traits that are needed to excel in this type of role are the ones I naturally possess for example I am self-motivated which means I need little supervision and I also learn things really quickly meaning you won't need to spend lots of time training me up I will always be positive whilst in this role and I enjoy taking care of people through answering their questions and also looking at ways to provide the right products and services for them based on their individual shopping needs that is a brilliant answer it's very positive and it is confident in regards to you telling them about yourself but also why you want to become a sales assistant so that gets you off up and running during your sales assistant interview and it gives you great levels of confidence to move forward so the next sales assistant interview question I want you to prepare for is why would you like to work for our company as a sales assistant now I can pretty much guarantee that this interview question will get asked during your sales assistant interview so we need to make sure we provide a brilliant answer to it now my tip when creating your answer to this question is to focus on their products their services and also their customer service standards in your answer now the aim when answering this question is to show you have the same customer service standards as they already have okay now here's how to do it here's a really good answer to the question why would you like to work for our company as a sales assistant the main reason I want to work for your company as a sales assistant it's because in order to be effective in this role you have to have confidence in the products and services you are selling and you also have to back those products and services up with great customer care now having carried out some research before applying for this sales assistant job it is clear the products and services you offer are to a very high standard in addition to this the customer service values you operate by mean I can go about my duties with professionalism and confidence so that is quite a clever answer because what you are doing there is aligning your own high standards with the standards expected by the company and that is the reason why you want to work for them as a sales assistant let's take a look at another sales assistant interview question does customer service mean to you now this is a much tougher interview question to answer than it first appears so you might look at that and think customer service is all about just looking after the customer but there are many different aspects to great customer service and we need to make sure you cover all of them in your answer so here is my suggested response to the interview question what does customer service mean to you to me customer service means many different things that all come together to meet the needs of the customer customer service means welcoming the customer into the store making them feel welcomed and valued asking them questions to help them choose the right products or services and also being on hand to answer questions and facilitate the sale where needed customer service is also about providing the same high levels of service after they have made the purchase and also following up for feedback to see what they felt about their experience with our business my role as a sales assistant apart from meeting the needs of the customer is to encourage repeat custom time and time again by making the customers experience a memorable and pleasurable one whilst in the store so that is a really good answer and it shows that you know all of the different key aspects to customer service and one of the reasons why that will make you the standout candidate during your sales assistant interview is because all the other candidates will say customer service means taking care of the customers and you know asking them questions and that would be it but you are applying a high level of professionalism to your answer that by listing all of those things that I have just mentioned so the next sales assistant interview question I want to tackle is where do you see yourself in five years time now generally sales assistant positions and have a high turnover so this is a sort of a trick question because in my opinion the employer or the hiring manager wants to see whether or not you are the type of person who jumps from job to job now remember they have to train you up in the role so they will want to see some kind of return on their investment if they're going to hire you so my advice is not to I plan to be with you for six months and then I'm going to move on I would not say that because I don't feel you will get the job if you do say something along those lines so here's what I would say to the sales assistant interview question where do you see yourself in five years time I actually see myself still working for you either in the same role well respected by my manager and my work colleagues or even having gained advancement to a more senior level within a team I'm not the type of person to go jumping from job to job so providing you are happy with my performance which I feel you will be I plan to still be here working for you I'd also like to see myself helping train up newer sales assistants who joined the company in the future and be able to pass on my experience of working for the company now my opinion that answer demonstrates you're planning to stay with them you may not do but you are saying to them that you are planning to stay with them and therefore if I was going to train you up I would feel quite confident that you were gonna stay with me and I would see a positive return on my investment the next sales assistant interview question I want to prepare for is who is the most important person in our company now this question gets asked quite a lot during sales assistant interviews and most candidates will say the most important person in the company is the chief executive officer the company owner or the managing director it is not this is my answer to the question who is the most important person in our company the most important person in the company is the customer because without the customer and their repeat business there would be no company or business and I would not be here today applying to become a sales assistant that is why it is so important to always provide brilliant service and meet the needs of every customer who enters the store customers have lots of choice when buying products or services so it's really important that the sales assistant makes their experience in store a positive one now it's a clever answer because you are not just saying it's the customer you are demonstrating why the customer is the most important person in a company let's take a look at another question don't forget if you are enjoying this please don't forget to subscribe so you don't miss out and I'd also very much appreciate it if you hit the like button thank you very much why should we choose you two workers or sales assistant so they are assessing here why you are the standout candidate so in your answer to these sales the system interview question list the qualities you have that make you the standout candidate here we go you should hire me because the skills and qualities I have are a match for the person specification of a sales assistant I am hardworking conscientious customer focused a good communicator and I will always look for opportunities to upsell to your customers hence bringing in additional revenue for your business I also understand and appreciate that for your business to continue to be successful I will need to provide brilliant service at all times and encourage customers to come back to the store time and time again in the future that is a great answer because you are listing the skills and qualities that you have you are also showing a level of commercial awareness which is attractive to any employer but I can pretty much guarantee you will be old the only person that demonstrates a level of commercial awareness if you use that answer so you are saying at the end I understand and appreciate that for your business to be successful I need to provide brilliant service at all times and encourage customers to come back to the store let's have a look at another question talk me through what you would do if the changing rooms were full and there was a queue of people waiting to try and close so when answering this question prove you have the ability to think on your feet and take ownership of the situation now a lot of people will say I would ask my manager or my supervisor for advice on what I need to do but there's a very simple way of answering this question here it is I will tell the customers that they had the option of purchasing the clothes and then taking them home to try them on if they were not suitable at home they could then return to the store for a refund or an exchange within the refund time period you know you could even add on the end that they could return when it was a quieter period so that is a great answer and it shows that you're taking ownership and that's the point of this interview question they are seeing whether you will come out with a solution where it's right or wrong or whether you will say I will ask my supervisor for assistance so that's the correct way to answer that now if you would like my sales interview questions and answers guide which is perfect for sales assistant jobs click the link in the top right hand
