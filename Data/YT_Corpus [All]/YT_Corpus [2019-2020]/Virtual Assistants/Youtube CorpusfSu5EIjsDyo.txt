 Cheza is driven, Cheza has no gallbladder,  Cheza is passionate, Cheza is empowered. Cheza for someone so young you have dignity, you have wisdom and someday we know me the right man he will recognize if you are worth far more than rubies. So just be patient and wait, and in the meantime continue to inspire us all. Happy work anniversary, Cheza!
