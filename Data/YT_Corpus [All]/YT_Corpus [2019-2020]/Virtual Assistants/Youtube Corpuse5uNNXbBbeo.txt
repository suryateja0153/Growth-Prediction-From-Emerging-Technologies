 hey everyone welcome to this video where we will  be talking about how various voice assistants   work using speech recognition technology  so what is speech recognition the very   basic goal of speech recognition is to generate  methodologies and technologies to convert speech   to text a very simple example of speech  recognition is right in front of you if   you turn on the captions for this video you will  notice that whatever i am speaking gets translated   as subtitles so basically youtube is converting  my speech into text using speech recognition   so how exactly does this happen so when voice is  produced in our vocal cords and travels through   air the entire environment is an analog now for  the system to understand what you are speaking   it needs to be converted into a digital signal and  that happens through a very complicated process   just kidding it's it's done through a microphone  now that the system has a digitally converted   version of the sound it still does not know  what it means and that's where artificial   neural networks come into picture so every word  we speak can be broken down into small individual   units called phonemes linguistically speaking  phonemes are unique individual sounds in any   language that help distinguish between one word  and the other in the english language itself there   are 44 unique phonemes so these phonemes are fed  into the artificial neural networks which consist   of an input layer a hidden layer which in itself  consists of many layers and an output layer now   based on statistics and data collected over time  the system sort of predicts the pattern of your   speech to give you the correct answer now let's  have a look at one of the many nodes of neural   networks so if a node c has to choose between two  connections a and b it will choose the one it has   the strongest connection with in this case a so  initially the neural network will have the same   connection with every node which means there  are high chances of giving incorrect results   that is why we need to train the network so what  we do is we provide the network with the expected   result and when the result is incorrect we call it  an error and the system goes through the process   again until it gives out the correct result and  that is how connections are established now taking   it a step further with the current development  in virtual assistance using speech recognition   now we can have contextual answers so now if you  ask alexa who is the ceo of amazon followed by   the question what is his age alexa will directly  tell you the age of jeff visos and that is one   of the many things that speech recognition could  do so if you like this video then don't forget to   give this video a big thumbs up and also check out  our other videos as well also if you want to get   trained in various technologies like java python  aws in just 30 days and at the ease of your home   then you should definitely get in touch with us  the link is in the description see you next time
