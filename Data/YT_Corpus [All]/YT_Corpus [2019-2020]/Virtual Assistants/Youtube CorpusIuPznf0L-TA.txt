 Hey guys, Errin here, I'm all about more money and less burnout and in this week's video I'm going to talk a little bit more about how to make a couple hundred extra bucks a month through fully passive income. Okay let's start with the term passive income - passive income is not really passive per se because it takes a lot of work to actually create a product digital or otherwise that you can then put online to sell but I am here to tell you that I've been putting out my own passive income a courses for the past year and I've been making between $400 and $500 bucks a month and that's some courses that I made a year ago that took me a week to put together but once it's out there it's out there and it's just been making money consistently ever since then and it's that kind of passive income that I think can really help change the trajectory of a Virtual Assistants income. Now often times we as VA's or really any freelancer often thinks I need to have more clients or get more hours to make more money but there will come a point in your life when you have so many clients and you're working so many hours that you physically cannot work with any more people. When you hit that point in your career you can feel very deflating because all of a sudden you're like, where do I go next? It's not like you work at a job, there's no stepping-stone, you can't get promoted. So what do you do when you do reach the point in your freelance VA career when ou think "I can't make any more money," it can be really disheartening but I'm here to tell you that's where passive income comes in and that's where it can really change your business. So for me personally I started with Udemy. There are a number of different ways that you can get into the passive income game, you can do courses like I do, you can write e books and self publish them on something like the Amazon marketplace. If you're a really great marketer yourself you can actually sell your own ebooks or designs, digital products, courses, whatever on your own platform. I myself am not that I'm not a great marketer, I cannot sell for myself, but the reason that I think it's so crucial to do your homework is because like I said there are a number of different ways you can do and sell passive income. So let's start with Udemy. Udemy is an online platform for courses and what they do is they match your courses with students. They have over 1 million students from around the globe right now who are actively looking for a lot of courses on a wide variety of subjects. As a virtual assistant I'm guessing that there's something that you specialize in and if you're not familiar with this channel I talk a lot about specialization why you should niche how you can charge more money for your new services part of that is if you specialize in a skill that's in high demand or it's something that your clients ask you for the most or it makes you the most money you might want to think about putting that skill together in a course and teaching other virtual assistants how they can specialize instead skill and how they can sell it themselves that is exactly what I do for some of my courses they've ended up being some of my best selling courses benefit of you to me is I don't have to market anything myself they find the students for me the Khan of udemy is that because they're doing all the legwork they take a pretty big chunk of income still for me I think it's totally worth it because I'm a terrible marketer I tried it myself I made exactly zero dollars over first couple months as soon as I put my courses on udemy I'm averaging between four to five hundred a month if you are a great marketer there are of course other services like teachable teachable is something that's a lot similar to you to me only they don't match you with students so they will help you host your course somewhere the rub is you have to market it yourself the benefit there is that you get to keep a hundred percent of the profits so whatever you would list your course for for sale if somebody buys it directly from you on teachable you get to keep all of the profits so a little bit give-and-take there just wanted you to be aware something else that a lot of my virtual colleagues do with some great success is sell ebooks there's a wonderful book out there that another virtual assistant many years ago published I believe it's called the bootstrapping bootstrap guide to virtual assistants like I said it's a wonderful ebook that she self-published and she is still after years of publication is making some pretty steady money on the book so a quick video this week but I wanted you to start thinking about some of the skills that you do as a virtual assistant and how can you possibly package those skills and sell them to other v's who are in need right now if you're thinking of a skill and you're not sure if it's the right kind of skill that you want to sell there is a tip that I will share with you this was a game-changer for me you to me in particular has a link that I'll drop below and it's all about insights so you can actually type in whatever you're thinking of selling and then udemy will break down basically how competitive that market is they'll tell you how many other courses are similar that are already out there what's the average income they make per month the reason that I like this insights page so much is because it can really make or break a course so for instance there are a lot of courses out there on virtual assistants already about how to start your business it's you know how to get going how to set up your business do you need an LLC it's the it's the zero to one step it's like getting started from Ground Zero a lot of those courses already exist on udemy and they're great and so for me I didn't think it was worth it to make another one because it was already a pretty competitive sphere but what I did notice was missing was that people were missing that kind of what I call VA 2.0 step it's the next step when you set your business up now what how do you find clients what tools should you be using what are the pitfalls that you should be avoiding to make sure that your business stays in business so it was those kind of things that I realized we're lacking and I figured that out by looking at the unit insights page so don't be afraid to play around but did want you to be thinking of certain courses or ebooks that you can sell on your own to help supplement some of your income while you're working with your clients full time hopefully this course was helpful and hopefully this video was helpful hopefully you're starting already to think about a couple things that you could sell on your own and if you have any questions or you want to know if something that's a good topic don't hesitate to drop it in a comment below and myself and hopefully the community can lend a hand and give us our to give you our two cents thanks so much for watching this week and I'll catch you guys on the next video you
