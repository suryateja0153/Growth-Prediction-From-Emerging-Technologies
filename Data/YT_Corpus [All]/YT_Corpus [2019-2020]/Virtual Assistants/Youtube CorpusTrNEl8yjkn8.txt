 Lanna Thompson -  Hi, my name is Lanna Thompson and I am the Co-Founder and CEO of VEA, which stands for Virtual Executive Assistants. We provide virtual EA's, executive assistants, bookkeepers, and fractional CFOs. In a traditional model, as you start to grow and get busy you add in more staff but you don't always need full-time staff. We found oftentimes, especially with executive assistants and bookkeepers, you're hiring full-time people before you really need them. Nick Thompson -  All of our staff it's all 100% Canadian and they are all virtual. So, we have extremely professional experienced EA's, bookkeepers, and now CFO's.
