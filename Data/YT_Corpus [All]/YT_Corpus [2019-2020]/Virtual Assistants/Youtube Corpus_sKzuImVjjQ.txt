miss I'm Lauren golden here with a new episode of free mama TV showing moms like you how to start and run a successful freelancing business from home subscribe to my channel and hit the bell to be notified when I post a new episode of free mama TV right here every Tuesday last year the most watched video on this channel was my video and identifying your skills so that you could start working as a virtual assistant now I'm back with an updated version for 2020 so that you can work from home and provide for your family without having to put your kids in daycare or spend hours commuting the idea sounds great right but when you start trying to figure out this whole virtual assistant thing your son what exactly do virtual assistants do and what the heck will you personally offer to people that don't want to pay you for good news I promise you that if you figured out how to get this video here to play on your phone or computer you have the skills to do a heck of a lot of things for busy overworked clients and they will happily pay you to take some of that load off their plates just to give you a little background business owners really will pay you to do all kinds of work for example they might need help with general administrative work like answering emails sending out handwritten thank-you notes mailing out invoices entering expenses into a spreadsheet all of that takes time into a busy business owner time is a precious commodity another area where business owners need help is organization such as calendar management or cleaning up virtual files or maybe even creating a system to manage email if you're a naturally organized person you might think that no one would be willing to pay someone to manage a calendar but I promise you there are loads of business owners who really struggle in this area just because it's easy for you doesn't mean that it's easy everyone or that it's not valuable now some business owners are okay with the general admin skills and they need more specialized help things like email marketing content writing social media management graphic design and even website development now if you're thinking but I don't know how to do any of those things I have two things to tell you number one don't worry these are all things you can learn how to do if you want to and number two you actually probably know more than you think you do for example social media management could be as simple as scheduling someone's Facebook or Instagram posts that's a skill you can learn in under two minutes I want to hear from you what drop me a note in the comments below if you've done work as a VA before where did you start what skills did you offer tell me now now we'll talk a little bit more about some of these specialized services but first let's address the question I'm sure is burning in your brain right now how do I know what I should offer clients mama I've spent the last two years working hands-on with thousands of women and here's what I see happening over and over again you decide hey I'm going to give this virtual assistant thing a go and then you start thinking about what you could offer you consider some straightforward admin work you can organize someone's inbox that now replies and so on but then you start to wonder if you'll really like doing that or if you should try to come up with a better idea or maybe you should build your business around the specialized offer which means you're going to need to spend the next six months learning how to build websites and you should probably go ahead and learn graphic design while you're at it you're totally ready to move forward on this plan and then you start to think hmm I'm really interested in email marketing plus I really like cats maybe I could do email marketing for cat based businesses now you have a whole new direction and you know that this dilemma won't be settled until you've had time to think about it properly so you take a couple of days or weeks or months to just think and overthink and question you're sitting there waiting for that lightning bolt of clarity to leap out of the sky and into your brain bad news it's never going to happen mama not as all lost because I do have a better plan for you to follow instead of spending all that time in your head waiting for something to magically tell you you've hit upon the right idea try this instead start having conversations with business owners and when I say have conversations what I really mean is ask business owners what's hard for them right now what they're struggling with and what they might need help with and then shut up please don't tell my kids I said that but seriously ask questions and listen to the answers don't think about what you're gonna say next and don't try to jump in with the solution right away just listen to these people when they're talking hear what they're saying learn about their problems and their struggles and even their goals after you've heard what they actually need rather than what you think they might need then you can see if something in there sounds a little bit interesting to you for example if you talk to someone who says oh I just feel so overwhelmed because every morning when I wake up after apparently 30 post in my facebook group you might think hey I use Facebook I could probably spend a few hours learning whatever applies look like and take that task off her hands you might suggest that and then you might even start learning more and more about managing Facebook groups six months from now you're a pro you've discovered new tools that help you get the work done more efficiently and you start managing her Instagram comments you come to her with some ideas for content development and you're having a blast but that happens over time you figure out those skills through new experiences my point here is that you have to stop trying to solve this dilemma of what skills can I offer in your head a much better system is to get out there and talk to business owners about what they need to try new things and to give yourself new experiences you don't have to start out doing web development you can start by updating content on pages following your clients instructions if it feels hard and heavy like work you can let it go over time as you have other clients you need at your help but if it interests you and you find yourself googling more and more on that topic diving into how-to videos and learning things on your own you may just have found your niche you don't know what you don't know and until you try out a couple of things you won't know whether you like them or not start by having conversations the kind where you listen more than you talk then you'll see where you can fit into your business owners world and by taking on new tasks and responsibilities you'll learn new things including whether this task is one you enjoy the most successful virtual assistants the ones who start making six figures and rocking out this work from home thing they're the ones who do this they listen to what business owners are saying they really hear what those people need and then they step in and start they don't overthink they use Google and YouTube to find answers and they learn as they go I see it again and again the mom is to think they need to learn everything before they get started or the mama's who never get started because there's always something new to learn stop overthinking listen to what people say dive in and figure it out as you go you can do this if you are ready to move forward and want to get
