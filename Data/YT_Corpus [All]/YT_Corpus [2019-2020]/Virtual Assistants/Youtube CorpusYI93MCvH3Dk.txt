 you guys use a lot of VAs can you talk to people you talk to the audience about how you do it because one of the things that I see here and there on the FreeeUp marketplace you get people who say oh I want to hire a $5 an hour VA I want them to source products so the only directions that they give them is go find me proper products there's no system there's no process behind it how important is it to have that process and how are you utilizing VA in your business so it's a you know we do we utilize VAs for all those types of tasks like we utilize pas for account management you know customer service if we have cases we need to file cases we need to file for reimbursements like our virtual assistants handle all that they also handle all of our scouting and finding products all of our initial contact to vendors so it's you know virtual assistants I think that's the I think that's maybe the disconnect right is that people just you know it's not they don't they don't realize the value of a true virtual employee but those employees can only be as good as the direction you give them like you know you can put the smartest person in the world and into a role where they don't know what they're doing and they will fail and the same is true with virtual assistants so it's you know originally we had those same problems like when we hired virtual assistants the you know we are the work quality would come back and it would be scattered like you would see some great work you would see some terrible work but that wasn't ultimately what we figured out of it that wasn't a reflection of the employee was a reflection of our training processes you know and that was where we really dialed in and tried to focus on trying to trying to decide the optimal way to do things you know creating a process is really simple it's it's understanding the objective creating a process that gets you to that objective every time right it's it's just the optimal way to do things so once we started doing that we started focusing our training around you know this is the one way I want you to do it I want you to do it like this every single time and we had that process literally spelled out step by step we included a video of us doing that process and what we saw is the quality of work got consistent it got consistently better - and and that's the thing it's like once you're able to get that consistency then you're able to tweak individual things to get the work level exactly where you want it right here you're just changing a small part of a process so it's you know it's not an easy thing to do but I think it's absolutely necessary particularly if you're going to use any employees let alone virtual assistants I think a lot of you know in in in regards to you know like people who might use temporary virtual assistants I know that's probably a thing in your platform right yeah I mean we have people that who might have the same VA for three years full-time other people will hire someone to build a website and never talk to them again and and everything in between so it's pretty wide range right particularly for any of those jobs where I feel like it's you're going to be going back and bringing somebody on but it's you know it's not you're not gonna have them employed for three years like you know maybe it's a two-month task or a month long task and but it's something you're going to do a couple times a year or three times a year like it's very important to get processes in place for those types of things because otherwise you're spending if you know you're spending a large amount of time training and that was another problem we had originally is we just have so much time training people it's like you're trying to make them remember something that you know it's a job to them like that's it's not you know these not necessarily something they're incredibly passionate about it's a job and it's it's just hard to it's hard to develop any level of consistency any level of high quality work if you don't have those processes and training methods in place yeah now that's one of the things that we focused on internally with our liaises how do we take that the month-long training process and move it down to two weeks I'm talking about my internal team not the VA is on the platform but I mean think that that's a huge part of it that people don't realize anything you can do to make that process simpler easier faster is only gonna help you and when someone does quit if someone gets sick or whatever it is it's a lot easier to replace someone in two weeks and if it takes you two months it's on board the next person Dan what do you look for when you're trying to hire someone oh it's for us it is literally that they we look for intelligent people who are excited about working and from there I feel like you know if you have the right processes and training methods in place like you can train them but for the most part we start we try to start with a with the more more blank canvas unless it's like a specific one-off job or something like that but you know if it's somebody that we're gonna be utilizing for a long long period of time it's just I want them to go through my entire training process I want them to be utilizing my exact track strategies that we use for that consistency so no it's you know I just I like you know whenever we hire somebody I just like to realize that they're their number one that they're intelligent very motivated I feel like if you give me an intelligent person who's motivated we can accomplish almost anything I want to pick your brain here because I mentioned before that people hiring VA is for sourcing a lot of times don't give them enough information they don't give them the right steps what does a good sourcing process will look like how do you know that process is good enough to hand over to a VA
