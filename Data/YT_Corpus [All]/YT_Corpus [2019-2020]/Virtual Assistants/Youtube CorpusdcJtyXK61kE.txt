 so a question I get asked a lot is about bonuses and I understand it's different someone's in the u.s. the Philippines part-time full-time project-based how did you create your bonus structure and for if there's an agency listening out there how would you recommend that they structure there's so there's we have like a sort of call it like a hybrid bonus structure so here's what I mean by that so I get a lot of referral business a lot of referral business and my team I've sort of indoctrinated them to my process of like networking with people constantly networking whether it's events locally online events groups things of that nature because there's always some sort of thread on Facebook or Instagram where someone says who do you know can run ads for example today I was already tagged in four different threats pertaining to running Facebook Ads right it's constant now one of the things that I sort of taught my team was I don't want you to go out there and be like David's the best Dave is the best I don't need that and I don't want you to do that looks like scamming and spamming people I don't want that right I want you to create natural conversations with people who are obviously wanting to learn ads talk about ads maybe there's some value you can bring to the table for them and if they ask you like hey how can I work with you on running some ads bring them to me we'll get the deal done and they actually get a large piece of that deal alright so for example we actually give about 25 percent of the management fee per month to the person who brings in that client so let's say brings in a person who ends up signing a $3,000 a month deal right we'll give them 25% of that management fee the $3,000 a month until that client cancels right most of our clients end up staying for on the low end six months we've had clients who've been with us for as long as seven years now right so imagine you bring someone in even if you're not working for me anymore I still pay you out of integrity right so we established like a really good referral system there another thing is a lot of our higher-end clients the ones that spend over 50k a month we have these packages where it's like a base fee plus a commission either it's a commission of the back end sales maybe it's like profits from a certain promotion launch spend right there's all sorts of different hybrids that we have for bigger accounts and outside of the referral part cuz I closed many of those deals by myself I'll say okay we obviously want to spend correctly for this Klein we want to optimize things the right way so if we end up not only getting towards $75,000 a month an ad management sorry ad budget but then they decide to extend our contract give us a higher management fee or they adjust our percentage and give us a higher management fee on that on that deal I'll give a percentage of that to the entire team right so let's say all of a sudden we get a $10,000 a month deal management wise you know typically our base is five on that side we'll take the extra five and we'll give 50% of that to the team divide it up monthly as so long as we're still hitting that number so you can imagine that some of my people once again only working 25 hours a week sometimes making as much as some people who are working 40 hours a week right and more than some people at the senior level we're talking my junior people are sometimes making more than people on the senior level right so I compensate for a lot of the extra stuff they do because I want them to be happy the more happy they are the more loyal they become they don't leave they understand that I give them a lot of creative freedom I give them a lot of freedom with their schedule because at the end of the day I don't want them to be like oh we're just doing everything and we want you know David to do nothing like I'm still involved in the process I want them to feel like they're a part of a family they're a part of the entire growth process they see how when my company grows they grow too and at the same time we're impacting our clients because when I go and do these calls with my clients I don't say how much more money do you want to make I oftentimes will ask them like what's the thing that you've been dreaming about that we want to help you achieve for example a coach might say I want to buy a new house cool what's the number we have to achieve so you can get that house and when we hope you get that house how do we compensate my team for you know maybe this person wants to go on a cruise or this one wants to buy a new MacBook right like how do we create a giant compensation for everybody and so some of our deals are just like everyone's benefiting from it simultaneously and that's how we come up for our compensation plans it's very unique and customized based on circumstances sure so I started my business which now is called convert ROI back then it really was just you know working with david schloss right I was a freelancer I was doing like paid blog posts and writing articles for people where you know just any subject they wanted to know about in the in the marketing advertising space
