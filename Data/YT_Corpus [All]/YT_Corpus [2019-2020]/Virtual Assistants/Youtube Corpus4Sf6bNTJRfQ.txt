understand why it's so awesome as a virtual assistant you're in charge of your own business not an employee don't like a client walk away want to give yourself off ready you go right ahead and raise those rates plus you can work from anywhere all you need is a computer and strong internet connection mama if you're looking for real freedom this may be your answer the barrier for entry is non-existent meaning you don't need a degree or certification to get started you get to decide what services you offer and which ones you don't you can even switch it up whenever you darn well please so let's dive in have you ever heard the saying you don't know what you don't know mama let me tell you that when it comes to services you could offer as a virtual assistant it's kind of like that the world is your oyster the possibilities are endless in other words if someone will pay you to do it it's a service you can provide in your business but for the purposes of this video let's rein it in a little I typically break virtual assistant skills out into seven categories administrative organizational email marketing social media management content writing design and websites now this isn't a comprehensive list it's just a way for my type-a brain to wrap my head around it and therefore teach it to you but Lauren what does it ministry to be the main and what is content writing anyway I'm so glad you asked let's break these down one at a time shall we now the first category of services that we are going to talk about is administrative and the beautiful thing about administrative tasks is that if you logged on to a computer or watching this YouTube video at this exact moment you are qualified to provide administrative tasks for someone not unlike being an administrative assistant or secretary providing administrative tasks as a virtual assistant can be as basic as checking or assigning to email us or somebody basic bookkeeping perhaps emailing out or physical emailing out invoices to clients maybe it's sending thank-you notes on behalf of somebody creating basic reports either PDFs or in an Excel data entry or possibly even basic editing for videos like the one you're watching right now or maybe even podcast can all fall under the administrative category next up organizational type tasks now wherever all my type-a sisters are hanging out this one could be for you if you like to organize if you like to color code if you like your email inbox to have zero notifications on it you are probably qualified to start offering organizational type services immediately there are business owners out there who really need help with this because it's just not the way that their brain operates so it might be organizing folders on their desktop or going in and helping them organize their email address account or possibly a Google Drive account maybe they even need to be set up on those things because they have no system in place for organizing all of their electronic documents this could also include calendar management so people who have a bunch of different appointments coming in coming out maybe they need you to book reservations at a restaurant whatever the case may be they are not organized and they need you to keep their calendar up to date so that they know where the heck they're supposed to be and when one of the things that I want to say about the first two categories of administrative and organizational type services that you might provide as a virtual assistant is that these would be considered under the general VA services umbrella the next several that we are going to talk about are going to be considered specialties now I want to explain the difference because it's really important depending on what your financial goals are for your new freelancing business you are going to be able to charge more for specialized type services the reason these tend to be things that a business owner entrepreneur possibly don't know how to do it is not in their zone of genius it is not something that they understand and so it's something that they don't know how to do on the other hand the first two categories that we already discussed those tend to be considered more general type PA services because you are helping a business owner save time now this is not to be downplayed it is actually the first thing that most business owners will outsource will be this this general category because they need to get more time to focus on growing their business until they make that extra money they're typically not going to hire someone in a specialized area however because you're only helping them with something they don't have time to do not something they don't know how to do you're not going to be able to charge more most general VA s can expect to charge somewhere between fifteen and thirty dollars an hour for those general VA tasks specialists however can expect to charge anywhere from 25 to 100 plus dollars an hour at that hourly rates next up email marketing now you might be sitting there going I don't exactly know what email marketing is that here's the deal if you have an email address I guarantee you that you have at least been on the receiving end of email marketing as a virtual assistant different things that you could offer in the realm of email marketing it would be managing subscribers so we call those email lists those are people who are actively subscribed to receive emails from a business so whether it's Pottery Barn Banana Republic Target whoever's contacting you and clogging up your inbox just be aware you are a subscriber to their account which also means you have the ability to unsubscribe and there's got to be someone on the back end of all of that automation through the software who is helping manage everything it might also be editing or creating an email campaign now if you're sitting there going I'm not a writer don't worry a lot of entrepreneurs have a Content writer perhaps but it doesn't mean that they have the times then go into the software copy and paste the email put it in the email campaign everything set up to go which means they hire someone like you to do it other things you could do in the realm of email marketing would be setting up autoresponders next up social media management now this is where I actually got started as a freelancer myself it was something that I was already doing at my nine-to-five I was completely self-taught and took advantage of a lot of free resources ready available on the internet including YouTube and I was able to take those skills that I was applying at my job and assist other business owners now what I want you to know about social media management is that it can be as simple or as complex as you decide to make it but just remember the more you can specialize in something the more you will eventually be able to charge for these services and thus crush your financial goals so remember this can be as simple as just managing a business's comments on their posts or possibly their private messages their inbox on Facebook or Instagram or LinkedIn it could just mean scheduling already written posts again if you're sitting there going I'm not a writer I don't know how to create this kind of content maybe you don't have to maybe it's just a matter of going in and scheduling it and then again managing everything on the back end for them on the flip side however this could be as complex as recommending a complete marketing strategy writing the content and designing the images and you know what there is a need for Bo next up content writing if you like to write you'd be shocked at how many opportunities there are for you in the freelancing world think about it there's blog posts there's emails there's newsletters there's press releases research papers shoot you can go straight an entire book truly the opportunities are endless so if you are somebody who's passionate about writing for yourself it might be time you start monetizing this hobby of yours the next category of services that you can offer as a virtual assistant is design much like social media management this one runs a wide range of meats and abilities now if you're a highly graphic designer amazing if you have a free version of canva also amazing people need design work for everything from just a simple Pinterest traffic to entire ebooks or web pages for social media banners or actual event banners if you have a creative I really encourage you to look into the possibilities of turning it into a profitable business last but not least web sites now this is for all you tech Wizards and/or want to be tech wizards I have very little professional training in this area and even I know enough to be dangerous which means that you can learn it too you could build landing pages for web sites you can manage SEO that search engine optimization for my newbies and more it's the 21st century which means pretty much every business means a website so theirs is not up to par they need you to help them get there I want to know which categories are most in alignment with your current skill set maybe things you're already doing at work or you know that you would enjoy doing tell me in the comments below now we've broken down the seven different categories that your services could fall into as a virtual assistant but what do you do if you still don't have clarity on the services that you could offer it's three tips for you tip number one write down everything you do in a day now I typically hear this most from my stay-at-home mamas you've been out of work for a while and you just don't understand how your current skills can possibly correlate or maybe you're one of the many moms that have sent me an email saying I'm just a nurse I'm just a teacher listen mama you're not just anything except fabulous what I want you to do is write down everything you do in a day so that you can begin to connect the dots I promise you whether you stay home or you've been in the same career for 20 years everything you do is transferable if you're great with people fabulous that's customer service if you are planning for a family of five and doing meal plans and doctor's appointments girl organization is your thing so start taking notes so that you can start see the activities that perhaps you can build upon and turn into circles for your freelancing business tip number two ask the people closest to you now maybe you had a piece of humble pie for breakfast this morning and that's cool but it's important that you start to see how amazing you truly are and in case you've forgotten I want the people in your life to go ahead and remind you so ask your colleagues or your neighbor or your spouse or your mom people who truly believe in you and see you for how wonderful you are and ask them if I could teach you how to do anything what would it be or what do you think my strengths are what do you think I'm really good at listen to them if there are any commonalities those are the ones that you should definitely pursue tip number three I want you to ask yourself what am I really enjoy doing maybe every day at work you're constantly looking over your colleagues shoulders and editing things for them before they turn them in because you just you really like that attention to detail or perhaps you were the kind of mom who has most elaborate crazy beautiful birthday parties with printables and cutouts and decorations because you love creating beautiful things well I would suggest looking at design right and if you're the first mom maybe you need to be doing some content writing or at least editing proofreading or perhaps you were somebody who has such a big heart that you're constantly helping business owners anyway manage their bookkeeping and actually worked with a mom who was doing bookkeeping services for free from her friends because she didn't even know that it was something that people would pay her to do and she was sitting on top of the business because she was already doing something that she really enjoyed doing she didn't even know it remember you don't
