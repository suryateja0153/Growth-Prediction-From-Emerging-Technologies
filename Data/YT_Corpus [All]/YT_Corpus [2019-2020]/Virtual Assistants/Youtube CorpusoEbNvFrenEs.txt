 All right hey everyone, welcome to a very special episode of Candid Convos where we talk   with attorneys unscripted, unprepared, and we have a  chat about virtual staffing, virtual assistants, and   law firm ownership, and life, and today I'm very excited to have a dear friend of mine one of   my favorite people in the world I'm so thrilled that he is now an official Get Staffed Up client   he, we didn't plan it that way. He didn't even know I was involved in the company, it's not like   I solicited him so just fortuitous because Otis  and I think the same way we have a lot of the same   goals and so Landerholm Immigration  it's out in the bay area in California   and Otis, please tell us a little bit more about yourself and what you do.   Love it, yeah! Brett, I'm so happy to  have a conversation with you, absolutely.   So, yeah. My name is Otis Landerholm and I run a law firm here, we fight for immigrants   who are facing deportation so a lot of work in immigration court,   and yeah. Where man, where can I start. You know, Get Staffed Up really has been awesome and   we haven't been with Get Staffed  Up that long, quite honestly. We just signed up I   want to say at the end of May, maybe early June of this year so it's been like three months yeah, and   the, you know if we're going to get right into it. Our first hire was for a role that we call   our case manager and I wasn't really sure what to expect and I was a little bit hesitant to start using overseas staff because you know I'm apprehensive, I want to make sure that our clients   experience is outstanding and I also want to make sure that our staff that are here in the office   are you know able to collaborate well and really able to get questions answered   and make decisions quickly in cases and work seamlessly within everything that we're doing   and Covid-19 created this very interesting dynamic within my firm where, and I think within   all firms right, where now many of us are like forced to work remotely and forced to test   some of our systems on, you know with a pandemic, but also with remote like how can we get stuff   done for clients get work done pivot and still make things happen even working from home   and so as we did that I was like wow, I'm actually grateful that this pandemic has hit   because it has forced me to up my game and to figure out okay where were we inefficient where   were we totally dependent on our office space and where could we, you know, step into that law   firm of the 21st century where now we can do some things remotely and if we can do things remotely   and if we can make that work then heck we don't need to have staff, you know necessarily doing   every little detail every little thing here in the Bay area at you know, California and Bay area cost   and we can run a more efficient firm, run it more intelligently and actually find a better talent to help us move to the next level at a lower price point and thereby save our   clients costs and so yeah it's been great. Yeah, well you covered a lot there so I, let me try to   unwind a few of those things. So, first of all, yeah you have Danitza and Anna right now   yeah and you like them so much I just saw that you're hiring more. Yeah I've got an interview like   in an hour with another person we're hiring yeah, we're going for four now yeah so we went we   hired one first and then we've got, yeah  we've hired Anna first as our case manager then   Danitza as a marketing assistant and now we're going to have two intake specialists join us.   Beautiful, so here's the deal I mean look, you mentioned systems and testing your systems I   also appreciated like in my law firm we moved out of our office very quickly we were out of there   March 16th and we were up and running a day later fully virtual you know our setup worked  but now we're paying an ungodly amount of rent on space that we don't even use one person. I feel   that 100 yep. And so, but I'm grateful I mean I'm thankful that this has happened because it   has forced us to re-look at the things and look  sick but just going to the monetary point of this   it's not about replacing people it's about being  able to add more services right like we've hired   client happiness directors and do better and more  for your clients and then pass on some of the cost   savings so the math essentially it's not dollar  for dollar because every firm is different but   if you have 10 offshore staff people to Get Staffed Up if you're you're saving a quarter   of a million dollars that year then if you had 10 people domestically yeah so and so you're almost   at you're almost at five right which would be basically, a 125 000 and the thing is people think   well a lawyer's just rolling around the money we've got expenses and it's hard to run a business   where you're not constantly basically breaking  even and so many businesses are breaking even   and so profit is not a dirty word because when  you're able to have profit you're able to breathe   and relax and say what fun thing can we come up  with this month to enhance our client experience   or can we take the savings and put it back or now  that we've grown and we've been able to parlay   our newfound freedom into more clients who  else how many more jobs can we create here.   That's right. There are so many benefits to doing what we're doing but now I'm singing   my own praises so you and I haven't even spoken  since you signed up and yet you're saying all the   things that I'm so excited to tell people this  is how it works and this is why it's so great   and you'll finally, look some people already have  profitable businesses but a lot of people don't, a   lot of people don't have systems in place, they don't you know I mean the average lawyer   was just like me eight years ago didn't  know anything didn't know what I was doing   you know no income you know scratching by each month I was miserable and that misery   I don't want to forget how painful it was and that's why I'm so emphatic about helping people   and I'm not afraid to say look you will have such a better life if you have a little bit of   margin for yourself so you can comfortably grow a business and figure out how to just   make things great for your clients instead of constantly worrying about how to make payroll.   Yeah, for sure, yeah and I mean  I could go on and on about   that point like our firm runs at a very  narrow profit margin like uncomfortably narrow   and so things like the pandemic were  happening and it's like oh crap you know now   there are fewer clients hiring us it didn't go down to zero but there are fewer clients   coming in for appointments there are fewer clients  even calling our office because they just assume   that lawyers are closed, right? And so that was, it was a scary situation for me to be in   as far as okay how long is this gonna last and are we gonna be able to get through it and   how can we pivot to get through it and so yeah, exactly we've we hired Anna who's in   El Salvador who's awesome she's super smart super like, like on top of it and we had her just   call all of our former clients and so the first month she called 200 people and she was just doing   client satisfaction surveys right with former clients and for clients that were satisfied   she would ask them if they'd be willing to do a Google review for us we more than doubled   our google reviews our five-star google reviews in 30 days wow right that was awesome we went   from 41 google reviews to 106 google reviews in 30 days and it was like that that contributed to   our SEO efforts getting up, that contributed to more clients coming in it's like, oh man! It was   it was so great it's like why didn't I do this years ago. Yeah! That's a great   story and look our pricing's on our website so I'm guessing you're at the 1850 price point   you traded that for reviews that would have taken so look they're. We've never would've gotten to   it. No, you, well, first of all, you and I know you I mean it's so hard to get there second of all   if you pay one of these companies they want like 800 bucks a month just to run automatic software   for you but that that rarely works you need to be a doctor's office with volume so I haven't   heard of anyone using a staffer yet for that and I love it. Yeah, yeah, I mean that was just like my   my first 30 days like getting her trained up and how our office works and stuff like that and   us quite frankly testing the waters out and seeing if this was gonna work and so plus it's like okay   let's get creative because of Covid-19 and have an excuse to reach out to all of our former clients   you know and so it was like a win-win-win. Yeah!  You know the other thing that I was going to say   is regarding costs we had a, one of my attorneys was really apprehensive when we started to   seek talent overseas and she was she used to be, in her former life, she used to be an employment   lawyer, a labor lawyer and she was very struggling right internally with the   philosophy about okay are we replacing American workers. Yeah! And are we just like you know   no longer to be hiring local and are  we going to be replacing everything global   and so we had that conversation, I  actually had a meeting about it with my whole team   and I was like okay tell me what are our concerns here, and what I really want and I said   this to my team also but what I want anybody who's listening to us right now to consider for   themselves if they're thinking that is it's a beautiful thing to have that thought in their   mind like we do want to create jobs  like that's that is something that we want to do   for our communities all right and I believe that having hired people overseas helps us to create   jobs locally as well like it's not either  or. Right! All right, it's not that we hire   locally or we hire overseas if we hire overseas and that helps us build up our margin or that   helps us become more profitable as a company it allows us to grow locally and globally all right   and really the 21st century and the offices that are going to survive into the future will   get that point and the sooner we get it and the sooner we embrace that the quicker   we'll be able to contribute in a larger scale locally and globally. So I want to point out   something unrelated but something very important just because I want to acknowledge you for this   so many people would never take the time to have a meeting with their team and hear their concerns   now at the end of the day, it's your name on the law firm you're going to make the decision   but by including everyone and giving them a voice clearly you've created the type of   culture at your firm where you guys can try things out and you're going to say I heard you out   you know now trust me we talked this through it and I'm glad we're all it sounds like you all   arrived at the same decision but I just as, I don't even know what to call this I enjoy   hearing other good leadership techniques and stories and so I just wanted to mention   I really appreciate that and I thought  that was very cool and pretty important.   Thank you! You will create more jobs here if you bring on people to supplement your staff   what if every attorney had an assistant that they, otherwise, wouldn't have who's virtual   which will then increase their productivity I would argue by probably give them another 30%   capacity by just not doing all the things that get in their way which helps put the push the business   further and then lo and behold you're hiring, you know, domestically again we're in favor of   a good mix between domestic and international, but I also think, and it's an interesting talk   to you as an immigration attorney we're helping the global economy, yeah I mean to me so we only   do administrative staffing which means your high turnover lower paid positions anyway if you live   in Miami where I am or you live in the Bay area, you cannot feed your family on ten dollars an hour   you know 40 hours a week it's just not possible you're gonna constantly be looking to upgrade your   life and to find better-paying jobs to do better for your family so you know those jobs have high   turnover anyway and turnover is expensive for a firm and it's a constant just friction point   so if we can take those jobs that people don't really want to stay in, that live here, outsource   them and then to me help those other people you know, not get stuck where they are, push them up   the ladder but also Otis here's kind of like my non-lawyer but just entrepreneur argument   those people that are talented they can get their own staff person right through us or anyone else   and start a business this is my argument like if I'm starting a social media business right I'm   a 20-year-old I'm starting a social media business I need to get two clients paying me a thousand   dollars a month now I've covered my one offshore staff person in 1,850 and it's all gravy from there   I'm going to spend all my time on making sales and that person will be doing all of the important   work behind the scenes isn't that a, you know the, to me being an entrepreneur is the way to get   out of the lower middle class up to the middle and upper-middle class in this country and   that's what a lot of immigrants understand anyway, immigrants are some of our best entrepreneurs.   For sure, for sure. I actually love working with immigrants precisely because   so many of them come with that entrepreneurial vision it's like what gets a person to   to say that they've had enough  with whatever poverty or situation or   issues that they've had in their  country and to make a decision   that they're going to like go and do something and search for a better life it's the same decision   inside the entrepreneur, it's like I'm gonna take my fate in my own hands and   I'm gonna make decisions and I'm gonna go for it and that's why I love being   a lawyer that's why I love being a business owner right but it's also why I really love   working with our clients because it's like that's what they do and same for you you're working with   with business owners, you're in it and it's like it brings this like new energy this new spirit   this new soul for life that's like hey let's not settle for garbage let's go for the life we want.   Dude, I'm not exaggerating here I got the chills when you were making that analogy because   I talk all the time about when I started my own business I woke up that morning and I looked   at the world differently like the world just looked different to me there was no one giving   me a paycheck there was no fail-safe I burned the boat and the freedom was so profound for me that   nobody could tell me what to do that day nobody well I guess they could try but I was in charge   of my own fate and you just nailed it, I  mean it's the same thing with somebody who says   screw it I know it's gonna be tough and it may not work but I'm going to seek a better situation for   my family so. That's right. That's probably why you know I don't know the numbers so I would be   making them up but I know that that entrepreneurs, that there's a high percentage that are immigrants   and it's probably approaching 50% coming with that mentality of I got here myself well let me   just make it myself and not rely on someone else for a job you know. And I would say taking it like   you know to the core of the United States as a whole it's like that's why the United States is   so great about business. Yeah. It's like because we immigrated here and we were freaking fed up   with whatever crap, we were dealing with in Europe, mostly, and it's like hey let's come here and let's   build a new country that works for us and let's not even settle. Yeah. You know and it's like I  just I love it, I love it. Yeah, and  by the way, I like totally apolitical here   you know, a lot of the wealthy immigrant entrepreneurs that I know are seeing the praises   of the United States so much because of the opportunity. Yes. Right, it's like you, where   I'm from you just can't do what I've done here and so I appreciate that opportunity like you   said that sort of the core freedom to  just pursue whatever the heck you want to pursue   And yeah, we've got a lot of other issues that we've got to work on in this country but at   the end of the day it's still you know as far as I know the best place to start a business and  make something of yourself. Yep cool. Yeah dude, Otis you're the man I really appreciate your time today   and thank you for being on with us.  Yeah, you're awesome Brett thanks a lot
