really valuable person to whoever you choose to be   valuable to so we're going to be talking  about virtual assistants uh just a little   bit of a background of how i got started as a  va and quite frankly i still consider myself a   va as of today and i foresee myself being a va  at some uh scope for hopefully my entire career   i'm going to tell you a few reasons why i  personally think being a va is perhaps you know   i've chosen this path for myself so i definitely  believe that it's really the most amazing   learning experience that you can possibly have  you're going to be learning from uh top executives   they're going to be learning from top gurus you're  going to be learning from top business leaders   thought leaders anybody in the industry is really  going to want to get associated with you and   sky is truly the limit you're going to have pretty  much all the skill sets that i have as of today   we've got some really good giveaways some good  documents that go along with the training so i'm   going to be sharing with you some resources that  you'll have for a lifetime you're going to have   access to this and when you are confident when  you are a lot of the stuff is going to be new   a lot of the stuff hopefully you already know  and now you've got a nice documented process   on how to go about your to-do's how you can help  other businesses go through their to-do's as well   and what we're going to do is we're going to  list down a very cool mind map we're going to   make a mind map together that you're gonna  get to keep as well on what it truly means   to be a virtual assistant a misconception uh is  that because the word assistant is associated   with secretary in india that a virtual  assistant is like a virtual secretary   and there is some truth to that though a virtual  assistant the skills that you're going to be able   to hone essentially evolves around every single  task that is carried out by a digital marketing   agency what that means is that a virtual assistant  is essentially a one-man show that can potentially   run a digital marketing agency right so what  does a digital marketing agency really help   businesses with it's pretty simple they help them  build assets so building assets could be things   like a website your facebook page your email  list your whatsapp groups your other social media   whether it's facebook or twitter or pinterest  so basically your social media properties   your email list your whatsapp groups so they  help you build all these things your funnel your   integrations and then the other thing that they  help you do is that they help you drive traffic   so they'll help you get traffic through google  through ppc email that's a good one there they   help you build your brand so within your brand  you know your colors your logos your taglines your   message they help you find out who your customer  avatar is so that's a good point over here and   then they help you build traffic so as a one-man  show as a virtual assistant there are essentially   a lot of tasks every single thing that we are  going to talk to you about can be broken down   into a task so a major keyword for a valuable  virtual assistant is to be able to identify   all the tasks that business owners need now to  ask you a question i want to ask you a question   is if you had a list of all the questions that  you needed to ask a business owner in order to get   them on the internet not only did not only you had  this list you actually know this list imagine all   this information that's going to be in your head  if you have a list of all the tasks step by step   that need to be carried out for any online  business do you think that is going to be   valuable just type in a valuable if you feel  that you have a list of all these tasks right   now it might be in your head you know there's  facebook you know there's google you know there's   email you know all these things but what if there  was a systematic way what if there's a systematic   strategic way for you to go through  this entire step-by-step process now   to a lot of people understandably digital  marketing does sound a little overwhelming   it it is overwhelming and when i show you in fact  when i give you this list it is going to look like   overwhelming stuff but that's why you're going  to study it that's why you are going to know   it that's why you are going to master it and i  want you to benchmark yourself today i want you   to benchmark yourself today and hopefully when  we are going through some of these exercises   like i said earlier there should be some things  where you're like oh yeah i know how to do that   oh yeah i've done that and there will be some  things that you're like oh i've never thought   about that or i did not know that so that's  where you're going to gradually increase your   learning you're going to figure out all the  tasks that need to be executed not just for   one business but for all businesses my background  has been in digital marketing we used to call it a   digital marketing agency but in essence  in real essence it was a virtual assistant   company where every client would have some  more or less the same requirement but we had   to customize it a little bit for them so with that  said let's jump in about 12 minutes into the show   we are going to talk to you uh first about  a step-by-step guide on being able to   set up a profitable va business and then  we are going to be giving you a list of 50   tools we're going to give you a list of 50 tools  that you can use to turbo charge your va business   your digital marketing agency however you  want to brand it it's totally up to you   what i want you to take away is this list of  guidelines that we've laid out for you and   you can use exactly the same material to train  another virtual assistant that's the beauty of   it that's the power of it it is a scalable  system it's a scalable system once you know   the checklist once you've been through the  checklist your job in essence is really to   make sure somebody else goes through the checklist  so that all your tasks can further be outsourced   so step-by-step guide for setting up a profitable  virtual assistant business this is going to be   a book that's going to be published pretty soon  you guys are going to get access to it right now   so really a lot of support from our freelancing  team as you can imagine as you can imagine i do   have a couple of va's that do associate with  me that do collaborate with me and uh this   book as you can imagine has also been created  by some va's so i'm really happy to be able to   present that to you this morning so all our  members thank you for contributing let us   together celebrate the gig economy and let us rock  and roll so my mission essentially is to help 100   000 people earn one lakh per month as a digital  freelancer so once you do have these skills once   you

going to tell you like the most  profitable va tasks that have the greatest   perceived value the most tangible value and once  you're able to understand these you're going to   be able to start charging a lot more for your  services so 14 years i've been doing this stuff   do take some time to read this but here we're  going to talk about a hundred ways you can   earn as a virtual assistant now some of these  like i said you already know but some of these   will be brand new to you so va services that you  can offer i'm just going to talk to you broadly   about the categories and then you can go through  the subtasks and see which ones you are able to do   if you are planning to set up a company if  you are planning to set up an agency then i   would recommend looking at each of these  categories like the administrative tasks   as one team you know you could have one  person you could have one va look after   it so that you can expand your services so that  you can hone your skills in multiple different   areas and then when you are pitching to a customer  you don't necessarily need to be selling calendar   management but this could be an upsell this  could be a retainer where at the end of it   someone's like they're really happy with you and  we've seen this happen pretty much every single   time is we will start with something really really  small maybe like uh a content article or we might   even just give somebody a content plan that's  really the foot in the door strategy once you get   literally any one of these tasks to do whether  it's an seo audit whether it's a content calendar   you get one of these jobs the opportunity opens  up instantly to offer clients every single one   of these tasks so we've got eight pages of  different tasks that you can offer right   from audio video editing to branding to  support to email marketing blog marketing   social media seo related services content  marketing services customer support services   and admin support services if you think that  this is an awesome list to start building your   services around if you could offer all  these services to your potential customer   do you think that you would be able to add  value to them of course you will there's no   there's no shadow of a doubt that if you're good  if you're able to stay on top of all these tasks   and it's measurable which means that at the end of  the month we've got we've committed that hey we're   going to do all these things for you at the end  of the month if you have a report that says that   i've assigned 25 tasks i've made 15 appointments  i've sent you 30 calendar requests we're using   slack as a communication tool i've collected seven  testimonials for you i've done a survey for your   audience i've checked the analytics i've created  a youtube channel and i've also helped create a   document in terms of customer support we've added  2 000 people to the facebook group uh we received   75 emails from customers in the last week uh we  looked at three new competitors that have come up   in the market we've created an online contest  which we've got 200 new responses for we've   got three press releases distributed that  have been picked up by google we're managing   the entire online business we're doing customer  relationships we're building these relationships   with customers we're tracking affiliate marketing  tools and we set up some affiliate tools for you   now imagine if you are a va talking to a business  owner like this do you think that you will have   their attention once you do this a couple of  times you know once you do this a couple of times   and you become familiar with the process like  i said every single thing is in your head uh   you'll be invited to very important places you'll  be invited to board rooms you'll be invited to   every single place because you know more about  the online business than the entrepreneur   the entrepreneur has got a checklist of   all the things he has to do whether it is get  new business whether it's negotiate whether it's   innovate whether it's a developer product all  those things right so you are going to be able   to do all these things for them and what is  awesome what is awesome is that we have uh   corresponding tools we have corresponding tools  that are going to help you do all these activities   and tasks and here we've got things like content  which is the most important thing you know content   is king you're going to be able to help them  manage their blogs you're going to be help   them manage their social media you're going to  be helping them do things like ebook writing   so you're gonna get this list of literally  the most amazing services that you can offer   and you're gonna be able to dive deep all  you really need to do is start with one all   you need to do is start with one service and  we've seen this happen every single time with   no exception you pick up any one of these tasks  you do a good job for your customer the chances   of them upselling you the chance of you upsetting  them the chances of you giving them something of   further value is going to be extremely  extremely high so you've got content   you've got seo you've got social media you've got  blogs websites and maintenance this again is a   industry by itself you know it's an industry by  itself where you're able to help businesses set up   their website you're able to help  businesses configure their e-commerce   you're going to be able to  help businesses configure their   affiliate websites so this is an amazing service  to be able to have it's a really good service   that is available and here we are going to  look at email marketing enable outreach you   know booking speaking events getting featured  on magazines like entrepreneur.com forbes.com   helping the entrepreneur in any single way  to move forward audio video this again is a   business by itself if you're able to offer video  editing services like this specific webinar   as well is going to be further edited and used for  promotions for the next uh class that we do so any   single piece of content that is created can be  repurposed and in order to repurpose the content   that has been created you need to have a va video  editing team so audio va branding and graphics   there's so many software and tools that are  available on the internet and that anybody can use   at the same time time is money time is money many  people say time is more valuable time is more   valuable than money because money can't because  time can never be brought back you can always earn   money in the future but you can never bring  time back so time is money to say the least   and here we've got other va tasks we  have other va tasks that are available   and next we're going to jump into your checklist  right we've shared this checklist with you before   as a download we're going to be giving  it to you it's been updated a bit   and we're going to be going through all these  tasks that are going to be available for you so i'll share this resource with  you you can keep a download of it   you can always circle back to this when you are  ready to start your business and the next thing   that we're going to be giving to you is the   tools 50 plus tools that are available and these  are basically broken down into 20 different   categories so for each of these we recommended  one in some cases two different tools that   you could use so when you combine this  knowledge you know when you combine   these tasks when you combine these 100 ways you  can earn with these tools then you automatically   kind of classify as a professional virtual  assistant because now you're helping businesses   not only get the work done but you're also  helping them get the work done in the most   efficient manner the reason we use tools is  because it helps us speed up the work every   single tool that's listed down over here is going  to help you speed up as well as be accountable   right so time management effective communication  this is really important you know being able to   effectively communicate with your customers being  able to effectively communicate with other teams   you know being a virtual assistant gives you  the privilege it gives you the exposure that you   probably require right now which is the ability to  really work with teams on the internet all across   the world the good news is that you're going to  learn very fast it's kind of like going to a new   country altogether it's like going on a holiday  because suddenly you meet so many new people and   all these new people have a different way of doing  things so everybody communicates through chat   to remove the barrier of accents to remove  the barrier of english not necessarily being   everybody's first language in most cases when  you are working with an international team   english is primarily their second language so  with chat with these tools that we're going to be   sharing with you you can be rest assured that  you will learn how to communicate extremely   effectively with other people they could be your  customers they could be your peers they could be   different teams it could be different agencies  that you are working with so it's really important   to be super professional every single thing that  you say is being recorded uh through chat so   everything does remain extremely transparent  so it's very important to understand that   the tone even of your chat the tone of your  chat the way you ask questions the way you   respond to people is extremely critical so  that you can have an eternal or at least a very   long-term relationship with people because they  respect you for your knowledge and they respect   you as a person because you're courteous  you're polite and you're professional   so let's go ahead and jump in to these tools  that we're going to be looking at start with time   management effective communication time tracking  now this is extremely important if you want to be   a successful va is you need to understand what  is your time really worth you you're going to   need to understand how to build your customers as  well as some tools that you can use to actually   monitor and record your time now being  a va comes with a lot of responsibility   you need to be a hundred percent honest because  you are working with other people's money you're   working with other people's money you're working  with other people's time so you need to be a very   honest person you need to be extremely transparent  you have to be happy to be transparent you have to   be happy to be an open book you have to be able  to communicate because it's all about trust you   know it's all about trust as a virtual assistant  you need to be honest you need to be trustworthy   because you'll be surprised really quick about  the power you actually get right from uh signing   up ping vendors buying software domains uh bank  accounts every you're going to get access to a   lot of stuff so you need to be transparent you  need to build that trust and once you do that you   literally become inseparable you become invaluable  you become so valuable to a business that you know   you're an integral part of it and i think it's  really the right strategy to be an integral part   of any team that you are associated with so time  tracking we talk about contracts this is where   a lot of v is i would say amateur vas go wrong  because when they don't have contracts and they   don't have anything to protect them and even  customers if they don't have contracts they also   can get into a lot of hot water and then they  want to kind of back pedal and then figure stuff   out so it's really important to understand  and again we've got some tools and resources   that will make you extremely professional  they'll make you look extremely professional   once you get your contracts in the right place  so here we've got things like time management   effective communication time tracking contract  management then you've got data storage and file   sharing you know like i said you're going  to get things like passwords you want to get   things like wordpress details hosting details  the email details and the text details   so you're going to be able to need to manage  that securely so we talked to you about some   password sharing apps as well uh surveys and  forms this is an integral part of being a va   which is being able to audit your audience  make questionnaires uh create stuff quickly   so that you're getting good information pdf  formatting you know pdfs are super important like   you're going to get this pdf as well social  media planning stock photos and creatives   where to network as a va project management email  marketing creatives and branding which payment   processors you need to be familiar with password  management remote access you know how do you just   jump in sometimes like the easiest way to help  your customer or to help uh whoever it is you   are vaying for is to just jump in and take  control of their computer and do it for them that   again is a really valuable task which is where  you're able to troubleshoot somebody's problem   using their computer whether it's helping  them set up a website or some software's   crashed or something's happening you can  just jump in start helping them and you'll be   a successful va so screen recording audio editing  and recording time zone converters this is super   important i'm sure you already know but it's  worth mentioning especially with the international   market that everybody operates in different  time zones you know everybody offers operates in   different time zones so it's really important that  you have an easy resource you should know at the   back of your mind that if you've got customers in  austin or you've got customers in dubai or what   customers in singapore you know exactly what time  it is over there and you're always talking to your   customer in their time zone you know if you're  working with different customers it's their   time zone and we made mistakes a couple of  times so i think these tools will help you   their desktop apps that you can just like quickly  glance at it i'm sure you've got them on your   mobile phone as well but it's just important to  note that people are in different time zones so   when you're setting up stuff you are in the right  time zone video conferencing meetings and webinars   so currently number one tool super simple uh set  more something that we are experimenting with   right now and especially when you're working with  a team when you're not just an individual set more   might be a really good option for you uh g suite  so this is uh google suite it's super important   super easy to use and you've got your  storage over here so you're gonna see that google drive as a va google drive as a va is  going to be an extremely extremely valuable   tool for you we've got  evernote google docs grammarly   time tracking it's as simple as using a google  spreadsheet or you can use toggle toggle is a   very good app that you can use to track your time  contract management this is the best proposify   and we've added a few more options that are  available and all of these have a free trial   now hello sign is an effortless e-signature  way this is the contracts and stuff   you do this you become professional and once and  for all you set it up and you forget it so here's   a list of all the tools that we've used and that  we recommend either you use it for yourself or   you use it for your customers i highly recommend  that you actually check out you actually check out   all these tools you sign up for free accounts with  them and once you play around with it a bit you   know once you play around with it a bit uh you'll  know it you can record your screen you can do a   little bit of audio editing time zone converters  video conferencing software uh we still use skype   a lot because uh us customers are extremely  comfortable with that zoom of course is zoom   so here are a list of 50 tools that you're going  to get access to and with that said i'm going to   be sharing these two resources with you right now  this is the agenda uh 7 a.m uh we want to set the   context you know we want to set the context as  to what the heck is a va all about and why is it   so extremely valuable why it's so valuable to  be a good va and there's a difference in quality   obviously someone who's been doing these tasks  for many years is going to be better than you   but there's no reason why you can't get as  good or better with a little bit of practice   so here we go uh we set the context the lan the  landscape the va landscape of like every single   thing that you need to know there's always  going to be new stuff and i'm sure there's   something that might not be included but with  that said honest skills in these use these tools   to begin with and you're going to be pretty  awesome uh just straight off the gate uh things   you need to know things you need to know as a va  let's just talk about things that you need to know   the first thing that you need to know is you  need to be punctual and you need to be polite   and i'll explain to you why these  are important especially as a va   and then you need to be transparent you need  to have proof and you need to be constantly be   upskilling so punctual why because like we said  they're different time zones so you don't want   to keep people waiting you always want to show up  at least at least at least at least three minutes   before time especially for zooms or especially  for any other meetings and a quick note before the   meeting saying hey ready when you are this is like  extremely important and it goes a long long way   when you are able to be a dependable person you  know when you're able to be dependable and you do   what you say you're going to do that's an  extremely valuable skill set to have as a va   now why polite because there are different  cultures and people interpret stuff   differently like for example someone  was chatting with you and they're like   if somebody typed this to you they're chatting  with you whether it's on skype or whether it's on   whatsapp if somebody sent this to you type in one  word how that would make you feel or how do you   think they are feeling so this is something that  we would of course want to stay away and this is a   extreme example when people are typing  in gaps and with exclamation marks so   too many question marks you know like if  someone doesn't respond you're like this   and then they don't respond and you're like one  more like this and that person is like just like   fried they are frustrated and the person who  reads this they're like what the heck man give   me like a minute so even though the work might  be happening even though it might be a great   relationship just because of poor communication  people get agitated they get irritated they get   angry they get frustrated and you've got  to understand that you need to take it easy   they need to take it easy everyone needs to keep  it polite everyone needs to keep it professional   and when when you're able to reach that balance  with your customers that's when it goes really   long term that's when you're able to flourish you  know that's when you're able to build something   extremely tangible okay so that's why you need  to be polite even though it is written chat   you need to be extremely polite so words  like thank you please great very important   so be transparent the reason why you want  to be transparent is so that you have proof   and once you are transparent and you have  proof then automatically your trust is built   right i'm going to be sharing with you a  video uh it's going to be a pitch video and   i'm going to play that for you to show you why uh  how we would pitch you know how we would pitch and   then we will take questions from you this  is the way we would pitch to customers and   hopefully it gives you an insight on how you  can pitch to customers as well and the title   is transparency trump's trust hey guys what's  up garage sani here and before we jump into   my computer screen and i start sharing my mind  map about outsourcing and why i think that's   really a game changer when it comes to doing  business online but straight off the bat you   know i just want to let you know that i'm not  trying to sell you on any kind of e-commerce or   any kind of new info product ebooks  or membership websites whatever it is   i think you've already got all the information  that you really need in order to succeed on the   internet one key component that i've seen a lot  of gurus kind of hold back for themselves and i've   been working with some of the largest internet  marketing gurus for about a decade right now   and i'll be sharing some of these case studies  with you once we dive into my computer screen   so you can see it for yourself but what i really  want you to let you know is that there are people   who are extremely qualified certified in fact in  the space of digital marketing who are going to be   able to assist you in your journey moving forward  so hope you enjoyed this i'll probably catch you   at the end of the video again but look forward to  learning more about you and if outsourcing could   be a potential strategy for your digital marketing  business okay i said my name is gaurav gurbaksani   and what i really wanted to point you out quickly  uh to over here is uh and feel free to add me on   linkedin that's a great way to get in touch with  me uh for right now i just wanted to highlight   uh one of the latest certifications that i  underwent it was by the digitalmarketer.com   and i really believe that they are the  number one digital marketing training   company out there digital marketing if you  recognize their logo you know their stuff it works   and stuff that they do for themselves so i went  ahead took a step back and relearned everything uh   ground up you know i have been running a digital  marketing enterprise for a decade now but i really   wanted to kind of relearn everything ground up  from a theory site and then start implementing   that with the new found tactics and techniques i  found find it an excellent way to stay up to date   so if you are following digital marketer or  if you are a hardcore online internet marketer   feel free to stay tuned i think i've got some  really incredible stuff uh for you lined up okay   so today i want to talk to you a little bit about  outsourcing and something that i think you require   in an outsourcing relationship is you guys need to  be able to understand and speak the same tools you   know tools are universal i think a lot of concepts  and principles and theories are universal so over   the past decade as a digital marketing agency  these are a few of the capabilities that we built   up these are capabilities that we uh started  doing either for ourselves or we learned from   our clients in fact majority of the learning uh  that we've really gained over this last 10 years   is from our clients and our clients put together  these amazing standard operating procedures   they come up with these really easy to execute  tasks and you know digital marketing as an   umbrella can be super complex but if you are able  to break everything down into small tasks that's   definitely going to help you get ahead so these  are a few things that we do some of our really   cool capabilities are just about over here so with  an outsourcing relationship if you are able to   find somebody who's actually walked the talk and  done this for a long time i think that could be   a huge asset for any business uh more importantly  you know trust is amazing trust is what   keeps business relationships together but quite  frankly on the internet when someone's sitting   across the world from you in a different continent  it's difficult to come out with trust straight   off the bat which is why i think something that  definitely trumps trust is transparency and the   next window that i'm going to open to you is how  we keep things 100 transparent in our company this   gives me peace of mind knowing that my work is  being worked upon when it's supposed to be worked   upon so over the last quarter we've invested in  a software like hub staff this is what i use for   my teams and it gives me a fantastic overview to  see how my remote teams are doing across the world   just to kind of let you know who i am and why you  should listen to me is we have been doing this for   a long time if you are familiar with warrior forum  probably the number one internet marketing forum   we have been endorsed very positively by some of  the leading internet marketing gurus in the world   we are their backend it is uh we do have exclusive  relationships with a lot of top internet marketing   gurus there's a very good chance that somebody  who you are learning from is outsourcing it   to us so the point of this video is i really want  to let you know that if things can be transparent   uh things should be transparent uh we do  have the tools we do have the knowledge   we do have the experience to help a handful of  top digital marketers outsource their operations   remotely you know so many different platforms  where different stuff is available from but to   be able to have someone to help you manage  your entire operations to have a dedicated   digital marketing expert hand hold you from start  to finish i did mention to you right when we   began we are certified by digital marketer which i  think it's safe to say that we know our ship we've   implemented this we've learned this from different  customers we do practice what we preach we set up   our own funnels similar to one like this so please  do fill

this was outsourcing   transferry transparency trump's trust and first  published in 2016. so this was our full site pitch   poolside pitch on outsourcing and we sent this out  to customers who were interested in our services   and each person who would watch this  the conversions as you can imagine   skyrocketed and the things that we're  talking about today are virtually identical   to what we were doing four years ago and  they're going to be virtually identical for   the next decade and by the end of today  you're going to have everything that you need   in order to be able to pitch like a pro so this  so we're going to talk about getting set up as   a virtual assistant uh help you find a niche  help you build a profile we're going to talk   to you about pricing as well our different  strategies that are available to you as a va   uh what we started off with what we are currently  doing right now as well and uh hopefully you get   a blueprint as to how to send proposals what  exactly is your product like what exactly   are you selling and then the most important by  the end of the hour you need to have a review   getting strategy typically we start with a review  getting strategy even before we start a business   that is how important getting reviews truly are  and for those of you been following us for some   time you've probably seen this but it i can't  stress the importance of doing this for yourself   so you need to be able to get something like  this on the internet one time it's a one-time   activity and if you get a review like this for  your business i can like literally guarantee   you that you will have enough business uh for  a very long time so starting with this in mind   how how do you get customers how do you  build a product and how do you price   the product and how do you get the end goal  which is reviews so let's go ahead and get   started and this is going to be a hands-on game  it's going to be called the va treasure hunt okay it's called the va treasure hunt one thing  that we are going to start with is a profile   so how do you build a killer profile and you  build a killer profile by first getting a   photo shoot done now this can be done by a family  member it can be done uh by anybody who's got   decent skills you need to have a photo shoot  done in order to be a successful va it sounds   kind of funny and strange but i can tell you  one good picture will help you build connections   will help you build relationships it'll help  you become from invisible to visible and when   people are able to see a good professional photo  shoot you're automatically going to be classified   in another league so you really want to be able  to differentiate yourself as much as possible and   you start by doing a killer photo shoot the second  is you start by getting a simple one-page website   okay now in your one-page website i'm going to  talk to you about a secret hack that absolutely   no one has told you about i'm going to show you  how you can get featured how you can get featured on entrepreneur.com today you're going to  learn this and you're going to learn a secret   that's really going to help you differentiate  yourself from any other va this is open to all   and once you know the secret once you follow  through i think you will be able to put yourself   in a all new position because you've  built authority you build credibility   as an entrepreneur so i'll show you how to  do that uh the next is you're gonna have a consulting firm without a consulting form you cannot be a  virtual assistant people have to be able   to speak to you they need to be able to book some  time from you we've shared with you the resources   that you need for a calendar management tool so  you're going to be able to set that up as well   and then you're going to need to think about  10 other properties i would actually say nine   other properties because your website is one to  be featured on so what are the other properties   of why are they 10 they're 10 because google  the chance the minute someone puts in your name these top 10 rankings these top 10 rankings  that show up over here they need to be   engineered they need to be engineered and  once you do engineer your rankings you can   even do your top 20 rankings as well and  i'll show you the importance of doing this   i'll show you the importance of doing this and  it's really really super simple to do this it's   a one-time activity when you engineer the top 10  rankings when you engineer the top 10 rankings   the chances of you closing the chances of you  converting your business from a lead to customer   in one simple word become easier because without a  shadow of a doubt people will google you and when   they start seeing videos when they start seeing  reviews when they start seeing testimonials then   automatically they want to do business with you  so we're going to talk about these things straight   away so the photo shoot a really simple way to do  that is to just identify influencers in this space take five angles and then use a background removal software i'll give you an example of how to do this  influencers you can just go to google i'm   sure you already know who your influencers are see  what pictures they have taken identify five angles   and get someone to shoot it it doesn't need to  be top class photography it just needs to be   done it needs to look professional it's as simple  as that once you've got that you can basically use   background removal software let me just give you  a quick example remove dot bg this is what i use and let's say we say we pick up this picture   this it's going to take a second and it's going to  work some magic i'll show you why this is really   i think a step that most business owners don't  think about so now they're allowing you to remove   video backgrounds as well which is awesome and  here you can see now they've given me an image   which is transparent i can take this one image  and place it anywhere so you take a photograph   it could be at your office it could be anywhere  and you simply put it on this background remover   and now on canva on any other platform this is  my current favorite which is called playset.net   i highly recommend this to anyone who's looking  at being a va for two reasons one you're going   to get some killer branding done for yourself  two this is going to directly tie in to customer   acquisition i'm going to show you a very  sneaky way on how to literally hypnotize your   customers or your potential customers to become  your customers without fail every single time   by using this one simple website so we've got two  missions to accomplish one mission is to build you   a killer profile and the second mission that we  have is to build you a customer getting strategy   it's twofold because one is you need to have this  in place and two is you need to have a strategy   that you can do every single day there are no  one-hit wonders over here it's every single day   it's going to be a standard process that you need  to tweak and it's going to definitely give you   projects money so that's what you're gonna get by  the end of today all right so here we've got uh   the software once you have these five  pictures taken you can use this website okay   and it's really simple that  you can basically build   some really cool branding material so in this  case say we found a potential customer we found   a potential customer let's go to google.com  and say somebody is selling pet products pet products in india   now we've got websites like pup cart we've  got websites like pets world and pause india   here you've got your google my business  listing so i'm going to open that up as well so say i am a current va and i want  to use a hypnotizing technique to   get customers and my niche or  my specialty something that   i'm passionate about is pets so say i want  to go ahead and pick up some pet business   i'd put in pet products in india and  i'll find this website like popcart.com and it looks like any other website so i'll  take their logo save the image over here and then i'll go back to branding and design placer i look  at packaging for this example and i'll take this bag over here take their logo so just create something like this of  course i'd spend maybe like 30 seconds more   in formatting it then i would download this and i'll have this logo created and with this  logo i'd probably uh put it into an email and   say surprise gift for popcart so in the chat if  you were pup cat would you open this email and   maybe reply back just type in yes or  no and yet and yet i can assure you   most vas most vas will have something  like this dear sir i want to be your va do you have any position available looking forward so this is 100 the  wrong way this is the most idiotic way   to do it in fact it should be slightly different  where you put in an introduction saying hey roger as any good virtual assistant i researched so basically you're going to be like hey  roger as any good virtual assistant i   researched your profile and i found you active on  linkedin youtube and your own blog i personally   loved your blog and wanted to reach out to  you and ask you if you'd be interested in   creating an image and posting an image that  inspired me about your blog post on popcart.com   insert the image and send it that's one really  simple example next is if you want to like amp   up your game you know if you want to do something  more different you could try something like this download and in the meantime so here it's opened   so an image like this you send it to the owner  of the company and they're gonna be like huh   that's pretty cool and then if you ask  them like can i send you five more sample   images and they're going to be like sure we  like this send us five more sample images and take another image one more  image take five of these images and then you say that hey and you keep the  conversation rolling you send one image two   images three images and then here you do  the same thing and then you call him freddy and do this again and you simply download it  in the meantime you can go to beth's world   here you've got freddy and you can write a  note saying that hey here's a picture of like a   really popular dog and i want to check whether we  could make him officially the mascot for popcart   and now they might like it or they might not  like it but they now are thinking that you are   thinking genuinely about their brand because you  are you are thinking about their brand you can   do this and if you don't want to do this uh you  want to move on to your next customer you can go   here put in the other logo that you've downloaded  pets world crop it put it in somewhere over here   change the logo download it and you will be good  to go at least to get there their attention now   since you know this now since you know this i  want you to go ahead and do a search like i said   this is a treasure hunt right so i'm going to give  you five minutes i'm gonna give you five minutes   to use placeit.net and come up with something  for your virtual assistant business it could be any of these categories it could be any of  these categories and all you need to do is find   one thing find one thing that you resonate with  you don't need to sign up you don't need to sign   up all you need to do for a treasure hunt right  now is to go and find one thing on playset.net   that you resonate with that you think will be  really cool for your brand and then post that   into the chat we'll take a look at it we'll see  whether you are on the right track and then we'll   see how you can integrate this into your brand so  that you can build a amazing profile which when   you do reach out to customers converts like crazy  so we're going to look at engineering your entire   va journey right from coming up with a unique  brand doing things differently reaching out to   customers that they're like wow that's that's  cool hey i look like these images can you do my   social media oh i like these images can you also  help me build a website do you know someone who   can do seo do you know someone who can do ppc  and you can see we've done an experiment with   two websites uh you can literally do  this for one hour at least in a day   reach out to five customers i'm gonna show you  how to reach out to customers this is how we   would send out proposals on other uh other  other platforms and marketplaces as well   so that is strategy number one  and if you do this for customers   you there then have like a very tangible product  you know you have a very tangible deliverable   thing that every week you know every week i  will generate four images or i will generate   five images or i'll generate 10 images or 20  images or 100 images depending on your customer   i'll customize it i'll put in your brand i'll  make sure that it's formatted for every single   platform whether it's facebook whether it is  youtube whether it's an instagram story i'll   do all the formatting that you need every single  month now you can pay me x amount for doing this   task all righty welcome back everyone hope you are  with us all right so this is va hack number one   and what we're going to do next is we're going to  show you how you can get a website set up you can   get a website set up for your va business in less  than 20 minutes so here you're going to find some   themes that are going to really help you stand  out so here you've got reverta personal assistant let's take a look at what we got over here view all demos so they've got different demos that   are enlisted main demo let's  take a look at the main demo so finally a virtual assistant i trust  to represent me and my business so here   you can see a photo shoot which is done using a  background remover so you can even exactly copy   this pose just have someone on an iphone  take iphone or any other phone take a   picture put in the background remover and  import it over here you can even use your   brand you can even use your brand which is created  on place it and you have one simple thing like   this it's going to put you light years ahead  of your competitors your logo your phone number   get started request a consulting remember that i  told you over here that the most important thing   that you need to have is a consulting form a  one-page website and a consulting form so you   can see that this template is very much in line to  a one-page website which will literally take you   uh 20 minutes to rewrite the content that's all  the content that's on the website these are the   services that you offer and here you can see they  exactly match the services that we shared with you   bright and early in the morning i'm going to  circle back around the video and why this is   perhaps the most important asset that you  need to build it's going to serve you both   on your website as well as an additional property  on the internet that you are gonna rank for   uh one testimonial can change your life uh three  five ten testimonials will definitely help you   some good statistics over here your process beautifully laid out packages   and contact details and a photo so type in  simple type in simple if you think that this   is a simple activity to go ahead and create  just one page create one page of content   you can literally do that in one hour you have  all this content you just need to literally   copy paste it does not get more simple than this  and you're going to be light years ahead of your   competitors and i really want you to envision i  really want to see you uh being over here getting   this done ranking for your own name with your own  website with your own testimonials it's absolutely   priceless when you get into phase two of your  business when you're doing consistent social   media and people are coming and checking out  a simple one-page website i can guarantee you   that you will start receiving inquiries  as soon as you get your properties set up   okay so this is a step number two is in finding a  theme and you can see there'll be multiple options   over here different colors different variations  you can pick your color so look unique to you   and you're going to be able to start standing  out so next is we need to talk about the nine   other properties we need to talk about the  nine other properties but before that we'll   talk about the entrepreneur.com yeah so  here is the secret ladies and gentlemen so how many of you would like to be an  author how many of you would like to be an   author on entrepreneur.com where  you can write your own articles all right so here is the secret resource that not  too many people share but since you said that i   like to share it is true i do like to share all  you need to do is type in entrepreneur leadership   network the entrepreneurship leader network  grow your personal brand by applying to   the entrepreneurship leadership network and  they give you an option where you can create   an article for free one article every 90 days  just open this up they've just opened this up   they're two options one is paid and one is free  the paid one is thousand dollars and the free   one is you can sign up for a free membership  that will give you the ability to publish   one piece of content every 90 days 90 days is  a lot of time so one article every three month   on entrepreneur.com for free i think that is an  amazing opportunity that they've recently opened   up i'm definitely going to be taking advantage  of this once again so there you go hopefully   this has been uh anyway worth your investment  so far but that is a resource that i wanted to   share with you now imagine when we are talking  about the next step which is the nine properties   here is how it's going to look like  one is you're going to have a killer   one-page website two is you're gonna  have a killer entrepreneur.com guest post   talking about your industry so if you're a  chatbot expert talk about chatbots if you're ova   talk about va's the next thing that i mentioned to  you is going to be a video you're going to have a   video which is going to be displayed over here  on your theme and we've already shared with you   a template a one minute template we'll do  that with you again for your video because   this video is then going to be uploaded to none  other than youtube and it's going to feature   an intro and it's going to feature an outro i'm  going to give you an example of this and that's   it it's going to get indexed by google so you're  going to have three rankings one's a killer one   page two is an entrepreneur three is a video  four i think all of you must already be having   uh linkedin which is super super simple the  next one is a killer hack this is i would think   more valuable than the entrepreneur.com hack and  that is simply by creating a profile so type in   drum rolls if you are interested to know  another resource that is going to help you   gain another top 10 position the drum rolls is  going to be on none other than instamojo.com instamojo.com has a humongous domain authority and i'll give you an example you can see insta mojo is ranking position  number two is ranking in position number two   higher than facebook higher than linkedin higher  than youtube higher than instagram higher than   inventiva and i'll give you another super insider  tip if you guys want if you want to get a story on   inventiva i have a resource because he did this  for me for free he told me to promote it but   it's really high ranking and a thousand views a  thousand organic views plus it ranks in google uh   they are currently selling a do follow backlink  for a mere sum of 3000 rupees so in ventiva   is definitely going to get you another ranking  so you can try for free you can try and hustle   your way but if you're just ready to get a very  good high authority rank you can pay 3000 rupees   to invent eva and they'll publish pretty much  whatever you want so that's another profile uh   for you so let me know if you find that insightful  type in insightful if you have figured out that   you can basically pay some money and dominate  the top 10 of your name which is really really   extremely important it's the biggest asset that  you have it's your name and it is your brand   so that is inventiva so one two three  four five six uh for more authority for   more authority you can always have  uh i'm gonna just rename this to youtube insta mojo and then we're going to look at  instagram and for instagram you can either create   a brand new profile for your business because  i'm going to talk to you how you can use your   instagram handle to jump into the customer  getting strategy which you're going to get in at   10 o'clock i'm going to show you how you can  leverage each and every one of these platforms   to start engineering yourself to get these  uh businesses got instagram and you cannot   not have facebook so on facebook you can have  your personal profile and you can have your page i'll give you a quick example so this they're going to show up my page first  so page is again free i guess on page two here's another simple hack i guess facebook is not showing up i mean  you just got the page so you get another   listing as well so your page just created  once and for all it's super simple to do   and then the next thing is you might at some point  want to use uh amazon to get a book published   and it's really simple to get that done  and you can get some reviews over there   so that way you are totally protected you know  you're totally protected with your authority you can even just hire someone on fiverr to do  this for you just pay like hundred dollars and   they'll publish a book for you either  do it yourself or you can hire someone   uh to do it for you so with insta  mojo you just have to create a profile so you just create a profile and you can create  a store if you want put up your information over   here and this way you're getting a backlink  to your website as well on your profile so all you need to do is just create  like whatever products you're selling   it could be your va products or whether you're  selling gigs or whatever you're selling you can   put it up over here and you get a top 10 ranking  so type in top 10 type in top 10 if you see   how you can engineer how you can really engineer  your results pretty simply and this way you are   protected by none other than the google god  so when people search for you and this is   a tactic that i often use is i tell people that  hey obviously i'm going to tell you that i'm great   at what i do but i don't want to do that i want  you to go to google and see what you think so   they're going to go to google and the first thing  that they'll see is reviews and it's just human   nature right it's just human nature to go and see  reviews and after they've read like five reviews   after they read 10 reviews they are totally  primed right they're totally primed to being like   okay i trust this guy there's no way that  they're going to be so many people saying   good stuff if it wasn't good right so that  is a very good tactic that you can use as a   va so when you're structuring your message uh you  need to be able to call out stuff like saying that   hey you know you probably get a lot of emails  like this and it's impossible for me to let you   know what i do why don't you go ahead and google  me here's my linkedin profile here's my youtube   profile here's my video so that way you are just  jumping ahead you're not playing the same game   you're not playing the same game as va's from the  philippines you're not playing the same game as   va's from bangladesh from pakistan because that's  what they're doing right now they're going sending   an email and that still converts right that  still converts because vas are so in demand but   the minute you start acting like a business owner  the minute you go with authority the minute you go   with engineered results right you go with engineer  results your chances of converting into business   are quadruple so that's what we're going to be  talking about is converting business how do you   lead a customer into a sale and basically by doing  all of the above that we spent about 15 minutes in   going over you're simply going to make it easier  not just for yourself but also for your customers   to be able to become successful online so quick  recap get your branding done get your website done   get your photo shoot done engineer your results  and you should be good to go all right so what   we're going to do is we're going to spend the next  one hour and going through a systematic strategy   on how you can go ahead and get customers on  demand from your house as a virtual assistant   using a couple of techniques all you need is one customer acquisition strategy so let's go  ahead so step number one is you need to   feel confident in being well represented  which basically means you need to take   the information that we have given you in the  last one hour and have a top 10 perfect score okay because once you have a top 10 perfect score  you are going to be in a better position number   two is you need to figure out your niche who are  you going to go after which customer are you going   to pick up if you are say brand new if you are  brand new my advice my advice is to pick up a   customer it does not matter about their business  it matters about the vibe that you get with them   it needs to be someone who you feel that you can  work with this is critical it needs to be someone   who has committed to you they trust you they trust  you and is going to give you a review that's going   to turbo charge you in order to get started all  you really need is three authentic genuine reviews   and you'll be sorted as a va it's as simple  as that so you find your niche initially by   working with anyone who requires any of these  services right we shared with you a list over here   we shared with you a list over here you  can offer any one of these services and get   a review whether it's seo ranking and it can be as  simple as going and running a ranking report for a   potential customer and saying that hey here's this  report if you found value go ahead and leave a   review for me if you provide them with a checklist  you can give them a checklist and saying that hey   i've prepared this checklist for your website it's  a custom checklist you're really looking at trying   to add as much value as you possibly can right  you want to add as much value as you possibly can   and collect a simple review this is going to be  your initial steps right this is going to be your   initial steps once you're done you're done right  so you want to have your perfect reviews over here   and then you want to go into your niche so your  niche can be i'm a general va that means i can do   any one of these tasks you're trained you can  do all and you have this sheet right so you can   just copy paste any one of these any two of these  all of these none of these you know these are not   all the va tasks there are so many other things  that you could do i'm going to leave that up   to you but essentially offering remote virtual  services remote services virtual services where   you do something from your computer for your  potential customer so you pick up one of these   industries you pick up one of these niches and you  can think about becoming a general va you can look   at becoming a video va so if you got video editing  capabilities there is a ton of money in video   editing a general va you can become a wordpress va  oops wordpress va where you're helping them with   getting their website setups and whatever else  needs to be done you can become a social media va   you could become any so you pick up any one of  these categories and then you need to pick up and then you need to pick up one of these other  niches i'll share that so here's a link for your   reference and what you need to do is get your  niche set up so whether they're going to do   general or video you just pick one of them for  right now the next thing is you need to find an   audience so for your audience you need to identify  who is your audience are they pet stores and this   can change this can change weekly but i recommend  that you try with one niche at least for one   week so you can do pets you can do schools like  nurseries you can look at any upcoming industries   like restaurants you can look at coaches you can  see anybody who's doing well they can be your   potential customer use google google is a great  way to find industries and what you need to do is   basically go ahead and get your audience identify  your audience the next is your branding proposals where you look at some easy way you  look at a easy way to grab attention we spoke about you know creating  custom images and graphics like that   grab attention either by video video always  works or images or send them a proposal   if you want to send an amazing proposal  something that we always swear by is proposify so let's take a look at proposify real  quick and look at their templates over here   all the way at the bottom look at the marketing find one template from here depending on your  industry whether it's e-commerce whether it's   graphic whether it's marketing pr seo  social media so you'll definitely find   something that's relevant to your uh industry  that you want to specialize in as a va   click on preview template sign up for free  put in your brand put in your information   again one time effort you fill up your information  over here put in your customers name here of   course you can see the branding is already  done towards social media it's talking about   all the services that you'll offer to them  your monthly time frame your investment   why us you need a website and you need a brochure  you need a website and you need a brochure because   once you have a brochure like this you can use it  you need to have a website as well as a brochure   this again will maybe take you three hours  to go through but it's a one-time activity   and this is what i was referring to earlier about  being professional versus being an amateur which   who will get taken for a ride so you customize  this one time you put in your customers name and   you should be able to send this out within  the first one hour after your consulting   call now where you actually reach out to these  people you've got everything set up now you need   to identify your platforms you need to identify  your platforms let's call these free platforms   free money platforms the free money platforms  we'll start with linkedin as our favorite   and we go to linkedin and we write down we've got  these niches over here pets schools restaurants   coaches let's do restaurants i've never ever  actually looked for restaurants but let's take   a look for restaurants over here and we'll take  a look at some direct marketing so we look at   rohan joshi over here indulgence restaurants he's  a member of rotary club as well so that's going to   give me some commonality commonality because my  father was a rotary member and my father is not   a rotary member i'm sure everybody knows some  rotary member so it's a good way to build some   rapper and i'll see if i know anybody else i do  have a common friend and most cases in most cases   if you are going city wise you will have a common  friend now he's a really good friend of mine so i   might take advantage of that as well but imagine  i didn't know anyone else in this industry we're   going to look at how we can use linkedin uh to  connect with someone who we are not connected with   from start to finish and see whether we can  put out some date without some bait so that   he will take a bite so we'll take a look  at his profile rohan joshi founder and   managing director indulgence restaurants this  is the stuff that he is currently looking at   so holding company of krusty is a casual  dining bistro chain pune sewing modern european   cuisine superb so let's take a look  at if i can find anything about this company cadbury india as well insead now here's  something that's very interesting that you could   also use and you really need to think out of  the box right you need to find out how you can   make a one-on-one connection on the social web  i don't know him he doesn't know me but with the   things in common uh whether it's a friend whether  it's a group so you've got connections over here   you've got his experience here now insead is a  business school and i know someone who's gone to   ncr so i can definitely use a connection there as  well to just build a quick reputation with rohan see he's following harvard business school  fmcg in india he's an entrepreneur for sure   so let's look at indulgence restaurant all right so you've got now some more  information that he has a co-founder   called vidya joshi and he's got atheism  manager deputy general manager of hotel kamal   she's a area manager so now i know that  indulgence restaurants also does own hotel   kamal so this is getting pretty interesting  so he's a chef so mangesh is a chef as well   so it's definitely a company that i would want to  learn a little more about so then i'll take this   i'll put it into google i'll find out that they've  got a registered company and here they're also on   zumato this is all the information that i need to  be able to figure out everything about indulgence   vidya joshi again linkedin  economic times they've got listed   and this is really good to  know that they are hiring   they do have some reviews they'd have only  one review over here or this might not be it so let's go ahead take a look at indulgence now  we know that they're a bakery restaurant they're   a bakery restaurant they specialize in walnut  cream cake they're located in korea park they   are on zumato they open in 19 minutes let's take  a look at their reviews positive pictures of their   caramel cake cheesecake yummy yummy yummy little  gem in korea park some more images over here   so this is going to load me  up with a lot of ammunition because as you can guess what i'm going to do next   is i'm going to save this image  i'm going to go back to place it and i'll take a look at their reviews as well snapshot it till here go back to let's try my luck here i see that they don't have a logo  anywhere there's no logo for indulgence restaurant dessert paolo so i'll go ahead and create  something for them really quick all right so now i've got  something more that i can work with got this image over here as well so  this is their logo as you can see   that there's nothing fancy over here so go  back to place it change this to indulgence the best cheesecakes download go back over here to my linkedin  profile with rowan connect with him   add a note look at the reviews  over here see the best reviews go back to my message over here truly a hidden gem in kp have created a logo from my  inspiration after eating at indulgence send now when he does accept my message i'll   simply send a message saying hey awesome place  attached is this logo for you i'll probably   spend a little more time or find something  in the bakery space that looks really good yeah probably something like this cheesecakes   send that over to him less than five minutes of  work less than five minutes of work and you should have a better chance so type in bc   for better chance if you think that you will stand  a better chance in actually connecting with a business owner so that is linkedin for you that  is linkedin it's super simple and as you can   imagine this is like literally a rinse and repeat  cycle you can have someone doing this for you   24x7 let's switch over to instagram over here and the trick the trick over here is your  conversions will be higher because you're creating   something custom you are creating something that  is of value uh you're not spamming them it's the   opposite of spamming them you spent like so much  time in creating logos and stuff for them and you   build a good relationship uh with them using the  internet so that is a linkedin for you so we've   taken a look at linkedin just type in li type in  li if you are clear with how you can use linkedin   every single day you can use linkedin every single  day to potentially get new customers if you reach   out to five new potentials each week that's 150 in  a month i guarantee you uh you will get 10 people   who convert 10 customers in a month by simply  spending like 10 minutes on linkedin it's very   doable so we'll jump into another platform  which is called instagram let's take a look   at instagram over here and we'll say we're going  after uh coaches let's talk about digital coaches we just hashtag a digital coach over here and let's see what comes up the 20 000  posts for the keyword digital coach   all right look at who we've got at  position number one today uh let's look at jenny we look at jenny and see how jenny  is doing jenny's a confidence coach   i help women embody confidence and bravery  in health career and relationships founder at   movement founder at varys soul cycle and a website so fitness fun loving beach yoga hiking fitness training confidence teamwork  scuba diving all right so it looks interesting   movement is empowering girls and women to build   confidence and self-worth through  exercise so fitness amazing various you can see it's a verified  profile just 68 posts so definitely   an influencer in the space and my idea is to go  after influencers coaches and stuff soul cycle again another verified profile  take your journey move your body   join the movement amazing and the  website bravebabe.com jenny gaither one-on-one coaching  testimonials about press contact   my brave digital coaching platform and community  helps women embody confidence and bravery in their   health career and relationships amazing   so you can see that she already has a lot of this  stuff and she's featured on pop sugar entrepreneur   all these different platforms so i've got enough  research to do so jenny is our potential customer sole cycle instructor entrepreneur 10 incredible  non-profits and the women behind them all right so now i've spent  about three to four minutes   in researching jenny and i'm  going to make a note for jenny and it'll be pretty simple let's go ahead and type in b-i-o if you're  ready to see how we can craft a proposal   to jenny in a matter of minutes and how many of  you think that if you were to get a customer like   jenny if you were to be a virtual assistant like  jenny it would be like a great customer for you   it'll help your brand and really the sky is the  limit right so in the first example we looked   at direct marketing in the second example we're  going to look at influencer marketing right we're   going to look at influencer marketing so for this  i am going to use my secret weapon which is ecam where did my ecam go he can there is my secret weapon all right there we are  so right now i'm currently broadcasting to are   using ecam and as you can see over here i've got  my green screen which is putting in this effect   but i'm going to leave this effect on because  it definitely looks a lot better than my green   screen so what i'm going to do is i'm going to  start sharing screens over here let's see record let's hit record let me take a give  me one minute give me one minute   actually give me two minutes uh we'll meet back  at 10 26 just gonna get a quick refill and then   we are going to pitch to jenny and see whether  jenny is going to be willing to work with us   what we're going to do now  is we are going to start   pitching to jenny who is an influencer  before i start pitching i'm just going   to make sure that i have a few notes i think  the first word that i remember from jenny was   women empowerment fitness she's an entrepreneur  she's verified on all the social platforms instagram i haven't yet googled her but i probably  would before i start so let's go ahead and keep that open as well uh here we have jenny uh jenny's an  influencer and we want to reach out to her   we found jenny by going to instagram and i put in the keyword digital  coach into hashtags over here she's showing up and this would  be a great way to start as well put this straight up shut what's  not required and i am now ready   so let's go ahead make a video for jenny in three  two one it's 10 30 a.m let's go hey jenny my name   is gaurav gurbaksani and all i can say is wow i'm  so inspired by you and i actually found you by   searching on instagram for the keyword digital  coach and i saw this picture here and i couldn't   resist to figure out a little bit more about you  just a little bit of a background this guy here   is me and i was actually looking for digital coach  and i saw you pop up on instagram right now today   so i want to take a second to reach out to you and  just first let you know how inspired uh i've been   and also let you know that i've been a professor  at the swims institute it's a women's only college   and i totally support your course of women  empowerment so i donate a couple of hours   each year at this college teaching women how to be  entrepreneurs so while going through your profile   uh is completely inspired to see that you've  got so many things going on especially with uh   movement and i wanted to just let you know that  we do have a provision that we work specifically   with women coaches and we support the entire  ecosystem now i can tell that you're a super   crazy fitness coach you've got different channels  that are going on so i can imagine that you are   extremely busy and your life is on digital so  what i propose is that you send me maybe one or   two videos of yours completely uncut and i want my  va team to work some magic for you absolutely at   no cost to you right now i just want to show  you how we can help take your current brand   and take it to the next level so if you could  send me a youtube link if you could send me   a dropbox file anything that you could which  is not edited i'll probably leave a couple of   samples uh with this video to show you who we've  helped who we work with and just a quick shout out   to let you know that super inspired about what  you're doing just kind of one form and build a   relationship with you have an awesome day jenny  and i look forward to talking to you on instagram   and hit finish end recording two minutes  show file uh take this upload it to youtube upload and you know here in the background she's  going to see that they have looked at   all across these platforms and  stuff like that but one minute left and then i'd simply wait  for this to upload and send   a message i'm already following her let  me start following her send a message saying hey jenny i hope my message does not get  trapped in the other folder i prepared a two minute video two minute video on how you can  outsource some of your video editing as you are a digital coach if i don't hear back i'll try to reach out to you on linkedin linkedin  with a quick two-minute video introduction and send and let's go to youtube over here upload is done the processing the video i'll wait for this video to get processed and i'll keep an eye out whether jenny sees this i'll wait for some time i don't want to act too  crazy as well you know messaging all across but   there's a chance there's maybe like a 20 30 chance  that she does respond and i do send my video you can dm the full video file  yep that would probably do yeah that's a good idea just probably compress  it format it maybe put an intro and outro and   that is how you can spend less than five minutes  in reaching out to possibly a mega mega mega   influencer either on instagram on facebook  or through her website like i know for sure   if i send an email to this address uh there's  a very very good chance that she will read it   and i'll also see that she's on squarespace and  squarespace is a little inferior to wordpress   like in terms of functionality in terms of  members area in terms of what coaches really   want so there's a very good chance that i could  upsell her a website as well as some va tasks so type in i g h i g h instagram hack if you think  that this could be a good hack that   you can use to get customers  less than two minutes a day   you send out messages like this uh  there's a good chance they're like okay we can help you with that so that's been recorded  it's been uploaded and then i'm pretty much done   for the day sent out one proposal to someone in  pune sent one proposal to someone in new york and   i could pretty much do this all day long because  they're like 20 000 hashtags for digital coach   this is direct marketing ladies and gentlemen it's  like that simple and people are willing to spend   so much money on facebook and they think that  facebook is the only option to get traction   it's not really the only option uh this way i'm  way happier to spend like two minutes of my time   potentially getting a ten thousand  dollar or twenty thousand dollar or   even a hundred thousand dollar a year customer  think about all the things that we can offer   her right from messenger bots to analytics  to jingles to intros to outros like there's   a plethora of stuff so all she needs to do is  bite saying that huh okay sounds interesting   go all out uh build a funnel do whatever  you need to and then get one customer   and move on do you think if jenny six months down  the line was to recommend you or to refer you has done an awesome job in my video  editing you should try him out   do you think that my business can  sky rocket with that one testimonial all right so that is digital marketing  that is digital marketing using   instagram and the same process moves on  for every single thing that you need to do what do we have here next so this is kind of  a two in one this is a kind of two in one uh   where you're looking at direct marketing using  instagram using linkedin plus this is influencer   marketing like given a choice would you work with  someone who is experienced someone who is famous   someone who will pay you well or will you work  with someone who has no experience has no money   and will probably complain so customer selection  is a strategy you need to have the right strategy   to attract the right customers and if you  follow through with a plan the more people like   jenny you help the more people like jenny you  will get as customers because she'll recommend   you to her friends her friends will recommend you  to her friends and that's how word of mouth with a   simple hashtag with a simple hashtag on instagram  can lead to a lifetime worth of earnings we see   that in the past the major customers that we have  today they're all influencers and it's all started   with a complete cold outreach email if we have  time today i want to play you a five minute clip   to just show you how one video completely changed  my life and that one thing led to another and the   one thing led to another and i truly hope that  with this information that i've shared with you   you take action because there is no stone  left unturned you know what's in demand   you know how to reach customers you have a  community of people who are able to support   you you already have some interest you already  have some skill set so now it is definitely time   to shine you can use this on pinterest you can  use this on quora you can use this on any platform   any social platform any social platform anything  that allows two-way uh communication so this needs   to be your copy paste message and i can literally  go ahead and copy paste this to 20 000 other   people on instagram i can look at their profile  i can see whether i can do something for them and then use influencers to promote your product  you know use influencers like jenny use anybody   who's got a little bit of clout  anybody who the market looks up to   do work for them is going to game  change your entire va trajectory   and finally uh something that's really  important uh as good as placer.net but this is   where i would recommend you go if you really  want to win customers on autopilot so video hives hey guys hey guys all right so what we're going to do  is we are going to take a look at   how we can simply use a template like this and all we all we need to do is edit it   with like something with hey jenny  let me go back to jenny's example put in her brand name as well her logo  stuff it's going to be customized so   maybe her picture her logo is over  here because when you send a video   like this the chances are that  you're gonna get a higher conversion so we'd have some background music playing her logos and then it'll start like uh hey jenny  my name is gaurav bhakshani and i'm so happy to   be here with my team and we all took a look  at your instagram profile and all i can say   is that i think we can add massive value as a  team here to your entrepreneur journey see we   work as a remote team and what we do is we  measure every single metric on your social   media to make sure that everything is compatible  what we want you to have is a team of virtual   assistants that you have on

team  on standby we're always excited to work with you   and like i said we can help you not only  with videos we also notice that you've got a   website uh that needs to be built on wordpress  so for your membership stuff we want you to   focus on your training and outsource the  rest to us simply by picking up your phone   doing a facetime call what's up call whatever  works for you we want it to be completely easy   here are the five tasks that my team members  can help you with if you're interested in   having a team like this work with you as a virtual  remote team feel free to send back a message to me so what do you guys think do you think that  you would get a response back from jenny   if you're to send a message like this you just  need to come to theme forest pick up a template   look at it once see what you need to say  download it and uh the wolf away the wolf of va   like that and then just send it to them and  you are done the chance of you getting the job   in less than one minute have now gone up by  a thousand fold what we're going to do next   is we are going to take we're going to  take some questions i saw some questions   coming in and then we will wrap up for the day you  know just to recap we started today's morning with   all the things that you need to do that you can  do as a va there's like an infinite list then   we took a break we got to hear from some of our  members what they're doing what their successes   have been and uh then 9 a.m we started to  get your profile ready you know your top 10   things that you need to get done set  up your profiles here google friendly   10 am we looked at how to use instagram how to  use linkedin how to use b-rolls for influencers   you start sending this out the chances of you  being a successful va are a hundred percent doable uh please explain about pricing strategies sure  we'll take the pricing strategy uh we'll spend a   couple of minutes on uh what your pricing strategy  can be and this really does vary upon where   you are getting in so your pricing strategy  so there are two ways that you can price your   the three ways actually one is  you can figure out how much money you want to earn each month so we took an example last time that's  saying you want to earn one lakh a month then you have to basically charge approximately  then you have to earn 3 330 rupees a day   and if you were to break that up into us dollars  it would be five dollars and 55 cents per hour   if you are looking at working eight hours a  day so if you have a va gig that's paying you   55 cents an hour and you're working  eight hours a day for uh 30 days   then you will make one lakh a month so that's  one strategy that you can follow where you have   an hourly rate now the other strategy that  you can follow is where you have a gig rate so this is your alverly judge now your gig rate is  basically how much you're charging for a specific   gig it doesn't matter how much time it takes  so a typical gig is structured into your free   into your trip buyer into your core product into  your maximizer and into your return path this is   for your pricing so free is free you can give  them away something like a proposal or an audit or an image like we've seen and then you get  them into your trip wire your trip i o i would   think should be about 5 000 rupees to begin  with something pretty low ticket this could be   offering them social media or it could be setting  up some templates or it could be editing a video this is how you can sequence your  funnel something free then 5000   then you offer your core product this  could be maybe setting up their email   autoresponder it could be setting up their  website doing something one time for them and then your maybe you have some consulting  you become a virtual chief marketing officer where you're consulting with them month on  month and then you can sell them a retainer so the core offer typically we  like to sell at about 20 000 rupees the maximizer at about 1 lakh 20 000  rupees this is where you're offering them   lots of stuff like a website videos social  media for a month like a starter package   and then a retainer of maybe 50 000 rupees again  depending on what you're doing whether it is   a certain number of video edits if it's  wordpress maintenance if it's social media   posting if it's emails if it's lead generation  that's typically how we structure our pricing   now the third way to do it is  called the value-based pricing this is where it can get interesting and  value-based pricings are typically for   businesses that already are successful they're  already successful and say they have a website   but they're not doing paid ads value-based  pricing could be where you tell them that   hey i will invest in paid ads i will  drive leads and you give me a commission   for every single lead that i drive and it could  be anywhere between five percent to typically 20   in service businesses and even up to 50 in  affiliate businesses so these are the three types   of pricing that you can start with personally i  prefer gigs over hours but there's always a need   and a place for both so you have good quality gigs  you have good you have a fixed hourly rate or you   can charge people based on the value you foresee  so where you take the risk and say i will do this   for you and you pay me based on a commission i  also recommend you do some competition research we do some compression research which should be on  fiverr which should be local so you can ask people   to send you proposals check out upwork have your  competition because at the end of the day why will   someone choose you if your competitor is providing  exactly the same thing at a lower priced option so   you have to be competitive plus you can use  a common combination of any of these topics so type in make sense if that's a  little clear on your pricing strategy boom hey congratulations for watching
