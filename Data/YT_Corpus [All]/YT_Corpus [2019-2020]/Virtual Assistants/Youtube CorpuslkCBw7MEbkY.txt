 when you start to step into the realm of getting help hiring assistants help hiring um whatever when you start to get into the realm of hiring virtual assistants admin assistants bookkeepers other people that can support you and your business we've been talking a lot about this in our learning community you can burden them in a surprising way in a way that just doesn't work this is mark silver with heart of business and i want to talk to you a little bit about owning your role as leader of the business which can be a little challenging for some folks so many heart-centered entrepreneurs and solos our value for collaboration for inclusion can be really high and it's it's beautiful you know of course we'd want people to feel included and we want people to feel like they belong and that they're part of it and they have a say and they have you know empowerment and all of these things and and it doesn't always work it doesn't always work and what's really sometimes going on is that you may have an unmet need for collaboration that you actually need some support from a peer from a coach from from an expert from somebody who can really help you hone your vision and lead where you want to go your assistants the people who are assisting you may not be the best folks for that let me give you an example we have people on the heart of business team who are running their own business they work for us part-time and they're delighted to work for us they're doing great work they're also loving their own business it's a great win-win um for us and they don't want to run our business they don't want to run our business they don't want to make the leadership choices they're already doing that in their own life they have a part-time job with us for a reason because they want a part-time job i'm not paying them enough to run the business to bear the weight of the big decisions to be obsessing or worrying about or being concerned about or thinking about what it takes and where we want to go and the big picture now they want to be included they want to hear what the plans are they want to they want to understand the context they don't want to just push buttons and pull levers you know unconnected to all of that but they don't want to do that if you have a virtual assistant if you have folks that are supporting you in your business they probably don't want to be burdened with running the business and what you think of as collaboration or empowerment is actually probably potentially a form of abandonment where you're abandoning your role as owner and leader of your business and then unfairly burdening them with what you are abandoning just let that sink in it's not that you don't have a legitimate need for support like i said before but you may be putting it in the wrong place empowerment has a lot to do with consent and when someone works for you there's going to be a power differential there and they may not be able to tell you they may not feel like they can express it easily they may not even be conscious of it but i want you to be conscious of it i want you to own your sovereignty i want you to get your arms around your business and lead it and that if you need support in leading it because you need a sounding board you need someone to bounce ideas off of you need someone to get some support to work through it that you find that as a separate need i hope this has been helpful and i hope it makes your interactions with people who are assisting you much less fraud and go much more smoothly so often they just want to know what do you want me to do for you i want to help you i'm here to support you i'm happy to do this work but you have to tell me what to do yeah let that sink in we're all handling so much we're all making so many decisions all the time i know that i'm in running my life i'm constantly making decisions about my kids i'm constantly making decisions about the household i'm constantly making decisions about all of these things if i were to for instance volunteer with an organization or i was you know doing some other work i just want them to tell me what to do i don't want to make any more choices at that level really let that sink in that it's okay to be the boss that it's okay to be the owner that it's okay to set the vision and it's okay with kindness and with context and with care to accept that help and to give them the direction they need all right hope this has been helpful i'd love to hear what happens for you what rises up in your heart around it and i'm excited to see your business fly and for you to really get the help that you do need to make it fly blessings and blessings and peace on you and your business
