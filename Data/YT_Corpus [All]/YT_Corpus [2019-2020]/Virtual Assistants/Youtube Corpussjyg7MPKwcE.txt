 you guys know there's a lot more people that come so we'll start adding them in but uh we'll get started in about a minute good morning what's up hunter how's it going dude good how are you good man good cool so we'll get started right now normally about 20 people that come um maybe it's a bit early but we'll get started so today we're gonna go over like um knowing your margins is the most important thing especially if you want to start scaling up exponentially um so and then ask me some questions during the way there's not a lot so it makes it easy we can kind of go like tailor this to each person now it makes a lot easier cool um so the biggest thing in terms of like how you want to grow um you want to know what your purchase price is right so it basically goes down to money and money outs and then money outs right um on this money in money out concepts right so you want to know your roi um also your turnover these are probably the two biggest numbers that you want to know with this information you can then raise debt or you can get debt and you can see how fast your items are turning so personally for me right let's say let's say i'm spending 10k my roi is 35 and my turnover is 47 days right and if your turnovers under 60 days you can do a lot of um financing options that are really uh useful i guess you could say some of those useful options is credit card credit card um also you want to be buying on credit card too um because you get your points and all that stuff um credit card you can get a paypal alone there's other ones that paypal are looking at about a 10 to 15 percent interest rate actually credit cards you have about 60 days to pay them off give or take um so if you know these two options um on the bottom on terms of purchase price roi and turnover you can start scaling exponentially a lot quicker so on um on that top end too so kind of go through like how to scale and know your numbers on top of that so obviously if you're sourcing sourcing you have um listing across this thing across this thing um and what's called shipping um so the one thing you need to have up front um this is great if you do liquidation so liquidation is probably the easiest way to scale because you can buy bulk right so you need a lot of processing power up front um on this side so with the sourcing side let's say you're doing liquidation i know that's what you are doing hunters that makes it easy when you go from that um so what i would do on liquidation i've been looking at this kind of um deeply as well uh take a purchase price the more obvious more money you put in the more money you'll get out the biggest problem about liquidation in general is you don't know your return on investment beforehand with that um it makes it a lot harder to to deal um with uh the scale right so what i would do if it was me i would i would buy um uh buy pallets um from a distributor make sure you know that return on investment from that distributor and you can start scaling up pretty quickly so if if the numbers are correct every ten thousand dollars that you put in you're getting a 35 return on investment um that makes it what uh 3 500 bucks and it's the season scale right so there's a couple ways you can do this the problem is the biggest bottom neck is obviously the listing and shipping part but if you get it down it makes it a lot easier to move really quickly um so then it becomes just a lot easier money and money out so the whole concept to really scale is just knowing money in and then money out this makes it super super simple to really kind of pick it up and process a lot of power and you just have that middle processing in between so on that liquidation side again i would pick these big liquidation pallets up obviously the higher dollar amount you put in the more money you're going to get out on average and then you're looking for a higher margin if you're looking the biggest problem about it this is going to happen is when you're in when you are in a buying situation i kind of go over i know it's on an email like i picked about 400 000 with the product and i put zero money down on it so there's a couple ways to finance that kind of stuff um you can help hit that scale but in terms of reselling especially if you start really pumping a lot of product through um producing the system so let's say you have your money you have in in your and let's call your bank account money right they have in your bank account um this money whenever you are a reseller you're actually paying you're actually paying dollars right up front unless you get a 30 day or 60 day note on it for the inventory um you're paying money out front so your sales this is how um all resellers even myself like when i want to ebay amazon arbitrage my money goes down my sales go up right so this is the biggest um i would say problem but this is the biggest like a hurdle in reselling once you get your whole back end figured out in terms of your listing your processing your shipping and when you can start hitting scale this is your biggest problem every time um in terms of number wise so the more money you put in the more money you're really spending right um the higher your sales are but then you have to either replace this money or or finagle it some way to really start gathering a lot of cash again this is me getting a loan using credit cards um one thing about credit cards you can get really sketchy if you do not know your turnover and if it slows down or you get banned um so then you are on the hook for that right so it gets it starts getting really um hard to move a lot of weight because if you're using credit cards it can get sketchy so like my company last year i'll kind of give an example we had um so we did 1.7 in 12 months so with that um it made it really hard to scale so we had the back-end processing done correctly but um obviously um the money became a problem so like pushing that much scale that quickly with that big of a with that big of a ramp up in terms of money in terms of sales the cash went down really fast so we had about 200 thousand dollars of debts um and then i only only recommend taking that out if you know your margins you know how fast you can turn over product and you know you can take it on if you can't do that do not take on debt do not use credit cards makes it super super sketchy if you do not know how fast your turnover is and that margin so let's say i had that 200 thousand dollars of debt last year i'll take that and then i had 1.7 1.7 in sales so with this like um we had a 47 day turnaround so i know my turnaround is fast enough i can use credit cards and i was making enough margin i could use credit cards right so this was a mixture of credit cards we had about a hundred and twenty thousand dollars of credit card debt last year and about eighty thousand dollars of loan debt um on the loan debt we took out paypal loans makes it um a lot easier um and it was about a ten we average about a 10 or 11 um interest rate on that on that paypal now paypal does it they give you upfront um and then they take it out each month in turning the interest and the principal um so there's another way you can finagle that if you get a balloon payment or you know family friends that are more happy to do balloon payments but so last year oh did that 200k ever we had like we were running at like about uh like uh i usually had like a thousand bucks right a thousand dollars in my bank account and then our sales were continuously climbing we would just reinvest we invest invest take no profit out and that's how we hit that scale but like i was talking about before with that dollar amount it just drops super fast the more you have sales so there's ways to do that um again take out credit card debts or loans or you can even do what i did um last week is when we do this kind of stuff we can also do it on consignment so the background about last week is i pulled out about four hundred thousand dollars of high-end electronics um from uh my past company so i used to run a downsizing estate company if you all want to use this model you're more than welcome to uh with um so basically this is kind of our our rates um this is how we run a uh downsize in a state company again i don't do downsides to their states anymore they're just kind of they're they're hard to scale so now we kind of tailored it to high-end um super high-end luxury items so i can see this is the way how i run consignment in terms of this way and this actually solves for that problem of having too many um not enough money in super high scale so at that 400 000 mark um uh we we're probably gonna make 120-150 k um net after all just from the consignment so it's a great way to really really build up cash is do these kind of weird financing options or or payment options to then help grow your business um a lot quicker there's there's there's a couple different ways to do it again if you are buying liquidation there's no one that's going to give you a 30 or 60 day unless you're buying a lot um like you're buying thousands and thousands of dollars um to pay up front but there's just different options to how to really work this cool we also have a small group today so i can answer any questions if you want to go over your business model in general this is the perfect time to ask as well so we only have about five people no he's about 20 or 30. kind of bumped up the time so that's probably why cool if not i'll just go through i'll just keep going through cool you can always put it in chat too if you have any questions awesome i'll make this one a bit shorter today as well by about 30 minutes um just so we can push through as much as possible can um does anyone anybody know their margins um on the top of their head on how much they are making in terms of on average for their products and then we can kind of figure out how we can scale that and what's the best way to scale that again you can put in chat speaking speaking here as well if not i'll kind of go through how i'm scaling um or how um we're looking to help other people scale too cool um so what we're doing next like the next steps to help scale uh we're doing a few things well i'm trying to figure out what the all these bottlenecks are happening with people so again if you have any questions bottlenecks so we're kind of figuring out obviously a listing part is a big bottleneck right um we have the customer service customer service is a pain and shipping is is hard so our next goal is to solve for all these problems or all these bottom necks also sourcing a lot of people are having a trouble really sourcing good products um and right now we've had a couple feelers on the market a lot of the liquidation because of kovid um it's it's tough right because not a lot of activities going on in terms of retail um so all like the big retail stores um all the big retail stores are having a lot of problems getting good inventory it's obviously supply and demand you're seeing this in the car market as well um right now there's not a lot of supply so the demand is going up so the margins are the margins are decreasing um in terms of numbers as well this is what normally happened this always happens right so in terms of um when when there's some when the supply and demand right when supply supply and then demand um you're not gonna really ever find a vacuum you might find a vacuum here and there um and we'll kind of go over that so supply and demand obviously the higher the lower the supply the more the demand is going up so that's obviously increase in price um and then we go from there for me listing is the issue fallout perfect um so we're listening is it what what are you listening you're listening close i believe correct no can you hear me yep i can hear you sorry okay so no actually vintage um hard goods mostly and uh toys vintage toys and mostly vintage toys okay so i have a pretty high um asp actually right now it's over a hundred dollars since i started a little over a year ago um where of course when you start you don't know as much it's still at 72 dollars if i you know divide my total sales by my total transactions so um yeah which is great because i have a pretty small store actually it's only only 399 items right now um so my issue is um being able to list faster and i did sign up for your for hammock of course which is why i'm on here but we've had some struggles with getting that going um it's with the ebay i guess there's an issue so it's been several weeks and we haven't been able to make any progress um but for me it's a little tough because i didn't realize when i signed up that um you're more limited to close and electronics so it's uh it's hard to find a way to list kind of different you know it's it's almost different each time so i'm trying to find a way to say just do a particular type of product like vintage barbies in the box and have say you guys do that or vintage games and puzzles because you can read right on the box what it is it makes it a lot easier um so but like i said my problem is just getting it listed i have i do have a death pile which is awesome um and like i said i have a really good asp but getting it up there is is my issue 100 so what our team can do is anything that has a brand and a model is going to be the easiest way to do it so like the problem is give me the vintage like vintage thing that there is no brand for our team doesn't know what it is right unless you want to add in the brand so what i would do um if you really want to speed it up is i would even give us like uh parameters right so if you know the brand of it let's say um if you know the brand of it or even like the model base of it so it makes it easy then we can go search and then find a similar cop um that's the easiest way for us to do these kind of items but like i said right so we need the easiest way for us is we have a brand or model that we can then go and and figure and then we can go down and research that kind of stuff so that's the way we can do these non-clothing not electronic um non-puzzle items we just need some extra information and our team can do those still okay well that's why i'm trying to start with the things that do have a brand name and have you know they're in a box so you literally can see you know what game it is and what year it is and my 16 year old i actually hired her to take photos and she takes really good ones so so that part is you know that's all trained and i've got that but to get that um kind of average sale price that's so high i need to spend a lot more time on sourcing which i love which everybody loves that's my favorite part and i want to hire somebody to source i couldn't hire somebody to source because it's just i kind of have a pretty good instinct um and that's pretty hard to teach but the listing i think is something i could i could outsource so um anyway just i guess waiting to to resolve whatever the issue is with ebay i don't know how it is this week but yeah so yep so on on that side right now again like we talked um ebay permissions are down just across the board um so that's the difficult part um we are working on our own solution and you can use like lastpass or some other other option right um those are the two options we have in terms of be able to move faster but we are adding in our we're adding in the api so the in connection with ebay we've been on we've been obviously on the phone with them for a while now um so we just got permission to use their api on the backend so we're adding that into the software so that should be up by at least we're launching it today in our dev environment so it should we'll test it today and probably launch it in two to three days hopefully by friday at the latest oh that's great because um yeah because when i called ebay they said no your permissions are on i don't understand what the issue is but of course that's you know customer service they don't always know what's going on in the in the background so i was concerned about that i didn't want to use the last pass because to me that's the same as giving somebody my my um my password because they can still get on and do whatever they want with my account so for me that doesn't solve that problem they won't see the password but they're still getting access the same way i would if i if i save my passwords in my computer so really the only thing that um in terms like having account access right there's really not much somebody can do inside that right um it's like when i i run i run buying um i buy about last year to buy about a million dollars for the product i might use use the same guys i have right now um but there's nothing inside most accounts one bank any credit card or banks it's all blocked off so you can't change that um there's really nothing inside these basic accounts that could really do damage um that's kind of the interesting part but i understand either way i didn't really know that so that's good to know definitely i can think about that then cool and then elaine had a question do you guys have a good tracking sheet that will pull up all your numbers uh in the same time you think what do you mean by numbers in terms of your listings or are you talking about your um prices or your your overall like like back end numbers in terms of return on investment or uh getting much more information about that please let me keep keep going through while you do that cool my question um is like i know well manage payment might do it all because right now you i'm having to go from ebay to paypal to get all my numbers together and i'm i'm keeping all keeping track of everything um and i just was wondering maybe managed payment will will kick in and be able to bring all the members in that together where you don't have to go from one page to the other page to get to get keep track of your numbers yeah so that's the one thing with ebay they're kind of far behind um so there's nothing that's really good in terms of gives you exact numbers it won't give you your cost of goods it won't add and give your gross net or your net net what is going what management store does is they're going to grab your shipping cost anything that ebay tracks shipping and purchase price and fees they'll give you right so they'll give you a little bit of information that it helps out but it's not enough to really make a difference right um that's why like if you can use us or somebody else it doesn't matter on that side i would recommend um going or do it yourself recommend going through and getting those numbers right um and then really tracking um because if you can track what you are doing you can then build you can build something a lot faster because you know exactly what you're doing your numbers your turnovers your return on investment all that kind of stuff so the more tracking you have the better your numbers are in terms of the better tracking your numbers are the better the more efficiently you can run your business if you want to scale business it's all about efficiency it's like how easy can i make a dollar and then that's the that's the best way to do it make sense yes also i have another question um when i am tracking my numbers i could have one thing on my sheet and then when i look at ebay in depth it's like it's another number so i just i'm wondering if anybody else have that issue or can see something like that um what do you mean by another number and where are you getting like from paypal or how are you getting the first number because you're adding in sales tax as well um and then paypal is going to withdraw that sales tax before it gets to your paypal like if i my profit on my sheet i could see a profit number of maybe twenty dollars but when i look at ebay's overall total it's like my profit has decreased to maybe fifteen dollars because there's another number coming in from somewhere that i wasn't able to track yeah so i'll kind of run the numbers on that side so in terms of numbers like what paypal is going to give you it's going to give you um the sale price they're going to give you shipping cost uh fee break down cool so they're going to give you about three different numbers and if you break down they're probably gonna give you managed payments or some sort of credit card processing these are the only things that they're gonna have right so they won't be able to break down anything else um they don't have your cost of goods so if you want you're good if you wanna get your net net you wanna you have to get your cost of goods sold um this is how you can see your actual profit so but they won't have that's the biggest thing so you don't have to get your cost of goods sold for each different product and then add that in okay thank you cool how's it going phil hey good good thank you um yeah um getting my listings up you know getting more trying to get more more through to you guys um yeah i've got a guy who's working with me now who's doing real good and it's working really well and he's just working on you know trying to maximize every minute of you know his day to to make sure we're you know working on that efficiency model on that um like kind of what chris went through last um last week um is his name um are you doing it by hour are you paying him hourly are you doing him by per product um slash like her um activity yeah he's paid per hour because you know he's he's doing all sorts for me not just listing he's you know he's unloading the pallets he's he's cleaning testing grading tidying up the packaging where where we can he's photographing now he's putting things on the shelf he's putting the location skewing he's you know he's vacuuming the place for me he you know he does everything he'll you know he'll he'll um organize the shipping area if we need it re-tidying you know he does whatever i need him to do so with that it makes a little hard to like um get your numbers uh like your costs down dramatic like you're caught they'll be able to get your cost perfect right or in terms of like you can scale right um with that you can try to like um just average it out it's probably the best way to do it but at least you have a helper and you should be moving fast yeah it's getting faster i mean i'm you know just looking now at the my ebay draft listings we've got you know we're getting we're not where we need to be but we're getting up to starting to work towards 10 15 a day now soon that'll be 20 25 so cool um so we're going in the right direction perfect and on that like every um when you guys are listening giving us information um try to give us as least amount as possible unless you have those very hard vintage items like we talked about uh paula um like so i did some uh high-end electronics i funded it and kind of like tested to see how fast you can move on high-end electronics like uh cleaning and photoing i did about 25 in an hour on that again that's just giving the photos and then the used condition any sort of description like i had like length of like wires and stuff other than that like try to keep these try to keep the amount of information um that's given to us at the very very minimum just to speed up as much time as possible um that's what i was doing when i was listening this weekend again trying to test everything out too okay so on your on your new well we'll call it call it an app you know the screen you have up now yep those all those plus signs are for photographs do they have to be in any particular order or does it does it matter to you as of right now no in the next stop we're gonna have um some we are releasing uh the native app on your iphone or android and that's gonna be a little easier to do but realistically no so as long as the defaults first the rest is just extra right this kind of helps help people out try to try to see what they need but other than that like as long as the draft is the defaults first it doesn't matter where you put the items our team is going to go through each each individual thing and pick out the brand and model especially what you're doing phil uh it's just about how it's just you need to be able to process through as fast as possible yeah wait i'm sorry where is this um what i'm looking at i haven't seen this before yep um so this is going to be on app.hammock.com so you can sign up for it and we can also give you your account as well we just released this probably about two weeks ago um we are releasing a lot more um we're focusing directly on the software now instead of everything else so i can find this if i go on app.him oh okay because when i started all i did was they told me to just upload it to a google uh drive photos and i didn't want to have to like write a whole thing of you know all the information when it was in the the pictures like you said because then i might as well list it myself could take the same amount of time yeah okay so we also just push it on our software too if you guys ever need the link you just go to hammock.com hit that sign in it's going to go directly to um directly to the items right so like let me actually see like this i did my photos i'll bring this up um so again i just try to move as fast as possible um took some photos default photo and the rest is just the rest is going to be just rest right make sure we have the the model um i can drive smart and then i think where is the model i think it's this right here yeah accudrive um uh smart power and i have nothing else in this at all except for the condition right any cons the condition is gonna be constant quantity is always gonna be one unless you change it so that's what we're trying to do right is we're trying to make it so it's super simple and as fast as possible to upload um the next thing we are releasing is a faster way to take photos sort of like the ebay app it's going to be automatic um other than that like just be able to i'll kind of show you like my listings in general um and then we can kind of go from there so like yeah so this one like our team can pick out this super easily i'm gonna default photo and then the rest is just the rest um the best way to do it would probably take the the brand and the model will be the first two we can then kind of speed up the listing power on our end but again it doesn't matter our team will go through the photos let me see even like something super basic of this thing it's a default photo which is a basic one and then um again uh this is the brand and then the models on the back end so transparent optus and then mm2 um this is the full thing so then again i put nothing else in here except for the quantity um because it is too so to change that and then the used price so again it's like how fast can we do it if you guys are doing shoes or anything very very simple i had to clean these off too um if you're anything very simple you should be able to hit like that 30 to 40 mark i did 25 doing like super weird like i measured this stuff too um other than that it should be able to process through cool awesome awesome awesome so then um does anybody have any numbers that we can go over and i'll kind of see how we can like um scale uh does anybody have like their return on investment or turnover that we can go over and we'll kind of talk about how we can scale and efficiently scale too if not i can just put some like random numbers out hey i've got a really quick question yep um it's uh so with the hammock app um they uploaded uh my drafts onto ebay they don't actually post them i just go check out through the drafts and then i just post them from there and make sure it's all good right um you can tell us to list directly to your um ebay too so basically like um okay so what like chris does or i know we have the other big players that do like a lot of units um once you get familiar with what we do then they'll just tell us and they like what we do and it's like kind of we've done it for a while and those cells list directly to their account so we can even skip that that draft process as well especially if it's kind of like stuff with brandon model i would even just draft it because then you like the the listings honestly the listings guys they don't like uh it's all about speed and try to get the the qual the quality up to a decent amount and then it's just about processing through because the biggest bottleneck is um is putting up items on the storeroom floor you can always change it if it's a bit too high in terms of pricing um because if you look at your total solds on on it's kind of going down the rabbit hole but if you look on your total solds um 97 to 98 of your total sold is going to be one-off people buying so they're going to be searching the brand and model or the brand or the type of item in in ebay and they're going to be buying off that so it's just about processing through as much as possible sure sure and then actually while i have you um in terms of scale you said liquidation is a pretty good way to you know scale up a little quicker um do you have any other recommendations on where to source for quicker scale yeah definitely so i'll kind of go through that all there's kind of um there's kind of three different ways right so liquidation is that business aspect you can look at there's this thing's called the four d's it's it's basically how items because we as resellers we are um it's it's called uh supply chain we're basically at the end of the supply chain dump um so uh items get down the supply chain and that's when we pick them up if that's garage sales that's thrift stores whatever it may be um so there's multiple different ways to do this um if you're looking to scale um with a lot of product obviously liquidation is going to be the one of the best ways because then you have the top end funnel because if you look at this kind of this is for everybody as well if you look at um like uh your your total funnel in general um you need to be able to do this uh it's just a big funnel so sourcing is going to be your biggest thing you can just push products through you're good so we have liquidation obviously we have garage sales um thrift um then we also have kind of like a niche market in terms of like buying online so we have online arbitrage this is what i do consistently is online arbitrage basically marketplace marketplace you can buy on ebay you can actually buy an ebay and sell anybody you can buy makari and selling makari or sell on ebay you can find all these different sites and undo this i would say you don't want to be able to drive because you want to be able to take your time basically how many items can you source per hour um and then how many items can you list per hour that's gonna be your two biggest bottlenecks i mean that's why that's why um liquidation works really well you can buy so much that you can just push that to the system there's also um consignment this is what i did last week and this is what you have with if you're looking to scale guys and you don't have a lot of money so if money is your your if money is the biggest problem let's say you have 10k you want to spend on a business this then turns to zero because you buy on a liquidation either you have to get a loan loan or use credit cards to be able to um offset that balance um or you can do consignments so consign you can run down this a lot of ways like what i do for consignment again you can check out i'll put this in the chat you guys can copy this if you guys want to that's perfectly fine so i do high-end luxury consignment only i only touch the best of the best but people can do like downsides and estates and stuff like that it's all the same um but with that i run a downside this is kind of my side hustle i guess you could say um with this you can pull out a lot of products um and it's relatively easy with this i got this i got this last item from a in a state trust right um state trust um you can also do um what is it uh organizer organizers i got probably about a few million dollars worth of art not about a million dollars with art from an organizer as well there's different ways you can do this basically whatever way you're looking at you need to reverse engineer it in terms of um how you're getting your products so if you're getting it from like thrift stores um look at look at how the thrift store is getting their products right so the thrift store is getting their product and they kill this stuff and the thrift store is getting their products from down sizes states um just people adopting downsizing just in general right they're getting rid of a lot of product that means they're they're getting rid of it they're pushing it out the system um estates when somebody passes divorce divorce the four d's right downside death disaster or like if like um there's a lot of stuff from their stores that gets if like they have water damage or their house if something gets flooded they'll just toss everything the thrift stores get rid of it so that's how like thrift stores are doing whatever you're working on guys just try to reverse engineer in terms of how to get better product you have to go up the supply chain every time so if you're looking to do a thrift store model i this is why i did the states um in downsizes is because this is where the model where the thrift store is going to every time you go upstream that's where you get better prices and higher margin right so there's no way i could pick out 400 000 worth of product at a thrift store i had to get it from an estate trust because this is the top of this this is the top of the funnel right so basically how this happens is obviously like for an estate there's something that passes um then it goes to a high-end one's gonna do it in state trust or a state lawyer and then it goes to a state sales and then it goes down to a thrift and then sometimes it goes down to reseller sometimes resellers can be right here as well so this is how like the supply chain of like a downs an estate company or a downsize or just in the like um the thrift store every time you go upstream you're making more money and that's how you get better product too um so like in terms of uh liquidation this goes for phil and i i guess u2 hunter like for like um this side so liquidation goes from a store like a retail store store um slash online store these are returns um it gets returned right so then this goes to a what is it called a dc um a centralized warehouse that they pick up all the products then this goes to a wholesaler and then this goes to a reseller so um like so this is this is good for you phil as well so a lot of a lot of people are doing liquidation they're getting it from a wholesaler so you want better products um and better selection you go to the distribution center of that of that store right so each time you're gonna you upstream that's when you get better product and more margin because everything about this way every time margin every time every time something gets transferred margin decreases one because of logistics one because of logistics and then two because let's call it hands and the pot the pots like each time this happens so dc's gonna be the logistics side this is gonna cost money to do the sorting and then the wholesaler is taking off money to sell to the reseller right so then we're making yeah so i guess every time somebody touches that product there's less profit yep 100 yeah so you know there are there's a few there's a few guys in the uk which i'm i'm i'm looking at what they're doing quite closely and they do some videos on facebook and that you know six pallets in today you know these you know while stocks last it's you know they're 49 pound instead of 99. so these guys are buying these pallets these are brand new products clearance end of line end of season you know maybe as we call it here the gray market short dated consumables you know his video today had lots of coca-cola products drinks foods snacks all within two or three months and i've been watching him and they they all sell so you know people are buying these things so he's buying these products from somewhere and it's not all food you know it's it's hard goods home wares etc so him and these other big sellers are buying these from somewhere and i don't know where they're getting them from so phil they're getting it from distribution centers of stores right so we've been doing a lot of research in this because we're trying to like work i'll kind of give you what like our plans are in terms of trying to get you guys better product we're trying we're trying to amass enough cash to go directly to the store right the store level if we can get a big enough people into the store level we can then give you guys the the profit on the back end right so what that got that guy doing is he's the wholesaler and he's getting it from the distribution centers so the best way um i'll talk about what elaine's question is too so he's cutting out the whole sailor he's cutting out the guy in the middle so he is the wholesaler that's why so he's selling products right so he is the guy in the middle but he's getting it from the distribution center so what you can do with the distribution center is you can call them up right for distribution centers you want to ask for the salvage department salvage market so department but the problem with this is you have to buy full um full truckload containers right so it's about 24 pallets so again what he's doing is he's taking um let's make it let's make this an easy number let's say he's buying ten thousand dollars with a product um and there's 24 um there's 24 dollars 24 pallets he's been selling these individually right so then let me see if we can divide this well he's he's i mean his video this morning was from like yesterday he had three three truckloads so that's three container loads so we had like 60 odd pallets came in yesterday and he quickly did a video and he sells them individually he'll you know he'll sell a case of a case of diet coke for like two dollars in your terms yep right he's bought them probably for a dollar so he's doubling his money so there's people queuing up and coming on in their cars to buy the you know the the whatever it is he's selling it's amazing so i'll talk about in a second elaine there's there's two ways to go and talk to people whatever model you're going for if you're going to that like the downsides and estate companies or you're going to um like the bit i call this this is business as a consumer so business consumer if you're going to business you can always just ask right like if you're trying to find who has it call these stores they have a bunch of supplies like hey uh i'm a big buyer i'm looking to buy um truckloads can you give me the right person right um this is a little bit more this is the the consumer side's a little more dicey um in terms of that you have to go i got this connection through another state lawyer it's basically um the dc's are a lot easier because it's a business you can contact somebody um if your guys going consumer base it's a little bit harder you get like especially in like like no one no the problem is in the trust side or like the lawyers lawyers don't trust many people so you have to get like a recommendation through another lawyer which you can do some things but you can start reaching reaching out to people we don't trust them either yeah hey hey i'm a lawyer seriously except for i'm doing this instead because it's more fun i'm joking my best friends are one of my best friends is a barrister here in the uk i'm kidding too my husband's a lawyer i don't trust no you're good you're good so um so in terms of uh what that guy's doing again he's just breaking him down if you want if you want to go next step to dc level you have to be able to process a truckload right or get two people like yourself that are more than more than happy to split the truckload um because for these dc's are looking or or just people the next level they want to dump off as much as possible it could be a dec distribution center or even like the the trust and estate lawyers right they just want to have one person do everything um so what you can do is you can package your service um or there's two ways this you can do like package or service um or you can niche down and be really specific so in the dc side you're gonna have to kind of package and take as much as possible um in the trust and estate i would niche down kind of like what we did right here is we only deal with very very high end we'll say you're high in artwork with ease blah blah blah blah um like we're we're basically just doing the highest isn't so we niche down we're out taking like the basic stuff we'll just take the super super high-end stuff um so there's those two ways the bigger you go the bigger companies are just gonna wanted to package it up and sell it bulk to you um but yeah elaine what can i ask what uh what you sell what what type of product i sell everything anything that i think would sell i sell um so can i make a suggestion this has worked for me in the last year so i go to estate sales i don't know if you do that and i've gotten to know a few people and this was one person in particular um she needed help either like sometimes sitting you know on saturday or sunday or actually when she has like too many houses to to clean out at once and i actually trade my labor for a ton of really good stuff i'm the first one there to pick it and because i don't charge her you know she has to pay other people i don't know a hundred dollars say for six hours or something um but i get really nice things that she's not necessarily you know she doesn't care she's not necessarily interested in she just needs the house emptied out and i know there are there are other women she calls even at the end and there's still good stuff to just get the place cleared out because if she's agreed to clear it all out and people aren't necessarily doing uh estate sales during covid so she has to take it off site to like a warehouse she lets people dig through and take what they want and then it costs her nothing so if you kind of get to know these people um sometimes that can work in your favor as well i've gotten a lot of great stuff in fact that's now my number one source i have more stuff than i can actually list so if that's the type of thing you want to go for rather than liquidation that's a suggestion as well oh wow thank you i'll look into that um i had a question ty as far as i'm having trouble figuring out um what did you call it how long my stuff sits my turnover so is there a faster way to do it with ebay besides looking at each listing see when i listed it and when it sold because it's number one it's pretty cumbersome to do it that way yeah so there's even a bigger problem with that ebay actually doesn't give you how long or when your item was listed since it turns over everything has a 30-day turnover and then that's how they that's how they charge you again right um there's really no way to do that directly so that's what we trying to add into our own stuff but like okay that's that's one of the biggest problems you're seeing ebay ebay doesn't give you good enough numbers really optimize your business but what you can do is like we'll give you a tracker on our end and that will actually give you the list states um you can then we can have like um our team go through and be able to like track that what we are adding software in that when you list it let's say you list us um the cost of goods and you list the item we'll be able to track all that stuff in the near future as well cool i have another question it's a little bit off topic but not um i was trying to get into your uh sign in um and it's saying it doesn't recognize my email or password so i then put um you know i forgot my password thinking okay maybe there was a typo and it won't even let me send the forgot password thing it just doesn't work um i know i tried to get in a few weeks ago or a couple of weeks ago and maybe it was before you guys allowed sign-ins and at that time i was just chatting with whoever the you know if you go to hammock.com who it's the virtual person and when i tried to sign in i was like i can't access that anything and they said oh yeah that's because that's only for for us and um like only employees can access that and i thought well then why did you make me come up with a password so i'm confused it might be that you just launched this but i still can't get in correct yeah so we just launched it so any old customers um let me know and i'll show you on the list and we'll add a bit to add you in manually right now which kind of painting but but that's what we have is right now and then once we add you in manually then you'll get a username and password and then you can start using the software so let me actually write this down on my list so how do i um yep so i'll add you to all this right now on my end and then it takes about um our team will be able to put you on in probably today or if not really tomorrow and we'll get you on and then we'll send you an email with the username and password oh that would be great okay so do you have my you have my email right yep i'll put you on i'm doing on my phone right now cool a good question yeah if anyone else wants to do that just send me an email um and we can put you on obviously the new customers will automatically be generated on their old customers um what we have to add you on manually which we were figuring out a way to make that a little bit easier but it's like what do we on our end it's like how what do we want to have um what what what do we want to give to you guys first um and like how do we prioritize that so if you guys whatever you guys want in terms of any features or anything like that let us know and we'll try to prioritize those instead of other things right that's what we're trying to prioritize like photoing faster making sure everything gets up and speed wise um that kind of information right so this would be great because if i can get on then i can use that form you were showing me for and because i've got a lot of photos ready to go but i was kind of waiting before i put them on google drive because i still don't have you know it's not working but at least if i can kind of get those ready uh that would be good yep so then i'll i'll send you the email later today or tomorrow with your login and go from there okay all right thanks good question though cool um any of the questions we can go over we got about 10 minutes left i'm more than happy to answer any questions on your business um how to scale anything along those lines yeah i haven't please yep when the guys when the guys are doing the pricing um what what's the kind of process for them because i let me tell you why i'm asking because i would say that night eighty percent eighty percent of the pricing is is is pretty much you know it's it's where it should be so it's it's pretty good uh a few of them a few of them are slightly off so and when i say off mainly underpriced rather than over what our team is going through is they're going to the sole listings and then going and kind of aggregating those into the middle right so depending on what you want your listings to be high medium or low they're trying to aggregate those and then put your listing in the let's say it's let's say we have ten items that they're selling between ten dollars and twenty dollars we're putting the average and then trying to get an average so sometimes how ebay works is there not enough information that's why you might be seeing those those mislabeled right but the majority of them like you said 80 were getting spot on but you can always sell us a little bit higher and the ones that um uh are harder to list or you can give us the the higher price point as well and then we can always deduct that as well either or we're more than happy to do can i can we um specifically ask to do a certain way like i mean you're going to laugh but um i tend to price mine just go in the soles put on the highest sold and that's my price and it's worked for me i i price high and i i sell high so um yeah can we ask they do it that way rather than you know aggregate and add 20 or something yep so what we can do is high medium or low and then the high is going to be the top price right the medium is doing the median price that's worth the aggregate aggregate for the median price this one's the one that's kind of harder to do but we can do it right because we're aggregating that middle price and the low is going to be the lowest right so we're more than happy to do um uh any of those so again let's let's let your va know and they'll change it on your sheet because each person has their own uh sheet on the back end of what we're pricing it off of right so you can also do some weird pricings like some people wanna some people are bumping it up twenty percent and then running at twenty percent off right sale we're more than happy to do that as well um we're bumping up twenty percent we're we can kind of we can tailor this to you guys okay that was that was based around my question as well that i was going to ask actually there are you know there are people we we we both know one of them who puts he puts his prices up i think something like 22 25 and then he runs a sale or he knocks you know now what's the psychology behind that because if you put your price too high then people are not maybe not going to look at it in the first place right yeah so on that side like the psychology that people are going for that are running this is saying oh people like sales so i'm going to generate a fake sale and that should drive more drive more um people to that but like so like again i i i like last year and this year's alone right i buy a lot i buy a lot of products and how i buy stuff on ebay is i just go to ebay what my team does they go to ebay and then it's filter from lowest price and then they buy those lowest price up to a certain because i'm buying our return on investment right they're doing that right so if you're trying so the reason why amazon works so um amazon works well amazon.com amazon i buy this product so you guys can buy if you want that's fine um why amazon works so well is because this buy box generates 95 of the sales right this buy box is based off of price so people like it's like let me ask questions that kind of open to the group if you guys are going into us like how do you guys how do you guys shop do you guys shop for the lowest price um or do you guys look for uh service for the same product right that's how you like that that's the way you got to think about this too um so like that's the psychology that like that we buy off i'm still kind of giving you that but the reason why people run fake sales is because the psychology of oh it's on sale i'm going to buy it which i don't know if it works not some people say it works some people say it doesn't we haven't again we haven't run the numbers on the individual people to really figure that out which hopefully we will in the future my psychology of working pricing things high which does seem to work for me but i think it only mostly works with say one-offs like vintage type things is perceived value it's definitely a thing i take really good pictures i do really good listings and i i try to get you know really good products i point out if there's any flaws and people will pay more they will pay more for that just like people will shop neiman marcus instead of kmart and sometimes it's the same product yeah so um you know it's just a kind of a different business model um as i said depending on on what you sell you can't do it on you know kind of everyday items and expect to sell the highest price because i do shop low to high and then work my way you know work my way through if i think somebody's not but you know if you're a top rated seller that's another another plus that you can charge more for so to speak so a lot of psychology if you have the rarer the product you have the more you can the more you can charge for because i'm going to give you an example i have a product i sell that sells about 150 units a month and i'm the only seller thus i can charge way more than anybody else or way more than like it what should be worth this because i have this stuff there's there's so much demand and there's not enough supply since i create i can create the price right it's all about supply and demand if you're selling um basically um consumer consumer items that um sure you can have some price bump up if you have the better quality item in terms of condition wise you can obviously show that in photos but um at that same point if you have the if you have the best quality if your goal is trying to your goal is trying to maximize so the numbers become really interesting if your goal is trying to maximize um uh revenue and the more revenue you grow the the more money you can make right so if you're trying to maximize revenue you should be the best qual the best quality and lowest price for the best price because you like because 90 except if you're running that like that estate stuff that's it's one us that people are looking for that no one else has you can then charge a higher margin but if you're in the consumer consumer base like if you really want to scale and move as much product as possible depending on your turnover if your turnover is fine leave it the way it is but if you're trying to up that turnover then everything just died down like there we go if you're trying to up that uh turnover then lo best quality and lowest price is going to move a lot more product sure your margins decrease but then it comes then it then it becomes a scale game right because in my opinion like i rather so like if i if i did one seven 170 if i did 170 i i and i can do um what is it let's say my margins 20 percent i rather make this like 340 um instead of and i'm pushing margin instead of holding onto items and i'm looking at let's say i said you're fractional let's say i did like so i did 350 the year before um and i'm having like a 50 margin um it's just it's just the mat the math goes higher the more the more rep that's why big these big companies have so that's why basis is worth so much money even though his margin is so slim um in terms of like his overall nets so slim is because he's pushing out so many units that's how he makes so much money because if you if you're in the if you're in the million dollar plus or not in that small if you're in the 10 to 20 30 40 whatever that may be you can then buy you can go directly to the store right there's more options you have the hot the more money you're pushing through the system and the more more cash flow you have and you can do a lot more things you can you can raise debt on this you can you get financing in other ways it's like personally me like the look selling the cheap like what i sell products i sell new products that are the cheapest price that's how that's how i move products right i don't care my minimum roi is 20 um even sometimes i'll even take 10 to 15 depending on if it has a high return rate because obviously if the return rate is 15 i'm selling out at 15 you break even um but i try to sell my products the cheapest possible i move volume it's a volume game for me i i have a question about prices um so do you have any opinion or any information as to um you know let's say you've had something and you realize the price is too high after a couple of months or something do you end it and re-list it with a lower price put it on sale or can you just reduce the price without ending it and relisting it is there like a bet best way to do that yeah so it depends on your strategy so there's there's different options right there i'll kind of talk through all i can't talk through we're if i go over a few minutes but that's fine i have to go to the house at if 9 30 but um so there's kind of different options right so uh the only problem if you end a listing you lose watchers so what i would do is i would send all watchers like let's say three to four days beforehand the price you want to go down to whatever discounted rate you want to go down to send them all that offer at that discounted rate um and then if you have to i would kill the listing deep um i would d-list reprice and then a re-list that will become a new listing right um right that's gonna be the best way to do that so again send that send all your watchers an offer and then d-list re-price and then re-list makes sense thanks i think somebody else had a question yeah i i tend to i when i get items that are being watched i usually send maybe once a day send out a bunch of offers and i just take off the minimum at five percent um i don't know if anybody else does that but i find that works quite well i get quite a few extra sales from that um even at five percent really yeah if the because i'm i've tried to price my products quite well well these guys do a good job of pricing the products for me sometimes it's just enough you know to take somebody you know to push them into the buying zone some of them are ten percent but most of them i just put in the minimum five and it it can work on some products on some of the more expensive products then yeah i'll push it up to 10 because it's a it's a nicer number to look at um the reason why that works is because it gets into their face right so it puts it into their ebay and it says oh the seller's offering this it's basically gets attention right so if you think about sales sales happens the same way each every time right traffic traffic like equals attention right like this this is all like the more traffic you have is the more attention you have and this than that then that equals sales right so that's what that that's what the offer is doing it's basically bringing even at the five percent it's more about the tension that it's bringing than the than the offer even though obviously the lower you offer the better chance you have to sell but at the same time it's just you're bringing a lot more attention to that item which is which is powerful especially people that the watchers are saying that they want to buy this so if you give them a price or you get them attention on that item they have a higher conversion rate which is interesting what about free shipping versus charging for shipping um the numbers about free shipping is about a 15 extra bump right so free shipping is going to be the best um if you want that 15 or 10 to 15 extra bump that's getting pretty consistent around the thing right um personally i don't like if i don't um let me try to say um i don't know why people would price with shipping when the numbers are that way um but again to reach their own um also with returns right the numbers are also saying like you you should have a 30-day return policy because it even doesn't matter right people like i don't want any returns but how ebay works is i know this i know this well because we turn a lot of items to ebayers um is i can go to as not described and you're going to get the return either way so there's no there's no reason why you should have no returns because ebay is going to force you to do the return so why not take the extra bump in sales oh i totally agree with that actually i've only had one return out of 350 sales right so i have free yeah 30 day returns i don't do free returns though because i feel like if they're going to return it i want them to at least have to pay for the postage so they have some skin in the game and they think about it before they buy it just figuring out i can send it back because then it's going to cost me to ship it there ship it back i just i just don't i've thought about it but i haven't done the free returns yet so think about the buried entry right too so somebody's like oh she doesn't offer free returns thus i'm not gonna buy it it might damper some sales but like again it's how the business business model there's best practices but best practices aren't how like to each their own right is however you guys want to run your store is how you it's your it's your it's your thing right it's your baby it's your your business so to each you can do what you can do whatever whatever y'all whatever whatever floats your the boat right i think it depends on what you're selling too um you know i i do charge for shipping i didn't notice any difference when i did free shipping for when i as to when i charge for shipping but i think it's because the people that buy my products they don't mind paying for shipping they don't care they want that particular item they're willing to pay a hundred dollars for it they don't care if they have to pay another 12 for for shipping um i'm not sure that they do the math which when i'm shopping i do i look at the free shipping price and try to figure out whether it's cheaper to just pay for shipping and buy the lower price one versus buy a higher price one with free shipping the other thing i don't like about free shipping is that if i decide to have a sale and reduce my price i'm also reduced so if let's say something is a hundred dollars and and ten dollars or fifteen dollars for shipping so i price it free shipping 115 dollars and then i decide to have a 20 off sale i'm now getting less money for the shipping so i'm actually giving more than 20 off on the product when i charge for shipping i reduce the price it's only on the product so that's another mathematical thing i've kind of thought about yeah most people should be making the money on shipping too a lot of people make i like when i was doing ebay i made two to three bucks on shipping but elaine you have a question yes um my question is the new spreadsheet we have now that we're uploading on would it be custom can it be customized to um the items we upload because the last one that we was doing before we changed to this one was sort of kind of customized to my specifics um can you i'm kind of confused on the question oh it's kind of hard to explain yeah i know i know is it about the tracker we're giving you or is it something else yeah like the front and back um to me this one the new one is more like for clothes or something you know high-end other stuff where i just do yeah talk about this okay the conditions so you don't need the whole 12 photos no so all we need guys is in the photos we need the if you're doing clothing we'll need the uh the default so whatever default photo you want and then the brand and the tag right anything else brand and model works fine or as long as we can see the item right so it doesn't matter how many items how many photos you give us that's it's all completely up to you right and all we actually need if the brand and model are there or brandon tag is we just need the condition so the whole goal is to be able to minimize the amount of effort that has to be put on your end right because we want you guys to be able to scale the whole business model between this is to be able to have have uh you as the customer um or or reseller let's just say the reseller do as least as possible and then the rest gets done um either by software or by our team right that's the overarching goal so however you can however you think that we can improve that we're more than happy to like like hear that hear the idea and then try to implement that as well but again whenever you're trying to think about this stuff it's how can i do as least as possible and make hammock do the most work as possible okay cool so i got two minutes i got i'm looking to buy a piece of property so i got two minutes anybody any questions this is probably the we'll do any questions for that comment if not we'll jump off one more quick question i just want to know if initially i signed up with hammock just to do listings but if i have you guys do cross listing do you would you would i be able to look at the draft first and only when it's good to go then you would cross list it to the other sites is that how that works yep so what happened first so we're going to do your listing right so i'll make this easy so we'll do your listing that's going to go to your main sites uh let's just call it ebay for now okay um yep and then if you if you auto list with us let's say you like our listings enough that you'll you'll just auto list those if not we'll put those in a draft form once you launch those draft once you launch it um then we'll cross list it okay and we also d list two make sure you guys are the d list that's probably the biggest time consumer i mean how you do that is just forward us the emails to d-list hammock.com um it actually works pretty dang well and we'll do it overnight and we are automating that process in the near future hi yep sorry i i won last question um because i gotta go as well um when when you've got items that are not selling they've been on your shelf for what kind of period should you should you if something hasn't sold what kind of period should you start to look at that product um so what we should do in your opinion yep you what i would do is i would say first month leave it at the price you want then then um take a 20 10 to 20 20 to 25 deduction that price fifty percent liquidate you want you wanna be able to you wanna be able to get your money and money out um as fast as possible right even if you break even on a product and make it so you get your cash you can then be able to reinvest into another product yeah okay i'll i'll look for that and then after after perhaps what three months and it's not sold um liquidate it take it off and take it off and put it in a box and bundle it up yep sell it on facebook marketplace or whatever that may be or you can go to auction sites options don't give you like no money for it but um you can always at least get some money back at it i would post it on facebook marketplace or bundle it up for resellers which i just dumped the product box it up and give you something a good deal either break even on it or take take a little bit of a loss again it's about getting it's not getting the money in money out as fast as possible yeah okay all right cool thank you yeah we got only assess michelle says may may have missed this but um we'll we'll be able to use the app to post on our own yep so the app you want to be able to post you'll be posting it on your own um uh that's some of the best way to do it um i think that's the question i gotta go i gotta run cheers guys catch you phil hi thanks bye yup so uh michelle um yeah so you can use the app and this is what you can be able to post on the app again all we need is a default photo the brand and model or brand and tag and then use condition quantity will always be one so it makes it easy again we want to have you guys do as least as possible and have hammock do as much work as possible like like we're trying to make this dish like as most try to try to push the work on us make sense if that answered question i gotta i gotta run guys um have a great rest of your week and we'll do again this on tuesday see you guys thanks charlie see you later
