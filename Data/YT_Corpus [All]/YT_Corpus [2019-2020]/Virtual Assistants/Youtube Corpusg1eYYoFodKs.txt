 maybe you're thinking about getting an echo or you have one and you want to know what you can do with it here are 10 echo in everyday uses hello tech friends welcome back if you're new here my name is Craig I love playing with tech and seeing what it can do for us that sounds like something you're into stick around this is week 48 of my 2019 echo series I did a top 10 everyday uses last year and the year before that's why this one is 3.0 maybe you're new to the Amazon Actos and this will give you some idea of uses maybe your season echo pro this video will go over the updates over the past year let's get started with the top 10 stay tuned to the end I'm gonna throw in a bonus feature for this year one that I think is an interesting use for your echoes number one are two of the most used functions for my family they are timers and alarms both have been updated over the past year did you know that you can set multiple timers and name each one of them then when a timer goes off it'll tell you which timer it is this is great if you're trying to keep track of multiple things set a pasta timer for 5 seconds pasta timer 5 seconds starting now a set of reading timer for 10 minutes reading timer 10 minutes starting now there's my pasta timer let me know pasta timer is done the stop I can check on my timer by asking how much time is left on my reading timer about 9 minutes and 20 seconds left I think that's a very handy feature I love that you can name each one especially if you start stacking timers on top of each other now the alarms are great with this you can set them through the app or your voice you can have it wake you with a basic alarm sound or you can pick a genre music a song or an artist but my favorite addition to alarms this year is triggering the routine when the alarm goes off basically a routine is a series of steps that your echo will do let's set an alarm for one minute and see a trigger a routine set an alarm for 1046 am so there's the alarm going off stop good morning have a wonderful day today there are two events remaining at 2 p.m. there's Madison parent-teacher conference and at 3:30 p.m. there's horseback riding so that was a little 3-step where it said something changed the color of my light and then told me what's going on with my calendar number two is one of the best uses for an echo it is smart home control for years you've been able to control smart light smart plug switches thermostats cameras and so much more last year Amazon making it easier to control your devices with the addition of groups you can combine all of your lights and smart devices in a room with an echo into a group my favourite update this year is being able to just say turn off the lights the echo in the group knows to only turn on or off the lights it is grouped with turn on light no more having to remember the name of each light or the name of the group that is a game changer especially with my wife who did not know the name of every light or group in the house now we can go from room to room and say turn on or off lights with the same command I've done the same thing with smart switches in my kitchen it just lights on and the two switches trigger this has been one of the best upgrades for smart home control number three is music the echoes are great for listening to music in whatever room you're in you can even combine them and listen to multiple rooms at the same time with the Amazon echoes you can listen to Amazon music Apple music Spotify Pandora iHeartRadio tuned in Sirius XM title Amazon HD music and more I was really excited that Apple music came to the echos the last December I know it's not available in all countries and I'm sorry to hear that that is a bummer but there are the other music options these options are great you're able to just ask for an artist genre music or song with Amazon you even create playlists with your voice and add songs to it by saying add the song to the name of the list with other services you could access your playlists that you've created through their I set mine up so Apple music is the default service so I can say play classical playlist classical from Craig's Apple music [Music] good to go number four built on the music option with multi-room audio speaker groups for a little while now you've been able to create speaker groups of echoes for example I can have an upstairs group a downstairs group or in every where group this past year Amazon added the option to add your fire TV sticks or fire TV cubes into a group for multi-room audio to play classical music on office speakers got it here's a station you might like ultimate classical on Amazon music now it's coming out of my office show five here it's on the TV it's telling me what's plain there's a dot behind me now you get music coming out of your TV this is a great addition if you have a nice sound system that you use with your fire TV number five is one of the favorites from last year's list it is still a great tool it's great for talking to someone in another room or even from outside the house it is dropping dropping is like an intercom system for your echoes you could say drop in on the name of an echo in your house and you'll be connected right to that echo you can even use the app or echo Auto to drop in when you're outside of the house drop in on the kitchen you can see in green light you letting you know hello hey how's it going I'm recording a video demonstrating drop in okay hang up number six is great for keeping track your day with calendars you can connect Google Microsoft Microsoft Exchange or Apple Calendar accounts to your echo you can choose what calendars you want to have sync up to your echo you can also choose what calendars you want to add events to with your voice add dinner to my calendar at 6:00 p.m. tonight I'll schedule dinner today at 6 p.m. ok yes ok I've if you have an echo shown you can set it up so that you can see your calendars and I'll tell you what's coming up next if I want to hear what my events are for the day I can say what's on my calendar here are the next four events today at 2:00 p.m. there's Madison parent-teacher conference at 3:30 p.m. there's horseback riding at 6:00 p.m. there's dinner you could see it added my dinner right to the calendar number seven is reminders and lists with your echo you could set reminders for yourself or others for example remind me in 30 seconds to continue talking about reminders okay I'll remind you in 30 seconds you can choose in the app to also send that reminder to your phone when it does go off or you could turn on the missed reminders notification so if you're away from Morocco a yellow light will stay on to give you a visual to check your reminder here's your reminder continue talking about reminders and here it showed up on my phone that says continue to talk about reminders with lists you can create lists and add items to it using your voice there's even the option to add multiple things at the same time for example I could say add milk cheese and avocado to my trip list I couldn't find a list called trip should I create one yes I have created trip list and added milk cheese and avocado to it now if I go into the app I can go to the list and I have a list called trip and there's now avvocato cheese and milk on it number eight is one of my favorites it is routines routines allow you to create a series of steps that can be triggered by voice at a specific time by select smart devices a location an alarm and it's a gadget or you like cigars with routines you pick what's gonna trigger that routine and then you pick the actions that go with it the actions include saying something reading your calendar off change some device settings have your Google or Microsoft email read to you send a message from the app to other exit users play music give you newsflash briefing trigger skills trigger smart devices traffic wait times or weather the weight option may need more of an explanation basically you could put weights between steps maybe you want to have a motion sensor trigger lights on in one step and then you wait 10 minutes and then in the next step it turns them off or you want to delay some other step in your routine maybe you have the lights downstairs wait 10 minutes after you dismiss your alarm the fact that you can trigger a routine by using an alarm like I showed earlier it's really impressive there really are so many options with routines here's one that I made I'm back well hello I'm very happy you're here the cheers for me and now set the device volume may not have notice it also triggered a scene that changed the color of my lights to all blue number nine is books audible books and podcasts with your ex you can ask for a podcast and it will search the available services such as iheartradio or tuned in for the podcast you want play the Joe Rogan experience here's the Joe Rogan experience from tune in number 1389 Chris crecer hello friends this episode of the pot one of the things I love is that I can listen to my audio books from any of the echo devices play my audible book it's the easiest to rationalise we don't tell how it when I ask for my audio book it's gonna just pick up from where I left off on the audible app you can also have read you your Kindle books read my book the hit resuming Craig's book the hit will Robi book to comment caught Vance off-guard she sat back her posture relaxed now it's gonna be read to you in a boy so if you're okay with that it does give you an audio version number 10 is calling when you set up the echo you can give permission to the app to use your contacts so if you get permission to use your contacts you can make calls from your echo if you set up a voice profile it'll know your voice and contact when you ask to call your mom as opposed to your spouse's mom you can also make a call by saying the numbers in a phone number so if you want to call a business you can just say the numbers another great calling option is Skype you can use Skype to contact other Skype users through their skype app or their echo if you're using something like the echo show you can do voice and video now the bonus number eleven everyday use they can give you a little extra peace of mind is the guard when the guard is activated your echoes will listen for the sounds of smoke alarms or CEO alarms going off it will also listen for the sound of glass breaking if any of those things happen an alert will be sent to your phone guard can also give your house that lived-in look by turning on or off rooms at random times after sunset it uses your zip code to determine when sunset is you can pick which lights you want to use with guard and now when you are met anyone who's up to no good won't know if you're home because they'll see lights come on at random times another cool addition with guard is you can use it to trigger routines it could turn off all the lights except for a couple in the house and all the devices when you leave and turn likes a guard then when you disarm guard it can turn on other lights in the house and start another routine this is one of those features that are creative and an interesting addition to the echos this is cut the stuff I like to see Amazon make that's it ten great every uses for the echo and
