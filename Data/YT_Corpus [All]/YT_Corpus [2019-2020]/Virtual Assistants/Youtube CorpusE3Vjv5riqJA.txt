 welcome back future millionaires this is debt to millionaire daily i'm john and today i'm going to talk to you about virtual assistants i use virtual assistants to help with my uh freelance writing business i do most of my freelance writing through upwork a website where other people can post jobs and then freelancers can submit proposals to those jobs um so i used to spend probably two hours every single day that's 14 hours a week um just scrolling through the jobs i'm at work submitting proposals but most of that time was spent scrolling through reading the job descriptions deciding whether it's suitable or not 95 of them aren't suitable for me um for a number of reasons maybe the client doesn't have much experience on off work so they're just likely to mess me about the job it doesn't pay enough per word so with it being freelance writing i get paid per word and most people are at work are wanting just the absolute cheapest rather than the best quality and uh i go from all the quality and i submit the best content i can but i charge an appropriate amount for them so most people aren't looking for that so to save time uh 14 hours a week which i have been spending uh on writing jobs i still have virtual assistants um scroll through the jobs for me and i pay them a relatively small amount per hour compared to how much i'm making um doing the writing jobs so for example on average if i spend an hour on a writing job i might make 20 30 40 but then i'll pay a freelancer around five dollars to find jobs for me during that time so it just makes sense for me to spend that time writing for clients rather than searching for the jobs myself i can make a lot more money that way um i've been doing this for about three months now and it's been working great my income for freelancing has increased significantly three months ago and before um i was barely cracking 1 000 pounds after all the fees upward charges and then foreign exchange fees and all that but now i've cracked um over 2 000 pounds a month freelancing in my spare time from home and i spend about on average two hours a day actually writing and then every now and then i have to look over the jobs that the freelancers the virtual assistants find for me some of them aren't suitable but it's a heck of a lot faster than looking through the jobs myself just looking through their short lists of jobs most of them usually are suitable so um i have three virtual assistants that work for me um they're based in the philippines and india where the cost of living is much lower and the average hourly rate is much lower than in the uk where i'm based and especially in america places like california the average hourly rate is around 50 in the uk i'm not sure exactly what it is but i think it's about equivalent to 25 so i aim to get clients that are in these areas where the hourly rate is um higher on average like california they pay me a california rate and then i pay my virtual assistance india and philippine rates so everyone's winning i'm giving a good value to the california clients and i'm giving a higher than average hourly rate to my virtual assistants to find jobs for me how did i find the virtual assistants um way back when i was hiring them three four months ago i just went and found 10 who i thought was suitable maybe it was 15 i just gave them all two hours worth of work to go out and find jobs based on the criteria that i gave them a bunch of them gave me lists of jobs that were just completely not suitable they obviously didn't read the instructions or they didn't understand very well but so then i just kept on i think it was eight of them you gave um reasonable lists and then after that each had a few more hours to find jobs um i could see clearly which the best virtual assistants were for this job so now i have three working for me i just give each of them two hours a week to find jobs and that gives me a total of six hours worth of work that i'm not having to do they do it for me and that keeps me topped up with jobs to apply to it lets me use my time that i would have spent looking for jobs actually writing and earning money from it so the key takeaways from this are that you can earn more money doing um a higher paying job and outsourcing the lowest skill lower value work to virtual assistants another key takeaway from this video is that when you're searching for the freelancers in the beginning make sure to get at least 10 to try out because probably two or three of those are going to be standout performers they're going to do exactly what you want or close to it and the rest are going to be absolutely rubbish so if you only try one two or three in the beginning chances are they're all going to be rubbish you're going to think it doesn't work and then you're just going to give up on the idea so with all that said if you like the video smash that like button subscribe to the channel and turn on the notification bell so
