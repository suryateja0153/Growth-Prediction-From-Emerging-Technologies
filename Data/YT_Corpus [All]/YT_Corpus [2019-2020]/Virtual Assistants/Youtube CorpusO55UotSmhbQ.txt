and digital marketing let's get started welcome back to outsourcing scaling I'm here with Ryan Lee Ryan how're you doing today I am doing great Nate ready rock this baby awesome well excited to have you Ryan is the founder of rewind home of the world's first nutrition super bar he's also the author of the millionaire workout passion of profits he was featured on the front page of The Wall Street Journal and called the world's number one lifestyle entrepreneur by entrepreneur I want to talk all about being a lifestyle entrepreneur but first let's take a gigantic step back to when you were growing up what kind of kid were you were you a straight-a student or you a rebel walk us through that I was definitely not a straight-a student I wasn't a rebel either I I my parents just said you know I was a good kid I listened never studied thankfully when I when I just paid attention in class and I was able to listen and learn I I was able to kind of retain it so I never studied which I don't know if that's great or not but haha I you know I I just uh it's kind of like a mama's boy I as I was a young kid I was not a good athlete but I was always pretty fast so that helped me get some confidence and then I ended up becoming captain my track team in high school and even college for all four years on sprinters that gave me confidence but I just I was just a regular kid either I was really lucky to have growing up in a great neighborhood we had a neighborhood of a hundred and ten homes and was all kids my age and you know I hit the lottery with my parents just so supportive they made me feel like I could do anything so um yeah and I started my first business back when I was 12 years old baseball cards well I know there's a popular entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk we have very similar paths that was my path just I started a baseball card business and I even to the point where I would I was doing ads and magazines and I would print up I would type up on a typewriter price sheets for all these baseball cards people would send me cash checks in the mail and I send out I'd mail out baseball cards so it was uh it was pretty cool I was doing it from the house I loved it so you were an entrepreneur when you were 12 graduate high school do you graduate college I went yeah I graduated college my degree I went to Ithaca College my degree was in Believe It or Not recreational therapy so my first job out of college I worked in a Children's Hospital for six years in a and I did all of the recreational therapy if I spend two years in the pool doing adapted aquatics I did fitness and sports and games and and then at night I put myself through graduate school I got a master's in exercise physiology and that's when I started getting serious and training clients on the side I was training them in the morning and I started doing youth sports training programs and I was training figure skaters and basketball and USTA tennis players and that's when this whole world Tut kind of started to come together so this was now taking me to the end of 1998 and I started doing sports training got serious about that business and then I said you know let me set up this thing the Internet this is Populi people talking about it right so I set up a little website I gave my neighbor Jonathan he was 12 years old at the time I gave him 20 bucks to help me get the site up I'm from page 98 and that was the beginning like I was really really early in it I loved it I actually almost went to Ithaca I ain't going to quit it be AK but oh yeah yeah I know Quinnipiac it's funny so what what does a lifestyle entrepreneur mean to you because I think a lot of people throw that word around and to me it's kind of like the opposite of the hustlers working 60 hours a week but I'd love to hear your thoughts on what that actually means it's for me it's simply building a business around my life that's it it's it's my wife and I we have four kids and as of this recording there nine eleven thirteen fifteen it's funny even you know we talk about lifestyle I'm filming this outside of the pool and I just hear one of my kids my third note thought it just came lunch dad so but it's it's been able to that it's it's building the business around my lifestyle it's and it's it's just putting them first putting them before money putting them before my business it doesn't mean I slack off it doesn't mean I take naps all day it's just I I schedule my time around that so I know they're all active in sports so there days you know right now it's 2:30 p.m. so as long as I'm home by 2:30 3 o'clock and then I've coached basketball and football and and soccer and I've coached all the sports and I Drive my kids carpooling from 3 till 9 o'clock every night but that's it like I know that's my time so I get up earlier I go to the coffee shop I know you're into virtual teams my whole team is virtual we have I have my morning huddle with my main right-hand person Kate every morning to talk about all of our wins and all the big stuff we can get into some of that but no okay dad's out of the house really early but I'm home at 3:00 and then I'm all theirs and that's that's it and I stopped I used to travel a lot well not a lot maybe once a month I would go speak at these big marketing events and like eight years ago I just stopped I said that's it I'm just not gonna do anymore I turned I walked away from a lot of money but I'm okay with that you know and you have to you might have to make some sacrifices but you have to be okay with it and and I get the whole hustle and grind and all that stuff but I also don't think it's healthy right your body needs to recover like you need recovery and using the whole I grinded 17 hours a day as a Badge of Courage it's badge of honor like oh my God look how its I think it's it does the opposite you're better off having one or two hours a really really super productive focus just shutting everything off time then 18 hours is staying up till 3:00 o'clock in the morning right I agree so let's talk about remote teams are you someone with that that came natural to because I think to some people listening some people that might be using free up or using remote people for the first time that terrifies them they're used to the office they they might not just not have experience hiring people in general talk to me about how you got into that it took me probably three years until I until it hired my first person on a full-time basis I started and it's funny even the first probably year and a half I did everything myself now remember this is the late 90s so technology is not what it was what it is now there was no Facebook there was no streaming video there was none of that stuff so all of the products I would sell were physical I would go to Staples I would photocopy things I put him in three-ring binders I'd go to the post office with garbage bags filled with stuff and CDs and send them out I did all the customer support I did everything and I'm like this is just not the most efficient use of my time at that time I went on a shot one it was similar to what Fripp is but it was one from 50 18 years ago I think at that point maybe it was Elance or maybe it was whatever the iteration was before that and I hired someone just to help with transcriptions that was because that way I knew that was not a good use of my time she did one project then she did another I gave her more work and more work more and slowly I started to trust her and then to the point where I got busy enough he said do you want to come on full-time and she lived all the way in the West Coast I'm in Connecticut she was in Vegas and she stayed with me for 16 years but it it was I was definitely nervous McMahon like to kind of give up a little bit of control and not have them face to face and this was you know this was again almost 20 years ago so it was different now it's pretty common now people are like oh yeah I got Virtual Assistants back then it wasn't really that comments but I was uh I I put my toe in the water first and I got comfortable with the person and then now I think it's better to have it virtual because I did the whole office thing for about a year and a half two years I did not like it it's just everyone there and like the problems and I talk to you for a minute I got much less done and what I found was they're less productive because you know half hour commuting they're half hour you lose an hour right there and then if they're kids sick they have to stay like I'm just just stay home get your stuff done keep in touch with me let's let's have meetings let's do stuff but you do you and I and I want other people to also have a life I don't want them to have to work 24 hours day I want them to be happy because if they're happy they're gonna stick around they're gonna be part of the brand part of the culture and they're gonna be loyal and I have like zero turnover really because I take care of them and they know they have the freedom and I know I'm gonna let them put their family first - I love it I'm in the same boat I opened up an office five six years ago and worse businesses I ever made and not only just the the drama and stuff but I felt like I was creating a nine-to-five job for myself and I had to be there because if I wasn't there nothing was getting done by anybody yeah we can talk about that all day that let's talk about your first height how did that go and do you have any hiring horror stories so she was the one to virtual hire was the one who's Dmitriy who's working for a long time who did the transcriptions and and then another project another project she was in the fur for 17 years we just she I just sold my company called freedom about four months ago so she and I just said to you know what stay with them like do that cuz now I'm building this new company rewind and what she was doing with the whole with was great with with freedom and I'm like this is this a better move for you just kind of stay with them as I sell to them and then I'm kind of starting over I'll never forget to here here's a horror story when I was doing the CDs and packing up and doing all that stuff it was out of our we had a condo at the time in Stamford Connecticut and I needed help I lived in for two we have a lot in common keep going that look at so one of our neighbors this gentleman I said I'm looking for help you know anyone know I said oh my daughter can help but she was I think 16 or 17 at the time so she would she'd come like an hour to after school helped me out pack all the CDs do all the stuff and she was I don't want to say she was a little off like maybe like a little strange that's fine it's cool she was just packing CDs to Anessa and she said do you mind paying me cash said it's fine no problem so I give her cash and then I gave her cash you know for the week and then she comes back that station is Co the money you gave me I lost my god I'm sorry she goes so can you paint give it to me again I said well what do you mean she said well I lost it so can you pay me that again I said but I already paid you she's like no I know but I lost it so I don't have that so could you give me the money again I said you don't understand okay I already paid you like that that's it that's your responsibility and she we for like an hour she could not get it and I'm like that's that's on you and that was that that was the end of that working relationship that was that was interesting that's funny so you have a remote team and you want to manage them you want to have meetings you want to have structure can you tell people how you structure that because I feel like a lot of people struggle on how to do that effectively yeah I think what happens is we so there's there's a few things first I think when you're an entrepreneur you you don't want to start hiring full-time people right out of the gate especially if you're not funded right it's much better to find people who are project-by-project and variable type stuff and to be able to control your costs and keep them virtual don't have that big office but you don't want to get to the point where you where it's you and you and you have 30 people answering to you directly because then that's a nightmare then all you're doing is is managing people all day so the way I like to structure it I like to have my kind of right-hand person my operations person some people call them your integrator right there's a great book rocket fuel where they talk about the visionary and the integrator the integrator so in this business it's Kate so essentially the way it runs is every single morning Kate and I first thing in the morning nine o'clock in the morning we have what's called our morning huddle and it's anywhere from 10 to 20 minutes this is I mean this is really the structure how I run everything first thing before we do anything before we get in the weeds I say what are your wins what were the wins from yesterday and we sort of with the wins oh we we had this great email we got this new thing the new flavor was approved by Bob we go over the wins and then and I share my wins and then we go okay what are we working on and then we just go through the project-by-project stuff and that's it she manages we have then a customer service person who reports directly to Kate Kate will give me the okay here's what we're doing with customer service she's talking to the people who are taking care of the fulfillment you know she'd the fulfillment company I interface a little bit more like the graphics person but she has she's hand talking to the tech person so all of these people report to her and she reports to me rather than me trying to micromanage and manage every single person and we've also tried every type of project management software I mean everything from base camp to asana to you name I've tried it right now what we're playing with and it's working well Kate and I just used a shared Google Doc that's it one document here's our two dues we share we kind of cross things off if I have a little note I put in there that's hard to do it's it's simple but that's really how we're running this big business especially a physical product business with lots and lots of moving parts with products in inventory and fulfillment and and e-commerce and all this stuff we're doing it with a morning huddle and it's so much more freeing because I could I could give it to her and she then manages talk to me about being a leader are you someone that you think it was a natural leader you said you had low turnover a lot of times I has to do with leadership and words that's something that you kind of developed over time um you know that's a good question I I've I think I think I've always kind of been a leader um not like an alpha male there but like I said when I when I was athlete in high school I was I was voted captain my track team in college I was captain even in college I was given the leadership award for my department so I guess I had this kind of natural leadership ability and I think leadership comes down to to one thing and one thing only really it's it's integrity it's my team my staff know they can trust me it's about trust and when whoever I hire through you know whether it's using a system like free up or whatever the program however they come into my world I don't even care I don't want say I don't care but the skills are secondary anyone can learn WordPress anyone could learn how to set a pixel anyone could learn this stuff right but what you can't learn is that that passion and that feeling for the I'm here to serve other people so that to me is more important it's finding those people with the big heart and saying and I'll say from the beginning look we are here if you want to be part of this team rewind we're here to change people's lives it's not you're gonna work 20 hours a day and what's the benefit - bah bah bah that's I don't even talk about that and even when I've done ads in the past I say I don't care your experience don't send me a resume if you send me resume you're not even I'm not even talk to you I don't care about your resume because they make up crap you know I facilitated customer experience you are waiter and that's fine that's cool but you can't be a CBS guy after New York I know when you're full of crap and I say to them instead just write me a letter write me a letter why you're the right person for this job and I just get into the emotion of it and it's about being part of this brand and and changing people's lives it's never been about the money it's about doing the right thing and treating people well and those are the only people I want I will take someone who's a less gifted person but someone who's got a little bit of a hunger so I've always gravitated towards those type of people so you told your business four months ago what was that process like um it was so I thought it was a great business it's a membership site it's teaching entrepreneurship which I've been kind of I started in health online that was my first thing sports and fitness I had the world's first sports training membership site I kind of got pulled into this world of teaching entrepreneurship but I was just not as excited about it anymore it just wasn't my thing and I went through some health challenges of my own and when I got my health back I want to create this bar because that's how I was able to do it starting with winning the morning and I just wasn't as excited about entrepreneurship anymore and teaching it so I ended up I was trying to figure out okay how am I gonna exit this two of my members are guys that I've trained that started with nothing online of doing really well I said one I said you guys I have are smart you get you pick things up quick you're action takers and you've got the right passion and you and you put people first are you interested in buying me out so it was like a couple of months a process that going back and forth they were doing their diligence looking at the books and and we came up with a with a good deal something that made them happy and me happy so it's been great it was and it was a pretty smooth transition and I kept telling my members hey this has come in this transition is happening and I I kind of handed it off and now I'm focused a hundred percent on building building rewind but it's it's funny because people talk about oh I want to do this business get it up and sell it quick they don't realize when you're now look if you want to sell the business for twenty thirty fifty a hundred thousand now it's not that big of a complet snot that complicated people aren't gonna spend two years doing diligence on a 50 thousand dollar deal when you start talking you know seven figure eight figure nine figure type deals it's not as easy as people think I mean there's a lot of work that goes into it and there's a lot of questions that are asked how much are you infused in it you know and if you leave if they pull you out of it does the whole business fall apart you know what's the marketing look like what what's the revenue is it flat as a growing is it going down is it trending so there's a lot of things and is it going to be a strategic buyer or they buying just for the money so there's a there's a lot of things to consider when eventually selling your company cuz this is the third or fourth company I've sold awesome so what talk to us about rewind is it rewind or no are you prefer your from some people say rewind some people say rewind I say every whined but I don't know every it's the same thing you know it's like rewinding a tape so it's just it's a it's a nutrition company we're focusing on our super bars and the bars are vegan gluten free made with all superfoods we have a new line of bars coming out that are have only seven net carbs four grams of sugar and just the best taste in the world they take that that's what we really really focus on is really good taste and rewind it's it's kind of I play with it it's a kind of like the retro theme and and we've got the double meaning of rewinding the years like turning back because I'm gonna be 47 I've never felt better and then there's the rewind of rewinding a cassette tape or VHS tape just we play with that a little bit so we just have fun with the brand and I don't say it's a miracle I don't say you know one secret to losing 50 pounds and we found this ingredient in this remote you know forest and then we slaughter the tribe to steal their vitamins whatever crap I just hate that this is about just being real and and trying to help people and serve them and help them live a better
