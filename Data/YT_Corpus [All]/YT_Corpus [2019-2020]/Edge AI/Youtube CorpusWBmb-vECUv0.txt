 hey guys and welcome back to bunches of lunches i'm jennifer and this week i have more fun but easy lunch ideas to share with you from fun themes to fun activities this week i have so many different ideas to share with you so i hope this video gives you some lunch time inspiration hey guys and welcome to monday now since halloween is less than a week away at this point i'm gonna make today's lunch a little bit spooky this lunch is going to be meat free and i'm making this family style since we're all having lunch together at home today for this lunch i'm going to start by taking one can of refried beans and i'm going to mix that together with some taco seasoning this is like one packet of taco seasoning i know this doesn't look so pretty right now but trust me it's going to taste delicious and i'm just going to mix this all together and then i'm going to spread it on the bottom of a pie plate now don't worry i'm not actually making a pie now that was layer number one but for layer number two i'm gonna be mixing together some sour cream and some cream cheese and you guys this cream cheese is a room temperature i think that part is important to this i'm just adding a little bit of a ranch powder and this is the type of ranch powder that you would use if you're making your own ranch dressing now if you don't have this don't worry you can totally leave it out so i'm just going to mix this all up together and then i'm going to add it on top of the beans for layer number two [Music] now for the next layer i'm going to add some salsa and this is very mild salsa because i want all of my kids to be able to eat this and this isn't a very wet salsa if you're using a salsa that is very juicy you're going to want to drain some of that juice out or just not use it i definitely don't want these layers to get too soggy for the next layer i'm going to be adding some guacamole and of course you could totally make your own guacamole but since i'm going for quick and easy here i'm just using a store-bought container of guacamole this is also a mild version and of course i just love that green color for halloween it's kind of spooky like frankenstein so i'm just spreading this all out and i don't have to go all the way to the edges because that part is going to be covered with something that's coming up next around the edges i'm going to add a sprinkling of cheese this is just some shredded mexican style cheese next i'm going to be adding some tomatoes and since not all of my kids like tomatoes i'm just going to be adding a few and these are actually just cherry tomatoes that i've cut in half that way my girls who don't like tomatoes can easily avoid them now at this point i'm also going to be sprinkling on a few pieces of black olive and some sliced green onions now you guys if you make this dip yourself and you want to you could also add a layer of taco meat in here that would be delicious but i'm just gonna finish this off with a really spooky decoration on the top which is actually really easy i'm just taking some plain sour cream i've added it to a little ziploc baggie and then i snipped off the tip that way i can try my best to squirt out a little webbed design right on the top of the dip and of course i have to finish this off with a little spider ring these are like the kind that you get on top of a cupcake and of course it makes it extra spooky now like i said i'm serving this family style so i'm going to put everything onto this big platter and to go along with the dip i'm also going to be including plenty of celery sticks these are nice and sturdy and perfect for scooping up all those delicious layers and now for the fruit i'm just taking some little mandarin oranges i've already taken the peels off of these and to make them look like little pumpkins i've just added tiny little pieces of celery right on the top this is so easy to do and it comes out cute every time now for a little sweet treat i am gonna go ahead and add just a few of these little cookies these are the pumpkin flavored jojos from trader joe's and then you guys i'm gonna fill in the rest of these spaces with tortilla chips and instead of just adding regular tortilla chips i thought it'd be super cute to use these ones from trader joe's they look like little fall leaves and they come in lots of different colors now to go along with this i'm just going to be serving some water and there you have it guys that is everything for today's lunch [Music] [Applause] now i am super excited for today's lunch it is going to be nut free but it's also going to be bird themed and that's because today's lunch is sponsored by the go go bird flying toy now if you haven't heard of the gogo bird before it's basically the perfect combination of a remote control toy and a toy drone but this one looks and flies like a real bird and you guys this is also really easy to control which makes it a perfect toy for the whole family to enjoy together now i love that this comes with two rechargeable batteries that can charge in just about 20 minutes and i also love that it's very durable which is important with my kids it's made of a really high grade environmentally friendly material which is also flexible and collision resistant the lightweight sort of bouncy material resists damage when it falls and it also has infrared sensor technology which basically means it's capable of flying around obstacles so it doesn't crash into them this little birdie can work indoors or out and it even has a color changing led light on the bottom which makes flying it in the evenings really fun you can find a link to the go go bird flying toy in the description box below and again i'd like to thank goku bird for sponsoring this lunch now you guys for today's a birthday and lunch i'm actually gonna start by making the sweet treat first and since this is bird themed i'm gonna be putting together some hummingbird mini muffins and you guys i'm not quite sure why this is called a hummingbird cake but i can tell you that this recipe is pretty popular in the southern united states and it starts with your basic muffin or cupcake ingredients so we have flour sugar salt then i'm spicing it up with a little bit of cinnamon i'm also adding one beaten egg and you're also going to need to add some oil and in this case i'm choosing to use coconut oil but you could also use a vegetable if that's what you prefer now to turn this into a hummingbird cake i'm definitely going to be adding in some vanilla extract some crushed pineapple some chopped pecans and then you guys just send this over the top i'm also adding in some banana that i've mashed up thoroughly and now all i'm going to do is mix this together well you do want to be careful not to over mix this however because you really want these muffins or cupcakes to stay nice and light so now what i'm going to do is take a mini muffin pan and i'm going to go ahead and add my liners right in here because i do not want these to stick to the pan and to doubly make sure that they don't stick i'm also going to spray them with a little bit of coconut cooking spray and then to make sure that these cook evenly i'm going to use my little cookie scoop to add just a little bit of this batter into each little cup so these are going to be what i like to call two bite muffins because they're that small now i'm just going to add these into the oven at 350 about 12 to 15 minutes and you guys while those are in the oven i'm going to go ahead and prepare some sandwiches my husband made me this a really cute birdhouse cookie cutter and it's my goal to make a peekaboo sandwich but this time i'm not using peanut butter or sprinkles i'm going to start by cutting out the bottom pieces of bread then i'm going to cut out the top pieces of bread but this one is also going to get a small bird shaped cut out of the center that way it looks like a little birdie is hanging out in the birdhouse and now for the filling of this sandwich in this one i'm using some smoky cheese and some ham i'm gonna check it out you guys these came out so cute to make these look even more like birdhouses i'm going to add little pretzel sticks on the bottom just like this for the fruit in today's lunch i'm going to give each kid a little mandarin orange i did go ahead and peel these already i'll fill up the rest of this section with more raspberries and then for the vegetable i'm adding a combination of celery sticks and carrots and to go along with the bird theme i did go ahead and cut these carrots into these cute little penguin shapes and speaking of penguins i'm also adding in some of these are really cute penguin cheese crackers these are a lot like goldfish but i get these ones at aldi and that gives me just enough space for the humming bird muffins and then i'm going to finish off these lunches with a little bit of bird themed apple juice and again i'd like to thank goku bird for sponsoring this lunch my favorite part was the celery and ranch my favorite pipe was the muffin and the sandwich my favorite part was um the muffin and the penguin cheese crackers my favorite for the muffin hey guys and happy wednesday so for today's lunch i've got my kids in the kitchen to help me out we are gonna try to make a pumpkin shaped pizza and instead of using store-bought pizza dough mackenzie is actually gonna make some dough for us mackenzie has become our resident bread maker in fact she knows how to use this machine more than i do all you have to do is add one cup of water a teaspoon of salt one tablespoon of butter then three cups of flour then two teaspoons of yeast you have to get it in just right like this and then turn because it unlocks it all right looks good on the sides it's all sticky it's like it's not slime but it looks like so you can see it can you see it's like fine yes i need the edge to be like more more smooth see how it's like bumpy okay maybe if you go like this no i'm not i feel like we should watch a movie what movie should we watch watch harry potter movie again yeah that's a good halloween movie harry potter so now that we have the pizza all shaped like a pumpkin lily's going to go ahead and add the sauce and now griffin mckenzie and lily are going to be adding on the cheese this is mostly going to be mozzarella cheese with just a little sprinkle of [Music] cheddar and then lastly we're also going to add some turkey pepperoni i'm going to add on the little face part and then the kids are going to add pepperoni all around the outside and check it out you guys this turned out so cute now i'm gonna go ahead and get this in the oven it's only gonna take about 10 to 12 minutes and while i'm doing that the girls are gonna put together some salad because we love having salad with our pizza [Music] and now the very last thing we're adding on to this lunch is the applesauce that's what jackson picked out so that's what we're going to have and these ones are extra cute because there's little halloween characters on the outside hey guys and welcome to thursday now today's lunch is not going to be halloween or pumpkin themed instead i'm going with an everything apple themed right now the stores near me do have a lot of pumpkin spice flavored things but they also have a lot of apple flavored things for fall so that's what we're going with and for this lunch i'm actually gonna start by making dessert first you guys i'm gonna making some super simple and adorable apple pie cookies and these are really easy like i said you only need a pie crust i'm just using one from the store you're also going to need canned apple pie filling one egg and some cinnamon and sugar now to get started i need to open up my can of apple pie filling and because these apples are pretty big i'm going to go ahead and chop them up a bit now i love using this pampered chef tool to chop things up but if you don't have one of these no problem you can just use a knife or a fork you just want to get the apple pieces pretty small so that they fit well in the cookies now moving on to our pie crust now the box that i bought actually comes with two little rounds of dough and i'm gonna be using both of them for one of them i'm going to start by cutting out some circles i can get about nine cookies out of this amount of dough and to these i'm just going to add about a teaspoon of filling you really don't want to add too much here or it might just ooze out everywhere next i'm going to take the egg that i've already beaten up and i'm going to brush the outside of these little rounds and that's really going to help this cookie stick together because what i'm going to do next is to top these apple pie cookies with more dough just so that they look a little bit more like a pie and of course you could go ahead and make a lattice with these strips of dough but i'm just keeping this simple so i'm just going in one direction and then the other and now before i put these into the oven i am gonna brush each one with a little bit more of the egg wash this is gonna help the outside to brown and then last but not least i'm gonna take a little bit of sugar and cinnamon i'm going to mix those together and then i'm going to sprinkle a little bit at the top of each cookie now i don't know about you guys but i love crispy sugar on the top of my pie crust that's how my grandma used to do it so that's how i do it too now i'm gonna go ahead and pop these into my oven at 350 for about 15 to 18 minutes and you guys while those are in the oven i'm gonna put together some chicken and apple salad now i know that sounds weird but trust me this is a really good and it goes with our everything apple theme now this chicken salad starts off a lot like most recipes i have some chopped chicken some celery onions i've chopped both of these pretty fine next i'm adding some craisins some chopped up pecans usually when i'm making chicken salad i'll add almonds but this time i'm using pecans and then for the special ingredient in this recipe i'm going to add in some chopped apples this is a mixture of both tart granny smith apples and sweet gala apples i just love that combination and these are really going to add a lot of good crunch to this chicken salad now to keep these apples from turning brown and to give this chicken salad extra flavor i'm also squirting in some lemon juice next i'm going to add in a good amount of mayonnaise and i'm really just eyeballing this here i'm not measuring it at all you just want to add as much as you like and then i'm going to finish it off with just a little bit of salt and pepper [Music] now i'm just going to give this a big stir to kind of mix everything together and if i need to add a little bit more mayo or salt or pepper i will definitely do that too and then check it out you guys to go with our apple themed lunch i put some of this chicken salad on some sandwich bread that i cut out in an apple shape next to go along with this apple theme i'm also going to give the kids some of this honey caramel apple donut flavored yogurt now i haven't tried this before i picked it up at aldi but it sounds really good so i'm just going to add a little bit onto the trays in this section i'm also going to add a few extra apple slices and now to give this some crunch i'm just gonna add a little bit of granola to the top of this yogurt and this is actually an apple streusel flavored granola which goes perfectly for this apple themed lunch now i couldn't think of any apple themed vegetables so i'm just going to keep that simple by adding in some celery and carrot sticks and then of course now that they're all cooled down i can also add one of our apple pie cookies these turned out so good and my entire house smells amazing and now to finish off this lunch of course i'm going to be giving the kids some apple cider as well and their favorite kind of apple cider is the martinelli's hey guys and happy friday now today the kids only had a half day of school left so we're having lunch at the magic kingdom right now they have all of the halloween decorations out you can also see the halloween characters around the park and for today's lunch we're going with a special halloween menu item these are called hades nachos and basically this is a huge pile of black bean chips then on top there is some buffalo chicken and they also give you a little bit of tomatoes and lettuce on the side oh yes there's also sour cream salsa and jalapenos now my older kids are really liking these nachos and i think they're pretty tasty too they're not too spicy but my younger kids they prefer uncrustables so i did go ahead and pack those i also brought some frozen capri suns and some frozen applesauce pouches now for today's special treat we're all gonna be sharing this one ginormous cupcake this is called the not so poison apple cake and it's actually a huge apple flavored cupcake with nuts and butter cream it is so big so it's perfect for sharing now if you enjoyed this video please give it a big thumbs up and hit that red
