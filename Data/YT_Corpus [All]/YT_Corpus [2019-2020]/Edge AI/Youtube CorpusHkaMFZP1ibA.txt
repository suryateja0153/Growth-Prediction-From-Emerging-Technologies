 [MUSIC]  Hi. I'm Manash Goswami. I'm from the IoT solutions team at Microsoft. Today what I'm going to present here is our Vision AI Developer Kit. What this is showing is a piece of hardware which is our reference solution for developers to build their vision AI services. This device is connected to the Azure Machine Learning Service and uses Azure IoT Edge to deliver custom vision solutions through the machine-learning cloud service, and deployed into the edge device as deep learning containers. The machine learning service that we have can enable this device to run the AI model directly on the DSP of this processor which allows you to get near real-time inferencing results as you can see from the display overhead here. This device is not connected to anything else but to power an HDMI, and it's all the AI is running on this device. Come build your AI solutions in visionaidevkit.com. [MUSIC]
