 Hello. I'm Altaf Khan, representing INFXL. We develop ultra-efficient embedded AI that is tailor-made for IoT edge devices. Our AI works on microcontrollers, DSPs, graphics chips as well as FPGAs Our AI inference engine works on microwatts making it ideal for battery-operated devices like wearables Our inference engine is tiny. It fits in 110 bytes on a microcontroller making it capable of real-time inference It requires only a few kilobytes of memory and it runs on chips that cost less than 25 cents Our training process is designed for people who are not AI experts Moreover, the trained network is delivered in the form of very simple code that is easy to incorporate in embedded projects The use cases of our AI can be divided into three groups: real-time applications, battery-operated devices, and applications where cost is an issue Before discussing these use cases I want to talk about smart sensors The key difference between smart and conventional sensors is that conventional sensors continuously broadcast data whereas smart sensors use AI to broadcast only the important data This is very critical because of the IoT data overload problem IoT sensors are capturing just too much data It is impossible to manage all that data in the cloud Conventional sensors are uploading lots of raw data continuously INFXL's AI solves this problem by intelligently processing data right at the edge thereby reducing transmitted data by a factor of a thousand in many instances Let us get back to the use cases now Our technology is ideal for smart battery-operated wearables due to its ultra-low power consumption Predictive maintenance is an important need of the manufacturing industry but it is expensive and is prescribed for expensive machinery only Our AI can run on hardware costing only a handful of dollars and therefore can be used to ensure the health of even cheaper machinery Whereas predictive maintenance ensures long and economic operation condition monitoring predicts imminent, catastrophic failures Here the ultra-low latency characteristic of our AI is of huge importance The ultra-low latency characteristic is also very desirable when you are trying to predict the data traffic on a telecom base station Low latency is also essential when you are trying to detect malware in real-time INFXL's AI has applications in many industries from manufacturing to health care to automotive Our AI is optimized for data coming from sensors like accelerometers, pressure sensors, biochemical sensors We have tested our technology on many, many application areas On large networks, on small networks, using gigabytes of training data Our first customer was SparkCognition, out of Austin, Texas They were interested in the low-latency aspect of our technology We were able to speed up malware detection for them by a factor of 10 Our technology is accessible through the web. Just upload the data and receive your optimized AI within 24 hours This is the front page of our Web portal. You log-in and You will be taken to the files upload page. Upload the two training files and you'll receive your highly efficient AI the very next day Currently companies in the semiconductor and telecom industries and a wearable manufacturer are trialing our technology on DSPs, FPGAs, and microcontrollers We are a Texas-based company. We registered in 2018 but have been working in this area since 1992 and we are currently self-funded We offer a world-class technology that is available for immediate use Our main application areas are industrial IoT, automotive, and wearables We are looking for partners who want to turbocharge the capabilities of their products by embedding world-class AI within them We desire partners with deep domain knowledge and large customer bases We highly appreciate your interest in INFXL We are looking forward to talking to you very soon
