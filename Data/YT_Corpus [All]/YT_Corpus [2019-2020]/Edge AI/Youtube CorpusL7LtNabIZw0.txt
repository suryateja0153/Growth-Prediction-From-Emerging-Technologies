 [Music] hi I'm Stephanie and today I'll show you how Google clouds visual inspection products can help you improve the efficiency of the manufacturing visual quality control processes in the world of manufacturing current market volatility leads to huge operational pressures you're first in line to respond quickly to decrease demand disruption in the supply chain and interrupted retail channels business continuity becomes P zero and the weight of reducing costs falls on your shoulders naturally leveraging AI to improve work efficiency becomes the light at the end of the tunnel as you start to explore more ways to advance automation control manufacturing processes remotely and enable a remote workforce in the last several years visual inspection technologies have been helping manufacturers ease these operational pressures image recognition is being used for electronic part classification retail Quality Assurance and even food inspection yet it can be difficult and costly to implement these technologies traditional inspection machinery can cost millions of dollars per device setting up and deploying AI for inspection not only needs a reliable IT infrastructure and expert resources but there's usually a limited amount of sample data to start with on top of that training ml models can be extremely challenging time-consuming and can require a specialized skill set that not all companies have access to take these defective parts for instance factory workers are often tasked with finding these discreet defects on the production line these small marks can be extremely subtle making it hard for even a human eye to be able to see it's no surprise that this process can be time consuming and inefficient this is why Google cloud has a rich offering for visual inspection products which reduces the pressure on ground workers and AI developers and increases time to value it optimizes for several steps of the visual inspection process from data ingestion to production model optimization google clouds visual inspection products do this by enabling customers to efficiently pre process minimal images for model training then it bends the data and trains automatically so you can quickly deploy the model locally and run inferencing at the production line better yet you can continuously improve the model by using fresh data collected from production lines to retrain the model in the cloud giving you increased accuracy as you discover new use cases here's what an end-to-end architecture would look like once a camera is set up on the production line users can collect images and store them on the factory floor server from here the images are uploaded to Google Cloud using the visual inspection AI products to begin model training let's say you want to inspect an assembled product to find defective components like damaged glass on devices labeling thousands of devices is probably the last thing you want to do instead using Google Cloud visual inspection AI products you can upload images for a new product component and the solution can automatically extract this component after you label a few images the model will analyze all loaded images to automatically identify the subset of the data with defects or anomalies along the way you'll have a chance to review current model performance for defect detection using built in metrics like average precision precision and recall after downloading and deploying the trained model inferencing can be efficiently done locally on your factory floor for rapid edge performance and when an unlabeled image comes in the deployed model can predict new defects automatically results can then be viewed in the central cloud dashboard giving prediction details and a place to correct inspections using Google clouds inspection products you can train customized ml models in the cloud with minimum amount of label images leverage scalable cloud infrastructure for distributed training and optimized costs enable production workloads within weeks versus months efficiently deploy models and run inferencing at production lines on-premise for low latency and it's not just useful for automating the detection of defective devices Google Cloud visual inspection products can support a wide range of discrete manufacturing use cases such as cosmetic defect detection and edge detection for electronics surface quality control for automotives optical wafer a defect detection for semiconductors and fabric or packaging quality control for consumer packaged goods using Google Cloud visual inspection products you can increase the throughput and efficiency of your ml models improve overall operations and augment your workers ability to guarantee the highest quality products land in the hands of your customer reach out to your google cloud rep to learn how you can deploy visual inspection solutions using cloud AI products and visit the google cloud vision AI page to learn more about our products [Music]
