 Hello, welcome to IEI product introduction the product we are going to present today is ITG-100AI I’m Judy, the product manager and I will be your host So the spotlight today is IEI’s brand-new box PC, ITG-100AI an ultra-compact AI edge computing device let’s take a look at the basic features first. This small giant is a fanless din-rail embedded system developed to fulfill increasingly demanding small-sized box PC market and intensively growing requirement for AI solution Don’t underestimate the capability because of its mini volume ITG-100AI is equipped with Intel Atom E3930 CPU it has all the basic I/Os to offer, LAN ports, serial ports display output, USB ports and also includes expansion slots for Wi-Fi function And if you are interested in a higher performance CPU with quad-core, the product is also available for E3940 with completely the same features and the same working temperature The most incredible thing about ITG-100AI is that it has built-in VPUs allowing this small giant run as AI inference workstation So there is a mini PCIe form factor module card Mustang-MPICE-MX2, pre-installed in the system and two VPUs are placed on the module card VPU, which stands for vision processing unit in short its ability is to boost the system so it could run AI faster and achieve higher power efficiency it is best suited for low power consumption applications such as surveillance, retail and transportation Later on, after the product introduction we'll have a short demo showing what ITG-100AI could do I think this should give you a better picture. To speak more about this mini PCIe module card as you can see from the photo above these two Intel Movidius Myriad X VPUs could dedicate Deep Neural Network topologies, with the advantage of power efficiency and high performance it is perfect to be implemented in AI edge computing device such as ITG-100AI to reduce total power usage providing longer duty time for the rechargeable edge computing equipment. And just for your information, Mustang-MPCIE-MX2 is fully developed and manufactured by IEI team. As the main dish for today is not the module card, I will stop here If you are interested in the module card or curious whether IEI has other VPU products to offer and the answer is yes we'll provide our contact info at the end please reach us! Back to the subject. You may wonder how can this small device satisfy storage requirements Well, don’t worry, IEI got it all sorted out We have fully utilized the space the more the merrier we believe so we provide three options First, a 128GB SATADOM is included installed right next to the VPU card. Second, a microSD card slot is available at the side of the device and last but not least, there is always a space for an optional EMMC 5.0 which can support up to 32GB The next three slides are about demonstrating the cosmetic and I/Os of ITG-100AI but I think it is better to show it directly as the device is already standing by waiting to be unveiled Here’s the leading role today As you can see, clean and simple outlines and it is really small, only the size of my palm We’ve selected two colors navy blue and silver to represent the coolness and solidness of high-end technology. The symmetric heat sink design is not just only for displaying balanced beauty but also has taken functionality into account I will show you in a bit So the I/Os are placed at two sides The power button, USBs, LAN, and serial ports are at the front and power input and VGA at the top ITG-100AI is designed to be compatible with two types of mounting either install the machine upright like this using din-rail, or set it down this way with wall mount Now let's go back to the slides and take a look at the internal architecture I was talking about the two heat sinks are not just only for aesthetic purpose this heat sink on the bottom is for CPU, and the one opened is for VPU As you can imagine when the VPU module card is running it also generates heat so this entire heat sink is designed to dissipate exclusively for VPU After all these introductions of ITG-100AI we would like to show you a short demo so you could have a better picture of what ITG-100AI can do. This is a demo about ITG-100AI working together with Mustang-MPCIE-MX2. We will be showing you two applications the topology we are using for this demonstration is RNNET-SSD the first demo as you can see on the left the application scenario is traffic control the system will identify and classify the object running on the road whether it is a car or a motorcycle and counts how many vehicles have passed by as you can see yellow indicates car and red for motorcycles the colors and what objects are to be identified could all be customized according to user preference the second demo is applied to driver wariness detection in some cases such as trucks or greyhound drivers they have high chances to drive long distance and this could get really tired so the system can detect whether the driver is getting tired by catching how many times the driver has blinked or yawned let me show to you so you can see every time I blink or yawn the number would go up here and there are two indicators on the bottom right the left one indicates drowsiness which means if the driver blinks or yawns too much the indicator would go up the right one indicates distraction normally when you drive you should always look to the front but if you got distracted somehow and starting to look around the distraction indicator will go up and when reaching a certain point the system will trigger the alarm so the alarming point can also be customized by user preference now this is our demo for ITG-100AI and let's go back to the slides after the demonstration of ITG-100AI at the end I would like to point out some of the important factors of this product that I have not brought about throughout this video it supports a 9 to 36 V DC input the operating temperature ranges from 0 to 50 degrees Celsius it has passed rigid shock and vibration test and of course ITG-100AI is certified with CE and FCC standards so this is all for today I hope I have somewhat brought your interest to this outstanding small giant, ITG-100AI if you want to know more about our products you can visit IEI official website or contact us you can also follow IEI's other social media accounts to get the latest product information and company news don't miss the premiere on every Monday at 8 o'clock a.m. Welcome to comment and share this video thank you for staying with us today, see you next time
