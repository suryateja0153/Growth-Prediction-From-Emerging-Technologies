 in this video i'm reviewing the starkey livio edge ai hearing aids coming up [Music] hi guys cliff olson doctor of audiology and founder of applied hearing solutions in phoenix arizona and on this channel i cover a bunch of hearing related information to help make you a better informed consumer so if you're into that make sure you hit that subscribe button and don't forget to click the bell to receive a notification every time i post a new video starkey hearing technologies has always been one of the most innovative hearing aid manufacturers out there in 2014 they were one of the companies that pioneered the made for iphone hearing aids and in 2018 they were one of the first hearing aid manufacturers to use artificial intelligence inside of their hearing aids with the starkey livio ai well they have continued to push the envelope by developing technology that blurs the lines even more between hearing aids and biometric tracking devices the new livio edge ai hearing aids has all the same great features that you could find in the livio ais that came before it with a few key feature additions that make it even better than its predecessor as a hearing aid the libio edge ai comes in five different technology levels the most advanced tier is the i-2400 followed by the i-2000 the i-1600 the i-1200 and the i-1000 in general the lower in technology that you go results in fewer features and reduced customizability which can limit your hearing care provider's ability to optimize the performance of these devices now starkey has added a new form factor with the livio edge ais but let's cover what you can get you can get a receiver in canal rechargeable hearing aid you can also get a battery version of this a disposable battery version of this you can get a size 13 bte so a size 13 battery and a behind-the-ear device that uses a tube and an ear mold but the most exciting part about this is you can now get a rechargeable custom hearing aid so no more batteries with these custom in the ear devices and you still get all the same great features that you can get with the receiver and canal and the bte hearing aids in my opinion the custom livio edge ai is the most significant innovation that we have seen in the hearing aid world since 2018 when we saw the release of technology that could connect directly with an android device and the other cool thing about this product is that it can come in a variety of different colors so you don't have to get black hearing aid manufacturers are starting to make some of their devices go this black color route just because they're trying to make it look more like a consumer electronic since there's eventually going to be people who purchase these products even if they don't have hearing loss now just in case you're unaware starkey is really well known for their custom products and on top of that you can actually have 3d ear scans taken of your ears inside of your hearing care provider's clinic and those scans can be sent off to starkey which in my opinion makes for an even better custom fit this is what their custom product looks like inside of my ear now this is a cic so completely in the canal hearing aid of course i like the color black on these you can get like i mentioned before any color that you want that matches your skin tone the weird thing about these though is that you have to have the charging contacts on the outside facing part of the face plate here so if you look at that you can see there's kind of like gold markings on there and that is so these devices can attach to the charger now this is a pretty cool thing because it's magnetic if you just kind of pop them up like that they go right into place so if you have poor finger dexterity anything like that all you have to do is take it out just kind of drop it into place and then it starts charging for you of course like i mentioned before the receiver in canal also comes in a lithium rechargeable version and these come in a variety of different colors as well i tend to like to match my hair color with these devices you can get a size 312 disposable battery as well but this is what it looks like on my ear back onto the charging aspect of these hearing aids the other thing that's important to note is that you can store charges inside of the case so you don't have to have it plugged in and they also have a space here that you can put a desiccant in i'm a huge fan of being able to dehydrate your hearing aids especially if you live in a humid climate or you sweat a lot moisture is the enemy of electronics and you want to make sure that you get all that moisture pulled out at nighttime when you're charging your devices the charger still has a magnetic aspect to it now you do have metal contacts on the bottom so it's not technically inductive charging but it's very easy just to pop these hearing aids in they go into exactly the right spot so if you have again bad finger dexterity it won't really matter they're super easy to put in the charger and they're super easy to get out as well in terms of the features for the livio edge ai hearing aids there are a ton of them and i can't do them all justice inside of this review video so i'm going to give you a brief overview of each one of them and i'll probably be doing more detailed videos down the road so let's go ahead and start with the low hanging fruit of the different features and the first one is streaming from your smart device and i say smart device because no longer do you just have to have an iphone you can now stream directly from your android phone into your hearing aids as well as long as you have a newer android phone that has the android 10 operating system and bluetooth version 5. thanks to the new asha bluetooth protocol you'll now be able to connect your livio edge ai hearing aids directly with your android phone which is something that you could not do with the livio ai hearing aids setting up this streaming for android is a little bit on the tricky side but you can eventually get it to work as long as your hearing care professional knows what they're doing they should be able to set this up for you in the office connecting with an iphone is still as simple as ever on a side note if you do have difficulty connecting your devices to your phone i do have a bluetooth video guide that i will also link in the description of this video once you get your hearing aids connected to your smart device you will be able to stream audio directly into both of your hearing aids so this includes phone calls music podcasts youtube videos whatever you can stream audio wise that can go directly into your hearing devices the only limitation that i really see with this is that you can't truly be hands-free you still need to use your phone as the microphone that you're talking into so the person on the other end of the line can understand you you also now have access to a variety of assistive listening devices this includes remote microphones a table microphone a remote control and a tv streamer which can improve your performance even more especially in noisy situations and for those of you out there who want a telecoil inside of your hearing aids they have that too the thrive app is so full feature that i definitely need to make an entire video review of this app but in general you can do things like increase and decrease volume make frequency adjustments using a 4-band equalizer track your body score to show how physically active you've been track your brain score to show how much you have used your hearing aids and how socially engaged you have been and you can track your heart rate which i suspect is pretty high right now due to your excitement of this review you can also activate different assistive listening devices and adjust streaming volume and hearing aid microphone volume separately a few other features include a find my hearing aid function that will tell you the last known location of your devices which can come in particularly handy if you misplace your hearing aids a hearing aid self check which i think is the coolest thing about the app because it can tell you if your hearing aids are mechanically functioning properly or if you need to have your hearing care professional repair your devices you also have the ability to do language translation hearing care anywhere and thrive care inside of the app as well let's talk about these last three app features in a little more detail language translation is obviously pretty cool because it allows you to communicate with someone else who does not speak the language that you do so let's go ahead and test it out here real quick i'm going to say something in french and see what it translates it into english par de vous francais do you speak french it says it right there if you can see it it's a pretty cool feature obviously there's a couple of things about it that aren't fantastic there is a little bit of a delay there you have to basically uh tap this in order to say something and if you have someone who's a really fast talker it becomes a problem because you just don't have the capability to translate that fast the hearing care anywhere feature is the remote programming capability that these devices have with your hearing care professional so if you are noticing some issues with your programming you can let your hearing care professional know they can make changes to your programming in the software in their office and then send those changes to your phone that you can then upload into your hearing aids now as far as remote programming goes starkey is definitely at the bottom of the list in comparison to other manufacturers here they can only do asynchronous programming changes meaning they can only just send you packages to your phone for you to upload and if you don't like those you have to request another one and request another one and another one and it just becomes really tedious uh and ridiculous in my opinion it would be much better if they were synchronous like most of the other manufacturers out there which means you actually schedule a time with your hearing care professional you jump on your phone and you actually have a live session with your hearing care provider so they can be making a bunch of different changes all at once making sure that you're liking them before ultimately saving those settings inside of your hearing aids if starkey had to improve one thing with these hearing devices it would absolutely be the hearing care anywhere feature they have a lot of ground to make up on the other manufacturers now the thrive care feature there is a really cool feature now think about it you have a lot of individuals who wear hearing aids that are in an advanced stage of life who may still be somewhat independent but they kind of need a caretaker maybe for a few things or they have their children who are kind of monitoring the status of their health and you can have a caretaker or family member be tapped directly into the data of the hearing aid so you can track things like physical activity how much they're getting up and moving around you can track things like social engagement which is really important for cognitive health down the road and you can also get notifications for falls the motion sensors inside of the starkey livio edge ai hearing aids can detect if someone has actually fallen and send a notification to a caretaker or a family member for them to acknowledge and to contact help if they need to this fall detection feature has literally saved lives of individuals who wear starkey hearing aids which is pretty impressive because i'm not sure you could say that about any other feature inside of a hearing aid at this point the thrive assistant is kind of like an amazon alexa or a google assistant in that you can ask it a question and it will give you a response in return and you can activate this by either double tapping your hearing devices or going into the app to activate it you can then ask it a question like what's the weather today and it will give you that response inside of your devices so if you're someone who likes to do that around the house with different voice activated systems and bots to get these responses then you'll probably love this feature as well now perhaps the most talked about new feature of the livio edge ai hearing aids is the feature that really gives it its name which is edge mode edge artificial intelligence is actually pretty cool and if you want to check out some other videos that are out there on the internet about edge artificial intelligence they're absolutely worth the watch but edge artificial intelligence basically means that you can perform artificial intelligence directly on board the hardware so you don't have to be connected to a smart device in order to have the artificial intelligence work so you can literally leave your smartphone at home and you can still have artificial intelligence operate inside of your hearing aids all right so the way that edge mode works is it uses this artificial intelligence inside of the hearing aids in order to optimize your ability to hear in a complex listening situation all you have to do is tap on your device or however your hearing care professional chose to set this up for you in order to activate edge mode and instead of me trying to explain what this is going to be like let's just go ahead and listen to a sound sample no now i think that it's pretty evident based on that sound sample that edge mode absolutely improves the ability for you to understand speech in a noisy environment the only thing that i just really can't wrap my head around is why they wouldn't make this the default why they wouldn't make this happen all the time so you don't have to activate it and deactivate it and reactivate it and deactivate it all the time and i understand that there's some kind of question of whether or not if it did it on its own if it would really sound natural as it switches in and out of it all the time but at the end of the day it's something that i would really like to see but i don't want to sound like i'm getting greedy here i mean edge mode is absolutely a really cool feature they can definitely pull out more speech in a complex listening situation and if you told basically anybody that all you have to do to hear better in that noisy situation is to just tap on your hearing aids i think they'd be okay to do that now all these features are great but the one thing that i worry about a little bit is these individuals who are not necessarily tech savvy working with these hearing aids yes they would be great for individuals who have caretakers or who have family members who take care of them but if you yourself are not a very tech savvy individual these are going to be really complicated for you to try to figure out all these different features and your hearing care professional will have a lot of work cut out for them to try to train you on all the different things that you can do with these hearing aids but if you are in fact a tech savvy individual you'll probably feel right at home with these hearing aids and it'll probably be hard for you to ever go back from a device that does all of these things back to a more traditional hearing aid that doesn't have all these cool features all in all the starkey livio edge ai hearing aids are absolutely amazing pieces of technology but just remember it does not matter how awesome your hearing aids are unless your hearing care professional can get the most out of your devices and that means that they follow best practices including realer measurement and so if you are unaware of what best practices are or what real ear measurement is i highly recommend that you check out my videos that i will also link in the description that's it for
