 hi I'm Angie Echota and I'm a p.m. on the Azure intelligence Solutions Group and with me today is my colleague Dave Armour you want introduce yourself hi I'm Dave Armour I work with on J I specialize in customers using our solutions in the manufacturing industry right and we're here today to talk to you about how we designed researched and built a solution that we think will help manufacturers get started very quickly and with no data science experience modernizing their factory lines with AI at the edge so on the agenda for today we've got what is the intelligent edge and there are products that make it up the Azure stack family our family of products that are designed to bring intelligence and Azure services right to your data center or other location kind of the efforts we've done to make developing and creating content and programs for the Azure stack family easier our ideas and customer conversations around how we came up with a manufacturing solution and how we designed it our development and review process and finally we'll show you the product we came up with so I guess first what is the intelligent edge so our CEO Satya Nadella has this idea that there's an intelligent cloud and an intelligent edge the intelligent cloud is a hyper scale computer that is available to everyone and can act in any capacity and the intelligent edge is devices up from microcontrollers up to servers that live outside of the Azure data centers and that provide lots of data that can be analyzed either right at the edge or streamed into Azure for further analysis in archival so when you combine these two approaches at the intelligent cloud in the intelligent edge you get what's called a hybrid cloud and so in a hybrid cloud is great for quite a few reasons you get the ability to operate in areas with little or no connectivity you can cache things and then submit them up to the cloud whenever you get internet connection back you can maybe meet some regulatory requirements things like data has to stay within the boundaries of a certain country or even you know I need to speed up things I need low latency because I need results now maybe you're dealing with some very time-sensitive process and you don't want to worry about the bandwidth limitations to the cloud it's also a great reason to use a hybrid approach and most enterprises that we talk to don't ever totally use an enterprise cloud or an enterprise edge they use a combination of both again it's that hybrid approach or a multi cloud strategy that allows customers to have the flexibility of choice to meet their needs and allows Microsoft to provide an array of options that make our customers happy so the Azure hybrid family consists of three parts there's the Azure stack integrated systems and Azure stack edge which make up devices that sit outside the customer data center and provide as your API so there's Azure arc which is a way to manage artifacts in any data center on any device through Azure and azure IOT which is the lab you know very small devices analyzing and provisioning thousands and hundreds of thousands of those devices getting all that data aggregating it and making sense of it and allowing it to accelerate your business so when we think about this let's talk about the azure intelligent and cloud taxonomy how Microsoft sees different segments of this continuum so at the smallest level there's the microcontroller which is things like as your sphere with secure Linux OS that's hardened against attack and the next level up is IOT devices and edge devices these are devices that can aggregate data from multiple sensors or maybe add a little bit logic of their own or they need more power like analyzing video at the edge and further up from that our edge appliances like as your stack edge which allows for purpose-built hardware accelerated machine learning at the edge and further up is as your stack hub as your stack hub provides full Azure services at the edge with a full portal the full set of API is that you come to expect from Azure and of course at the farthest end of the continuum is the hyper scale cloud with regions that span the globe and can be scaled up at will so the focus the parts are gonna focus on today are the azure stack edge and as your stack hub David if you'd like to talk about the Azure stack portfolio sure when we talk about Azure stack edge we're really talking about a cloud managed appliance this is an appliance that you could put into a remote facility and then you manage it from a sure this allows you to provision resources like machine learning at your edge or IOT solutions at the edge again you manage this from the with in Azure and you reach into that device remotely another handy capabilities devices that you can as the network is free stream up the data back to the cloud so you could do future analysis on it as your stack HCI is a way for you to modernize your operations around your virtualization technologies that you are already familiar with this is kind of an ideal solution in your branch office or for high-performance workloads address that hub is a cloud native integrated system where you get an entire instance of the azure cloud that you could put within your own facility that autonomous cloud can be disconnected from the internet or connected to the Internet you have the choice for doing that and it allows you to meet your data sovereignty and maybe your contractual responsibilities as well as start to modernize using cloud native technologies within your corporate network sounds great so I think what we're gonna go into today are again Azure stack edge and Azure stack hub let's take a little bit deeper dive into those products so as David said Azure stack code provides an autonomous cloud on-premises that's great for disconnected solutions things that require regulatory approval or regulatory boundaries for your data and application modernization to take legacy applications that exist in systems of record that are legacy and upgrade them to modern micro services based or kubernetes based applications so that's an extension of Azure which means it has the same tools the experiences the deployments the application patterns operations and automations and we have a lot of azure services available on premises we also have a lot of them coming soon uh David if you'd like to talk about the services that are coming soon since that's you know what you do every day currently under development our IOT hub in event hubs those are full resource providers that will allow you to do advanced messaging as well as IOT management too and two-way communication between them kubernetes based on our aks service and Azure allowing you to manage your container applications sequel 2019 is also under development we will be bringing high scale high volume sequel capabilities in later this year hopefully as well as you can see blockchain cognitive services stream analytics and API management right so as you can see we're constantly bringing new services down from Azure to Azure stack hub this is again like that consistency and innovation flow that we always promise that we're working to take the things that we build for the hyper scale cloud and bring them down to the public to the hybrid cloud and the private cloud Azure stack hub is offered as a purpose-built integrated system which means that the hardware the architecture in the system topology as well as deployment services are all provided by a single point of contact you work with your hardware provider to order the system and then it gets delivered set up and integrated to your network and a white glove experience this also means that you have one area for support if something breaks with the hardware or with the software you still go to Microsoft and we work with the hardware provider to make sure you get taken care of this provides a seamless experience that allows you to work on what you care about you know developing applications and growing your business right a lot of those things people used to do it all by themselves and having automated processes for each of those really makes a big difference for adopting cloud technology inside your own facility yeah absolutely application modernization is a huge benefit of azure stack up so then there's Azure stack edge it provide it's a purpose-built abite our current model is a 1u server class device it provides hardware accelerated machine learning it has FPGAs onboard that allow us to do we built ML models and accelerate them way faster they could ever run on the CPU we also have a few new features coming out for Azure stack edge which includes the ability to have GPU Hardware on board based on invidious t4 which allow us to further accelerate our machine landing inferencing capabilities we have edge compute which the ability to run VMs containers and kubernetes clusters on some Azure stack edge devices and this is all managed and provisioned through Azure so this means that you pay by the month or as you stack edge you can literally go to the edge of portal hit new and one will show up at your doorstep and you get it all you can eat for one month so again this is what's coming in the future the ability to have hardware accelerated learning with NVIDIA t4 GPUs or Intel FPGAs you can use Azure ml or your own system until a chain to develop ml models and you could train at the edge with a GPU based device we have edge compute with the ability to run as your VMs and scale across and build a pivot IDs cluster and you know of course this is all managed from Azure and you with Azure arc you'll be able to manage these workloads as well for measure and create policies and there's a cloud storage gateway that as David mentioned you can take data copy it from your network to the device and when bandwidth is free or you get an internet connection back or at a certain time of night or day that data will be streamed as and for further archival and analysis allowing you to take get out of your local location hardware accelerated machine learning on Azure stack edge allows us to get data locally where there is a where it's generated to get immediate results this is things like if I have a lot of video to analyze I don't want to ship all that data over the internet and bring the results back I can simply analyze the data throw away anything that's useless and then only send the relevant things to the cloud that saves me money it saves me time it says you'd bandwidth and it saves me space and you could take action on things that connect to local systems or are behind a firewall so kind of the goals behind these solutions are that and in our previous efforts are that customers want design best practices when they work when they would we go and tell customers about a just a cub or Azure stack edge they said this is great but how do I build something for it what's hello world how does this integrate into my application how can i connect this to my legacy database and run a function to analyze data and partners you know Microsoft products aren't complete without a powerful and robust ecosystem and our partners one away to build software and offerings for as you stack up and Azure stack edge and a way to monetize it and market it and developers need guidance again that hello world and developers you know always like to look for things like code they like to look for artifacts guidance and tooling so we surveyed a lot of developers a couple years ago we came up with hybrid cloud patterns and these are things like hybrid DevOps allowing DevOps offer to deploy to both Azure stack hub and Azure stack edge or so that's your stock edge and your local systems and Azure cross cloud scaling the ability to take an application that's under load and scale it to run a cloud boundary from Azure stack hub to as your step cross cloud scaling is the ability to take an application and run it across cloud boundaries scaling from Azure stack hub to Azure public you have data sovereignty and gravity how do I analyze data that it's required to stay in a country's borders and then get anonymized insights to a fleet level analysis for Allied hey at the edge which breaks down into several different concepts of how we train run and version models that run at the edge with local data do distribute applications in scenarios where I can't access the global as your instance I can route users to a local instance on an azure stack hub and a tiering data for analytics can I analyze data in successively smaller steps starting where a large amount of data is generated throwing away the useless data and passing those signals up to the cloud or other other data streams as a result of this we created some guidance and artifacts we created solution architectures that explain these patterns and we created some tutorials that show you how to deploy them along with best practices we then created one-click artifacts which were a downloadable sample code there on Hubb and you can find a link at the bottom of the screen they combine edge equipment they we have we have all kinds of one-click artifacts for these patterns there's ways to build hybrid applications like with using the patterns I just mentioned there's DevOps guidance there's ability to build highly available applications using highly available sequel and O's sequel databases and the thing is as time went on our customers they said this is great we have the ability to start building things but a lot of our customers don't want to have to learn all this by themselves they want to be able to say I have some building blocks that I can take and build the better solution and to be honest with all the customer conversations we did we weren't really finding new patterns so we started looking for the next thing there we got edge patterns and we turn them into edge solutions edge patterns are common threads that we hear from customers for architects and developers to lead design conversations and include best practices edge solutions are made up of multiple edge patterns and they're based on kernels from customer scenarios our solution goals are to enable solution makers to see the product in action and figure out if it meets that needs now David you actually came up with kind of the framework for this you had this vision for the solution that you wanted to create for manufacture can you tell us a little bit more about it yeah well one of the things that we learned is manufacturers are very busy and they can't spend a month doing an evaluation they have very little time so we tried to focus on how can we show them how to use the technology and do that within a single workday so that as they have time they can do one of our solutions as an experiment and at the end of the day they can go to their manager and show them how this technology can make a difference in their facility right so it's all about enabling that low time to value so that way you know David's customers from manufacturers can see this is not some cloud platform I bought it's a way for me to modernize my business and they can see that in action with sample code that we can give them this also helps our field out they are always looking for ways to show the value of as your stack of an edge to their customers and of course this enables us to course this enables us to help out our is fees they're able to take these solutions and customize them to bring them to production for their clients and of course if if a customer's large enough and they have their own development staff the code is available for all of these on github so they can take it break it apart tinker with it and build something totally new that meets their needs so our current solutions that are here today are retail and health care focused solutions we've got the ability to detect out of stock items on store shelves using Azure stack edge and a machine learning model footfall data collection which is data collection of things that happen inside stores the ages of the people who walk in the number of people who walk in how happy or sad they might be and where they go and precisely and processing that in an anonymized manner and of course we have a bit of a big solution for personalized retail how while respecting privacy we can provide recommendations that are tailored to your shopping preferences and needs and our newest vertical our new vertical for this year is healthcare where we brought the fire server which is the fast health care interchange resource which allows healthcare facilities to communicate back and forth using a common language we've brought Microsoft SAS service as a standalone service to Azure stack hub and Azure stack edge so they can run this server locally and we're working to bring a medical imaging platform to Azure stack hub which will allow which will allow facilities to train and derive data from images and scans located on the network's premises Kroger actually helped us with our out of stock detection model in Sunrise technology their technology division uses as you stack edges at retail as a service platform which we use this live video analytics on Azure stack edge at certain stores and enables those personalized guiding experiences so we've found you success with these other verticals retail and health care and then we pivoted in manufacturing and and David owns the manufacturing vertical on our team and David why do why did we want us to tackle manufacturing next why is this so important to our product yeah manufacturers have facilities all over the world many of those locations get really bad network connectivity also their operations inside the plant really can't depend on an internet connection so largely they want to be able to operate autonomously yet get the value that they find in the cloud so what we did is we actually went out and talked to a number of our manufacturing customers to kind understand what they'd like to do on the edge what's important for them there and one of the things that we heard over and over again is you know they'd like to do things with video in analytics but you know sending up video streams to the cloud really doesn't make a lot of sense so they'd really like to take advantage of our address tack family of portfolio to try to build a solution where they can do analytics to do things for example quality control or part identification all within the edge all right that makes a lot of sense yeah so based on David's customer research we picked manufacturing as the next vertical to work on then we moved into the design phase and so this is where David took the scenarios from customers and maybe you can give us some of those ICANN statements at your customers wanted and then we translated those into other requirements yeah one of the things that we heard loud and clear is people are curious in video analytics at the edge but they really don't know how easy it is to get going on that so one of the ICANN statements that we have is I can set up a proof of concept in a single day another ICANN statement that we learn is I can set up a prototype without requiring any experts like data scientists to complete the task so these types of ICANN statements really gave us an insight into kind of the scope of what it is we needed to build right so those are the I can't statements which form like the general scenarios that we wanted someone to be able to do so let's actually talk about the personas like who who in the factory would end up using these so you said you didn't want a data scientist to have to have to take on this project but who would end up using this and how do we design for that yeah the people who see the values are the people in the factory and you know if you're in a factory in some remote location it's very unlikely that you're gonna have a data scientists there that can work with you to kind of fine-tune models and things like this a lot of these folks don't even know a lot of the terminology that we use in machine learning so we really zeroed in on the person who has a task to do in the factory related to producing high-quality products all right so yeah that makes a lot of sense we want to make it easy for someone to use one of the I Kansas get started within a day and so we broke those down into what parts of that I can are reliant on the backend API the thimble things to handle models things to handle images a web service and the UX how do you make it easy for someone who's never done machine learning in their life to click one two three and see it in action and then you know with all that data from the I cans the UX the API and the personas we have to figure out where this thing will run so you know David you mentioned the Azure stack family but we kind of made a choice about hub versus edge how did we arrive at that choice yeah we kind of arrived at edge because this is something that we won't be able to people to be able to do in a single day without a large investment right and with Azure stack edge you can get the device it's a monthly fee you can have it shipped to your facility we handle all of the shipping its first party you just deal with Microsoft you order it straight from the azure portal and it shows up it's a really easy way for you to get started what we believe however is after people see the value of this they'll want to invest in it even more you know long that they might want to start to do like model retraining all autonomous within their facility and that might lead to a larger device such as you would get with an azure stack hub and so that makes a lot of sense so let me actually show you some of the ICANN statements that we that are actually straight from the document we hand it off to the dais so things like I kinetic camera use it to register a part which means train a model that says I will look for this part and then reliably detect that part in a video feed you know at 15 frames per second with a current detection rate in the maximum of two parts so that scenario you see it has a car gate for success test them constraints so we're not trying to boil the ocean but it very specifics of the developers and the testers does exactly know exactly the targets they have to hit right and we got more specific on this by calling up customers and finding out exactly how they would measure us for a successful prototype right exactly and sometimes things that customers give us are a little bit more fuzzy for example that second one I can easily install the solution on an azure stack edge device managed by a j''r easily varies for a lot of people but you know David tell us the kind of experience that your customers are looking for yeah I really were focused on people who don't have a lot of pre-training or previous knowledge we're also trying to target people who are not experts in machine learning or even an azure stack edge device right so then and so that's important that it be easy to use easy to set up easy to manage and did it well egg will also test this as we go through different iterations we'll have people come in or we'll ask them remotely to install and give us feedback on this and we'll find out whether or not they thought it was easy or not yeah actually the most important part of all this we're talking about customer conversations as the backgrounds the most important part is that we have a tight feedback loop with our customers and users that way we can make sure we're always on the right track are not wasting resources that's right and so like our third I can is I can view a it's actually a third piece of functionality I can view a sample of images and then retrain the model or David was mentioning autonomous retraining as an eventualities for this product or this sample that's right so as your stack edge exposes as your iot edge as a surface for you to run modules on that device it provides access to the hardware such as the FPGA and the GPU or the shares to access the internal flash storage it also provides some really cool manageability things so from Azure and soon to be as your hub you can use Azure stack the azure stack edge resource provider to add shares activated device manage it and do all kinds of lifecycle operations and then you can configure compute and add it to IOT hub again on Asscher and soon to be as your spec hub where you can take all those messages that are flying around in the IOT edge space and send them up to the cloud store them and analyze them as a badge of Crossley two devices and of course make sure that device has a consistent deployment framework in is the same as the rest of your other devices so a lot of what we deployed for intelligence at the edge relies on containerized versions or Azure services so we things like as your cognitive services the face api is are available as your ml we can deploy ml models as containers on Azure stack edge David you worked on the stream analytics and functions of your team did how does the head of those can you know compared to the cloud based ones well the cloud place based once you configure it all within a sure with the containerized versions you configure them in Azure and then push them out to the edge yeah so exactly like it's a lot about you know being able to package a workflow that you have in the cloud and export it to run anywhere you'd like and of course SQL database edge and event grid are both coming to Azure as just that gauges containers or as your stack hub as containers or you can use our API and write your own container that runs on a Linux platform so let's talk about how the isare odh lifecycle experience works so you have some kind of data with a sensor database or something any good the data flows into an azure stack edge and that that analysis flows up to azure IOT hub but in order to set the containers and the modules on the device we use azure IOT hub which provides a really comprehensive experience for saying this is the goal state for the device and this is where I'd like it to reach it and I oth keeps trying to achieve that goal States and keeps trying to achieve that keeps trying to achieve that goal state in reports back the number of devices it's configured the failures are the kind of failure so it's easy to see manageability across an entire fleet of devices like one per factory or two per factory but you can manage them all from a central place when we build solutions for as you stack edge we talk about using things like on-premises devices that flow into a hardware accelerated compute platform that act that can also access on-premises systems of record then those that des is combined and the relevant signals such as like maybe anomalies or failures per hour or even that are problematic we'll get sent to as your IOT or as your stack age on the cloud or as your storage or as your stack hub storage and azure stack hub IOT hub wow that's a mouthful and that they could interact with Azure service is there to provide even richer and more amalgamated offerings so taking combining the IOT edge deployment and that as your stack edge to lose in deployment here's our solution architecture we've got a camera that exposes an RTSP feed which then sends a raw image to an inference module right now in the first state of the program it does nothing but eventually we have a web service that exposes a UI we snap some images we drop it in there and then those are sent to custom vision that a I where it's trained and the model is then deployed to Azure stack edge at that point inferencing begins and then you can see results come up on the come up on the screen and then those results are also forwarded to IOT hub for further archival on analysis so now that we've kind of talked about the design and how we thought about building this product to meet the needs of the customers that you've identified kind of talk to us about the review process that you want to maintain that feedback loop so we don't go barking up the wrong tree well first of all it's really important for us to do incremental progress in small pieces so that we can check ourselves and make sure that we're on target every new capability or new feature that we have we want to go back to customers reconfirm then move forward after that so we expect more customer conversations more learning as we go the same is true with their design research that's again a very iterative thing we want to do after every sprint make sure that we're on target for anything new that we're adding into the product and also making sure the things that we previously had in the product still work for everyone finally for the scenario refinement we're going to get feedback as people start to try this stuff out and they plug it into other efforts that they have going inside of their facilities we're probably going to get a lot of feedback on hey you know if you did this for safety that'd be really great or hey if you could help me count how many pieces I made in an hour or if I have some kind of bottleneck in my system that I can address so as we learn these scenarios we'll consider them and reprioritize them and schedule them in one of our future sprints yeah that sounds great yeah example for example we will always want to make sure we're meeting our customers needs and maintain a feedback loop that makes sure that you know we're meeting you know their requirements and once we've kind of established that review process in the design we kind of went into event we went into we went into a development process or we use an agile developer process where he worked in a really tight Sprint's of three weeks with using github for collaboration if you go to our repo you can see all the commits listed we partnered with link code networks they actually they're an ISV in Asia and they worked with us to develop this application what you'll see in the demo is actually all of their dev work and we're very grateful to them for it and of course all of each of these Sprint's were kind of gated on a scenario demo that when we finished the sprint we had to be able to show that we could achieve one of the I cans in our document David you mean you kind of came up with the sprint process do you want to kind of talk about more about how we lamp brought agile into this conversation well we assumed agile from the beginning since well we need to get this thing quickly out we just like feedback on a product we need to get feedback on our team and how we're developing stuff and so agile is really the way that we needed to go for doing that I will say one thing that's kind of interesting is since linker networks is over in Taiwan and we're in completely different time zones we use that to our advantage so at the end of our day we can tell them what to work on for their day and then when we get into work in the morning we can see what they've done try it out and then give them feedback for the following day yeah that schedule difference has actually been really helpful because it allows us to maximize the time that we have for development so now that we've talked about the design the requirements the review process in the development process we you know actually had to go build the thing so let me show you what we came up with I'll go ahead and show you a demo of our current stage manufacturing solution so here is the current UI it looks very similar to some of the mock-ups we've created and let me go ahead and register in your location this would be like an area in a factory for example production line one I need to be able to type first this is basically what the camera is going to be pointed at right boundary exactly so this is going to be pointed at a production line that makes cats you know not real ones but 3d printed ones toy cats yeah and then we need to add a camera so this solution relies on RTSP cameras that's a very standard video streaming protocol so yeah line one and I have a handy dandy RTSP URL and submit that now we have a camera so we can click on this camera and we can configure a job to this device which means I have a camera I need to add a part of course which means I need to train a part so there's no parts in this library which means that there's no models trained to provide analysis at the edge from the string from that camera so let's train a model and you know create a part first so it's cat toys plastic okay notice that we don't have terms like train a model in the screen anywhere because we're trying to target somebody who doesn't have expertise with machine learning right exactly I'm actually using words that we've kind of found to be too technical for our audience we're trying to hit here so we made sure all the language made sense to the personas that we're gonna use it I already have a camera registered cat line one so I'm gonna hit play and I'm gonna capture some training images I need at least 16 for custom vision to work properly so that's that and let's see how many wages we have here let's go all day they're getting their say we're gonna label it of course you don't you know use the term labeling because that's a very confusing term so we just say draw a rectangle around the part next next next now on J I know people watching this are probably thinking hey this could have been Betty or better here or there and we agree we just haven't shown this to enough people to get all the feedback that we need yeah absolutely we'll work continuously improve on our user experience as we learn more yeah absolutely this is always like a continuously evolving process we never at any point want to say you know we're done this is it it's sealed and forever this way that's you know kind of what makes the clouds so great is that we can innovate at that kind of speed another box it up the software but I'm gonna keep labeling here cuz I think I took a lot more pictures that I was supposed to okay wait what happened here I'm just gonna save all these right now there's 21 pictures so ah just the last one okay and he lives right here now this model is not gonna be super accurate just because I have you know taken 20 pictures the more pictures you add the better it goes so of course encourage our customers take as many pictures as possible but I'm gonna save this which means these images are now being transmitted to custom vision and being trained this is a big deal because manufacturers typically produce parts for which there is no existing model unit like every single kind of widget and doodad is manufactured and we don't there's no way we could have picture or models for all of those things so we really wanted to focus in I'm making an experience super easy for you to create your own new model based on the unique thing that you make as a manufacturer right exactly so this is this is custom vision dot ai it's a way for anyone who doesn't have data science experience to quickly train a machine learning model that identifies certain images but just uploading images and tagging them and it also has an API that we're taking advantage of to train and get this model downloaded so this is a model I've trained earlier a project I proceeded earlier you can see all the pictures here the labels I've set for them and I will literally click train and I'll be able to download them on it's very simple very easy to use for making it even easier and accessible to those who aren't in the industry yes we're sending people to multiple websites we're bringing it all together here by calling the api's and bringing the full solution and to end together for this user exactly so we're gonna go ahead and finish configuring this job so cat line one cat toy part production line one I don't know hum click configure so we're still sending the data up to the cloud and waiting for the model to come back so we can see that the models done training we it's been uploaded to blob storage and then we downloaded it and then passed that URL to the module twin that controls the inference module that we talked about earlier the module twin is an IOT hub contract that allows you to dynamically change properties of a module while it's running and get information back out of the module so he told it dynamically go look for this model apply it to this camera feed and start inferencing so let's see what we can see here we're gonna play and you can see it's barking the cat toy it's a little bit inaccurate because of how how we trained it how quickly we trained it but you can see it kind of getting the gist of it and highlighting that particular cat toy as it comes across the production line once this is done we may have images that are low confidence and you might want to be able to improve the model so then we can go to something that we click to call retraining so let's stick like this part and we can see images here in a confidence level and we can see where it wondered if this was actually a cat toy and it actually got it if you can't see there so I'm gonna click yes and identify it Suzy they got it right and we're gonna you know extend it to make sure it's got the full toy and say and this is one there's no cat toy selected here we're gonna click no and this one's got a cat toy and then identify and this is not actually where the toys it's over here and then save it and we can continue doing this for all the pictures that it's collected we're gonna do these three I click update this model within a read be retrained and redeployed and we'll hopefully have better inferences the next time around so that's kind of our stage one work you've got the ability in use very non data scientists and non computer scientists friendly terms the ability to set up a camera get its feed then take some images from that camera use it to train a model and then get that model and run it against the feed from a particular camera you can do this for a couple of cameras and even further we can take low confidence images retrain them and then provide an even better model and again this is all someone who the day before didn't know what data science or how this worked and one of the things I really love about this Sanjay is it involves the person with the expertise about that part which is the person working in the factory and it allows them to share their knowledge with our machine learning system without them needing to be a expert in machine learning right exactly so now that we've got these scenarios and these I cans down what are the next ones like what's in the future for us David can you talk about like what you'd like to see go for happen with this product going forward well first of all we're of course always improving our Azure stack edge form factors as well as our Andrew stack hub form factors making form factors that are appropriate for different verticals and manufacturing often you don't have a data center to go and plop a rackable server into so we'll be working on new form factors the key scenarios we're really looking at is not just part identification but within a part are there defects that need to be identified and then as we mentioned earlier how do I count how many parts are in a location so that I can do things like know how much was manufactured in a day or know if there's a backlog within my manufacturing processes that I need to address finally I think we really want to look at how we could run this completely disconnected from the internet and not rely on a calling a web service like custom vision AI upon the internet to do the full and n scenario so that could be completely autonomous right so that sounds like a great book of improvements for the future so that's kind of what we've got today here's what you as a viewer can do next to get started with custom vision as your stack edge or these patterns and solutions that we've made available so we've got a few a kms links that show you some solution architectures some tutorials and the code for manufacturing solutions like these and other solutions we put on the internet you can reach out to us if you're an ISV and you or you want to be able to publish your solution on Azure stack family either that's Azure stack edge or as your stack hub and in the future we'll be having a hybrid virtual event where I'll talk about these kinds of scenarios and EPS so that's all we have for today thank you to everyone for tuning in and watching and you know have a great bill thanks everyone for your time [Music]
