 [Music] [Music] we are involved in Big Data because we are involved in Big Data because we are involved in Big Data because we're in storage company the partnership we're in storage company the partnership we're in storage company the partnership with HP is critically important we're with HP is critically important we're with HP is critically important we're trying to bring in new technologies like trying to bring in new technologies like trying to bring in new technologies like machine learning with deep neural machine learning with deep neural machine learning with deep neural networks or at evolution neural networks networks or at evolution neural networks networks or at evolution neural networks to handle our image processing problems to handle our image processing problems to handle our image processing problems in the company HP has a remarkable depth in the company HP has a remarkable depth in the company HP has a remarkable depth of resources available in a project like of resources available in a project like of resources available in a project like this we're working with HPE labs and this we're working with HPE labs and this we're working with HPE labs and they have experts in machine learning they have experts in machine learning they have experts in machine learning the edge line team has been really good the edge line team has been really good the edge line team has been really good because they're they're helping us put because they're they're helping us put because they're they're helping us put the hardware into our factory there's the hardware into our factory there's the hardware into our factory there's another team that works on the Apollo another team that works on the Apollo another team that works on the Apollo 6500 side that's helping us put the 6500 side that's helping us put the 6500 side that's helping us put the software out so that we can do the software out so that we can do the software out so that we can do the machine learning training and the machine learning training and the machine learning training and the overall software architecture is being overall software architecture is being overall software architecture is being done by points next and they're putting done by points next and they're putting done by points next and they're putting together a kubernetes based together a kubernetes based together a kubernetes based infrastructure that will allow us to infrastructure that will allow us to infrastructure that will allow us to have the flexibility to scale all of have the flexibility to scale all of have the flexibility to scale all of these models and manage them what if you these models and manage them what if you these models and manage them what if you could predict that something is going could predict that something is going could predict that something is going wrong and as well before it actually wrong and as well before it actually wrong and as well before it actually goes wrong our factories produce goes wrong our factories produce goes wrong our factories produce somewhere around five terabytes of data somewhere around five terabytes of data somewhere around five terabytes of data per day and where you see value in your per day and where you see value in your per day and where you see value in your data changes when you're able to do data changes when you're able to do data changes when you're able to do real-time analytics to it and then if real-time analytics to it and then if real-time analytics to it and then if something is a little bit unusual detect something is a little bit unusual detect something is a little bit unusual detect it and take action avoiding maintenance it and take action avoiding maintenance it and take action avoiding maintenance events will save a tremendous amount of events will save a tremendous amount of events will save a tremendous amount of money what we can do is see that a tool money what we can do is see that a tool money what we can do is see that a tool is starting to behave a certain way and is starting to behave a certain way and is starting to behave a certain way and then make a prediction that you know then make a prediction that you know then make a prediction that you know within some number of hours we may be within some number of hours we may be within some number of hours we may be able to intercede and do something to able to intercede and do something to able to intercede and do something to put the tool back on track without put the tool back on track without put the tool back on track without having any product affected having any product affected having any product affected what we get from this combination of OT what we get from this combination of OT what we get from this combination of OT and I T that HP has done is the ability and I T that HP has done is the ability and I T that HP has done is the ability then to have central control of OT then to have central control of OT then to have central control of OT resources in our factories as though resources in our factories as though resources in our factories as though they were IT datacenter resources data they were IT datacenter resources data they were IT datacenter resources data has its most decision value in real time has its most decision value in real time has its most decision value in real time something's going on in the factory you something's going on in the factory you something's going on in the factory you want to take action on it right when want to take action on it right when want to take action on it right when it's happening instead of waiting for it's happening instead of waiting for it's happening instead of waiting for the data to accumulate in a central the data to accumulate in a central the data to accumulate in a central location and then go back and and do location and then go back and and do location and then go back and and do analytics on it so it's really about analytics on it so it's really about analytics on it so it's really about latency and making real-time decisions we're looking at building what I would we're looking at building what I would call an artificial assistant or a agent call an artificial assistant or a agent call an artificial assistant or a agent that can help people do a job so when that can help people do a job so when that can help people do a job so when people do get involved in the process people do get involved in the process people do get involved in the process they're not replaced by the machine they're not replaced by the machine they're not replaced by the machine learning tool they're assisted by it so learning tool they're assisted by it so learning tool they're assisted by it so that the machine learning tool says look that the machine learning tool says look that the machine learning tool says look here and this is interesting or here and this is interesting or here and this is interesting or anomalous in some sense anomalous in some sense anomalous in some sense [Music] [Music] [Music] focus on scalability and flexibility focus on scalability and flexibility focus on scalability and flexibility first and understand what success would first and understand what success would first and understand what success would look like if everything works what does look like if everything works what does look like if everything works what does the hardware and software have to be the hardware and software have to be the hardware and software have to be able to do these tools change they able to do these tools change they able to do these tools change they evolve over time very rapidly the system evolve over time very rapidly the system evolve over time very rapidly the system that HP has put together for us allows that HP has put together for us allows that HP has put together for us allows us to drop new tools and without us to drop new tools and without us to drop new tools and without disrupting the system itself we're disrupting the system itself we're disrupting the system itself we're putting together something that's putting together something that's putting together something that's relatively new and different and we're relatively new and different and we're relatively new and different and we're doing it in months it's not taking years doing it in months it's not taking years doing it in months it's not taking years it's it's really an exciting opportunity it's it's really an exciting opportunity it's it's really an exciting opportunity for us
