 [Music] our facial recognition process has four stages detection feature extraction tracking and recognition for the detection process our AI platform divides the frame into a grid and starts looking for a face once the face is detected a mathematical model is extracted this process is then repeated in the next frame creating a track once the track is done the algorithm creates a combined model that is based on all the frames it has analyzed this allows us to detect people in extreme conditions such as a high contrast profile view low resolution and even disguised subjects our platform will use this model to search your database if it finds a match it will create an alert this process happens simultaneously within a multi-camera environment on all phases in the field of view [Music]
