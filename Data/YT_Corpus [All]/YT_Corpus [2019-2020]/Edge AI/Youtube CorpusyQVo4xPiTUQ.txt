 Hi! Welcome to SoundAround studio! Here is some lyrical intro about the eternal battle between digital and analog What you choose: analog pedalboard or digital processor, hardware or software, tube or transistor? Today we are comparing two microphones:  Neumann U 87 AI and Antilope Edge Duo Both microphones are recording sound (surprise:-) Neumann price is about 2500$ Antelope price - about 1000$ Antelope Edge Duo is an emulating microphone. It comes bundled with proprietary software that includes about 20 emulations of well-known microphone models, allowing you to change these emulations on the fly, virtually expanding your studio's microphone park to unimaginable proportions. The main meaning of the comparison is: True Neumann or emulated Neumann (we used emulation of Neumann U87) We have 2 sources of signal for this comparative test (everything that was at hand) - voice and a finely arranged set of sticks and wire called cello. Both microphones are in the "Cardioid" mode, the signal is written simultaneously to both. Recording was made directly to the audio interface Antelope Orion rev. 2017. No signal processing (except for Antelope emulation). We only adjusted the gain of each microphone to get the same volume while recording. What is the difference? Which microphone is better? You decide! We hope this video was useful for you. You can find original audio files in description. We’d like to know, what do you think about this comparison, and what microphone is better? Leave a comment for us, please. Thanx for watching!
