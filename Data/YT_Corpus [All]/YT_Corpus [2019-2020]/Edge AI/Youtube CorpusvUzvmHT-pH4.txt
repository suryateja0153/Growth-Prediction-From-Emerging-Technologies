 on this episode we talk to da ki about how they use federated learning to preserve privacy while training machine learning models so going back to your application you kind of mentioned that AI was used for the patients that are using it tell us a little bit more about the actual app yep so we have the medical research companion app and what it allows you to do is basically be able to collect some important omics information and we have reduced the friction to be able to collect that like I mentioned earlier you can take medical selfie which is just a selfie but it extracts medical information out of that we can extract mood and behavioral data out of that selfie but we can also take pictures off your pill bottles and understand what medication and dosage and instructions that exist on those we can do that pretty much for lab results and medical records very soon we can also collect your genetic information so we don't do wet sequencing meaning that we don't get you sequenced but we can collect any of the raw data that you have sequenced yourself for example from 23andme your ancestry and be able to bring that into the app and keep it in the app and then understand what's in the data right so so one is it's all about Polly omits data collection that the app allows you to do but on the other side we basically run what we call as data trials which is the new version of what medical research looks like where we can actually take users vertically based on their disease or conditions and use the data they've collected so far to like lead them towards this research with the right consent and the right opt-ins so that they can participate and get some rewards the rewards could be financial but it will also be more than that like insights and other predictions that we can give on top of that so largely it the medical companion app is a medical research app that are those patients to understand and see what are the newer ways that they can find solutions for their diseases today how does the cloud kind of enable that color and then you know actual yeah using of that data right yeah so we see that in many ways so first of all for some something like medical selfie which is basically a deep learning model that we have built we have built it on the club across a lot of data that we were able to collect painstakingly through different techniques so the medical selfie is a deep learning model that can take an image or a selfie of your face and be able to predict your sex height weight and age as parameters out of that but then also triage further predictions out of that so now that's a model that we built on the cloud using on Google cloud using a lot of computational resources then we were able to convert that model to run on a mobile device so we we were able to take that and made it to edge inferences so we can run it on a phone and it can actually predict those variables just sitting on the phone without really revealing or taking any of the images that they pay patient or the member is taking back to the server so so one thing that I see there is that cloud enables us to like build models like this that today is much harder to build just on the phone but with newer approaches like federated learning we can actually also train and build models on the phone across many many many users like hundreds of thousands of users so we may not need cloud to even centralize the data at some point in future so what exactly does federated learning an able for the users who are using the application that's a great question so I think healthcare data in general is a very valuable data asset and I think it's highly secure and private data that every user and every patient should actually care for so we think the future of where all of the health information will exist is only on the edge specifically on the mobile phones for the users and I think it's easy for them to lose that information and send it to a cloud if they are not aware of how the data has been used so what we can do with federated learning now is provide guarantees for users that it can stay on the device but then we don't lose the aspect of learning something from the data we're in we can now build models that can train on the device and we can build a better model on the server by just sort of sharing the device trained information which is usually like bits of information like numbers but not the real data itself and imagine now if we can do that across a population of users like hundreds of thousands of users then what we get behind the scenes is a much more robust model that's much more diverse and hopefully it's much more generalized than as if it was strain on a single user so that's what federated learning can do and then we can add layers of security and tools like differential privacy where we don't even learn anything about the person that we are training on so in combination with differential privacy and federated learning I think we have a very important solution where we can keep the data on the edge and still be able to learn something from the data without knowing who the user is or what's in the data stay tuned for more conversations with Balki i if you enjoyed this episode check out the stack chat playlist for more great videos [Music] you
