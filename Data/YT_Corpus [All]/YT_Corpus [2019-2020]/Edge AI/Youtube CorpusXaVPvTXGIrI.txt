 there are a lot of different  combinations um that that work on  when you choose the software there could  be a computer vision algorithm plus  an ai model in your solution or that  could be just a computer vision algorithm  alone or an ai model alone so there  are multiple combinations which occur  when you approach towards a solution  so for example when you want to  detect a circle a computer vision  algorithm is is is good enough whereas  when you want to detect people when  you want to recognize people as  as based on their gender then an  ai model would be much more suited  and just solving this problem with  vision might not be enough and   identifying a people we could use a model and then tracking them could be a computer  vision algorithm so there is a lot   of combination of these algorithms and  models which which are present now when  we start working on this algorithm  there is an algorithm development  part either you could start from scratch  um and do it or you could pick an  existing algorithm or model and see how  it works for you and then optimize it   improve it if you choose a model  then you prepare your own data set  and train it before applying it for your  final solution so the algorithm development  or going towards the solution with  existing blocks is not always a very straight path and once you do all  this okay you have made everything work   there are a lot of other things when  it comes to final productization   putting it on the edge optimizing it  for working with live stream of data and  things like that that is another  thing that we need to consider when  we are choosing these algorithms and blocks  so how do we start and how do we go towards   the fast prototyping of of all of this  that's where nvidia's deep stream helps us  where nvidia has a as a framework to help us   get started on this ai journey and from visAI  labs part of econ we also have a bizarre   platform which has a collection of algorithm accelerators which can help you go forward
