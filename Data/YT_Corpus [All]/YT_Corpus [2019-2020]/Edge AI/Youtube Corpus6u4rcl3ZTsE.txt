 - You know, in an increasingly distracted world, everybody has their story. I have a story every morning. There's people eating cereal and there's people slamming on the brakes for no apparent reason. I think we all have those stories. Our team is working to heighten your senses as a driver. This technology can help you keep track of what's in your blind spot, alert you when you're drifting out of your lane, or even potentially help you avoid a collision. Still, you're the one driving, you're the one making decisions. We're just helping you do a better job of both.
