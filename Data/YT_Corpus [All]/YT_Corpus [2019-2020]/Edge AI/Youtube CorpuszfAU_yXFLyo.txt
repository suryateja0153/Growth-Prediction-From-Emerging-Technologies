 [Music] you all creators sometimes struggle with finding new ideas for the creations so am I so I thought why not let technologists help me I've heard about music and lyrics written by artificial intelligence and I decided to try it out by myself I found a little AI power tool called lazy me this tool uses a machine learning model pre-trained on thousands of songs so you don't have to train the model for yourself but you can customize the model by adding your own MIDI I've chosen : to train the model on because this band has composed hundreds of also raised during their career what I did is I have loaded for recording songs and MIDI format in Reaper I've cleaned the MIDI files up by removing everything except the guitars removing the parts of the songs that I didn't like and I also made into rig plate ones only then I've joined all the music files and exported them as a single file I've loaded it in talita me and nothing work immediately narrated by the program didn't sound like porn it didn't sound like music no this is how this current that this software doesn't support polyphonic easily convinced that you can upload chords enjoy it so mean D file has to contain single note melodies only so I made all the risk on a pony leaving only root knows of which quad and I tried again a trained model for one thousand steps for the best result and it finally has started generated some interest in riffs I took view of them and play them on the guitar check it out [Music] [Music] [Music] you have to be careful with the tools like blades because they can generate melodies that sound very similar or exactly the same as these samples that produce to train the model and many of the melodies that I got sounded just like the original corn songs but they also were some interesting new riffs but are they better than the risk that I can write I don't think so love this time [Music] [Music] you
