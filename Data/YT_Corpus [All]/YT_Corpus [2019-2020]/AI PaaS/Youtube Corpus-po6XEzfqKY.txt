 Hello! My name is Amy Sturkey. I am a pediatric physical therapist. I am here with Charis who is 10 months old. We are going to work on crawling over. She can crawl. You want more? Alright. We are going to work on crawling over. I have got her on this side of my leg and she needs to go to that side of my leg. She is already smart to know that there is less leg over there. Go! So a simple thing is you can do is put up an obstacle. I find my leg convenient because I keep it with me all the time. I   have her work on crawling over to get to something she wants. Charis was belly crawling a good bit. They said that when she got close they just....there you go!... refused to let her belly crawl anymore, and would get her up on her hands and knees and blocked her from belly crawling. That is how they ended up getting her to crawl when she was refusing. Anyway since she has left me, I guess we are done. I will talk to you later. Bye-bye!
