 [Music] I've spent my career in artificial intelligence jumping between academia and industry this particular next is so exciting for me because it's all about how artificial intelligence has become a real and significant part of the world's economy and I'm imagining the students I was teaching 20 years ago about the futuristic promise of AI and although we have a heck of a lot further go much of it is now actually here hi everyone my name is Rajan chef and I lead the product team for for cloud AI I've been at Google 15 years and and in enterprise the whole time because my passion is turning interesting technology like this into products that can help all of you customers developers partners do really great great things and I think AI is probably the most interesting technology I've seen because it can really empower people to really transform it so in 2019 I think you've you're seeing this in this particular meeting we are taking the business of AI very seriously the fact is that where many of us were excited about producing tools which had the prospects of helping transform industries we're now most interested in the science of how enterprises adopt AI effectively without too many false starts safely reliably and of course in an ethical and sensible way that respects the kind of cultures that we're unleashing AI into and and and as Andrew often says we like to work backwards in that we need to start with your problems what are the real business problems that are out there and then figure out how we can work together to solve them and that's what we're what we're oriented towards doing so we're co-hosting this session we are both a inodes who've actually had pretty different career paths getting here but that's why it's so exciting and such an honor for us to be involved in this great responsibility of making sure that Google does the right thing in terms of AI so this is what we and Google cloud are now dedicated to and so today's session we're really gonna focus on is stories from customers and so you're gonna hear from over a variety of interesting customers and stories from different customers about how they're using AI to be able to solve some of some of their problems and and really kind of focusing on how this is there today and what you can really do today a first guest demonstrates that AI customers don't just need powerful algorithms and that's certainly been a huge learning I think of many people in our industry that it's about how you can scale these things so that it goes from a fun Jupiter notebook into a real-world deployment so please welcome Alex Owens VP and global head of people data centers AI and data governance a you know leader [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] all right so welcome it's great to have you here firstly before we jump into the details tell us about your career trajectory and what's brought you into the world of AI yeah well I mean I then I guess I've worked in data and analytics most of my career prior to Unilever I worked and I worked in banking don't shoot me my watching media as well so worked under Rupert Murdoch's youngest son James using data and analytics to power BSkyB which is probably be familiar of that and then before that watching the BBC so yeah British Broadcasting Corporation which is broadcast and corporate very good and I guess you know no Unilever I mean for many people I don't know people know Unilever well but I can imagine some of you probably do you know we were the second biggest advertiser in the world we spend 8 billion a year advertising and Google is a very strategic partner of ours we have 200 markets 500 brands and actually the biggest opportunity is in the fact that 2.5 billion people use our products every day and so there's a massive opportunity there to collect data from the consumers on the consumption of the products yeah that's great I find that it's really excited to have that data but then you get completely crushed by the volumes of it unless you've got a strategy for managing it yeah so part of your job title is people data centers that is a weird but cool term tell me more well I think we joke at Unilever as well and the fact that the guest the only constant is change I think that's my job title to take on us would it be tomorrow when I get home who knows but you know I mean let me give you a little bit more more more background so at least it brings to context I guess how we use Google Cloud api's but we have a very grand ambition of 1 billion one-to-one relationships through meaningful and relevant dialogue and so what do we mean by that using data and technology to speak to a consumers one-to-one my job has been primarily on people data centers which is effectively three pillars so all of this social and business analytics that we do on a global basis so we have access to 30 or 40 different data points whether that be social data search data ratings interviews data or business data my team on a global basis will mine that data to drive inside the second element of the of the people data center is what we call our consumer engagement centers or in other words call centers I'm so loving the conversation this morning around the contact center API and you know we get maybe 15 million calls considering how many people use their products it's not that many but it's a massive insight source and a vast amount of data and the third element is what we call internally PRM or people relationship marketing which is effectively searing so I'm accountable for deploying the capability across the business but also driving CRM across a business using adobe marketing cloud actually in this case okay very interesting yeah operating of that scale must be so much fun so given the complexity I assume that this is part of the reason why you're going beyond regular information technology into artificial intelligence yeah yeah I mean look I mean we have you know I mean one I always joke when you speak to people who are yeah it's probably an overused term and a misunderstood term and for me I think AI is an umbrella term I suppose and the way that we look at it is through the various strands of AI you know the biggest thing that we've used in Google from any part API perspective and we're using many others which come on to explain in a second but it's the vision API yeah so the vision API gives us the ability to decode a lot of the imagery that we see whether it be on Instagram or whether it be on any image heavy social platform but that's primarily for an insight purpose so how can we understand more about the way in which our consumers are speaking about us through imageries on the social platforms but more importantly more recently we've actually been using the Google vision API on add a touch of marketing so how can we understand how our campaigns are performing real time so we can optimize the content to meet the audience and and then effectively change the creative when creators on I was working too well very good so he was through your curveball here yeah I'm proud of vision API but there must be something you really wish we'd already done is there something that we could be doing better there I mean to be honest the vision API for us is been outstanding and I really do think it's been it's done you know when we played around a lot with image recognition capability in the past you know yes its water is that a fish I'm not quite sure if it's a fish type stuff you know but nowadays I think the vision API is starting I mean we do use others you know so we use your visual API which is you're moving imagery one which i think is probably not quite there as good at yet as the vision API yeah exactly is there something that you guys haven't done it's a good question but I think you know I mean we have been really impressed by by by the vision API and I think not just its ability to decode and then eventually sits behind it but actually the speed at which you can get the information back and process the data to be able to optimize a campaign real-time very good well that's great to hear that positive feedback if it's positive feedback I'm gonna tell you that this was really my project if it'll be the other way it would have been Rogers brother people don't know me about but I can tell you I'm not I'm not fan of priests I absolutely hate praise so if I just praise you there it's a good thing very good all right so when it when it comes to the sort of actual results like do you have metrics showing you whether this sort of use of AI really helps let me go back and let me just explain two examples when we've used the vision API the first is for a guest for insight and the second is for data for marketing before I come on to the results so the first one is we use as I said vision API to decode all the imagery we've invented our own tool internally called pixel which is basically powered by Google vision API we've done a recent piece in India for a very famous tea brand of ours for the Libre know know that I suppose you know we make Benny Jerry's dog flipped and you name it you eat it you put it in your skin and you you clean your house with most of the stuff that we have but that really helped us I guess take what we did to another level because using the vision API we managed to not only understand how people were consuming tea but more importantly we could then look at stuff in terms of facial recognition we could play around with situational type analysis as well so wherever people consuming tea and ultimately he gave us insights that we had never ever got before yeah because most of the insights were coming from text in the past but the way in which people consume our products most of which is in situations that you would necessarily have seen otherwise and actually just won the best paper at their mr-mrs I in India because you know because of the insights that we generated and the ability of us they're now driving a campaign which is a very different campaign that we've run 40 + years gone by the second one and edge of marketing and it's a very proud one again I think we won an Effie on this and partnering again with Google on it so in effect we set up a command center it was for life boy life boys basically hand sanitizer it's a hand washing theme is one of our oldest brands probably I think about 80 200 years old and in in there Northeast North Africa and Middle East and of June Ramadan so we set up a command center we had Google analysts coming in we we use Google Analytics both in terms of the search capability as well to understand how people were interacting but more importantly by the vision API allowed us to adapt the content real-time and change the content real-time because of the ability to process the information see what content is working with which audience and ultimately then adapt that content to reflect more than needs of the consumer across I think this was across about seven or eight markets and the results for that were phenomenal I mean they really were phenomenal we grow market share in over the Ramadan period with whiteboy of 4% which a phenomenal I hadn't seen results like that at all and that was purely because we were speaking to our consumers in the right way through the right channels with the right content very interesting congratulations so what's next I assume you're not done with deployment of AI no I mean we use that extensively across the organization and I guess my team is at the heart of the digital transformation whether that Bureau enter in supply chain whether it be in the way that we can innovate much faster into market or whether it be through our date of marketing so the next day geezers were partnering heavy with you guys again on using the visual API so the moving imagery want to do stuff like YouTube again for an insight perspective but also for a campaign perspective as well contact center API is something that you know we're playing around but it's got a couple of pilots and in flight at the moment I haven't quite seen the fruits of its labor yet but I'm sure if it's like the vision vision API it will be doing is overall pretty well and now an NLP you know we use NLP heavily within everything that we do especially as you're starting to summarize a lot the data that we get from our social platforms very good so the next thing in all of this is the importance of how we do this responsibly and yeah I'm very aware how much of a brand killer it can be if someone does something irresponsible yeah how do you guys handle this no it's very good it's very good question I mean ultimately everything that we do has to retain a consumers trust you know we are a consumer goods giant our consumers are at the heart of our business and you know many businesses say consumers are there are at the business but it's true for us if it wasn't for our consumers we wouldn't have a business Unilever cares passionately about its values we are very values driven organization sustainability is at our core you know whether that be environmental or societal and therefore everything that we do we have the consumer in our mind there are certain things we set up internally I just realized actually I'm wearing pink socks today as well for those that saw the they're not before inclusiveness I didn't realize that it's just by chance anyway ahem but we have an ethics committee and we work very closely with our partners such as yourself and Facebook to make sure that whatever we do with the data is done so on in the right way and the IIF its committee is actually chaired by our general counsel our CFO chief data officer and chief the still offices so it goes all the way to the top yeah we are generally a bottom-up organization not a top-down organization but for things like this you need to have sponsorship at senior levels yes similarly we have deployed what we call Unilever code which is basically adobe marketing cloud in 24 markets over the last year that is using both the digital data you'll play it through your DMP as well as all the PII information that we'd collect through subscriptions or competitions or sampling but every single market that we go live in we make sure that they are gdpr compliant now gdpr is the regulation that's in Europe and that is a very tight regulation but if I had to go to Thailand for example Thailand you could do what you like with any data I could buy a dodgy list off a man in the street and I could use that list but ultimately any market that goes live has to be GTR compliant because one it holds our reputation but secondly it ensures that we're future with the business as well excellent I'm really glad you take this approach so I at this point I'm gonna hand over to Raj and to discuss one of our next use cases everyone thank you so much please thank Alex for joining us here so the next story we're going to talk about is Fox Sports in Australia and I thought it was a very interesting story how many of you here are cricket fans by any chance a good amount in the crowd I'm a newbie to cricket but my entire family is cricket fans so I've been learning very very rapidly on this but what's interesting is that Fox Sports in Australia is using auto ml tables which is a new product that we introduced today to change the way that cricket is watched and all the way ml tables is essentially a way that we can take the power of auto ml which is essentially automatically generating machine learning models for a given data set and deploying it for you but we can apply that to structure tabular data and a lot of the problems that that many of our customers face are tabular data problems and in their case with with Fox Sports they have a specific thing that they wanted to do so in their case cricket has been a staple of a broadcasting in Australia for 60 years and it's traditionally been available for free but now it's not now it's now it's something that that is a paid broadcast and so the expectations of Fox Sports for cricket were really really high and so their challenge was how do you then acquire new subscribers because in order for them to actually watch these games you have to actually acquire these subscribers how do you reduce the cost per acquisition by by 40 percent and then how do you actually get a share of the live cricket audience with this and so they needed to figure out how to do this and they use machine learning and artificial intelligence to be able to do this and so the vision behind this was that they were trying to figure out what if you could actually anticipate the most exciting moments of the game cricket is a long game some cases lasting more in multiple days long and so how can you actually anticipate that something interesting is about to happen and alert users that something interesting is about to happen and so what they did is they use our technologies to build what they call Monte which is essentially a model to try to predict this try to predict that there are interesting things happening in the in the game and so what they put into it was the bold ball by ball data from these from these cricket matches and they were then using using our our technologies to then make predictions based on that data so in particular what they were outputting was the chance of a wicket falling and they for example this is just an example where they would they would be able to say that with X amount of probability a wicket is gonna fall in the next five minutes for example and so something like that can then attract people to come and watch the game because then they know something exciting is about to happen and so once they did this they then integrated that into their marketing campaigns so they would integrate it into everything from literally billboard ads all the way through to the Fox sports app through to things like Google home and social media to get this wicked warning out out to viewers and they would then be able to be drawn back in to us and it was shockingly accurate in terms of the actual accuracy of this such that in most cases something actually exciting really did happen after this and this was a a tweet about the about the results and so of course you know the term of game-changer has been and become a bit big a bit of a cliche but it actually really does apply here for for real and so this became a fundamental part of their broadcast in a fundamental way that they started to connect with your viewers so this may seem like kind of a a trivial example but it had real major business impact for them it increased their their viewer engagement by hundred and forty percent it increased their their subscriber $2 spend by a hundred and fifty percent and increase their brand recall by 2x and so this kind of thing can can be you know another way to use AI to be able to draw people in and and start to actually build up your brand and get a real result out of it so tabular data is is not something that that seems like the most interesting area but it is actually one of the most interesting areas what we're finding is that with many of our customers probably more than half of the machine learning problems that they have are tabular data problems and Ottawa Mel tables is a great way to solve this because essentially what we can now do is generate an accurate model on top of this on top of this tabular data and make it such that you can have outcomes like this for things like marketing but all the way through many many other kind of structured data problems so I'll turn it back over to Andrew to introduce our next customer very good thank you Rajan and that's a really interesting story I I grew up with a father who was obsessed by crickets and I could have really used this just jump in when it actually gets interesting no no slice intended to the cricket fans out there all right so we've we've had a really nice discussion about marketing and retail and another nice discussion about media and the entertainment another really important area which of course drives the world's economy is finance and so applying artificial intelligence in finance is important there's all kinds of good it can do it it really underlines the need for things beyond predictive accuracy and especially that includes transparency we cannot allow black boxes to be running the world of Finance for us so our next speaker or interviewee has very significant experience with this as part of the Blackrock organization so I'm very pleased to welcome up to the stage Stefano Holly [Music] [Applause] [Music] so fill us in on Blackrock and the kinds of problems that you're facing Blackrock is a must as a manager as a mandate to manage investment and trading and security in the market to satisfy our clients need to invest their money for the future of wealth my specific case and there are many many teams Blackrock that apply I'm a specific day job is trying to build the model to forecast different type of liquidity to support trade and portfolio manager to manage better the portfolio from the liquidity with management perspective very good so how is Clara I actually helping you in this my objective is not a I use often the world machine learning my objective is to build good model now liquidity by nature of the problem it became is a problem that can be it's very difficult to solve sparse data or data there are available very noisy and there is high dimensionality so all this type of problem that machine learning can help a lot so we enter in this adventure home we seen immediately ten years ago when I started this job about the social equality immediately start to look into random forest decision tree never network clearly just for fun because the ten years ago in our network really wasn't as of the solution so now we are able to you personally use material that the cloud for the research of a concept and we are able to do a lot of tests and lot of development and our research leverage in the cloud and using machine learning /ie only what is necessary so I am not ashamed to tell that there a lot in production we my team last quarter - model-based random forest and another model base or - variable in a regression because it was Linda job so it's not about going to exceed only for the sake of modular yes I totally approve it that approach by the way and it's a a common misconception that you need massively complex models all the time very frequently it's actually the responsible thing to do to try to minimize them a number of parameters to explain something and I can see how in your industry that's particularly important so yeah two parameters instead of two million I would wear that as a badge of honor if it does the job yes yes so so there is this really important thing though it is not like we're trying to predict flaws in manufacture of sunglasses or something there are real people lives and societal issues going on here so how do you account for this in the design of your eye systems Blackrock has a big company centralized initiative about AI to try exactly to build this practice OVI in the company my specific case in building models is very simple I'm seeking for performance everybody want name that I have a model performing are two simple very well and without giving away because we are dealing with the fiduciary role of our clients we are dealing with people money so I cannot ask the trader to believe my model based on black boxes so we always tend to find the right equilibria between overshooting so sometimes the regression to do the job so it's cool exciting but dazzling is not very necessary and when you can push the machine learning warder try to account that you cannot for a moment push too far in deep into the in today that the research because interpretability so you are able in a must be able may be another sector but in finance in financial or particularly in it to be able to explain in that revealed the outcome of your model to the input features very good and it's this is for me such a important and typical lesson that no two data scientists actually get to follow the same recipe pretty much in every industry in every use case there's some different combination of constraint you're under and in this case you've really had to experiment with these extra constraints that you cannot have unjustified complexity in the models do you think there are things that those of us who are supplying the a industry should be doing better to help create a more a more finance friendly form of AI yes John knows my paranoia interpretability yeah when I was speaking another Google event in London who live in the stage show to me some search they were guys we're doing about that ability I really really like him the room and try to understand more because it's really our priority so it's definitely our priority and to the point that's when I was mentioned before that were allowed to model based on the forest we have in the cloud the parallel implementation whenever Network as expected the performance is higher but we need to build an integrated internet ability framework around this in order to roll out this model is an example that I do at the time one of these model is supposed to focus the T plus one tree the world volume four bond I go to the trader and they say there is a big drop in to double value for tomorrow so tomorrow may be problematic to that this one assuming that I'm right the next question the traders gonna ask me say why your model is forecasting a much lower number I honestly can't say to him I am beautiful deep learning mode like best estimate no I need to say to him because all these features they jump the movies so the forecast is change this is a big thing for us very good and it is something where we in Google have been really pushing hard on making sure that we're ready to help answer those Y types of questions is it something which we should always do so do you see a day when we just don't use really sophisticated models because we have to keep them all interpretable now first of all we count a lot on people like you solving the problem and second of all I was receiving one conference where question how much I will give away interpet ability to sit performance and my rule of thumb is if they numbered out to put the model produce is directly used for business decision I will give away a zero percent with repeatability so whatever it takes going back to a random forest or limb back to progressive model if is our features that are input of the final output maybe you can give up a little bit interpretability for example if you build a beautiful and in order to generate a sentiment indexable ability and this is one feature in your model that maybe it's becoming less important for you to be able to attribute to the sentiment to the input article that is impossible and does really make sense so depends the layer in the process of producing the output where is the model where we can give up into interpretability little bit yes I very much agree with that answer and I've usually see big big machine learning deployments your models feeding into other models sometimes you want to be able to isolate one of them and understand what it's doing but sometimes one of one of them which doesn't need to be explained because you're doing that work later on does align very good so what do you see is next in finance using artificial intelligence super specific case try to improve the quality of our model in leveraging this technology so for me a I'm a saloon is a tool to see better performance accounting for what we just say the interpretability component I personally see I'm a strong believer even it's not mine we may meet him we have the machine learning expertise we are not at least I'm not NLP NLP guy where people in Bachrach working on an LP I personally believe that NLP can contain a big source of valuable features to plug into the model so when it sees somebody building a powerful an app in order to extract sentiment from text or news I think this always would be a big step forward in the quality of our model I very much agree the natural language processing once any free text you got on your systems it's important to do several different things extract the entities being referenced if the text is a sentence find the relationship being describes in what we call in a triple in a knowledge graph and then sentiment there's another really big one so very much this is another aspect or example of a staged multiple layer machine learning and deployment where you're going to use more natural language processing to get you signals to help you make better decision is a very good thank you very much I really enjoyed talking to you I could talk to you for a lot longer and I think we're all very thrilled that important companies like Blackrock are really being careful about transparency in their AI work thank you tomorrow we are we show actually some of this example in the breakout session where we can see where we're able to push the model or we are so we're obliged to wait a little bit because internet ability all right that's great we'll look for that tomorrow thank you very much thank you pleasure so the next case today I want to talk through is from Walt Disney Company and it's it's one of these things where where in this case Walt Disney Company in many cases is an e-commerce company or a retail company and what they're trying to figure out is how can they actually get to know their users and B have a more personalized experience for for their users today earlier in the morning you saw that we released what we call recommendations AI and what we're doing here is we're taking a lot of the best of our knowledge of personalization and bringing this into a product that can deliver product recommendations at scale and Disney has been one of our first customers with this and they're using it for a variety of things on their shop Disney site so they're using this for things like placement on a product product detail page so that you can find things that are more like this they have an existing system in place and they're using one year of anonymized data to be able to figure out this this recommendation and their belief is that they can have better recommendations they'll have happier users and it'll increase their revenue and so what they've tried was a test with us kind of an a/b test with their existing system versus versus our system and this is literally what they saw which was really fascinating so you can see here and it's a little bit small but what the customer was trying to order here was an e or sleep mask and I can guarantee you that if you're getting an e or sleep mask you're probably not looking for the Darth Vader mask as well however the results on the right was the test Group B with our system and you can see the kinds of things that that this came up which are much much more logical if you're getting the e or sleep mask you probably want other things with a or or other things from winnie-the-pooh that that might be are there and so we're doing this based on not things just related to the current product but a holistic view of the of the customer from Disney's data to be able to produce these results and the results are much better for the for the end user and so what they saw in production was that this increased the average order value it increased the number of units per transaction and then also increase the revenue overall they've been running this now in production for for all of shop Disney since July of 2018 they were one of the first customers that we we worked with and then more recently they've been they've brought this together into the frequently brought together section and then they're now starting to do that since November of last year and so they're able to see some very tangible results that hit clear ROI for them so the last one that we want to talk about is Hulu and we talked a little about a bit about this onstage at the keynote this this morning but we want to dive into this this use case in a lot of detail and and talk about how Hulu has been using contact center AI to be able to help customer service so I'd like to welcome to the stage Matt Kravitz the director of service applications in via and viewer experience from Hulu good afternoon afternoon thank you for being here and so can you tell us a little bit about yourself and tell us a little bit about the hulu sure first question is why'd we put the guy with the new jersey accent after Stephano great accent so everybody's in for a treat with me so I'm Mac Kravitz and I'm the director of service applications for Hulu and I'm responsible for innovation specifically in the service experience so first I'm really really excited to be here there was something that was announced this morning the partnership with 5:9 and with Salesforce and it has a really an opportunity to affect many of our businesses so I'm super super excited so hopefully you guys know Hulu because many of you in the room you really are the target demographic but for those that don't we have 25 million active subscribers we're a 10 year old business and in our tenth year we experienced 48 percent year-over-year growth Wow so the good news is a lot of growth the downside is that a kid really put a lot of complexity and risk in terms of what it impacts in terms of the customer experience are you prepared for that sort of scale so it has some interesting challenges in in terms of trying to maintain customer satisfaction or CSAT within the within the call center and transactional experiences so why am i excited about AI I think it's really reached somewhat of an inflection point and I think this is a very very recent occurrence where the technology has become simplified enough and accessible enough that you don't have to be super technical as an organization and do a lot of hiring in terms of trying to get sort of a lift of capabilities right so because of that maturity and that that sort of point it really allows us to spend a lot more time worrying about the customer experience and a lot less time worrying about models and algorithms and things that really aren't as impactful in terms of our investments that makes and so how are you using the technology to enhance the customer experience okay so at hula we've decided to really focus on partnering there's other areas of the business that really are you know historically sort of a build business especially when it comes to our core competence which is media and streaming and searching algorithms but as you're starting to get further from the core competence and in the service environment we're partnering so we have three partners that were we're plugging into in our ecosystem the first is Salesforce we really use them end-to-end our help site of Salesforce our communities our omni-channel deployment so we offer a couple different ways to contact us through chat or telephony and we started our AI journey recently with chatbots the second partner is 5/9 who's a cloud-based telephony company it really has allowed us to scale up very quickly and it also plugs in very very well into Salesforce in terms of the omni-channel telephony capability and now we're partnering with Google and we're really exposing Google to the next generation of complex use cases and what's really so amazing for us is that we built out this ecosystem and as each of these partners are sort of evolving their respective roadmaps very easy for us to plug this in so something like a dialog flow it's just really almost even plug-and-play for us so it's a it's a really good partner ecosystem that we built that's great it feels like kind of one adds on top of each other yeah it makes that makes each one better and so can you talk a little bit about your business challenges and what are some of the challenges that you're facing right so we we alluded to that in the beginning which is that 48% number and what that growth really does to contact volume so you just can't depend on hiring more and more people just not scalable so we're becoming increasingly dependent upon technology and innovation right there's a couple KPIs that I think could sort of measure how you're making progress two very simple ones would be average handle time right a HT and measuring that and how technology can play against HD and it's a couple good examples of how we're addressing that and the other is positive deflection right so it's not deflection it's positive which is sort of helping people resolve issues so the question is if you're reducing a HT and you're trying to increase positive deflection how do you do that without sort of negatively impacting Net Promoter Score and see sad as well so you sort of have to balance both these things and that's an interesting business challenge no definitely that's really tricky and trying to figure out how to balance that without one affecting the other and so can you share anything really interesting with the audience and something cool that that you think would interest the audience yes so Hulu is a media company so we have now an animated short that we partnered with Salesforce in Google and it's this amazing new movie of course share it with you guys and that probably can explain it better than words could do wonderful we'd love to see that Google cloud and Salesforce are partnering to deliver a I powered customer service experiences so that every company can transform their customers experience let's show you who lose vision for scaling engaging experiences for their more than 25 million subscribers through the eyes of Lauren a Hulu viewer Hulu makes it easy for their viewers to get help anytime anywhere instead of customers having to navigate a lengthy phone tree a hulu bot powered by Google clouds virtual agent technology can immediately engage viewers in a human-like conversational experience help resolve issues 24/7 and seamlessly handoff the call to a human agent at the right time hi Lauren thanks for calling Hulu how can I help you today hi I would like to update my plan to watch the NBA basketball games sure thing looks like you've been watching on a chromecast ultra is this the device you'd be watching the game on yep perfect I'd recommend our Hulu Plus live TV plan if you'd like I can transfer you to one of our viewer experience advocates to get that set up that would be great thanks hey Lauren thanks for calling Hulu the human agent now has everything they need in the Salesforce Service Cloud console including the full call transcript to expedite case resolution Google's agent assist technology automatically presents machine learning driven recommendations making it easy for agents to know what viewers need and get answers fast it looks like you'd like to add the Hulu Plus live TV plan to watch the basketball games I'd be happy to help you out there that would be great perfect I'll update your plan to add live TV as the call progresses agent assist continues to surface new recommendations based on the context of the conversation did you know that you could also watch who live TV on additional devices such as tablets would you like me to help you set that up sure I'd like that great I'll send over an article that will walk you through the steps for future devices as well a I powered recommendations and offers are provided in real time allowing agents to add value to every conversation and keep viewers engaged and happy what else have you been watching recently besides basketball my husband and I have been wanting to binge watch Game of Thrones so we can get ready for the final season awesome did you know that if you add HBO through your Hulu plan you can watch directly in the Hulu app if you'd like I can add HBO to your plan as well yes let's do it agents are guided step-by-step through any business process no memorization of what to do next required the combined power of Google Cloud AI and Salesforce Einstein also makes call wrap up easy with pre-populated case details improving data quality and saving agents time as they move on to helping the next viewer with Google Cloud and Salesforce Hulu can now integrate ai into every service interaction and reimagine the viewer experience wow that's really interesting very cool this looks great on my IMG profile that's great but it's really interesting you know very very cool stuff it really shows that the example of how this can be so useful there's a lot here yeah two of my favorites I'd love to share so one is really good acronym to remembers RTS a real-time speech analytics so I think this is the game changer or one of the game changers so what's amazing to see during that video is what was happening in the center of the screen how as you're having a conversation with our viewer you're literally it's almost like a closed caption there's an there's an immediate transcription of the voice that technology itself isn't really the game changer but what happens is as that is being able to be transcribed into text and unlocks a few interesting capabilities so one interesting capability is in the traditional call center environment is when a case loads you're looking at a knowledge article or a next best action and it's sort of a singular concept in terms of how the conversation starts but it's amazing to watch that during that video that it's able to update itself and throughout the conversation to give really dynamic recommendations that's great so that RTS a really enables that technology so it's a very exciting conversation capability the other thing that it really could unlock is imagine during a call what you could do around a be testing so through upsells or retention offers again instead of having a static list having the system understand the intent of that conversation in that case you know Game of Thrones is an intent yeah and offering HBO as the next best action that package is just it really unlocks some pretty cool capabilities and with AI we can really do this across all of our calls not just a subset of the calls and you're really going to get optimal recommendations through that in terms of the business outcome of that and I know that's really sort of the focus is you're really getting at least 30 seconds in terms of the search cost knowledge articles Wow and for the next best action you know in our business seconds count yeah you know getting our viewers back to watching television faster is really our goal so saving you know 20 30 seconds it's really a very nice lift so that's gonna impact that average handle time that's great night and that's great for the customers and for you yep everybody wins that's great and so what about what about other use cases what's the second use case the second one is is my favorite and it's my favorite and it's really I think sort of a universal call center pain point which is the least fun thing about working a call center is attribution or after call work it sort of reminds me you know filling out an expense report and you have all those dropdowns like is it an airfare or is it a meal it's just painful and half the time you just really don't pick the right value because is it why am i spending all this time and energy picking the right value right call centers sort of feel the same way call center agents so very often you'll see a lot of others or alphabetically you'll get something at the top because it's the easiest to select so looking back at that video that screen that popped up on the upper right hand side in terms of what sort of the case outcome and the attribution around it it's it's a game changer for two ways number one again we're gonna get 20 seconds back per call so we have the 30 seconds from the last use case we're gonna get 20 seconds through the auto attribution but the other thing is that she gives us good data and insights so being able to partner with with somebody like Google who's going to be able to parse that information determine the intent give all that information back into the service console for the agent to say yes and do that final approval it's really going to give us some great insights that's really so dialog flow is really going to be very valuable for enabling that technology I think that's a pretty universal use case that's that's great well a last thought on this is around the ethics of AI and what can you tell us about your thoughts on that sure so we thought of two examples low-hanging fruit in terms of what we're gonna do is saving time so 50 seconds the question is what do you do with those 50 seconds I think the easy answer is just to say it's ROI and that's what's gonna fund your project there's also a very interesting potential counterpoint to that which is maybe there's something more humane to do at that time maybe you split the time with the agent meaning let's give 20 to 25 seconds over to ROI and back to the business maybe give 25 seconds back to the agent right just give them a second to breathe or to stand up or to just you know improve sort of the quality of their work experience so it really it's a very interesting conversation and I think we're just pretty fortunate to be in a situation to even be in midst of that internal debate but I think the the ethics of what AI is gonna bring is a really great topic so that's that's great that's a great way to think about it well this is a really interesting new approach we really appreciate you sharing this with us great thank you very much thank you so I really enjoyed this and you'll notice how talking about Google artificial intelligence the best way is to talk about the stories of what's actually happening in enterprises because that's where we are these days the key things that we're seeing in common is we're boosting the viewer engagement with scaling customer service we're making decisions more quickly and more transparently and we're making things globalised but we're still retaining that personalization touch I think most importantly this is within your reach this isn't something that's in the future it's there that that that's there right now and it's for for everyone for things like being more efficient for things like unlocking the value of your data and reaching your customers in in a better way so definitely there are many many sessions that are going to go into a lot more depth here at next and then if you want to find more go to cloud.google.com slash slash AI and we'd love to be working with all of you thank you [Music]
