 Tell everyone at home we'll be late tonight So don't wait up We've earned the right to celebrate So forgive all my mistakes Friends, for a handful of hours today Let's walk the wayward path Let's turn our backs on the world Let's break all the rules Out in the open Making a sound Drenched in red dye Like true heroes, we'll dance Jai Jai Shivshankar! Carefree and wild Let the colours fly! We're raring to go Carefree and wild Let the colours fly! Jai Jai Shivshankar! Carefree and wild Let the colours fly!
