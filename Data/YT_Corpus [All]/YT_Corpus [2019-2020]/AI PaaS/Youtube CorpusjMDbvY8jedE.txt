 Hi! My name is Amy Sturkey. I am here with my friend, Charis. Hi! Hi! We are going to work on more sitting balance. Charis has pretty good sitting balance. I can support her way down low. Right now my hands are on her thighs and she can sit up independently. For another child I might have to support up higher. Before we worked on side to side sitting balance. Now I am going to work on the front and back. So just keep that right there. Not the wire. Okay. Okay. Okay. So, I can sit her in between and I am going to rock her forward and back. Oh! Forward and back. Foward and back. Forward and back. The further I take her, the harder it is. Again you are wanting to see her curl toward the uphill side. So against it is a C Curve but it is a C curve forward. When I go forward she is arching back. When I go back, she is arching forward. The faster I go, the harder it is. For a kid this age, a lot of times the faster I go, the more fun it is. Hi! That is perfect. You can call this the rocking chair if you want. Oh, heavens, oh, oh. It is alright. That is a simple idea for you to do at home. I'will talk to you later. Bye-bye! Hey!
