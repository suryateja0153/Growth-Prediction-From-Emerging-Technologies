 Oh Life, what have you gained, what did you lose We breathe to stay alive All hearts are worried Even though not fulfilled, but still have several dreams in our eyes, Don't get too immersed in this life, it will entangle you It will take away everything that is there in the heart Oh Life, what have you gained, what did you lose Oh Life, what have you gained, what did you lose People abandon you like life does Who once were the center of your life Keep you in their heart but take you for granted Forget you like life has forgotten you Are you listening to the noise of desires in the heart It will take away everything that is in your heart too Oh Life, what have you gained, what did you lose Oh Life, what have you gained, what did you lose Why do you feel like a stranger sometimes Life what kind of a bond is this Have tried to live this life with passion But the heart is always scared now There is so much uncertainty in life, nobody knows what will happen It will take away everything that’s left in your heart Tell me Life what have you gained, what did you lose Tell me Life what have you gained, what did you lose
