 [ELECTRONIC MUSIC] FRANCESCO STASI: BotSupply is a company where we work with conversational AI. AI and chat bots are a tool, but they have no power without people behind it who, first of all, build them and also design them. More and more, the interaction will be on a voice level. We were building the whole stack internally. Our front end, our back end, and everything was running on Google. Then we got into the Oracle startup program. We switched to OCI. And as of today, I think that we're saving 60% to 70% of our costs in infrastructure. We also built our IP on top of the Oracle Digital Assistant. So we are actually working across different products and paths from Oracle. I think that helped us greatly in being more efficient and faster and cheaper when going to market. And now but BotSupply is 100% running on the Oracle Cloud. BotSupply makes it easy to build multilingual Oracle bots, the common win-win that we find with Oracle and the reason why we're going to market together in so many different regions and countries. We have a case with Save the Children where people can interact with a bot. So that first interaction with the chat bot is something that helps them to open up, and then eventually only at a later stage get in touch with a human. It's about enlarging the network of Oracle partners that we have on a global scale and really bring the Oracle technology to all the biggest enterprises in the world. [ELECTRONIC MUSIC]
