 [Music] so my name is Bob City I'm a VP of cloud engineering for Atos and I'm currently based in London for those of you close enough to the front of the stage to be able to count the Rings under my eyes I think you can correlate that to the number of hours difference between London and San Francisco so in today's session we are going to look at the role of hybrid clouds in acceleration transformation - cloud is a really big topic it is quite complex there's a lot of technologies involved so we can really only scratch the surface but before we start that I like to just make a quick introduction about what data says who we are and what we do so a toast or a global digital services leader operating in 73 different countries we've got in excess of 120 thousand people with an annual revenue of circa 12 billion years we provide a quite a wide variety of IT services spanning from digital transformation managed services application development application transformation security Big Data you name it we do it well established organization April last year we announced a global enhanced alliance partnership with Google focusing on hybrid cloud machine learning AI digital workplace and security and I'm very proud that this year we've been recognized as the Google cloud global breakthrough partner so artists on Google are driving six distinct innovation tracks focusing on increasing application agility and able enabling s AP on cloud I oh t enhanced real-time collaboration artificial intelligence and secure hybrid clouds so the agenda for today in today's session we're going to start by putting a little bit of business context around what it is that enterprises are striving to do and we're going to try to drill down from that position into what sort of transformations need to take place we're also going to look at some of the typical challenges that enterprises experience and how working with a trusted partner can alleviate some of those burdens and we'll move into the role of holistic hybrid clouds in helping to accelerate and hopefully I'm going to be able to get the time to also spend a few minutes to tell you about a product launch that we did this Tuesday at Google next for our newest hybrid cloud offering and we'll close this session with a bit of Q&A and if there isn't sufficient I'm more than happy to take questions after the session and obviously we'll be at the stall in chardee so regardless of the sector and enterprise organization is within operating within there are quite a lot of common themes that we all strive to achieve today especially in the context of a global digital market we see these things across pretty much all of our customers and actually we recognize those exact same things internally within our own organization and they're relatively simplistic we all strive for agility the ability to be the disrupter rather than the disrupted we strive to have data-driven businesses where the decision making is based on analytics and real-time data we want to increase our revenue base through the introduction of differentiated offerings and we want to do that in a way where we are cost controlling and making sure the solutions are pulling together our cost optimal and competitive so to achieve these aims there is quite a lot of change that's required business processes need to change in order to provide agility security processes need to change in order to provide agility and equally your application development method all themselves need to be changing to give you that agility looking at a data-driven decision-making sort of scenario again your application space needs to be able to support that there needs to be a consolidation of your data in order to be able to effectively apply machine learning and analytics to your data and equally from a revenue and cost perspective well in order to actually find what's a differentiator in the market you need real data and you need the real analytics again is that their data to understand what the demand in the market is automation plays absolutely huge part in ensuring that we got a cost-effective solution and we are able to control the costs and be competitive and equally cloud native solutions enable you to really it's the utility model is utilizing resources at the point you need them being able to scale up and down in line with the agility of your business so I want to drill down another level further than from this and look at really what are the transformational spaces that we need to look into so from a business process perspective this is the absolute bare minimum we need to enable the business to be able to make decisions based on data and analytics IT operations majority of our other organizations we work with are still I tool based they use IT Service Management to link in order to manage the environments and processes and to achieve the actual agility that we require me to start moving more and more and more towards deaf setups you're gonna hear me repeat the word deaf sack ups over and over in this and hopefully it's nothing new to anyone here but it's actually really complex and really hard space to get into especially when your starting point is traditional IT operations security again embedding security in the application development space as opposed to it being a wrapper after the fact and the biggest challenge at the moment is we're in the era of multi cloud hybrid cloud on-premise solutions and coming up with processes and technologies and tools that actually are able to effectively span all three of those spaces to give you a consolidated view of your security is a tough task similar with your processes around security not unlike the rest of IT services I think automation is absolutely key within the security space so we need to look at the ways of automating security processes security testing security governance within or essentially it's things like our CIC the pipeline's policy driven architectures where why we can articulate policies the security policies and other business policies in a way where the technology can enforce them and anyone who is working in in sort of regulated industries or with governmental bodies will be aware of the amount of work that needs to be done with the legislative bodies with the government bodies in essentially trying to bring them up to speed with the cloud negative technologies they have to go on the same transformation and understanding and learning that we all do and it's we have to bring them along with us so this is a this is not a short-term fix and it's going to take some time and later on we'll look at some ways that we can try to help accelerate at least parts of this process so that is not the whole thing is not a serial application development back to dev psych ops putting the appropriate practices in place so we are able to effectively get agility out of our or application development space putting the right quality assurance and testing capabilities including the security we touched upon within our CI CD pipelines adoption of all these new technologies so kubernetes cloud functions acts as a service by X as a service I'm talking about things like PA's SAS database as a service a IML as a service Big Data as a service so all of those total technologies need to be adopted why do they need to be adopted because they form the building blocks of your applications Europe your applications and developers do not have to recreate those things from scratch they're ready to be consumed and it's critical that we start moving our applications towards using those ready-made services and building blocks that are managed by managed service providers so your business can concentrate on developing applications for a line of business as opposed to caring about the under-the-hood IT and we gotta be realistic at this point in time our vast majority of the applications that are in the enterprise space are still not cloud native at a rough guess I would say 95% of the applications are non cloud native and that's probably somewhat generous so we still gotta be aware that we've got a significant portion of work to do in order to transform replace refactor those applications to get them to cloud native space data consolidation so separation of the code from data is absolutely key and especially when we start looking at technology such as kubernetes where essentially the code base is running in a pod that pod can be killed it can be recreated as many times as you like it can be scaled up it can be scaled down their data mustn't be affected for not so separating code from data is absolutely crucial at this stage and it's a real difficult task to be with legacy applications we also have to look at centralization and normalization of that data in order to then effectively apply analytics if anyone's worked with sort of the AI ml type of technologies machine learning it's it's somewhat of a area where there's a lot of experimentation required you're not always sure about the viability of a particular idea being model able in an effective way through machine learning so experimentation is required and we need to build capabilities where we can do proof of concepts but they rapidly take a proofs of proof of concept that we've shown to be working into a production level application and this probably worthwhile mentioning from an AI ml perspective and analytics as a whole it's a bi-directional relationship in terms of the way whether it drives the business or the business drives it so your practice is from a IML perspective have got to be able to respond to business demand and be able to model things and predict things as the business requires but equally we got to be open to the challenges that information and analytics lead sources can lead to us changing our business models Automation again it's an absolutely theme throughout this presentation in being able to automate as much of the processes because your agility is highly dependent on it and we are getting to a space at the moment where more and more things are getting easier to automate and we gotta ensure things like Quality Assurance testing and the security side are really effectively addressed through the automation piece and CIC D is one answer CIC D is a methodology CIC D enables you to encode your business rules and practices your security capability is testing from from our own internal perspective for example when we're developing our cloud platforms our CI CD pipelines actually include whole set of security testing around scanning the code for quality for inadvertent insertion of vulnerabilities for upstream reliance on upstream libraries that may have vulnerabilities included within them and the QA sort of thing is equally so we want to get to a point where an application developer checking code in automatically triggers our whole set of pipelines that will automatically give you to a point where you have confidence that code is sufficiently tested to directly deploy into production that's where you get your agility from and that's got a cover security and the technology and everything else to do with it it's gotta be policy driven again going back to the point of being able to encode business rules policies legislative rules policies all of those things in a way where they can programmatically be tested as part of your ability to deploy and also to build your solutions and we've gotta adopt all the cloud native technology so those are who are familiar with kubernetes space probably understand the analogy of cattle versus pets when when we look at the current existing set of applications we're dealing with enterprise applications are typically very stateful we really care about the state of our virtual machines and our servers if they die they take things down with them that affects our business in cloud native world we are in a complete different scenario we don't patch a server we create a new port we create a new pod we start directing some of the traffic towards that pod if it's successful and it's not failing we start diverting all of the traffic to the new pod and we get the rid of the old one so mentality wise is a mindset shift your application development and QA processes it's a shift and actually gaining agility but he said has a reliance on your applications being architected in a way where they able to support that kind of mechanism and your operational practices has got to be aligned to being able to do the kind of testing to be able to understand the effect of introducing a new version of a service and directing the portion of unity and canary testing for example so it's a lot of work to be there to be done there and I mentioned this before around the X as a service whatever it is as a service adoption of those in order to accelerate the actual application development process so the cloud challenge we are transforming far more than the IT we're barely skirting around the edges of of the non-id elements in this particular presentation but there are cultural shifts that need to happen there are business processes that need to happen this security processes there's legislative stuff that we've got to deal with when we look at our typical customer scenarios of what they go through when they start looking at transformation and moving to public cloud quite often the starting point is looking at the regulatory and compliance needs that typically forms some sort of a concept or architecture and what they need to do for security and their networking and usually it's fairly traditional base rod and cloud native approaches that are adopted because at that stage all of us are in the same boat we haven't quite learned what we need to be doing then we start looking at selective applications being transformed or adopting ready-made cloud native applications in order to to satisfy our needs so we then end up in a position we've got selective applications our own public cloud the rest of our environment is still in a non cloud native mode and not on Prem it is usually at this stage that most businesses that we have been working with have a realization that the pace of public cloud adoption is far far slower than they would like and in order to accelerate that most organization go down the path of looking at lift and shift there's a few problems so we've got our existing application space the legacy applications or traditional application space which is now cloud native traditional operations around it traditional security around it you're talking about change control boards cabs people approving changes being applied into production and now we've got a set of applications which are completely different in the way they're being managed I'm their cloud native living in public cloud so one or two things can happen you either enforce your existing IT processes on top of your cloud native stuff that been deployed on public cloud in which case you are reducing the agility of that entire solution or you end up in a mixed mode of operations where the cloud native stuff is dealt with in a different way to to your on-prem or traditional applications and if it's not planned upfront really well you end up with an inconsistent application of controls so governance IT governance technical governance security governance you can end up in a position where you have a complete mismatch and inability to consciously say that you've applied your governance practices equally across the board so when we start looking at a holistic hybrid cloud and I'm intentionally keep putting the word holistic here because it's much more than just the cloud platforms themselves we start looking at a holistic hybrid cloud ecosystem what does it do the extents and brings the cloud to your premises simplistic allows you to do a coexistent model and a bimodal mode of operations so we have to delve into that much more but there are certain characteristics that these clouds need to have in order to enable that but they also enable us at least in the short term to predict it protect our existing investments and you know we we have a hell of a lot of customers who are going through this journey to public cloud and the reality of situation is and this is not uncommon we we talk to them and they've got a 10-year lease on a datacenter that cannot be changed overnight they've got that existing investment and finally where we are protecting the existing investment is critical and I think hybrid clouds is one way to address that in the short term so are the characteristics of a hybrid cloud in order to enable those things these are opinionated need to be open standards and native API based by that I mean for example open source standard API is there are not proprietary and that is to enable essentially integration with orchestration tools with CMP tools there are available out there without getting locked in any true hybrid hybrid capability in order to such that if you start developing your applications on the private cloud element of a hybrid you don't have to spend the same R&D or application development time to then transform them to run on public you development work once you do it once in a true hybrid cloud environment you should be able to have full portability in order to move them to public lab when the rest of the processes and things that you need to change within the organisation are ready for it CIC the end policy-driven architecture we've talked about already absolutely crucial that your hybrid cloud solutions are able to support these methodologies and again it goes back to the to the point of being able to present out standardized non proprietary open api's that means that whatever work you do in developing your CIC any pipelines again is reusable regardless of what cloud you're running on and this is another key point so we still have got our existing traditional IT service processes they're not gonna go over it over away overnight and we need to maintain those services and processes in order to ensure governance is still there so we still need a way of bridging the old and a new so a true hybrid cloud solution needs to give you the capability whereby you're integrating your actual processes you're ITSM toolsets with that platform but in a way where it's not affecting agility and the ability to you see icd capabilities it's a hard thing to do but I think that is an absolutely crucial requirement for a true hybrid cloud solution many of you know adoption of public cloud again it's a it's a topic that is driven sometimes by motion it to be truly successful in adopting cloud your developers need to love working in that environment they need to see advantage they need to see a different way of working they would have to like it if they don't like it they will go and do something else that's the reality we've seen adoption of public cloud come about in pockets of line of business applications within our clients purely because the developers like the ecosystem that they have on public cloud so to make a hybrid cloud successful we need to ensure we are providing the developers with the same set of care abilities the same set of tools that they actually want to use and helps them to develop their applications on Prem so why is it different this time there's been so many iterations of technologies changing new things coming along we had virtualization 10 years back coming along and with the promises that would completely transform the way we do businesses I do think we're at the unique point at the moment we've got a real convergence of the convergence of the infrastructure application and security technologies methodologies all of those things coming together so dev check ups CICE capabilities automated QA cloud native stateless applications AI ml analytics all of these things have come to converge at the same time to enable us to do for more successes as successful sort of transformation than we were able to do before and a hybrid cloud environment has got to enable you to take advantage of all those technologies and has to actually drive the usage of those technologies so we've only barely touched on these things but there's a hell of a lot of new technologies there's a hell of a lot of new processes new ways of thinking about things there's a lot of learning to be done by by the entirety of our organizations it's challenging it's really crucial I think for everyone to think about working with trusted partners that can help them work through some of these challenges bring the right skills to the table and help organizations adapt their existing application development practices to be to be a deficit corpse based teach you about the technologies where it's necessary and adopt all of these things I think it's crucial to try to avoid all of the typical pitfalls by getting help from your trusted partners in our case when we have a partnership between someone that is helping you transform your business and the cloud provider is a three-way partnership which brings a lot more value so I'm going to quickly summarize the stuff that we talked about and today transformation is at every level it's not just in a technology space it is in the people space it is in the culture of the organization it is the entirety of your business processes your security processes your application development processes so it is at every single level this is the price of getting agility if you want your businesses to be agile and be able to compete and come up with those differentiated offerings this is the sort of transformation that needs to be taking place we need to get to a place where we're able to encode business processes or governance or security all into automated ways of being applied applying those so see ICD through automated policy enforcement then we have to ensure that whatever solutions we put forward or capable of supporting these things hybrid clouds can significantly accelerate movement to cloud public cloud cloud overall adoption of cloud why because they allow you to paralyze your activities so if you looked at that typical scenario scenario that was talking through earlier where we were talking to the legislators or governing bodies see what we're allowed to do looking at changing our security practices and look at changing our network practices once we're done that we start doing pockets of applications if you have a hybrid cloud environment to do your development work on and it's got all of the same capabilities or the vast majority of the core capabilities and you need for your developers to do cloud native application development but on Prem within the confines of your own security space your existing network space etc you're paralyzing that set of activities so by nature you're going to shorten the timescales required to do the overall transformation and it's kind of leading by example when it comes to bringing their legislators or auditing bodies alongside with you you have real-life examples running on Prem that are compliant to the existing security requirements but also demonstrate what can be done we talked about the hybrid clouds needing to provide the right ecosystem that developers want to adopt and they've got to be developer centric if we don't hit that piece like I said your developers will go elsewhere do it some other way and we end up with that mixed governance model and the inability to apply the right level of governance controls where all of us including me on a learning journey continuously these technologies some of these technologies are bleeding edge they're developing it every day something new happen something new functionality comes out so it's working with your trusted partners in order to accelerate and D risk a transformation so I'm really proud and excited to present the Atlas open hybrid cloud platform which was launched on Tuesday morning at this event I'm going to try to keep the marketing elements of this to a bare minimum but in short OHC is a managed hybrid cloud platform and that at a base level provides both iOS and kubernetes in the same box which means you have dynamic scaling between the two it provides sass and past services that are mirroring what is on GCP databases service big data as a service a IML he has got hybrid capabilities so I'm sure you've seen the keynote speeches and anthos anthos is embedded within this product and you are able to use this product in both a true private mode so if you're not quite ready to open up your network and have a true hybrid capability you can start off with a big private and dynamically change configuration to move it into a hybrid mode Otzi is cost optimized it is entirely based on open source technologies and we have been working with our partners Google to ensure the set of technologies that we built on this platform are api compatible and again going back to the point of being able to develop your applications once and deploy many into any cloud that's the work that we've been doing for the past four months in order to ensure other interoperability from a DevOps perspective all the api's are available for consumption the native API is there are no proprietary API is everything that it is on the platform is open standards all the third-party tools for orchestration CMPs etc all integrate with it out of a box it is really intended as a gateway to accelerate move to public cloud and it is extremely developer centric so like I said all of the api's are fully exposed that and they are the native API so we are the first Google partner to implement anthos on top of OpenStack there's a lot of advantages on that front including their costs so other things but we it does allow us to offer a platform which is a combination of the IRS and the cast side of things but more crucially the ecosystem that you see on the screen it isn't just the hosting elements of a cloud platform it is all the data services the key data services that any application developer developing micro services would want to use and above and beyond that your capabilities around AI ml there's variants of this in terms of the hardware models where we've got very high end GPU acceleration so again you can do even the cube flow and AI ml aspects of it on this platform the solution itself incorporates the concept of policy engine policy engine and let me be clear about this because there's a there's a lot of different uses of the word policy engine many people think of it in terms of identity access management that's not what I'm talking about I'm talking about policies that represent genuine business level policies so take an example an application has got a requirement to be PCI DSS compliance so that application can be tagged to be PCI DSS compliant your pipelines and your policy engine must prevent that application being deployed on top of a platform which is not PCI DSS compliant and when it gets down to the level of the actual technical components and the way the services are delivered and the characteristics our platform that's where the policy enforcement comes in and is able to discern whether this platform is suitable to deploy such an application on top of it could be more simplistic than that geofencing so we know many countries around the world have got policies about certain data not leaving their perimeters we're able to for example apply geofencing policy that says the application can be deployed in this particular instance of the private cloud or in that region of a public cloud but not others so we're talking about the high level business level policies which then our solution translate into a much lower level granule technical implementation of those policies so there's a couple more elements I want to show one so we talked earlier on about hybrid clouds integrating with existing ìtell processes ITSM tool sets so we have created a level of abstraction in this specifically for that purpose so we have a sort of message bosses which are actually based on Google pops up where we are able to publish all the messages from event alerting and CMDB perspectives or you create a new instance of instance of a virtual machine or you create new kubernetes cluster or you spin up a new applications on kubernetes the events will be published so they can be consumed by existing tool sets you can still apply your auditing and compliance using your existing tool sets the solution itself has not got a reliance to manage services around the solution or DevOps mode and don't have a reliance on those ideas and tools but it does allow that bimodal operation and marrying up the existing oil processes with the develop side of things so talking about that message boss and the pops up we have an implementation of pops up within this platform itself we work with Google to to actually create a solution where whereby we've got 100% an API compatible version of pops up running free locally and in hybrid mode it creates a connection to GCP and gives you a single message boss across GCP and your private cloud it's a really powerful concept because it does mean that events all of those types of things again can be correlated and collected in a multi cloud or hybrid cloud scenario centralized viewed analyzed all those things become possible when you've got ability to span with one set of technologies message buses across one or more clouds the manage databases managed Big Data services again these are accelerators and because there are API compatible with with the Google services it's the same concept of write the application once and you're able to deploy and consume it in multiple clouds private or on-premise or non-public we've got demos of our platform in the stall and I would really welcome you to come and join us so these are live demos they're not pre-recorded we've got a number of different ones we got our overview where we just show you around what the what the product looks like and what they Piz offers and the user interface within it we demonstrate a hybrid application being deployed onto the private cloud the same hybrid application being deployed to public cloud and then we split that application into multiple parts or the front-end web services for example run on GCP using a history of service mesh communicating back to database services running on prem so your data stayed on Prem your web service is scalable bursts out if you like into public so it's quite powerful and we have got a demo of anthos so we can actually go into google console we see the private cloud as appearing as a region within the GCP console you can go into the marketplace you can select an application for marketplace and deploy it directly onto the private cloud it's quite a powerful thing to be able to use the marketplace all the work that goes into creating these template of the applications and being able to reuse those regardless of the fact that you're running on Prem [Applause] [Music]
