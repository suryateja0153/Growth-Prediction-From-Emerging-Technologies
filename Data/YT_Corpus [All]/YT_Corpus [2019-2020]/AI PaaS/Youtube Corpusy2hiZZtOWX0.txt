 Hello! My name is Amy Sturkey. I am a pediatric physical therapist. I am here with my co-instructor, Myla. We specialize in teaching children how to get stronger who have low tone. So, we are working on core strength a lot to help her learn how to crawl. So we are putting in this activity working on side strength. We have worked on back strength and stomach strength. We are going to work on the side. So we are going to have her go off to the side this time, to grab something...oh! It might be too big to grab. Uh-huh. I am going to lead her down off to the side and have her come back up. Yay! for Myla. I need that. I need that. Again, I have got her straddling my legs on purpose. For one that puts her up higher so she has to go down further to pick something up but for two, I don't want her turning toward it to pick it up. I want her to go truly off to the side. What a good girl you are. I can do the same trick as I did on the previous video if this is too easy. I can raise it up a little bit so that she has to go down further. I am going to steal that right here. Go get it! Excellent work! So I do the same thing on both sides. You are doing super today young lady! That's the end of this video I hope you enjoyed it and hope you find something useful. Thanks a lot! Bye- bye!
