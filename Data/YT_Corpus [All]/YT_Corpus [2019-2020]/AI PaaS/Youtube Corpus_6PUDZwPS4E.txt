 Hello! My name is Amy Sturkey. I am a pediatric physical therapist. I am here with my co-instructor. His name is Sebastian. He just had a birthday. He is seven years old. We are going to teach an idea on working on head control. Sebastian has trouble holding up his head for long periods of time against gravity. One of the ways he loves to work on it is he loves to move. So we have gotten two scooter boards on the bottom, a folded up mat, two wedges, and non-skid stuff on top of that, Sebastian on top of that, and a belt holding him down to keep him from rolling off so I can feel pretty safe being on the other end. I have his hands which tend to be pretty tightly fisted, I have got them wrapped it wrapped around the hoop. We are going to go for a ride. Ready? Let's go, my friend. Mmm, Sebastian you got to lift up your head just a little bit further. Hey, let's turn around. Here we go. We got to go, Sebastian. There you go. Lift up that head. That is right. What Sebastian tends to want to do, is he wants to have his head way up too high or too down too low. So his head is not all the way down. It is somewhere in the middle, which is exactly what I want. So let's get that hand back on. You ready? To get his hand on, I pushed down his wrist into flexion, that opens up his fingers and then it allows him to hold back on again. Let's go again around one more time around for the people-watching. Sebastian, lift up your head just a little bit more. Thank you, sir. Nice Sebastian. Nice. Sebastian, you got to lift up your head just a little further. Thank you, Sebastian. Sebastian really likes this idea. Hey, lift up your head just a little bit more. Thank you. He really likes this idea. I hope this is something you can do at home, and we will look forward to seeing you next time. Thanks! Bye-bye!
