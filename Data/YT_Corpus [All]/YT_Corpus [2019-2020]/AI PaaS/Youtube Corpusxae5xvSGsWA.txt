 Hello! My name is Amy Sturkey. I am a pediatric physical therapist with a little over 30 years of clinical experience. I am here with my friend, Myla. We are going to work on dynamic walking balance. One of the skills we are going to work on today is stepping over. I am using this broom as a something to step over. Let's see if I can get her to do it. Alright. Come on Little Bird. Ready? We are going to go step, step, step, step. Step over. Woo hoo! Way to go! Way to go! Yes! Yes! Yes! You ready? 1,2,3. Not on! You have got to step over. Step over. Uh-oh We are going to step over. Over! Yay! Do it again. Do it again! Come on. You ready? We are going to step, uh-oh, uh-oh, oh, oh, oh. Step over. Step over. You ready? Step over. So when I am practicing this with a child, sometimes I will put a spot on the other side like a carpet square. I have some round dots that are colorful, just to mark the spot where I want the child to go to. I will pay attention to if they always lead with the same leg and then try to work on the other leg too. Right now it looks like I am needing to give her a handheld. A lot of times kids do want to step on as opposed to stepping over, so I will help them get the feel, usually with hand over leg assistance like I am doing with her to get the feeling of stepping over as opposed to stepping on. But it is a way to work on dynamic balance for children who are early walkers. Thanks a lot and I will see you next time. Bye-bye!
