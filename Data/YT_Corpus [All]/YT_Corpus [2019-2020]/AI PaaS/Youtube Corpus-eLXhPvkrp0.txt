 welcome to quest fonts YouTube channel a very very warm welcome to this one hour of free course around a said nine hundred as your fundamental certification so in this one hour of free course we will cover seven questions you know around capex around OPEX around eoz Pia's and CEA's and so on but before I get started our very good news out here I want to announce if you go and if you share this video on your LinkedIn on your Twitter or Facebook you get is at nine hundred practice question PDF for free so once you share this video do email us on respond at Qualcomm so that we can provide you the free PDF so in this one hour we'll be covering seven questions right but before I start with those seven questions you know let us go ahead and first understand what exactly is this is at nine hundred certification what kind of syllabus do we have you know how many topics do we have what is the intention and goal of this exam and how is this course structure so this course of one hour how is it structured you know for preparing the exam right so before we go into the seven questions let us first understand what exactly is a said 900 certification exam is it 900 is a Microsoft certification exam which tests your fundamental knowledge of cloud and Azure services so anyone out there who's making his first move into cloud and specifically as your cloud then this certification is for you so now let us go ahead and let us see you know what does this exam contain what kind of syllabus is laid out what is the intention behind his exam from the Microsoft point of view right so I'm going to go and search as your 900 now you can see there is some there is there is a very bad word here called hazard 900 dumps I would suggest everyone to avoid dumps remember that certification can expire but knowledge cannot expire right so I would suggest that please take this exam from the knowledge point of view and this course will target from the knowledge point of view right so I to still go ahead and such as your 900 you can also search for s at 900 right we can also go ahead and search for is at 900 if you search for is at 900 you can see this website out here doc start Microsoft comm please note that there are lot of other websites as well which can come here as an ad banner right for example it's not coming for now but as your 900 if you go and search like this there are chances you know that you can get some ads out here right so do not click on those ad links because those ad links are not coming from the authority Microsoft website the authority Microsoft website you know where the syllabus is described is this one doc start Microsoft com so you can see the first link out here exam is at 900 will go and be trick on that link and you can see on this link you know there is a small one page explanation out here and if you go and if you read this explanation carefully you can you can see out here that this is an fundamental exam so this is an exam which is a more of a foundational course so please note that is at 900 is a foundational course for people who want to start with cloud for people who want to start with as you all right so let us go out here and let us try to download the exam syllabus out here so somewhere you know they should give out the syllabus so you can see a download exam skills outline please note that if you are going and if you are visiting this website after a year it is possible that some of these links name can change but you can see here download the exam skills outline and you can very clearly see out here that this exam has four skills you know which it which it will test so cloud concept azure services security and trust and as your pricing and SLA right so I'm going to go and download this skills outline out here and you can clearly see out here that there is a there is a long page document out here which describes the syllabus in more detail right so now you can go ahead and you can read this you can read you know what kind of audience profile Microsoft is expecting but I would give you a quick one-minute understanding of the broader level of syllabus in a stat 900 the complete is at 900 is divided into four sections first one is the cloud concept you know wherein they expect you to understand what is cloud they expect you to understand what is capex what is OPEX and so on and they have allocated approximately 15 to 20 percent of concentration on it right the second topic you know is about Azure services means what kind of services Microsoft is is giving out to you and what knowledge you should have out there right now remember that when you talk about Azure services from the a from this example of you they only want the what part of it what means for example that what is this Internet of Things services provided by Microsoft or probably what kind of services are provided in big data or what kind of services are provided in Azure devolves so they want to want you to know you know the what part of the service it is ok that if you do not know how to go and create the service or if you do not know the internals of it but they at least want to want you to let know that what kind of services Microsoft is providing right then the third chapter or I will rather say that for me this is the third chapter which is around as your pricing and SLA so basically how is the pricing calculated right how are the subscription managed do we have a free account or not so so so basically over here and also we have this pricing calculator you know which can help you to calculate the pricing so here if you know this topic is focused on out the pricing part and the most important topic the fourth one is around the security and Trust at the end of the day when people want to go on cloud out there they are very worried about you know their data lot of countries out there do not even want to share data on Asiya for example if you look at India then the Indian government does not really want to share their data on us your cloud right why because it is it is the country's data right so how is Microsoft addressing the issues how it is making the customer feel comfortable right so all is there in this chapter as well right and every chapter out there is allocated some percentage you can see this is 25 to 30 percent and this one here is 30 to 35 percent and so on right so for topics so there are 4 topics in is at 900 cloud concepts as your services as your services has the highest percentage of concentration of concentration out there and then security and trust and finally as your pricing and SLA also let me give you a brief about how this course is structured how this course will be executed so normally if you see any course out there first what they do is you know they teach you the concept so they will have a topic we will teach you the concept and then around that concept you know we go through the questions and then we answer right but here we won't follow this methodology we will follow a bit different methodology where we will first take the questions so we'll take question number one must be we will go through the question and then around that question you know whatever concept is needed we will do that concept and then we will answer that question right so why this format if you look at the syllabus of is at 900 it is very vast you know for example you can see here let us take this you know describe core as your services 35% allocated to it so this is the main topic and if you look at you know subtopics for example look at this is a sub topic in this sub topic itself there are so many topics virtual machines virtual machines scale sets and app services and ACI and qu Burnett's so for even if I take each one of these subtopics subtopics you know it will take so much time to complete that topic and then take the question right so by following the QCA way what will happen is if we will be focused right so we will be very much focused around that question second we will learn in small bits so we will have small successes and that we make our learning more effective right so the format of this complete courses question concept only around the question and when I when I teach this concept I will point towards the lesson so when I say that okay this question is for chapter one so what I will do is I will go ahead and say that this is the first chapter one out here and this question belongs that or must be if there is a question which is coming from the second chapter I will say okay this question is from the second chapter right so whenever I explain the concept I will link it to the chapters as well so so that you know you have an idea that what we are doing right so the format is first questions then concept and then finally the answer so let us get started with the first question so let us start with the first question of a Sat 900 so you can see the first question of s at 900 certification is flashed on the screen out there now before I answer this question this question is related to chapter one so if you remember in this this chapter one which was about cloud concept which has like 15 to 20 percent of concentration in this you know we have a topic here called as cap X which means capital expenditure and OPEX which means operational expenditure right so if you understand these if you understand the terminology of capex and OPEX you can easily answer this question so let us first try to understand what exactly is capex and OPEX in the context of azure now let us try to analyze what kind of infrastructure cost we need to invest on when you say that you are buying a server or you are hosting a website and so on right so the first thing is you need to go and invest on the hardware so basically you will go and you will buy X amount of configuration which will have an X amount of RAM it will have an X amount of hard disk and so on right so we will invest on the hardware we also invest on the software for example must be you are buying a license OS or must be you're buying MS Office or office software's or must be antivirus you know so you have an afront hardware cost software cost which you need to invest so this is termed as capex capital expenditure expenditure which is invested upfront right now once you start using this infrastructure right you will have running cost also attached to it like for example probably you will need a vendor who will look at your look look after your hardware or must be you have a salaried employee you know who will look after your Hardware right so you will have a salary cost attached to it wherein you will recruit some people to look after this Hardware right then you can have other cost you know for example backup you know must be you if you have some backup strategy then you will buy something on a kind of a media drive and that media drive again you have to go and invest and also probably you will be also a person will be that to do a backup and so on right so you have some kind of a running cost in which is termed as OPEX so when you say that you are going to go and build your infrastructure manually you have these two kind of cost capex and OPEX but now when you talk about cloud cloud is pay-as-you-go PS you go means for example let us say I want to go and have a windows 2019 server you know with the Windows operating system and so on so what I can do is I can just go to us you are out here and I can just type your virtual machine right and I can go and I can create a virtual machine which is having Windows 2019 data center installed so you can see or I can go and say or I can use Ubuntu I can use Red Hat but also I can use the windows 2019 datacenter I can decide you know that I want to CPU with 8gb almost before CPU with 16gb right ram and ram and so on right and all of this billing you know will be done to me pay-as-you-go monthly right that means that let us say I can take this infrastructure I can use it for two months three months and if I feel know like it is not working out for me I just leave it there in case of upfront investment what happens is let's say that you do not like that Hardware you have to literally then give it out at a very low cost in second and in second and also things really don't go out then you literally donate it out and so on right so here again the benefit is that you don't have to talk about depreciation you don't have to really look into how to go ahead and you know leave that Hardware you know afterwards it is used right and the second important thing is even at the from the software perspective let us say you are having we are using Windows 2000 19 datacenter for now and tomorrow you say we have we want to have Windows 2020 datacenter no it shows delete this VM take a backup and create a new VM with Windows 2020 right and over here now once you have invested up front on the license cost you do not have any option there isn't any option really to upgrade directly right so when you talk about as your when you talk about cloud it is a rental model it is like you know asking yourself that should I buy a car or should I go to Ola and uber right so as your cloud is a rental model it is pay-as-you-go right now with all this knowledge let us go and try to now look at that question right so with this understanding of capex and OPEX let us now look go ahead and look at this question so mark that the below statements are true and false pay-as-you-go pay-as-you-go is an example of capex false why the time you have used the word pay-as-you-go the capex what is completely opposite to it right it as your VM BM means virtual machine as your virtual machine instances are example of OPEX true so you can create a VM use it for three full days and delete it creating your own data center means your own hosting Center is an example of capex true so when you say you want you are going to go and create your own data center you are responsible for Hardware you are responsible for procuring the licenses you are responsible for looking at all that infrastructure and also you are responsible for effects right so false true and true now I would like to make a very important note out is it 900 course this course is more targeted towards certification so if you want to really go and learn us you're more practically like creating a virtual machine filling these values and then connecting the virtual machine by using the RDP protocol I would suggest to go and watch my course learn as your step by step which is hosted on this channel you can see I'm flashing on the screen and in that you can go ahead and you can look at the topics these topics are more practical oriented you know more from the perspective of how to do things it has nothing to do with certification as such right but this course is focused on certification so the goals and motives of this course and that course both are different right so in case if you are wondering that okay why not why don't you go and create an as your virtual machine and show us the demo then that will make this course very big right so please go ahead and watch my practical course out there you know where I've explained the complete as your things step by step concentrated and it is more than 12 hours of course I'm sure you will enjoy it so let's start with question number 2 now this question number 2 is again related to the first chapter described cloud concept and again it is related to capex and OPEX and you know the economies of cloud right so it's related to the first topic so let us see this question so this question says that mark you know which of the below statements are true or are correct so let's look at statement number one as your provides flexibility between capex and OPEX so as I've said in the previous question I have explained capex and OPEX and I also explained that when you talk about cloud it is all about capex and OPEX right so definitely when it comes to Azure when it comes to cloud not only to us you're when it comes to any cloud it's either Amazon or it's either as you're right it's always about flexibility of finances so this statement is true let's look at the second statement if you create two Azure virtual machines that use the b-2s size that use the b-2s size each virtual machine will generate the same monthly cost first let us try to understand you know what exactly is this b-2s size of virtual machine so this word b-2s comes you know when you actually go to create a virtual machine so you can see here if I if I say that go and create a virtual machine alright on Azure in that you know one of the options which I get here is select size so you can see here there are different size of virtual machine it has different configuration for example you can see it we have a t2s series we have a b-2s series we have a b4 series so you can see lots of series out here so the question says that if I select this b-2s kind of series machine out here alright if I select this b-2s size machine will it always generate the same monthly cost right so let us try to understand what exactly b-2s size of machine means this word be in this b-2s means bustable burstable virtual machines now when you take any infrastructure on cloud right you pay for two things so when you take a virtual machine on Azure or or any cloud right you pay for two things one is you pay for so the total cost so the total cost is equal to to keep the virtual machine month running to just keep the virtual machine running right so I will say that this is the this is the baseline cost so just to just keep it running right so we will turn this as baseline right so one is that you need a baseline cost right and another one is when you start using it that is a usage cost so in other words for example now let us say you have taken a virtual machine right this is the time okay and this is the CPU performance right so to just keep it running let us say that you are using 100 percent performance so let's say you are using 100 and performance right and when you actually use it there is a spike so must be you are using 200% of the CPU right so that you will get billed for this period as well as definitely for the usage right and this is this one here the baseline is running on 100% CPU performance so you get build build the same kind of quantity evil for just keep it for keeping it running right so what the b-2s or the burstable virtual machine says that but Sebastopol virtual machine says that when when we the baseline cost will be reduced you know by running at the low CPU performance so to just keep the virtual machine running we will not run I 100% we will run at 5% and when you need it when you need it yes definitely at the time we will shoot up to 200% right and again we'll come back to five percent right so must be you know rather than running out of on a full CPU cycle we will run at a less CPU performance so this is what the b-2s virtual machines virtual machines promise right they run at a low CPU performance during your baseline period right and when the CPU is needed they run at 200% or whatever percent you want and you get build maximum only for this time and you get build very much minimum you know for the baseline period right so if you go and if you see on the on the Microsoft website you can see a introduce B series our new bustable vm size right you will see out here there is a table and this table says that if you take a standard b1 S series we will run at 10% baseline CPU performance right and maximum we will go for 100% right then you have a standard b1 S series which is like 20% and then 100% and so on right so you can see that there is a baseline cost which is given and then the maximum CPU performance is given out here now let us go ahead and let us try to attempt the question if you create two Azure virtual machines as your virtual machines that use the b-2s size each virtual machine will generate the same monthly cost right so definitely the answer is no why because must be no these two BTS sighs machines you have right but the workload can be very different for example one b-2s sized machine can be like this can be spiky right the another betwen sized machine must be just runs only for one period so definitely the cost of this and cost of this will be different you know why because azure is all pay as you go pay as you use so this this VM here will be billed more and this VM here will be billed less you know why because this VM is using less CPU right so the answer is this correct no it is false remember the top one is true right let us look at the third question when as your virtual machine is stopped you continue to pay the storage cost associated with it right this is true because if you go and if you see in the portal let me just show you so if you see here if you go to create a virtual machine out here you will see that one is yes you need to go and give you know the kind of CPU in you need and you need the RAM you need you know the type of server you need right but that is one tab out here which is the hard disk no storage and remember I am creating a virtual machine and if you look at this hard disk you know that is a premium hard disk that is a standard hard disk right and all of this will have a cost when you say that you want to use an HDD hard disk or SSD hard disk and SSD hard disk is is costly right and definitely you will be having a cost attached to it right so the answer here is when Azure virtual machine is stopped in order that this virtual machine stays on the hard disk of as your right it will need something right and that's where the storage cost comes into picture so yes we continue to pay for it right so the first one is true as your provides the flexibility between capex and OPEX yes the second one is false you know why because the b-2s machines are meant for some other purpose right it has nothing to do with the monthly cost the monthly cause depends upon how much you use it and when a virtual so this is false and when a virtual machine is stopped yes you still continue with the with the cost of your hard drive why because you must have kept some files in that you must have written some source code so for that you need to use storage and if you need to use storage then depending on your use HDD or SD d you need to pay for it so this is also true so true false and - so let's start with question number three a company is planning on creating several virtual machines in Azure so they would be using the virtual machine service so virtual machines service belongs to which category below so does it belong to e as does it belong to PRC Azure fears right now this question belongs again to the first topic out here describe cloud concept so in this topic you know they want they want you to understand the economies of scale the capex and OPEX and there is one more section you know where they want you to understand the three different type of services that is e as Pia's and CS right so let us understand this concept now when you go to Azure cloud or and say when you go to any cloud out there and when you buy any service right so let's say if you are going and if you're buying SQL Server or if you are buying Oracle or if you are creating a virtual machine or if you are doing anything out there right all of these products you know they belong to one of these categories so the first category is EOS infrastructure as a service the second category is PRS platform as a service and the final category is C as software as a service right so when you say you know you are buying anything out there on cloud you are buying from one of these categories or the product belongs to one of these categories so let us understand each one of them first is a infrastructure part infrastructure means you want to only go and buy some hardware from from Azir or from Amazon so let us say you want to go and just hire a GB RAM with 80 GB hard disk for 10 days right so that that means that you are actually buying from this category infrastructure as a service the second one is platform as a service with Azure there are lots of products which comes in built into Azure platform so for example Azure storage or must be as your fabric right and a lot of other things out there now these softwares you know you cannot run without does your framework let me repeat that sentence again this software these software's which are in pass in platform as a service or peers you cannot run without as your framework for example you cannot run Azure storage like blobs and queues inside Windows operating system or Linux operating system you need to have as your for that and they are only available on the CEO framework right so these software's are tightly coupled to the CEO framework and they are available at a very cheaper rate then comes the software as a service like for example SQL Server now SQL Server is a software which I can install in Windows I can install even the 2019 can be installed in Linux as well and also I can install it anywhere else right and also I can install on a zero right so so that means that this is a software which has been used for a long time locally and now that it is available through the azure platform in a rental model so rather than buying the whole SQL Server license in one go now you can use the monthly or the rental model so software the SQL Server must be Excel Word PowerPoint and why not you know even your application like inventory counting can also come into software-as-a-service so the question here this question here is is trying to make you understand or trying to check you know that do you know where the virtual machine lies in so does the virtual machine lie India's PRC as our fears right now Sophia's means function as a service right so there is something called as a function as a service so function as a service means you only want you don't host a whole web application you want to host up just a simple function right follow I'll just leave this part you know let us focus on this I can just tell you that that is not answer for that right so must be for now you can just remove your eyes from this so now if you talk about a virtual machine right that means it is only the hardware part so if you go and see in Osseo really so when I go and I create a virtual machine so it can be see here I'm creating a virtual machine so what do i specify I specify the RAM I specify the CPU right I also specify the hard disk like premium standard HDD and so on right so it's mostly I specify the you know the hardware part to it the networking part and so on right but I do have a I do need at least the operating system I need the minimal operating system to access it so what happens is you know a lot of developers feel that Oh like isn't we are using a we are even buying a software out there you are buying a software but it is not really a software it is the OS without the OS you can use the hardware through the internet isn't it so don't let yourself confuse that when you actually buy a virtual machine out there and because you buy an operating system software like Windows Server and Red Hat or anything right that means that it becomes a platform as a service or a software as a service right virtual machines are purely infrastructure right so the answer here is where does the agile virtual machine service belongs to it belongs to yes infrastructure as a service so right answer is a so let's take question number four again this question number four belongs to the ESP as and CEA's topic so your company plans to migrate all the data and resources to us you're the company migration planned states that only pass should be used platform as a service platform as a service means services which are tightly coupled with Azure right those should be only used right remember in the previous question we discussed about ia's we discuss about PRS and we discussed about CS right so that you should use only this this you know why because if you use infrastructure then you have to do everything yourself right so we don't want to do everything ourselves so first is the solution they are proposed as for web application will create an azure app service so whatever is your web application code and your compile code you want to host it we use as your app service and the second one is as your virtual machine that have Microsoft SQL Server installed ok let's start with the first solution as your app service so as your app service is a pass so when you say that you want to go and host web applications on Azure we have something called as an app service so you have to go and you have to create this app service right and once you create this app service you can go and you can host a dotnet coding this you can host must be a Python of PHP so depending on what kind of technology you select you know this will this will function accordingly right so this is a platform as a service it will help you to very easily migrate your code you just go and say that for example if your code is in dotnet code you can just say dotnet core out here it will go and it will actually go and create a workspace for you where you can go and host your dotnet code right so this is platform as-a-service because this feature you cannot really run without us your this is tightly coupled with us your it makes your life easy right I would really suggest to go and watch my videos on learn step by step as your you know where I've explained all of these things practically so here I'm trying to cover from the certification point of view but in those lessons I have covered things more practically I would really suggest to go and watch those practical lessons and then look at these questions and with answers which I am discussing out here so first thing is this as your app service is a platform as a service and it means this demand now look at the second option as your virtual machine that have Microsoft SQL Server installed now here what it means is that you will actually go and you will create an azure VM inside this VM you will install SQL Server this has nothing to do with Azure you can do it even offline and this is more of a infrastructure as a service because the time you say that you are going to go and create a VM that means you are doing things yourself right for example when I say create an app service what the app service does is he does not he will go and he beef figure out you know which VM one of there are a lot of shared VMs out there in one of those shared VMs he will create a workspace for you so he does not really tell you that now you have to create a VM and then install I is right so it takes it takes up a lot of your work right and that's what is pass but here when you say virtual machine that means this is infrastructure as a service so does this solution meet your goal no it does not meet your goal for this if I want to meet my goal if I want to make it as a pass service I should be using Azure SQL so I should use does your app service and Azure SQL Azure SQL if you see is again a platform as a service so you can go and you can say your SQL server so you can see this is the SQL Server here which is nothing but as your SQL and if you look at Azure SQL it is quite different in the sense that it's the same SQL server at the backend but you know the way it is built for example if you look at your SQL Server which you buy from offline or which you buy as a DVD or must be as a separate software you have to pay it in one go but in this case you know when you say that you want to go ahead and use Azure SQL that is something called as DTU and by using the GG you he will calculate depending on how much SQL you have used that many that much charge will mean he will he will allocate to you so you can see that there is a elastic pool and so on so if you use an azure SQL database it will go and it will figure out one of those VMs out there which is a shared via he will go and he will create SQL Server in it he will create the database instance for you and you can go ahead and you can connect and you can install it so creating on virtual machine is out of question right so remember Azure SQL is different different in the sense there is a you know this Azure SQL which is there out here helps you to it will use the same SQL Server the classic is conserver what you have but then it does lot of like elastic pool DTU PS you go I would suggest to see my SQL Server videos where I've explained how to create an azure SQL database how to do DTU and so on right so azure SQL is passed SQL Server P or installation of SQL Server the time you say I want to install it skill server that means you are doing infrastructure you are actually doing things yourself right so for this answer to be yes this Azure virtual machine with SQL Server needs to change to Azure SQL Server as your SQL then this answer is yes but for now the answer is no because virtual machine is infrastructure-as-a-service now this is again a different flavor of the question which were discussing out here so it's the same question your company plans to migrate all its data and resources to Azure and you have to use one we pass but you can see here he has given a right solution it says that you want to create an azure app service and azure SQL database right so in this case the answer would be yes so please note that please see the solution properly read the solution properly understand the concept don't just buy it and go I have seen people you know they just look at the first question and they just say yes or no that's not the way to look at it right so please read the question check you know that this is a pass or not this is a yes or not and then according the answer so the same question which I just discussed right this question is a kind of an opposite to it with a proper solution so the previous question had a had a wrong solution so that's why the answer was no but this is a proper solution as your app service is a pass and azure SQL Server database is a pass a pure SQL server debase which which we install offline is more of a ia's it's more of a software I will say rather right so the answer is yes this is a right solution so let's start with question number five you plan to migrate a web application to us your this web application is used by external users you need to recommend a cloud deployment solution to minimize the amount of administrative effort so we need less amount of administrative effort this word is important your administrative effort so what should you include in the recommended solution so should you do see as be as ia's or database as a service at this moment we can safely exclude this because there is no database here right now remember that all of these three things out here that is er's and then on the top of it we have the platforms of azure that is PR and then we have the CRS right the more you are at the infrastructure level the more administrative effort you have right so your administrative effort increases you know if you are at the bottom layer because if you are at the infrastructure layer that means that you are responsible to install the install the firewall your configure the firewall to install the antivirus to install the software's to do everything right so definitely the administrative effort here is very high so we can exclude EOS for now now let's talk about the software as a service now when you say web application the web application itself is the software right so it's not a it means for example if you have a ready-made web application out there then install to install that is a different thing right but here we are talking about deploying our code so we don't have any ready-made code out there right so definitely here again the software as a service is not logical so what what is remaining out here is a platform as a service so in platform as a service you know we have something called as app service which I've showed in this too and also you can go and watch our tutorial of laura's EUR so by using app service what you can do is you can create an app service and then you can go and you can deploy your code into the app service and the app service will find out the right VM so there are lots of VMs out there you will find out the right VM right and deploy your code into that VM into that shad BM so we don't have to worry about anything at the background you know there are lot of VM shared VMs and when we deploy our code in the app service it will hunt the web server it will hunt the virtual machine and deploy our code in the VM so for us you know to create a virtual machine and then to figure out the web servers and then to go and deploy our code we don't have to worry anything we have to just deploy to this platform as a service given called as app service so the right answer out here is because of this word minimize the amount of administrative effort is pass platform as a service and in Azure the right platform as a service to deploy your web application is AB service so B is the right answer so let's start with question number 6 mark 2 and falls the below statements a platform as a service that hosts web apps in Azure provides full control of the OS that hosts the application right so what the question means is that when you create an app service remember app service is the service you know to host a web applications on Azure so when you create a web app service out here so you can see out here please go through the videos of learn as you are step by step where I have explained things things practically so when it when we go ahead here and we say that yes I want to host an website which is on dot net core website and app name and so on we are also allocated we are also allocated avium because at the end of the day this has to be hosted in a VM right so you can see here it is allocating us a standard s1 VM so if you go and see this there's a standard s1 VM which it is allocating to us which is having you know approximately 2 GB RAM and so on and so on right so the question here is that when we go and host this app service do we have access to this virtual machine or not that that's what the question is so the question say is out here if you look at the question a pass solution that means this app service the past solution that hosts web apps in Azure provides full control of OS right so this OS this OS which you have you know on which your dotnet core application will be running do you have access to that so the answer is no you don't have access to the you know to the VM because what happens is when you go and host your web application so you have your code out here your website code right whatever it is in c-sharp or PHP or dotnet right that website code when you go and host using the app service what the app service does is the app service goes and looks into shared VM so there are lots of helium's out there huge fabric of VMs so you have like must be VM one VM to VM 3 lots of VM which are running right so he will go and he will find you know appropriate VM and in this VM he will go and he will host your web application so this VM you know you don't have any kind of access you cannot go to this you cannot go directly to this VM by using the terminal services you can't do that you can't access the Start program files or the desktop of it this is only purely for hosting your app service so this is the e as infrastructure as a service and this one is a PS so ad when you say that you are using a pass solution that means that you don't want to deal with infrastructure you don't want to deal with raw operating system you don't want to do things yourself right so whenever you are using a pass solution the passed solution will ensure that he will manage the infrastructure internally inside it and you only have access to the pass UI to the pass framework right so this statement out here is false you don't have any access to the operating system so this is a false solution let's look at the second statement a platform as a solution that hosts web apps in Azure provides the ability to scale the platform automatically scale the scale the platform automatically means if I have let's say I have one VM you know which is running my application and for some reason if I need two VMs let's say the load increases will it go and automatically increase from one VM to to VM so let's go and see so if you go here to this to this plan so remember that if we had this app service what we create it creates right and we are associated with a plan this plan here we can see here at this moment I am using this ASP rs9 5-cc to plan this plan out here says you know that what kind of machine you have so if you see here for example look at this I am selecting the s1 series which is a 2 GB RAM and if you see down below look at the included features for s1 series it says auto scale up to 10 instances Auto scale up to 10 instances so that means that if if needed you know he can auto scale up to 10 instances right if I go and select a more stronger instance you know for example s1 is a less stronger instance but let us say if I take this 4 GB RAM look at this we have this P 1 V 2 series out here if I take this 4 GB RAM out here you can see now the auto scale has become 20 instances so yes you know these you know app services out here have the ability to automatically Auto scale you know depending on the load right so the answer to this question to this sentence out here is that yes it is true and that's what is expected and that's what is expected from a pass solution right so this is true a platform as a service solution that hosts web apps in Azure provides professional development services to continuously add features to custom application to continuously add features to construct an application yes if you see nowadays you know people are talking about CI CD continuous integration continuous development so the question the this statement out here says that any pass solution out there like for example the app service right specifically when you are saying pass solution for hosting web apps in Azure is app service you know it provides professional development services to continuously add features to the custom application absolutely we have something called as the azure DevOps I would suggest to please go and watch the practical video where I have shown how to go and continuously build continuously cold continuously check in continuously integrate and go live on those your app service so I would suggest to go and watch this video right so we have something called as the continuous integration and continuous development in us your which is termed as the azure DevOps so this as your DevOps what it does is you can go ahead you can check in your code right then this code what is checked in it can get built automatically right once it builds automatically even you can run your test case your unit test cases can be run then afterwards you can go and you can put this into production right when you go and put this into production actually it actually at this moment it uses the app service so the app service you know can be plugged in into the azure devops pipeline very easily right so I would suggest to go and watch this video where have explained how does your devops pipeline works so the answer to this second thing the the last three the third thing out here is that it is true that we have lots of development services given in Azure which helps you to continuously add new features to the custom application automatically from the backend so it does not have to be a manual process right so false true and true so let's start with question number seven when you are implementing software as a service solution you are responsible for configuring high availability let us read this sentence again when you are implementing SAS solution you are responsible for configuring high availability first thing this statement is false why because whenever we go ahead and we take a SAS solution we are 1ly responsible to use the software we are responsible to use the software must be we are responsible to configure the software data so for example let us say if you go to us you are out here so you can see here I'm at the market place market places where I can buy a lot of things right and in in market place normally it is a SAS solution so for example I want to take an Hospital management system or people call it as EMR right so there are lots of EMR out there for example I can take this open EMR out here now this open EMR out here you know helps me to go and do you know the billing it helps me to do labs and lot of things right so what I have to do I have to go and create it and then I have to go and load probably the doctor master I have to load you know probably the pricing list but I am not responsible here to configure that the scalability of this that has to be done by the provider that has to be done by the provider at this moment you can see the provider here is someone called a service so he should do it right so first thing this first sentence out here is false that as a SAS solution I am only responsible to configure it now let us look at the question so the question says review the above underlined text and if it makes the statement correct select no change is needed if the statement is incorrect so yes the statement above is incorrect select the choice that makes the statement right so it makes the statement correct so first thing no change is needed so this one here I will not select this right this cross indicates no selection so if the statement is incorrect select the answer choice that makes the statement correct define scalability rules again no high availability or scalability you know those kind of things we don't define in SAS SAS is mostly you know is where you know the person just goes ahead creates your application and starts using it right so now this is again false installing the SAS solution no like we go and we create the SAS solution and automatically it is installed into one of those VMs so over here I will go and I will say create it but I will not go and define your where is the VM which operating system it is that is not my headache right so again installing the SAS solution is I will not select right configuring the SAS solution yes it's my responsibility to configure the master tables it's my responsibility to configure the parameters the configuration as per my the business rules and so on right so this is the only thing which I need to do but the other all things you know are it is not connected with SAS assets right so D is the correct answer so that brings us to the end of this session if you are interested to take the rest of the three hours of course you can send us a mail at Qwest point at Qwest Montcalm or you can also go through the link provided in the description for more details right so I hope that you enjoyed this video keep learning stay safe happy learning
