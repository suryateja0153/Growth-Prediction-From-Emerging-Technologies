 Hello! My name is Amy Sturkey. I am a pediatric physical therapist. I am here with my co-instructor, Myla and we are working on standing balance. One of the ways you can work on standing balance is move from two hands held to one hand held, which it looks like she is ready for. Then just be wary of the lower you support a child...so if you are holding their hands up pretty high, you are giving them lots of support and the lower you give them support...come back here...the lower you hold them, meaning lower relative to their body, the less support you are giving them. So as I get lower in my support, she is more likely to want to sit down. I hear you. So whether that is two hands held or one hand held, the lower you hold, the less support you are giving her. So there you go. Nice! So just be conscious of where you are relative to them when you are giving them support to determine how much support you are giving them. It is a simple idea for you to work on at home. Thanks! Bye!
