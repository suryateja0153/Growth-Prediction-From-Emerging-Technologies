 I'm really excited about this session Liz yeah because what are we talking about we're talking about artificial intelligence it's pretty amazing stuff right and there's a ton of buzzwords around it I think we've talked about it a lot with some of our other products like database performance analyzer and it's a big part of making a service desk really easy to use for users who maybe aren't familiar with it instead of like training them all the time about a very specific like if you have if you have a form that you fill in and you have to have a rainin manual on how to fill in that form something is not right exactly there's a little bit of a problem there and you're spot on with artificial intelligence we're altima trying to guide our users in the right direction so they know where to look instead of constantly scratching their heads so it's pretty amazing what it brings to the Service Desk side of the world so is it mostly for gathering user input is it for recommending self-service or where does it typically appear honestly all of the above so we're trying to collect information so that you're not constantly having that back and forth of did you try this is your computer even on but it's also making sure they're going to the right resources so you told me you needed this here's an example of exactly what you're looking for and also it should adapt over time exactly all right so why don't we walk through just a really simple example user input yeah right kind of going back to that don't hit them up with 50 million fields what that looks like in terms of starting with a basic request that's kind of broad you're not sure what it is and then figuring out exactly what that request really is yeah definitely let's take a look so as an employee when I come to the service portal there's a handful of options that I could go and take a look at but the most jarring here is gonna be that search bar and if you think about Google it's a perfect example I can go and search for exactly what I'm looking for so we tried to mirror the exact same logic here and it's natural language instead of expecting them to speak IT yeah totally so when I come in and I am just a lowly little requester I don't speak IT but I use zoom all the time for our web conferencing meetings and as of late I've been having a lot of problems with connecting my camera on my meetings which doesn't necessarily bode well when you're trying to do face-to-face over the web and then oh that's actually true in the last couple weeks what we've been on accurate so when I come in here and I type in like zoom meeting for an example but I don't even have to go so far as to type in the full phrase it's already prompting me with suggestions but let's say I don't find exactly what it is I'm looking for so I'm just gonna glaze over all my suggestions and head straight into submitting a help ticket so when I get here it's still capturing what I originally entered making my life a little bit easier so my meeting camera won't work and the search box popped up again while you sure did and we're going to talk a little bit more about what that search bar actually brings to my experience but specifically taking a look at how your employees can categorize or classify the problems they're having so down below I'm going through and I see a bunch of categories which admittedly is overwhelming where do i click so here are smart suggestions otherwise known as artificial intelligence but again as a requester I wouldn't know that's AI because it says smart suggestions so here I recognize that zoom is an application that I actually use to take it one step further the subcategories are gonna do the exact same thing so now I know I'm actually doing the right thing up front making me feel like a I should get a gold star but be knowing my ticket is gonna go into the right hands so the main reason for doing this then I guess is it the the big advantage of using a service desk like really incorporating a lot of different options and workflows and automation is that automation is way way easier to actually have narrowed it down to context and specifics before you kick it into automation to avoid it kicking back to a human who has to sign exactly and there could be outliers too so the more that you give them even if it's a condensed version of that the better it's gonna vote for your technicians and at the end of the day I'm gonna get my issue resolved so much faster I'm gonna actually hold a question until later but I'm just because I guess I'm gonna have to take your word for it at this point because what I saw was a search box that popped up and I guess - right so - actually no three so there was the initial search then the context-aware search as you were working on the details of the ticket and then categorization sub categorization you're saying that AI was actually involved in recommending all of those so apologize okay well I'm gonna I'm gonna hold you to that and when we get to the end of the session I'm gonna make you show me that so that we can see it changing or they should talk about how you would know definitely sounds good so to round out this ticket for Amelia employee the final two questions have popped up so this is our final layer of how they're going through and classifying this issue now that I've put in all the information as it pertains to my zoom problems I'm able to submit this help ticket and now my technician is well-equipped with everything they need to diagnose my problem well it also on that last screen what that last box was did you reboot mm-hmm I'm you've got a pretty good chance of not having to ask the very first question exactly so now that we've looked at how artificial intelligence can influence how employees are behaving in terms of ticket submission and all the data that can be collected not to mention categorization big win there with the Service Catalog there's also so much value that can be driven because of how powerful it can be you're collecting infinitely more data up front but pairing that with an automated process making your technicians lives easier and ultimately your employees happier because they're getting the services they need in an efficient manner but it's not just for IT it can also be utilized by all of your internal service providers we have clients who have utilized the Service Catalog in some pretty unique ways for an example there's one team that uses it for office check-ins so when a guest comes through they have their tablet situated and they have a service catalog running for that check in but it doesn't stop there you could use it for Human Resources for employee onboarding or even facilities changing light bulbs the list is limitless okay that is absolutely true and I love that so you're going to spend some time you're going to build service items that map to the business actually reflect the way your organization works that's going to be provide a lot of automation and save a lot of time and get quicker time to users being happy it's going to raise your CSAT but the trick is if the forms are simple if the entry point is simple how do you get them to the right form that feels like something where artificial intelligence can really be a help exactly especially knowing if you have so many internal service providers who are leverage that's a lot of catalog items to have to dig through and I ain't got time for that and that's exactly where the artificial intelligence is going to come into play so let's take a look at how it's going to help nudge me there cool as an employee when I come back to the portal again I see that search bar so I could start here so I recently got married and I had to go through a slew of paperwork to change my name it was a headache but they would automate it maybe we have an idea there so going back to changing my name if I were to go through and put in change name I'm now being prompted with the available service but also a knowledgebase article in this example though I know for a fact that I do need to follow certain procedures in order to get my name changed once I reach this screen I'll find every required field that I need to enter in order for my Human Resources team to best facilitate my name change because that's defined in that form exactly and once the employee goes through and fills out all the required contents here then Human Resources can take care of it in a pretty quick fashion making me happy and with my new name okay so go back a second to that search for the name change form there's another one here which is actually about updating the beneficiary forms for a life insurance is that coming up here because somebody took the time to say well these things are kind of related or is artificial intelligence helping guide that because other people tend to use those use those close together yeah that's a great question so it's actually populating as a result of how we've used the system so rather than programming the artificial intelligence because that's not the nature behind it it's truly showing this based on adoption so because in the past people have looked for changing their name there might have been a technician that actually suggested here's a great article for you to rely on to make that appropriate change okay and so by we you don't mean we the service desk you mean we the organization that's operating it so these are going to adapt over time to the specific operation of that organization you hit the nail on the head it really is machine learning so it's like muscle memory it's learning the different actions you're taking over time to start making the appropriate changes based on what your employees are putting into the system that is a great example for HR and I think a lot of our customers actually start with HR s or that first adjacent department that they really start adding Service Catalog items for so show us another example maybe for a different part yeah definitely let's bring it back to IT so when I come here there's oftentimes the same request for password reset I am the number one culprit for this my IT team can attest to that so I type in password from here I'm prompted with my available password reset services I know exactly where I need to go so we'll click on the first one here and what's great about this form once I get there is it only asks me one question what's the application that you're having a problem with for this example we'll check zoom and from there I'll go ahead and request my password reset for this application once I've made that request I'm assured into my request and I can see that this one is pending work it's brand-new but what's really cool with this process is we've taken it one step further to automate what the employee can do so we're really bringing that employee empowerment into focus by using tasks and approvals the workflow actually puts the work back in my hands so now I need to go through and read the how to document on resetting my password I'm not waiting for a technician to take care of this I'm able to do it on my own which makes me feel really good well I love the way it sort of flips that helpfulness from instead you get an email where somebody cuts and paste a link in and it feels almost like you're being punished by the IT departments like you should have known and stoled it and instead it just presents it for you much faster because in the end it's you fixing it yourself you are always going to be happier okay let's we've talked about using artificial intelligence to make sure that you have what you need when you fill out a form in the first place you showed us how it is helping guide employees to the right forms in the first place but how can you really do the magic which is prevent a ticket in the first place like get them the information they need and guide them to resources without and prevent workflows potentially redirecting a ticket or anything else yeah I'm really glad you brought that up Patrick so that's really where we're driving with artificial intelligence case deflection why put in a ticket when there's a resource that you could actually digest to do the troubleshooting on your own and again your technicians will thank you so with that there's different ways that you could help work on the content so that it really is employee focus so they could follow a step-by-step but again be nudged by artificial intelligence so let's take a look at that here for an example we use dialpad to make many of our outbound calls so let's say that I'm having problems in terms of my contacts within Gmail connecting with this which is critical for me to make these outbound calls rather than getting it set up like it's being suggested as a service I actually could go and reflect on this article about how I can get my contacts to synchronize with dialpad so that I can keep doing my job here as an employee I can go through and read the contents look at the gifts get all the help that I need so that I can make sure that the connection is established and go on with my day so it's pretty easy to create these I mean the thing that I love here is you've got an animated gif so instead of having that thing where you have 16 different screenshots and hoping that they can follow along you're actually showing them what it looks like if it is and I think that's what so many of our clients have turned to rather than relying on photo step by step we're using the rich text that you're you can bring into these knowledgebase articles and putting gif is in nothing is easier than following along with a 10-second clip and I can look at it on one monitor and reproduce the exact same steps on my other screen and again I'm able to resolve the issue myself without ever having to put in a ticket so you're using a lot of CSAT to figure out where the people really like processes not to tune them do you find that they like workflows that are part of a Service Catalog item or or do they tend to like being able to do it themselves like almost they've it's a discovery place where they get smarter that's a tough one to answer because they think that all teams benefit from both and using customer satisfaction we can definitely get down to which is panning out better for our teams we have something so simple as a thumbs up thumb down so I can actually have better in to the articles that users are reading on their own but on the back end I can actually qualify the number of times a knowledgebase article has been attached to a ticket helping me better understand is our content actually being used exactly and that's that thing you only have a limited amount of time NIT so you're either building automation building workflows or you're building this case KB articles so you're basically what's happening you're saying is that the artificial intelligence is guiding people to resources they need then you're watching the use of those resources over time and that helps you decide where to invest it's like maybe they like KB's more I'm going to spend my time proactively building help files it will help them or maybe it's more complicated and you want to actually create a workflow mm-hmm I think for me the big takeaway here is that this is not Skynet right this is observing behavior and getting better over time yeah exactly and originally when artificial intelligence came out it was kind of scary no it's not Big Brother but we are helping take the different actions that your team is using within the Service Desk to empower the employee which is what we all want at the end of the day make our lives a little easier so we can work smarter not harder we covered a lot in this session has been a great crash course how do we end this good question let's go to the source say thanks and smile thanks and smile
