 nanoelectronics refer to the use of nanotechnology in electronic components the term covers a diverse set of devices and materials with the common characteristic that they are so small that inter atomic interactions and quantum mechanical properties need to be studied extensively some of these candidates include hybrid molecular semiconductor electronics one-dimensional nanotubes nano wires eg silicon nanowires or carbon nanotubes or advanced molecular electronics recent silicon C Mo's technology generations such as the 22 nanometer node are already within this regime nano electronics are sometimes considered as disruptive technology because present candidates are significantly different from traditional transistors topic fundamental concepts in 1965 Gordon Moore observed that silicon transistors were undergoing a continual process of scaling downward and observation which was later codified as Moore's law since his observation transistor minimum feature sizes have decreased from 10 micrometers to the 28 to 22 nanometers range in 2011 the field of nano electronics aims to enable the continued realization of this law by using new methods and materials to build electronic devices with feature sizes on the nano scale topic mechanical issues the volume of an object decreases as the third power of its linear dimensions but the surface area only decreases as its second power this somewhat subtle and unavoidable principle has huge ramifications for example the power of a drill or any other machine is proportional to the volume while the friction of the drills bearings and gears is proportional to their surface area for a normal sized drill the power of the device is enough to handle e overcome any friction however scaling its length down by a factor of 1,000 for example decreases its power by 10,003 a factor of a billion while reducing the friction by only ten thousand and to a factor of only a million proportionally it has 1,000 times less power per unit friction than the original drill if the original friction to power ratio was say 1% that implies the smaller drill will have 10 times as much friction as power the drill is useless for this reason while super miniature electronic integrated circuits are fully functional the same technology cannot be used to make working mechanical devices beyond the scales where frictional forces start to exceed the available power so even though you may see micro photographs of delicately etched silicon gears such devices are currently little more than curiosities with limited real-world applications for example in moving mirrors and shutters surface tension increases in much the same way thus magnifying the tendency for very small objects to stick together this could possibly make any kind of micro factory impractical even if robotic arms and hands could be scaled down anything they pick up will tend to be impossible to put down the above being said molecular evolution has resulted in working cilia flagella muscle fibers and rotary motors in aqueous environments all on the nano scale these machines exploit the increased frictional forces found at the micro or nano scale unlike a paddle or a propeller which depends on normal frictional forces the frictional force is perpendicular to the surface to achieve propulsion sylia developed motion from the exaggerated drag or laminar forces frictional force is parallel to the surface present at micro and nano dimensions to build meaningful machines at the nano scale the relevant forces need to be considered we are faced with the development and design of intrinsically pertinent machines rather than the simple reproductions of macroscopic ones all scaling issues therefore need to be assessed thoroughly when evaluating nanotechnology for practical applications topic approaches to nano electronics topic nano fabrication for example electron transistors which involve transistor operation based on a single electron nano electromechanical systems also fall under this category nano fabrication can be used to construct ultra dense parallel arrays of nano wires as an alternative to synthesizing nano wires individually of particular prominence in this field silicon nanowires are being increasingly studied towards diverse applications in nano electronics energy conversion and storage such sinners can be fabricated by thermal oxidation in large quantities to yield nano wires with controllable thickness topic nanomaterials electronics besides being small and allowing more transistors to be packed into a single chip the uniform and symmetrical structure of nano wires and or nanotubes allows a higher electron mobility faster electron movement in the material a higher dielectric constant faster frequency and a symmetrical electron hole characteristic also nanoparticles can be used as quantum dots topic molecular electronics single molecule devices are another possibility these schemes would make heavy use of molecular self-assembly designing the device components to construct a larger structure or even a complete system on their own this can be very useful for reconfigurable computing and may even completely replace present fpga technology molecular electronics is a new technology which is still in its infancy but also brings hope for truly atomic scale electronic systems in the future one of the more promising applications of molecular electronics was proposed by the IBM researcher arya veeram and the theoretical chemist mark Ratner in their 1974 and 1988 papers molecules for memory logic and amplification see uni molecular rectifier this is one of many possible ways in which a molecular level diode transistor might be synthesized by organic chemistry a model system was proposed with a spiro carbon structure giving a molecular diode about half a nanometer across which could be connected by polythene molecular wires theoretical calculations showed the design to be sound in principle and there is still hope that such a system can be made to work topic other approaches nan-oh Yannick studies the transport of ions rather than electrons in nanoscale systems nanophotonics studies the behavior of light on the nano scale and has the goal of developing devices that take advantage of this behavior topic nano electronic devices current high technology production processes are based on traditional top-down strategies when nanotechnology has already been introduced silently the critical length scale of integrated circuits is already at the nano scale 50 nano meters and below regarding the gate length of transistors in CPUs or DRAM devices topic computers nanoelectronics holds the promise of making computer processors more powerful than it possible with conventional semiconductor fabrication techniques a number of approaches are currently being researched including new forms of nano lithography as well as the use of nano materials such as nano wires or small molecules in place of traditional Simos components field effect transistors have been made using both semiconducting carbon nanotubes and with hetero structured semiconductor nano wires Sina's in 1999 the C Mo's transistor developed at the laboratory for electronics and information technology in Grenoble France tested the limits of the principles of the MOSFET transistor with a diameter of 18 nanometers approximately 70 atoms placed side by side this was almost one-tenth the size of the smallest industrial transistor in 2003 130 nanometers in 2003 90 nanometers in 2004 65 nanometers in 2005 and 45 nanometers in 2007 it enabled the theoretical integration of 7 billion junctions on a 1 euro coin however the C Mo's transistor which was created in 1999 was not a simple research experiment to study how C Mo's technology functions but rather a demonstration of how this technology functions now that we ourselves are getting ever closer to working on a molecular scale today it would be impossible to master the coordinated assembly of a large number of these transistors on a circuit and it would also be impossible to create this on an industrial level topic memory storage electronic memory designs in the past have largely relied on the formation of transistors however research into crossbar switch based electronics have offered an alternative using reconfigurable interconnections between vertical and horizontal wiring arrays to create ultra high density memories to leaders in this area in Antero which has developed a carbon nanotube based crossbar memory called nano RAM and Hewlett Packard which has proposed the use of memristor material as a future replacement of flash memory an example of such novel devices is based on spintronics the dependence of the resistance of a material due to the spin of the electrons on an external field is called magnet or assistance this effect can be significantly amplified GMR giant magneto resistance for nano sized objects for example when two ferromagnetic layers are separated by a non-magnetic layer which is several nanometers thick eg Cosi Yuko the GMR effect has led to a strong increase in the data storage density of hard disks and made the gigabyte range possible the so called tunneling magnet or assistance TMR is very similar to GMR and based on the spin dependent tunneling of electrons through adjacent ferromagnetic layers both GMR and TMR effects can be used to create a non-volatile main memory for computers such as the so called magnetic random access memory or MRAM topic novel opto electronic devices in the modern communication technology traditional analog electrical devices are increasingly replaced by optical or opto electronic devices due to their enormous bandwidth and capacity respectively two promising examples are photonic crystals and quantum dots photonic crystals are materials with a periodic variation in the refractive index with a lattice constant that is half the wavelength of the light used they offer a selectable bandgap for the propagation of a certain wavelength thus they resemble a semiconductor but for light or photons instead of electrons quantum dots are nano scale objects which can be used among many other things for the construction of lasers the advantage of a quantum dot laser over the traditional semiconductor laser is that their emitted wavelength depends on the diameter of the dot quantum dot laser cheaper and offer a higher beam quality than conventional laser diodes topic displays the production of displays with low energy consumption might be accomplished using carbon nanotubes CNT and/or silicon nanowires such nano structures are electrically conductive and due to their small diameter of several nanometers they can be used as field emitters with extremely high efficiency for field emission displays fed the principle of operation resembles that of the cathode ray tube but on a much smaller length scale topic quantum computers entirely new approaches for computing exploit the laws of quantum mechanics for novel quantum computers which enable the use of fast quantum algorithms the quantum computer has quantum bit memory space termed qubit for several computations at the same time this facility may improve the performance of the older systems topic radios nano radios have been developed structured around carbon nanotubes topic energy production research is ongoing to use nano wise and other nanostructured materials with the hope to create cheaper and more efficient solar cells than are possible with conventional planar silicon solar cells it is believed that the invention of more efficient solar energy would have a great effect on satisfying global energy needs there is also research into energy production for devices that would operate in vivo called bio nano generators a bio nano generator is a nanoscale electrochemical device like a fuel cell or galvanic cell but drawing power from blood glucose in a living body much the same as how the body generates energy from food to achieve the effect an enzyme is used that is capable of stripping glucose of its electrons freeing them for use in electrical devices the average person's body could theoretically generate 100 watts of electricity about 2,000 food calories per day using a bio nano generator however this estimate is only true if all food was converted to electricity and the human body needs some energy consistently so possible power generated is likely much lower the electricity generated by such a device could power devices embedded in the body such as pacemakers or sugar fed nano robots much of the research done on bio nano generators is still experimental with Panasonic's nanotechnology research laboratory among those at the forefront topic medical diagnostics there is great interest in constructing nano electronic devices that could detect the concentrations of biomolecules in real time for use as medical diagnostics thus falling into the category of nano medicine a parallel line of research seeks to create nano electronic devices which could interact with single cells for use in basic biological research these devices are called nano sensors such miniaturization on nano electronics towards in vivo proteomics sensing should enable new approaches for health monitoring surveillance and defense technology
