 today I'm gonna be talking to you about my project which is suppressing delamination through vertically aligned carbon nanotubes so through the course of this presentation I'm going to really give you a bit of background what VACNTs or vertically aligned carbon nanotubes are and look at my two main areas of my research which is fracture toughness enhancement and ply-drop strength enhancement using VACNTs then I'm going to give some quick conclusions that I found and then areas where I want to lead in future work so the most common failure mode and composites nowadays with delamination where cracks form and propagate in the resin rich region between plies now my project aims to inhibit this through interleaving vertically aligned carbon nanotubes at the interface between the plies now these nanotubes can be grown on a substrate and the synthesis conditions can be tailored in order to control the densities and the lengths of the nanotubes you can then take the nanotubes and then place them directly in their raw form on the prepreg or embed them into a resin film and then apply them as another stage during the manufacturing process now to understand the benefits of this system mode 1 and mode 2 tests were conducted to work out the fracture toughness it was found that as the crack propagated into the interleaf approximately a 15 to 20 percent improvement in mode 1 fracture toughness and approximately 10 to 50 percent in mode 2 was achievable now when I looked under the SEM of why this was the case I found that the crack was going from the inter-laminate where the nanotubes are to an intra lamina or through the ply and this meant that the enhancements that I was seeing was caused by extra fiber bridging and basically some more torturous crack path we should also see is that the nanotubes map the topology or the actual terrain of the tubes themselves which indicates there is a kind of a stiffening or strengthening effect at the inter laminar region now another application where inter-laminar reinforcement is useful is in tapered specimens where when subjected to a tensile load inter-laminate stresses rise and that leads to delamination so what I did is I took a tapered specimen which was found to fail repeatedly through delamination and a particular ply drop which is that ply drop there and I interleaved it with two different configurations of nanotubes one had a length of 11 microns and the other had a length of 40 microns I then pulled these under tension and you high-speed camera footage to understand where failure occurred and by what mode did it fail by and this is what I found so basically 11 micron make no difference related to the baseline whatsoever but the 40 micron configuration gave approximately an eight to ten percent improvement in strength now to understand why that happened I had a quick look at the footage from a high-speed camera and I found that both the baseline and 11 micron failed basically in the same way where you've inter-laminar shear stresses as you'll see which will growth it will cause the ply to then slip back and then all the crack will propagate through the thick section and you'll lose complete structural integrity now with the 40 microns something slightly different happens so again same ply drop but the inter-laminate shear stresses cause a crack to grow it's very subtle as you'll see it but the ply does slip and it actually causes waviness it suppresses the crack and it stops it failing completely now this survived for approximately half a second to a second which doesn't sound a lot but for static cases like a 45 50 kilonewtons worth of load that is a huge advantage so in summary I've shown interleaved vertically aligned carbon nanotubes cause intralaminar or this through ply failure and that's both under mode 1 and mode 2 conditions now this did increase the fracture toughness and that was because you've got more torturous crack path I've also shown that the cracks map the topology of the nanotubes which indicates there's some means of a stiffening or strengthening effect I've shown that  if you put local patches of the VACNTs into the tapered specimen you can increase the strength of that but it is dependent on nanotube length I've also shown that nanotubes suppress delamination and I should really indicate for all of these it didn't change significantly the strength or the master tool of the laminate there's a very subtle change I'm doing So where I want to take this into the future I want to change the characteristics of the nanotubes or the lengths and identities and understand how that influences the fracture mechanisms and therefore the fracture toughness these are delamination dominated scenarios so I want to try and use cohesive element modeling in order to predict homogeneously what may be occurring and where failure is likely to occur for complex structures and then finally look at other applications where you see delamination dominated it so we're talking maybe open hole tension if I interleave every single interface can I improve the strength of the laminate so I'd like to thank Rolls Royce for their support over the course of this project I'd like to invite you any questions you have now or please come and find me at my poster but thank you very much for listening you
