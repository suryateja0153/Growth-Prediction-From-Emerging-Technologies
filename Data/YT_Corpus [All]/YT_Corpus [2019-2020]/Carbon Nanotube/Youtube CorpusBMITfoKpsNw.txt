 an electrostatic motor or capacitor motor is a type of electric motor based on the attraction and repulsion of electric charge an alternative type of electrostatic motor is the spacecraft electrostatic ion drive thruster where forces and motion are created by electrostatically accelerating ions topic overview an electrostatic motor is based on the attraction and repulsion of electric charge usually electrostatic motors are the Joule of conventional coil based motors they typically require a high voltage power supply although very small motors employ lower voltages conventional electric motors instead employ magnetic attraction and repulsion and require high current at low voltages in the 1740s and 1750s the first electrostatic motors were developed by Andrew Gordon and by Benjamin Franklin today the electrostatic motor finds frequent use in micro mechanical MEMS systems where their drive voltages are below 100 volts and we're moving charge plates are far easier to fabricate than coils and iron cores also the molecular machinery which runs living cells is often based on linear and rotary electrostatic motors topic nanotubes nano motor in 2004 researchers at university of california berkeley developed rotational bearings based upon multi-walled carbon nanotubes by attaching a gold plate with dimensions of the order of 100 nanometers to the outer shell of a suspended multi-walled carbon nanotubes like nested carbon cylinders they are able to electrostatically rotate the outer shell relative to the inner core these bearings are very robust devices have been oscillated thousands of times with no indication of where these nano electromechanical systems NEMS represent a promising direction in miniaturization and may find their way into commercial applications in the future topic electrostatic ion drive see also electrostatic ion thrusters electric motors in general produce motion when powered by electric currents the common type of spacecraft ion drive uses electrostatic forces to accelerate ions to generate forces to create motion and thus can be considered as unconventional electric motors gridded electrostatic ion thrusters commonly utilize xenon gas this gas has no charge and is ionized by bombarding it with energetic electrons these electrons can be provided from a hot cathode filament and accelerated in the electrical field of the cathode fall to the anode kaufman type ion thruster alternatively the electrons can be accelerated by the oscillating electric field induced by an alternating magnetic field of a coil which results in a self-sustaining discharge and omits any cathode radiofrequency ion thruster topic patents the prime classifications of electrostatic motors by the USPTO class 310 electrical generator Oh our motor structure 300 Nandi YN amo elec TR IC 308 charge accumulating 309 electrostatic u.s. patent six hundred and thirty three thousand eight hundred and twenty nine J galagos static electric machine US patents seven hundred and thirty five thousand six hundred and twenty one a Thomson electrostatic motor u.s. patent nine hundred and ninety-three thousand five hundred and sixty one Harold B Smith apparatus for transforming elect energy into mechanical energy US Patent 1 million 690 3806 w gk d electromechanical system US Patent 1 million nine hundred and seventy four thousand four hundred and eighty three tt Brown electrostatic motor the 25th of September 1934 US Patent three million four hundred and thirty three thousand nine hundred and eighty-one feebly electrostatic motor edie electrostatics from atmospheric electricity US Patent three million four hundred and thirty six thousand six hundred and thirty b-billy electrostatic motor US Patent five million five hundred and fifty two thousand six hundred and fifty four Mitsubishi CEM Corp electrostatic actuator US Patent five million nine hundred and sixty five thousand nine hundred and sixty eight Robert at Al electrostatic motor topic see also electrostatic generator Oxford electric Bell molecular motors nano motor topic external articles and further reading de carros Antonio Carlos M an electrostatic linear motor the 24th of January 2002 William J BT simple electrostatic motor electrostatic motor TM dotnet fast and flexible electrostatic motors at Univ Tokyo 1 heavy lifting electrostatic motors at Univ Tokyo 2 e savagely cat al MEMS electrostatic micro motors 3
