 so we're going to talk a little bit about bohr and then we're going to talk about ionization energy which is a theme that's going to come back a couple more times very important and then we're going quantum we're going quantum and that's why this is a very exciting day uh for me and i i'm hoping it will be for you too it's why i have t-shirts it's also a goody bag day there's just all sorts of things happening today so i'm very excited this is how we ended our lecture on wednesday okay i was showing you this as part of my why this matters which started with refrigerators and then we talked about a chemistry problem cfcs and we talked about how those were destroying the ozone layer of this planet now why is that important and i had this picture up there to help explain it this is just to to make sure we all see what this is you know i'm showing it here again this is the energy watts per meter squared that we get from the sun right and and you can measure that up on top of the atmosphere so there's no atmosphere there and this is what it looks like right that's the energy as a function of the wavelength or frequency or energy of the photon you now know how to go back and forth between those but see on the planet here once you once you have the atmosphere you get a different spectrum and the reason is and it's shown here that some of the molecules in the atmosphere are absorbing parts of that spectrum so what we see on the planet is different right and we talk about this in terms of why this matters and and how ozone you know so you say well i said i mentioned oh if you could only if we could only see out here right the visible is here that's the visible okay there's the frequencies of the visible but what if it were here the planet would be totally dark because no light would get through the absorption that happens from those molecules on the other hand over here we've got ozone that's protecting us it is absorbing light in the higher frequency in the higher frequency which means lower wavelength that's the uv and that's why that was such an important problem is to not destroy those precious ozone molecules okay so i want to make sure that we and we understood this in terms of energy transitions because how do these things absorb light well they do just what we said which is they take the energy from a kind of light and and an electron then takes that energy absorbs it to be excited and it goes from one energy level to another right we did that in terms of the board levels so i want to do that and that is what you have right here right you have a way to see that visible spectrum so we'll talk about that as well oh we'll talk about it right now because i have a slide on it so you have what is known as a spectroscope or the most powerful way to see light ever designed and and if you look through this okay don't look at the uv please don't look at the sun with this please don't do that but we gave you light sources to look at like that right or you could look at that or you could look at like things around you with it and what are you seeing you're seeing this you're seeing the spectrum in the visible you're seeing it in this part okay but from this you are also what you are seeing are literally electron transitions you are literally and that's what i want you to think about that's why i wanted you to have this power this power which means responsibility as we know but now you can not only see light you can see electron transitions i want you to think about that as you're seeing light and and i want you to think about it in terms of what we learned on wednesday which is bore right and so let's let's just put that here okay so we had bohr and in the bohr model we said the energy is going to be quantized minus 13.6 electron volts times the atomic number squared divided by n squared right and so like for hydrogen for example this is equal to uh minus 13.6 ev right because z is one over n squared so that was our for hydrogen z equals one all right and so that that's one and that's it but n is equal to one two three etc it's quantized right this was this was the whole uh kind of discussion and theme of wednesday's lecture and and and that got us to these levels these bore levels which are places where energetic places energies of the electron right so we'd have these levels that kept on going until you're at somehow right so if this is energy right and and this would be like n equals one n equals two these are the energies right right there i'm just plugging in and this would be like n equals infinity so the energy here would be zero and for the hydrogen atom the energy here would be minus 13.6 electron volts right if that's hydrogen so this is now i'm leaving this here i want to use this that's why i'm putting it back up okay because look now you can use this to start understanding light and so you use this and you look at light sources and you can start thinking about things in terms of energy transitions so let's take a look so what if i uh just look at some light sources right okay so that's what you see that's like the sun right so that's daylight and now we're getting into the the mode of seeing light like this right it's in intensity salute versus uh wavelength right and there you go you go and now if you look at sort of an incandescent light bulb all right it'll look something like this so it's it's warm there's a little more red right you can't get up to the sun's temperature but you get pretty hot so you see this nice kind of looking spectrum and oh here's a halogen all right that looks kind of closer maybe look at what happens when we go fluorescent ah look at that why does fluorescent light give us headaches well that might be other reasons but but look at this spectrum that doesn't look like that that's why we all have so much trouble with floor and here's leds and you can buy your cool white leds and your warm white leds but look they're still not they're not that right there's been a lot of work on this can we get this to be that right and and so so now we are armed with with great power and so you can look at things you see oh i see that it has uh this large peak because i'm looking at a fluorescent light within and i see that it's got this stronger peak in the blue maybe i could just absorb a little of that what if i came up with a coating right that i could put on that cool led bulb to make it just a little bit more look like that well now we know how to we might be able to use bore to do this right because because what if i say okay the the wavelength of that is around 450. so if the wavelength is 450 nanometers then i know you know remember we did this waves right light waves we can go back and forth between uh frequency below how's it going all right welcome to class um and uh and energy energy equals h c over lambda oh plank thank you and this is roughly 2.75 electron volts for that wavelength 2.75 electron volts right okay well but see now but i want to absorb some of those photons i'll pose a problem what if i have an atom so question right so i have an atom an atom that has an n equal 4 to n equal 5 transition that absorbs so i'm i'm telling you now this energy so i'm telling you now i've got some atom and i know there's a transition in it it has an electron transition because remember we're going from electron transitions to light energy back and forth back but this right here i'm just saying look okay n equal just keep going n equals three n equals four n equals five so what i just asked you is i said well look some atom has a transition between n equals four and equals five that means that if an electron happens to be here it can absorb energy to promote it up to here of exactly 2.75 ev well i can use bore i can use bore now right because so i can actually answer this problem answer this question if i know that then i can say well okay if the initial state is four and the final state is five right i've gone from four to five i've promoted an electron up in energy lifting it up like a ball against gravity all right then if then i can use boar to say that 2.75 ev is equal to minus 13.6 z squared times 1 over 5 squared minus 1 over 4 squared that would be the transition energy this dictated by bohr and oh i have everything except z which i can solve for z equals three z equals three all right so so i've now all i need to do is come up with a way to coat all the cool leds with lithium right because this is lithium and we'll be fine except there's a problem and this is part of the problem that we need to address and solve today before the weekend and that is that see bohr only works war only works for one electron now it's okay z can be higher z is three and it works here but i've assumed only one electron which means this really would be like li-2 plus okay we're going to come back to that but bohr only for one electron right so so if i'm going to get something like like z is three that's fine but it can only have one electron there can only have one electron there or the model doesn't work it was one electron with some z of protons right so this could be li-2 plus that sounds harder to put into a film okay we will be coming back to this that is a serious limitation of the bohr model and we can't do a lot if we can only do one electron right you do a lot of ions but that's it okay so i just said the word ion what happens now if you take an electron not from one level up in energy but up up up up up all the way until it's free what happens if you do that well that is called ionization that's ionization and in fact when you look out into the beautiful world the universe remember i said on wednesday 75 of this is hydrogen a whole lot of it is ionized it's getting ionized from energy that's that's knocking electrons out and then electrons are coming back and cascading through these levels emitting discrete frequencies of light and this is what you see it's beautiful right what you're looking at is ionized hydrogen getting electrons coming in and cascading through the bore levels right ah but what does ionized hydrogen mean right okay we can now understand it we can now understand it because now instead of going from like four to five i'm going from anything to infinity it's like escape velocity right it's like how much velocity do i need to give something so it just gets away from the earth and it's not going to feel the earth's gravitational pull well here i don't want this electron to feel the potential of the atom anymore the z the positive charge i want it to just be free that's here that's infinity that's n equals infinity right so if if i think about this that that's actually quite easy to put into bohr ionization energy so to save time we'll write ie right and this is equal to the energy required oh i'm going to save time here look at that requida to remove the electron from the atom okay good and and if we think about this in terms of bore it would be like minus 13.6 let's say for hydrogen because i've got hydrogen up there so for hydrogen meaning z equals 1 it'd be minus 13.6 times 1 squared that's the z squared right times 1 over nf squared minus 1 over n i squared that's that delta e which equals minus 13.6 times 1 over infinity minus 1 over n i squared right now the last i checked with my colleagues in the math department that's zero that's zero right so the ionization energy you literally can just read off here if an electron is in the ground state if there's a happy electron right here in this orbital the amount of energy i need to input into that atom to knock the electron fully out the ionization energy is 13.6 electron volts right it's just the energy of that orbital i could get a little fancier i could say well okay what about this question what if i had light with a hundred nanometers so now i'm telling you my source right before i didn't tell you something goes into it and knocks it all out no now i know what's going in the the uh the wavelength or the energy of the photons is a hundred nanometers and i'm shining that on hydrogen well now okay let's see here so let's stop oh i'm asking a question what's the question what is the lowest energy level that the electron could be in such that a photon from this light source ionizes the atom okay let's see because i now i now know the pieces and i know the definition right so now if i have the energy of a hundred nanometer photon well that i'm not going to go through it is equal to 12.4 ev but see if i now want to use this to ionize hydrogen then i get something like this i get that delta e equals minus 13.6 okay times uh one over infinity squared okay fine we'll keep that for a sec minus one over n i squared right this is how much this is how much uh uh delta i need to ionize from any given place any given energy level and i right okay but but i have 12. so what if i set this equal to 12 right if i set this equal to 12.4 that's what i have then what i get is n i equals 1.05 okay good that's my answer no panic everybody should be panicking no that can't be my answer i can't i can't have something that's not an integer because i said it over there that n is a quantum number one two three nothing is allowed in between so what you can see is that i got so close i almost had enough energy to get n to b1 but i don't so i cannot use this light to ionize an electron in n equals one i can't but i could use it to ionize an electron in n equals two right because there if n is two well then i've got actually plenty of energy right so cannot ionize from n i equals one but n i equals two is okay right so that's the outcome of this now i could also use that same 12.4 ev photon to ionize from n equals three or four or any of these but i can't get to one and there's one other concept that's important because look i gave it 12.4 ev what did i actually need well i mean you can even see it here you can just you know what these levels are from the bohr model here this is 13.6 this is minus 3.4 okay that's telling me this is definitely not drawn to scale but still you you get the point 3.4 and and i just said well i could probably get it out of 3.4 and i can because i've got 12.4 and so if i did this so if n i equals two then i would have excess energy excess energy would be nine electron volts and that is kinetic right so i've shot this thing out of the atom with light that's got way more energy than i needed to ionize it but that energy didn't it's still in the electron i transferred that photon energy to the electron energy and so that is going to be in the kinetic energy of the electron that's now free the electron free i should have said free electron right excess kinetic energy comes after ionizing it right so these things are the things we can do with bohr so i wanted to kind of you know take what we learned wednesday and apply it to a few problems and go back and forth with with this idea of photon energy uh to bore level changes and that's what i want you to do in this week's goodie bag as well okay now ionization is an important concept like i said we'll be coming back to it um and you can you can actually uh plot and many people have measured and and this is very important the ionization energy of elements like as a function of atomic number and the first ionization energy is important right the first ionization energy is the energy required to remove the outermost electron right right so if i did have a whole bunch of of electrons so if i had a whole bunch of electrons the first ionization the first ionization energy is the energy required to remove the outermost one so that's an important number to know if you want to take an electron off of an atom and we will be doing that because that's how we're going to make our first bond next week if you want to take an electron off an atom this is one of the first things you ask how much energy does it take right how much energy does it take so that's an important concept that we'll be coming back to now okay i alluded to the fact that we needed a new theory i already alluded to that and i said that's where we're going today the bohr model works for one electron as i said all right that means it's good for hydrogen oh we just ionized hydrogen that was a lot of fun and it's good for like he plus or li2 plus or osmium 75 plus yeah that's real but what about two electrons what about two just two forget about ten twenty thirty two the bohr model can't do it it doesn't it it doesn't work for anything more than one electron it was derived for one electron and that's where it stays so we're at this point now this is a picture i started to draw this week on monday and we're at a point where we need something deeper and some of the work that went into this was really critical and i'm not going to go into too much detail but there's one thing i want you to know so remember you know plank and einstein they were playing with quantization of light and einstein's photoelectric effect found the particle nature of light with planks you know with together their energy right equals h nu that quantized energy of the photon and they they saw it's a particle but it also is is a is a wave right there's a lot of discussion and and interest and and attempts to understand what it was was it a wave or a particle and compton did some beautiful experiments to show again evidence that it was a particle because he he saw how light interacted with electrons and it was like this collision that particles do and then de broglie or as where's jerome de bruyne i don't know would say he went further de broglie went further he said everything is both light you guys don't know if light is a particle or wave well i'm saying everything is a wave everything and everything has this duality so he wrote something very important which is the relationship between anything's momentum and it's wavelength so we'll come back to this so i want to write it down so de brush he said that the wavelength of anything can be written as oh that same quantization number constant from planck divided by its momentum literally just its momentum anything has a wave nature anything and light has a particle nature what's going on and it led einstein to say at the time he said quote it seems as though we must use sometimes the one theory and sometimes the other while at times we may use either we are faced with a new kind of difficulty we have two contradictory pictures of reality separately neither of them fully explains the phenomena of light but together they do this was the beginning of quantum mechanics this is where they were and and later once they once they really got the quantum mechanics kind of going he said this the more success the quantum mechanics has the sillier it looks why well there's only one way uh to really learn about quantum especially if it's the first time and that's from dr quantum himself and so i do have a video of dr quanum and i'm hoping you will enjoy this with me i enjoy it every time i see it most friday nights um so let's watch dr quantum explain because there was one really important experiment that happened that he's going to explain right now called the double slit experiment and it changed everything and i don't care if you see it in another class we're seeing it here because this sets up what happens next in chemistry let's watch dr quantum we are the granddaddy of all quantum weirdness the infamous double slit experiment to understand this experiment we first need to see how particles or little balls of matter act if we randomly shoot a small object say a marble at the screen we see a pattern on the back wall where they went through the slit and hit now if we add a second slit we would expect to see a second band duplicated to the right now let's look at waves the waves hit the slit and radiate out striking the back wall with the most intensity directly in line with the slit the line of brightness on the back screen shows that intensity this is similar to the line the marbles make but when we add the second slit something different happens if the top of one wave meets the bottom of another wave they cancel each other out so now there is an interference pattern on the back wall places where the two tops meet are the highest intensity the bright lines and where they cancel there is nothing so when we throw things that is matter through two slits we get this two bands of hits and with waves we get an interference pattern of many bands good so far now let's go quantum my favorite line i love that line an electron is a tiny tiny bit of matter like a tiny marble let's fire a stream through one slit it behaves just like the marble a single band so if we shoot these tiny bits through two slits we should get like the marbles two bands what an interference pattern we fired electrons tiny bits of matter through but we get a pattern like waves not like little marbles how how could pieces of matter create an interference pattern like a wave it doesn't make sense but physicists are clever they thought maybe those little balls are bouncing off each other and creating that pattern so they decide to shoot electrons through one at a time there is no way they can interfere with each other but after an hour of this the same interference pattern is seen to emerge the conclusion is inescapable the single electron leaves as a particle becomes a wave of potentials goes through both slits and interferes with itself to hit the wall like a particle but mathematically it's even stranger it goes through both slits and it goes through neither and it goes through just one and it goes through just the other all of these possibilities are in superposition with each other but physicists were completely baffled by this so they decided to peek and see which slit it actually goes through they put a measuring device by one slip to see which one it went through and let it fly but the quantum world is far more mysterious than they could have imagined when they observed the electron went back to behaving like a little marble it produced a pattern of two bands not an interference pattern of many the very act of measuring or observing which slit it went through meant it only went through one not both the electron decided to act differently though it was aware it was being watched and it was here that physicists stepped forever into the strange never world of quantum events what is matter marbles or waves and waves of what and what does an observer have to do with any of this the observer collapsed the wave function [Music] simply by observing you you can see why i show this uh we do movie night at home a lot it's friday night guys like seriously um you know that uh you know you might have like a little free time you get together with some friends there's no better way but look let me you know this is why i hope that's as mind-blowing to you as it is to me it was mind-blowing to them at the time um this led border famously say anyone who is not shocked by quantum theory has not understood it and and here's the thing there's uh you know there are some things in life where you can ask questions and and you can understand them you can answer them i can ask the question why do or somebody might say why do i wear a a t-shirt under a sport coat that's weird stylistically i mean stylistically that's and i say well okay here's the answer because i put you know comfort over stylistic norms whatever that's an answer i could ask a harder question i could ask a harder question why did justin and celina break up because jelena was totally hashtag couple goals just saying okay anyway now i'm just why oh but still that's a harder question why because they were so good but there's probably an answer to that too that's a harder question this was mind-blowing how can something be both how can something that they know is a part of how can everything be both this was really difficult to answer and in fact the real answer came with a mathematical solution which we'll learn next but not quite understanding we still don't really understand quantum mechanics even after 100 years we don't um and and so so this is just i think a beautiful part of our story of our detective story and just to show like people are still working on this right how much quantum can we see how much quantum can we see well look here's some here's somebody who about 15 years ago and it's published in this paper i'm a little more almost 20 now they actually took forget about electrons those are teeny tiny things this is a whole group of of 60 carbon atoms that's called a fullerene and they shot this through they did the double slit experiment with this and they showed that with the grating right without you get the single p just like we saw and with you get diffract you get interference you get interference so they were able to show all the way up to a large molecule 60 carbon atoms that these things are still they have wavelength they have these these incredibly strange properties that you just saw in the double slit experiment all everything has this duality this this duality between uh waves and particles now um okay we said we needed a new model right bohr can only do one electron and meanwhile there's all this stuff going on at the time you know showing that that there you need a new theory how do we explain waves and to kind of put a little bit more of of the nail in the coffin for for bore you had um you had heisenberg so i'll just write this on the board before i go to my why this matters um and what heisenberg said is that you cannot measure both position and momentum exactly you can't get them both okay and that that that's called the heisenberg uncertainty principle but that was it because look you look at that so he he's saying this and said but in board you've got them both you've got them both exactly remember we i put energy down there but we also put r on wednesday exactly because then type you can't get them both and if you can't get them both that's another problem with bohr because bohr says you can get them exactly right so we had these pointers double sid experiment heisenberg's theories right saying we need something more we need something more and i'll i'll get to that um i want to do my why this matters and then i'll get to the more that came which will then expand on on monday um before i do that let's do wise matters so why why are why is the fact that an electron is a wave why is that so important first of all because it sets up you know this this detective story of the electron set up this new theory that's coming quantum mechanics right um but also it immediately just like just like we started painting with them right remember that was one of my widest matters we also realized that we could see with them we could see with electrons because you know if electrons are waves then i can shine them just like i shine light and see what it shows me right it can illuminate matter so you know if you look at the frequency here of light right this is this is a electromagnetic spectrum radio right microwave infrared visible uv now here's the thing if you want to see something some feature size you're limited by the wavelength of the light it can't be bigger than the features you're looking at roughly ish okay that's what you're so if you're trying to see something tiny but the wavelength of light is really big you won't see it so we need if we want let's say we want to see atoms let's say we want to see atoms or or or even more nuclei look at how tight those are 10 to the minus 10 centimeters 12 meters those are x-rays or gamma rays but the problem is if we shine x-rays on things and we will do that when we look at crystals but if we shine x-rays it's very hard to then collect them and make a photographic image okay right i mean at least one that gets you that resolution and gamma rays are even harder to catch right oh but see here's the thing electrons electrons give you exactly what you need because you know if we do this math for an electron let's bring this one back down if we do this math for an electron well i'm going to use ah i thought i had the middle one so if i have an electron let's suppose i have an electron that is electron i'm going to say i accelerate it over 100 volts i'm going to take an electron i'm going to put it over 100 volts i'm going to give it some kinetic energy right so its kinetic energy is then going to equal 100 ev right okay so now i've got an electron moving with a kinetic energy that's 100 ev now you can convert this to joules and you can set this equal to one-half mv squared right mass of the electron times its velocity squared and then once you have the velocity so you get the v and then once you have that you get the momentum the p right and then once you have that you get the wavelength right so i can go now from like something that's easy to do 100 volts is a lot but in a lab safe not in your dorm you could apply 100 volts to an electron get it going at this speed and once you know the speed you know the momentum and if you know mv then you know it's wavelength and that in that case from this relationship you would get that it's about 0.12 nanometers but look at this the wavelength of a simply accelerated electron is right where i need it it's right where i need it it's an angstrom right so now i think if i take advantage of the wavelengths of the wave nature of electrons and i shine them on materials then i can see materials that way and i can see them at that scale and we do that all the time all the time in in many many different areas of technology and of research today we use electrons to image in fact the best images you can get are made with electrons right here's an example of using scanning what's called a scanning electron microscope right so you see a butterfly but you want to really see a butterfly or we can go even further and instead of just drawing pictures of this these beautiful materials made of carbon those are called nanotubes these are called this is called graphene because in tight it's a single sheet of carbon atoms one atom thick material notice with these materials every single atom is a surface atom that's pretty cool they also have lots of other cool properties and i'll give you examples throughout you know in other other lectures of how these kinds of materials can be used but for now i'm talking about seeing them and this is what happens when you actually look at them with an electron that's a nanotube and here is a picture of graphene the only reason we can see graphene is because we have electrons and we take advantage of the wave nature of those electrons we say well okay but why does that matter well that matters tremendously because one of the first experiments that really did what feynman what richard feynman wanted richard feynman predicted the the field of nanotechnology 50 years ago he gave a famous speech at caltech it's called there's plenty of room at the bottom he's also an amazing teacher and he taught actually the double slit experiment i highly recommend you googling that lecture and he said that you know someday you can put the atom where you want right and the first time that was done was in 1989 by ibm they had 35 xenon atoms they moved them around the point is you couldn't realize nanotechnology you couldn't realize the ability to actually move atoms if you can't see them right and so this you know the ability to see what you were doing changed everything it changed everything and you know nature had been doing this and i love these examples so you know nature has been doing nanotech for a long time right uh so you have uh the inner ear of the frog it's a cantilever that uh sensitive to a few nanometers of movement the frog can actually hear that you've got features in the ant's eye i love the the silk moth the male silk moth has a single molecule detection system on board that can sense a single molecule pheromone it can detect a female silk moth two miles away two miles away we have nothing like that we have no technologies like that i can't even tell if someone's in the next room i have to look at my phone or something this is because of nanotechnology that kind of detection system right but it was the ability to see atoms and molecules with electrons that that kind of blew open this entire field right and it's made it so that we can now try at least to rival nature here's one example you're not just seeing graphene but check this out you're seeing a single atom of graphene and you're seeing what happens under a certain kind of ra irradiation and you're seeing this hole and you're seeing the whole grow and that's really important because something i care a lot about our membranes right and another why this matters i'll tell you about membranes but here you know i'm actually making the thinnest possible membrane that that you could make because it's only one atom thick and i'm controlling how i make that but i would never know what my controls do if i couldn't see it in real time right so this is this is my my why this matters it's seeing things at this scale okay so back to so there's heisenberg right so at every moment the electron is only inaccurate position and inaccurate velocity this was again saying bohr you got to think harder um and we had all of this these experiments showing the the the particle wave duality of nature and of of atoms um and so the question then became all these pointers from all these different places the question became how do we describe these this wave nature of matter how do we describe an electron as a wave and i like this because not only do i think if schrodinger had a swimming pool this is what he would do with it but also i thought maybe this would be cool for like an mit kind of swim test thing um in the future because you can see what happens um this just i i want to do this experiment um but this looks really fun they're making waves they're they're literally making waves right um but and so the question now look at that see but the question is how do you describe it well there are wave equations there are wave equations that we know about that relate the position of a wave to its time change and velocity right and and the thing is this is it this is how we need to describe an electron now think about it for a second an electron by the way it just occurred to me that you should take this on that same date because if they don't have real candles and they only have these you should have this handy because you might need to pull it out and see what kind of led they gave you what does it look like anyway okay that was a side point bohr says electrons can only be in certain places well that's mind-blowing because but by the way think about that an electron can only be here here oh by the way it can transition between them but it can never be between them did anyone catch that what's up with that it can't be between them i am telling you that but it can transition where did it go oh okay that's a weekend kind of thinking exercise and now we're saying they're not even they're not even like in one place they're waves they're like the water that's cra that that really was at the time they thought how is this possible right but schrodinger came along and he said i'm gonna write down the equation anyway and and that's that was the the the big contribution the the really critical contribution that schroedinger did is he said i'm gonna i'm gonna write down kind of like a newton's equation like an f equals ma but for for quantum mechanics and for waves like electrons and i'm going to describe them so he developed the equation that we solved that on monday we'll solve to describe the wave nature of quantum mechanics and and just to to end so on on monday we'll pick up with schrodinger's equation for the atom you know the question is what does this all mean for chemistry what does this mean we're not i'm not teaching you quantum i'm not teaching you quantum just so you know quantum in isolation i'm telling you about it because it completely revolutionized chemistry and and that is where we will answer that question on monday have a really good weekend you
