  Narrator: THE AGE-OLD SCIENTIFIC MYTH THAT SPIDER SILK IS STRONGER THAN STEEL, IS COMING DOWN TO THE WIRE. IN THEIR INITIAL SMALL-SCALE TEST, 500 STRANDS OF SPIDER SILK PROVED TO BE TWICE AS STRONG AS ITS STEEL EQUIVALENT. AND NOW THE MYTHBUSTERS ARE READY TO TAKE THIS TEST TO AN UNPRECEDENTED SCALE. THERE WE GO. TO TEST THE STRENGTH OF A 28-GAUGE STEEL WIRE TO ITS MATCHING EQUIVALENT IN DENSITY, A WHOPPING 25,000 STRANDS OF SPIDER SILK, COLLECTED FROM 42 SPIDERS OVER THE COURSE OF FIVE WEEKS. THIS IS QUITE POSSIBLY THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF SPIDER SILK THAT'S EVER BEEN BROUGHT TO BEAR ON A TEST LIKE THE ONE WE'RE ABOUT TO DO, TO COMPARE THIS TO THE STRENGTH OF STEEL OF THE SAME MASS. WHY GO TO THIS LENGTH? IT'S A GREAT QUESTION. THE FACT IS, THAT WHEN YOU'RE TESTING STUFF IN SCALE, AS LONG AS YOU ITERATE AND YOU COME TO SOME GOOD CONCLUSIONS, BUT, THE BEST WAY TO GET GREAT RESULTS IS TO EXPERIMENT IN THE LARGEST SCALE YOU CAN, HENCE THIS MONSTER. Narrator: AND FOR THIS FINAL SILK VERSUS STEEL SMACK DOWN, THE TEAM HAS ADAPTED THE TEST RIG WITH A CLEVER ADDITION. WITH OUR NEW RIG HERE, WE'LL BE CONDUCTING TWO DIFFERENT EXPERIMENTS. THE FIRST WITH OUR LENGTH OF STEEL TWINE HERE. WITH OUR WATER BEING RELEASED IN A CONTROLLED MANNER DOWN TO THIS BOTTOM TANK HERE AND IT WILL WEIGH DOWN THAT CABLE UNTIL, HOPEFULLY, IT'LL SEVERE IT AND WE'LL BE ABLE TO SEE HOW MUCH WEIGHT, IN WATER, IS CAUSING THAT THING TO SNAP. IF THE THE RESULTS OF THE PREVIOUS TEST HOLD TRUE, I'M PRETTY SURE THAT SPIDER SILK IS GONNA KICK STEEL'S BUTT. CUE THE BUTT-KICKING ATTEMPT. THE 28-GAUGE WIRE'S UP FIRST. STEEL WIRE TEST, IN THREE, TWO ONE. THEY'VE TRADED OUT WASHERS AND PAPER CLIPS FOR OVER 40 POUNDS OF WATER. IT'S SO AMAZING! SO QUIET. GRAVITY DOES ITS JOB. AND AS THE WATER TRICKLES INTO THE LOWER BUCKET, THE STEEL WIRE STARTS TO SUFFER FROM SOME SERIOUS WATER WEIGHT GAIN. IT'S STRETCHING. OOH, WOW! LOOK AT THAT. IT'S REALLY MOVING. IT'S STRETCHING. IT'S VISIBLY MOVING. THAT IS CRAZY. -I HEARD A NOISE. -OOH, OOH. [ CLATTER, WATER SLOSHES ] -COOL! -THAT WAS FANTASTIC!    Adam: THAT COULDN'T BE A BETTER RESULT. ALL RIGHT. LET'S WEIGH THIS PUPPY. TWELVE POINT FIVE POUNDS, CANNAN. THAT'S A RESULT! LET'S SET UP FOR SPIDER SILK. DEFINITELY. Narrator: TWENTY-FIVE THOUSAND STRANDS TO BE EXACT. THERE WE GO. IT'S A NICE YELLOW COLOR. I'M GONNA LET IT TAKE ON THE WEIGHT. [ VOCALIZES ] THIS IS THE MOST AMOUNT OF SPIDER SILK THAT'S BEEN TESTED IN THIS KIND OF TEST, MAYBE EVER? NINE AND A HALF MILES OF SILK, RIGHT THERE. THAT'S CRAZY. NINE AND A HALF MILES! THAT'S INSANE! Cannan: YOU GUYS READY? -TOTALLY. -YEP. TWENTY-FIVE THOUSAND STRANDS OF SPIDER SILK, IN THREE, TWO, ONE. Allie: RELEASING THE WATER. Adam: OOH! Narrator: QUART BY QUART... IT'S NOW STRETCHED ABOUT A FULL INCH. ...THE 25,000 STRANDS OF SILK BEARS THE LOAD. OKAY. WE'VE PASSED THE WEIGHT OF THE STEEL. WHOA! Narrator: THE SILK HAS SURPASSED THE STEEL'S HOLDING POWER. Adam: [ EXHALES SHARPLY ] WE'RE COMING UP ON DOUBLE. Narrator: BUT THE STRAIN OF THE WEIGHT IS TAKING ITS TOLL. [ SPROING! ] [ ADAM GASPS ] THAT WAS THE -- IT POPPED. Allie: THE SIDES SNAPPED. WHOA! [ ELIJAH LAUGHS ] [ CLATTERS ] WAH! THAT'S A RESULT! Allie: OH, MAN, THAT WAS COOL! THAT WAS FANTASTIC.    ALL RIGHT. OUR STEEL WIRE HELD 12.5 POUNDS, THIS IS THE AMOUNT OF WATER, IT'S EQUIVALENT IN MASS IN SPIDER SILK, HELD, AND IT IS... Narrator: CUE THE DRUMROLL. [ DRUMROLL ] TWENTY-SIX. TWENTY-SIX POUNDS! THAT IS SO COOL! AREN'T YOU EXCITED? YEP. EXCITED. HERE, GIVE ME A HIGH FIVE. WE ARE SO PSYCHED. [ LAUGHS ] CAN'T YOU TELL? Narrator: JUST AS IT DID IN THE PREVIOUS DENSITY EQUIVALENCY TEST, THE SPIDER SILK PROVED TO BE A LITTLE MORE THAN TWICE AS STRONG AS STEEL. TWO HEAD-TO-HEAD DENSITY TESTS, TWO ALMOST IDENTICAL RESULTS. A SATISFYING CONCLUSION TO THIS CLASSIC SCIENTIFIC MYTH. THIS IS DEFINITELY ONE OF MY FAVORITE STORIES THIS SEASON. NO FIRE, NO BOMB BASS, JUST 9.5 MILES OF SPIDER SILK AND A SET OF REALLY ELEGANT METHODOLOGIES FOR TESTING ITS STRENGTH. AND, YOU CAN PICTURE, IN YOUR HEAD, WHAT A FINE STEEL WIRE FEELS LIKE, LIKE JEWELER'S WIRE, YOU CAN FEEL THAT. OKAY. NOW I WANT YOU TO HOLD THAT IN YOUR HEAD AND WATCH THIS. THIS IS, THIS IS SO GOSSAMER IT IS BARELY EVEN THERE. AND THE IDEA THAT IT HELD TWICE AS MUCH WEIGHT AS THE STEEL WIRE? MIND BLOWING. ALL RIGHT, MYTHBUSTERS, IT'S TIME TO CALL THIS ONE. FROM A MASS PERSPECTIVE, IN A TENSILE-STRENGTH TEST, IS IT TRUE THAT SPIDER SILK IS STRONGER THAN STEEL? HOW DO YOU FIND? WELL I MEAN, IT TESTED TWICE AS STRONG CONSISTENTLY. SO I WOULD SAY CONFIRMED. -CONFIRMED. -CONFIRMED. CONFIRMED IT IS. ALL RIGHT. THAN YOUR SPIDERS. Mythbusters: THANK YOU, SPIDER. NO SPIDERS WERE HARMED DURING THE FILMING OF THIS EPISODE.
