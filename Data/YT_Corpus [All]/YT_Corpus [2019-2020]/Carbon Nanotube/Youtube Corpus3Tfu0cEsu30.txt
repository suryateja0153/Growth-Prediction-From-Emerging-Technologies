 David Carroll born January 13 1963 is a u.s. physicist materials scientist and nanotechnologist fellow of the American Physical Society and director of the Center for nanotechnology and molecular materials at Wake Forest University he has contributed to the field of nanoscience and nanotechnology through his work in nano-engineered cancer therapeutics nano composite based display and lighting technologies high-efficiency nano composite photovoltaics and thermo piezo electric generators topic education caryl earned his BS 1985 in physics from NC state university raleigh NC and his PhD 1993 in physics from Wesleyan University in Middletown CT with dr. Dale during thesis adviser Carol's thesis examined the thermodynamics of charged defects in complex oxide materials as a postdoctoral associate for professor Don bonnell at the University of Pennsylvania Philadelphia Carol worked on the application of scanning probes to size and dimension related phenomena in oxides supported metal nanoclusters from there Carol became a research associate at the Max Planck Institute for metal first Chun MPI in Stuttgart Germany under the direction of Professor Manfred rule his primary research was on nano scale phenomena at metal ceramic interfaces using a combination of microscopy techniques at the MPI Caroll first began working with carbon nanotubes and their variants specifically carol was the first to identify the signature for one dimensional behavior in multi walled nanotubes the so-called van Hove singularities as well as the signatures for defect States for those systems this work helped to open the door to the use of scanning probe spectroscopy Zin understanding the electronics of low dimensional systems topic research Carol's research contributions have been in the areas of growth and assembly of novel nanostructures optics of nano structures and nanophotonics quantum functional properties of nano phase blends organic material nano composite devices and technologies including organic photovoltaics lighting systems and IR sensors biomedical nano technology including smart therapeutics hyperthermia approaches to cancer advanced responsive tissue scaffolding technology and biological technology signal transduction in 1997 Carol moved to Clemson University SC as an assistant professor where he received early promotion and tenure in the Department of Physics while at Clemson he established a program in organic devices based upon carbon nanotubes nano composites demonstrating enhanced lifetime and performance in organic light-emitting diodes Oh LED for the first time this work was among the first to establish that nanotube based nano composite systems could be used to enhance a variety of organic device performance metrics in 2003 Carol's group moved to Wake Forest University in winston-salem NC to establish the Center for nanotechnology and molecular materials with this move the research team expanded its work into biomedical nanotechnologies and continued to push the state-of-the-art in performance of organic electronics announcing the development of highly efficient lighting devices based on field activation of polymers FIP els and fabrics that generate power from body heat in recent years Carol's team at the Nano Center at Wake Forest University versity was among the first to realize morphology control in organics through the use of heating or multiple solvents setting the world record for the highest efficiency organic solar cells at the time since becoming faculty carol has published over 240 articles in scholarly journals h-index equals 40 he has published one textbook one-dimensional metals and edited two books on nano electronics he holds 44 patents with numerous patent filings Caroll as a frequent speaker at international conferences with more than 150 invited talks in the past few years since 2003 six different spin-off companies have been based on technologies from his labs equals topic personal equals professor Carroll has become a well-known speaker on the topic of Technology and human society he has appeared on numerous television and radio programs including the History Channel CNN NPR BBC and CNBC as well as in newspapers and popular magazines around the world
