 this tube is a micro motor it's cruising around this water bath grabbing up pollutants what makes this swimmer unique is that unlike many previous micro boaters this one is made without expensive precious metals micro machines that react with fuel in their environment could one day perform microscopic tasks like cleaning polluted wastewater typically these micro motors use a photocatalyst like titanium dioxide to generate fuel from their environment when light usually ultraviolet light hits them they undergo reactions with their surroundings that he meant a stream of gas bubbles researchers typically coat one side of the motor with a thin layer of gold or platinum as a catalyst so the bubbles propelled the motor in a specific direction now a team led by researchers at the University of chemistry and technology Prague has made a simple metal free micro motor that jets around under visible rather than ultraviolet light this approach could lower the costs of mass producing the micro voters the researchers say the team's motors are tiny tubes of graphic carbon nitride a nitrogen-containing variant of graphite made from inexpensive melamine visible light excites electrons in the material and these electrons react with hydrogen peroxide in the surrounding solution breaking it down into water and oxygen oxygen bubbles that form inside the tube are expelled from one end propelling the micro motor forward researchers can control the tubes motion by turning a light off and on again and the material is fluorescent unlike metal based versions making it easy to track these new micro rotors in solution the research team showed that the surface of their micro motors absorbs heavy metals like lead copper and cadmium the researchers hope fleets of the micro machines could one day clean water polluted by these heavy metals the tubes could be powered by sunlight and some peroxide added to the contaminated water nano motor developer jigna tang of the University of Hong Kong said that the easily scalable synthesis and lack of expensive noble metals makes the work a promising step toward large-scale application of micro machines [Music]
