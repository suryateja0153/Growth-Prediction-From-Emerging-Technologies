 good morning I'm thrilled to be part of the talented 12th class thank you to see any news and to the tremendous amount of work I'm sure it is taken to put on the symposium so marquita Landry I'm an assistant professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering at UC Berkeley where I started my lab three years ago and I thought I would start by introducing a little bit about myself this is what I like to do when I'm not doing or thinking about science although sometimes I do think about science while I'm hiking but hiking and the outdoors is a big part of my life I really enjoy being outdoors I really enjoy climbing things and here on the far right er a few select pictures of myself and my family hiking the W and the dojos they define a national park in Patagonia similarly climbing things in Iceland checking out my new home or near my new home Yosemite National Park and this bottom one is at the top or near the top of Mount Fuji after summiting in the dark I also really enjoy dancing salsa dancing and tango dancing in particular hobbies that I picked up and carried out through graduate school my hobbies weren't always out the outdoors I used to be more of a contact sport person in high school my sport of choice was actually wrestling whereas I was on the wrestling team for a few years my family is largely from a city called La Paz which is in Bolivia and this is a city that is 13,000 feet above sea level this is a photo of a younger me hitching a ride with a cousin near our home and of us and this is a more recent version of a recent picture of a trip that I took to visit family in the mean time and this is probably one of my favorite pictures of all because it's a picture that was taken one month after I started as a professor at UC Berkeley and it's of me hooding my very first PhD student now before students get too excited about joining a lab that turns out PhDs in one month I would like to clarify that this is my younger sister Allie she and I overlapped in the department she is a PhD student me as a professor for about one month and luckily her advisor lucky for me was out of town when the hooding ceremony took place so I was able to hood her as she graduated from our department and I know that her advisor did most of the work but I taught her how to walk so I like to think that I had some play in her success and graduate school a little bit more about my professional background so as I alluded to my family is Bolivian from this landlocked country in South America depicted here but I'm half french-canadian my dad's family is from Quebec and I grew up in Ottawa and moved to the United States and as a high school student where I completed part of my high school in North Carolina I then went on to get a degree in chemistry and a degree in physics from UNC Chapel Hill went on to do a PhD in Chemical Physics at Illinois and then switched gears when I did a postdoc at MIT to explore nanotechnology and my group today combines flavors of all of these past training experiences into the work that we do today and my group is also depicted here now my PhD was done in a field known as optical trapping this is a field that was awarded the Nobel Prize last year and essentially it leverages the fact that you can take light focus it down to a diffraction limited spot and trap dielectric particles to manipulate matter on a single molecule scale and specifically during my thesis I was looking at polymer elasticity on a Pico Newton scale as a postdoc I was really excited to take the tools that I'd learned to develop as a PhD student and apply them to a new field specifically nanotechnology for characterization of nanomaterials specifically optically active nanomaterials in a way that biophysics had done really well and when I started my lab at UC Berkeley this is what I envisioned I envisioned setting up these precise instruments these optical tools and being able to take very precise measurements in a very pristine and clean environment but my lab looks a little bit more like this and so similar to some of the career paths that we heard about earlier today a lot of my research interests have diverged less so in understanding fundamental biophysical biochemical interactions and rather leveraging those interactions to build tools to either learn more or to manipulate genetically biological systems and so I'll tell you a little bit about these two flavors of my labs research again keeping in mind that many of the focus areas of our lab really depend on understanding and being able to tune this physicochemical properties that nanomaterials can have so the first story I'll tell you is one of how we use nanomaterials to genetically manipulate plants the genetic manipulation of plants is really a key factor in many different technologies the first of which is agriculture in which the genetic manipulation of plants can confer desirable traits to crops such as pest resistance or resistance to climate change pharmaceuticals is another area in which genetic engineering of plants and plant matters is important because many drugs and natural products originate from plants and also in the bioenergy sector where biofuels and biomass can be increased through its genetic manipulation now all of these applications depend on getting the workhorses of genetic manipulation from outside plant cells into plant cells specifically DNA RNA and protein now the tools that are currently used to deliver these biomolecules into plants are two the first is agro bacterium mediated delivery so Agra bacterium leverages this natural evolution of a pathogen agra bacterium to replace the DNA of interest of our interest into the agra bacterium so that it can in turn deliver this DNA into the plant cell now because this is a naturally evolved mechanism the species of plants that can be transformed the tech with this technology are relatively limited biolistic particle delivery is the other option and here what happens is we can take gold or tungsten particles dehydrate DNA RNA or protein onto them and then quite literally shoot them into plant cells this causes the cell to incorporate the genetic material and in both cases either the use of a pathogen or the integration of exogenously netic material into the host genome triggers regulation of the plant product as a genetically modified organism or a GMO and so as you may be aware slapping this non GMO label on a bag of oranges or apples can significantly increase both the price point of the product and consumer acceptance of that crop despite the challenges in genetic engineering of plants both societal and also in terms of time and money there has been quite a bit of success in generating GM crops in the United States as a global leader in the production of GM crops shown here most of these are used either for feed or for non consumer based products but there are several crops on the market that are GM that are intended for human consumption and I think one of the examples I like to give is the generation of Golden Rice this is a varietal of rice that has had the gene for vitamin A expression engineered into it such that it glows golden and the concept here is that this varietal of rice could help deliver vitamin A to vitamin A deficient populations now despite again the success of these crops it takes a long time to genetically engineer a plant a genetically engineered plant or crop in the United States takes on average 13 years of R&D at a cost of 136 million dollars and about 40 million of these 136 million dollars are just regulatory so there's a significant time and cost consideration to be had for the creation of GM crops and this is attributed largely to inefficient tools and to the GM regulatory burden so we sought to create a tool that would be plant species independent efficient and also for GM considerations non-pathogenic and non integrating so you'd have better control over where that genetic material occurs in the plant when considering the design of such tools nanotechnology comes into mind because if we think about the size exclusion limits that we need to traverse for biomolecule delivery the plant cell membrane which is the membrane that all cells have has a size exclusion limit of about 500 nanometers so for most delivery applications in biology usually the size exclusion limit is enough so 500 nanometers being about as large as something can be before it can no longer traverse the membrane but the plants in addition to having a cell membrane also have a cell wall and what this means is that this new barrier with a size exclusion limit of as small as five nanometers presents the dominant barrier to molecular delivery so this means we have to be clever in the tools that we choose for delivery applications and this becomes a bit of a Goldilocks problem right because we want to stay as small as possible but we also want to have enough surface area for doing chemistry and for biomolecule grafting so something like a Bucky ball would be small enough but not high enough of a surface area conversely with the 2d graphene sheet a lot of surface AR you're not small enough and that one-dimensional material provides a nice in-between where the smallest dimension is still small enough but now there's a surface area on which we can do chemistry so the concept being that we can put our biomolecule of choice onto these carbon nanotubes or these high aspect ratio materials they would go through the plant cell wall and membrane and allow transcription and translation of a transgenic protein and so the workflow looks something like this we can load these materials on with DNA plasmids we can cause the expression of a green fluorescent protein which is a nice scorable marker that we can use and then we can do microscopy to assess whether or not this genetic protein or this transgenic protein has been expressed in the tissue so our results look something like this for a variety of species of plants we observe expression of this transgenic green fluorescent protein in the tissue and one of the interesting features of this platform is that if we look 10 days later at where the expression was we see that the fluorescence protein expression goes back down to baseline what this suggests is that the transgenic DNA is not being integrated into the host genome and we can validate this also with something known as a quantitative PCR to confirm on a molecular level this is in fact the case so what this is exciting or the reason that this is exciting is because we can now express a transgenic protein transiently without DNA integration what this means is that instead of making plants go glow green fur day by day three we can instead express a protein known as a nuclease or a cast nine that when complexed with a synthetic guide RNA can target regions of the plant genome for modification and if the plasmid transiently expresses these proteins we can get a permanent edit in the host genome without transgenic labeling of the plant product and so the advantages of doing so in a variety of different crop species and different tissue types would be to combine the precision of nucleus technology with the avoidance of GM GM labeling in the absence of using a pathogen and the abscess in the absence of trans gene integration as well it's the last little bit that I'll tell you about today involves a slightly different flavor which focuses on neuro chemistry now there are many different reasons that we would want to study the brain and these reasons lie in the core that neuromodulation or the transmission of chemical signals between neurons is really at the core of both health and disease in brain and behavior research now while there are many tools to study the structure of the brain or the action potentials the logic ated signals that cause the release of these neurotransmitters there are very few tools to study the actual chemical activity and this is because it would be like taking a large analytical device and trying to miniaturize it to the place where it's important to capture these events now these neuromodulators norepinephrine dopamine and serotonin again are classically the targets of many drugs for antidepressants and antipsychotics so the way we address this problem is by creating a molecular recognition that is synthetic and that is specific to the neurotransmitters of choice so we can create a library of these synthetic polymers that when adsorbed to the surface of these carbon nanotubes will perturb the surface of the carbon nanotube creating an optical or a fluorescent signal that is specific to that analyte now because this platform is generic we can do this for any polymer analyte nation but the goal here is to create a construct that optically responds in the presence of only our neurotransmitter target and so once we've determined which conjugates are which nanosensors are selective for our neurotransmitters of choice we can validate them in brain tissue and by doing so we can create these acute slices of brain tissue and better sensors into these slices and then image them so what you're seeing here is an infrared movie capturing the fluorescence of these nano sensors upon stimulation of the tissue and capturing of dopamine release in the striatum which is a very dopamine heavy part of the brain now this is important because the synthetic molecular recognition elements provided by these carbon constructs allow us to assess the effects of drugs of pharmacology the targets dopaminergic neurotransmission and we can look at dopamine agonists and antagonists and their effects on the concentrations of dopamine in the extracellular space of the brain as it's being shuttled between cells and also the residence time of these neuro chemicals in the EECS so for example if we look at drug Quinn parole which is a psychoactive drug we would see the predicted effect with bath application of Quinn Perl here we see dopamine release and reuptake in artificial cerebral spinal fluid and then after we add the drug and then we can do the same thing with soapy ride where we can see instead an increase in dopamine release in the extracellular space of the brain but one of the interesting features of this technology is because we're not averaging over hundreds of terminals because we're not using these large analytical devices to average over our signals we can ask what is each of these dopamine release hotspots doing and we can start assess or assessing what each of these hotspots is doing relative to the effects of the drug where again the predicted effect here would be for the drug to diminish dopamine release and that's exactly what we see most of the hot spots doing we're anything below this D F over F ratio of one suggests the predicted drug response but as you can see there a significant number of hot spots that actually have the opposite response and so using technologies such as these we're hoping to better understand and better assess what some of the endogenous variabilities are in how neurons respond to these dopamine receptor agonists and antagonists that are really the core of our pharmaceuticals in brain and behavior science so with that I would like to greatly thank my lab and the large series of mentors that I've had along the way specifically the work that was shown here was done by a very talented graduate student does a dimer and supported by Frankie Cunningham and Huang Zhang who are presenting at the conference here today and the support also from the USDA and the innovative genomics Institute for the work that I've shown here and I'm glad to take any questions if we have time [Applause]
