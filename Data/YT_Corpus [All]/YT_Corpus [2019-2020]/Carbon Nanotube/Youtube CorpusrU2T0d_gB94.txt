 so nm idea max is launching an experimental research program in realizing recent advances in a hardware is the castle systems that mean much better great no thank you for the introduction and for limitations us here today so as you've heard my name's max and you know be speaking about focusing really a monolithic to the integration for enabling of the next generation of barber for these future applications so let me start off with some good news and bad news I guess so the good news is that there is so much data available for future systems and applications that's this future of a smart intelligence you know a world with an applications that leverages is really realistic but the bad news is the same is that there's so much data available that consciousness today simply cannot keep up with it as such I explode the mass that was started in Adobe generate at such a fast pace that teenagers and their reason by all Tronics are not able to keep up with the growing demand with all these applications is because our products aren't just fitting one or two walls it's a perfect storm that hitting many walls all at the exact same time so as most of us probably are aware there's something called the Powerball which stems from the fact as we shrink the transistors smaller and smaller they no longer become more more energy-efficient this is the end of Moore's scaling and we're actually you know called an RN scalar then there's other memory world which stems from the fact that a processor today and spending the vast majority of his time and energy just need to get out of system so he robbed and for instance if you were to do a big but a good application you'd be spending over ninety ninety-five percent free time at just maybe data from your object processor key option memory back to processor back to memory again time and just been though I've been doing these for computation then there's a communication mode which is all the energy and time spent of taking data from assets from those being up to the cloud you reckon he didn't say never goes back down I thought Stovall's goes on and on the interconnects blow up soon as well and so on and so forth so the question is given all these walls how are we possibly going to enable these new applications so just to do an example if we dig into this memory wall for instance this some actual data ready to mount actual cost by some actual AI type machine learning application so this is genomics classification we know consecrating consent it's a key part of some deep learning for instance and here you see 95% of your femininity it's been about doing competing you just do media router system so the question is how are we going to overcome all these walls enable the next generation of hardware well on one hand what approaches to leverage these types of devices new types of transistors or memory cells and while this is extremely important where I work in this field it faces some major challenges for many of these new devices we can even build them yet and even if you could this is a very important point even if you could give me the best register or memory so in the entire world you would still only see limited benefits for applications as a device level inefficiencies themselves only account for a very small portion of the total cyst so for instance the best conditioner in the world might address the Powerball but it wouldn't address the memory wall I spoke about previously so a second separately the trying to prove computing is by creating the you competing architectures you seem like one pores or special accelerators and while this is also very important work in two phases main challenges there are only limited number design tricks we complain and play many of these party today and making systems more complex to hide inefficiencies is known as free lunch as it makes its important plots we have to deal with more design bugs for instance which are the dominant cost and time of maintenance net so what's the solution well I think it's safe to say that if we really want to enable then that's giant leap in computing that new advances and new approaches are required so in today's pop what I want to speak about is can we get to the next level or is this game over I'm going to argue it's in fact game on we can get to the next level of computing through three key approaches which is what I like to call so what exactly is a nano system when that is as soon as we start by taking these new version technologies using Ableton x devices you've ever patient complete in a sense of etc and only by first overcoming their imperfections and problems can we then actually combine their benefits in order to realize a revolutionary new system architectures which in turn can enable a whole new class for these future big abundant data applications they always say that while each sphere we're here is important and necessary in its own right it's only by connecting and combining they're right emerging technologies with the right system architectures for the right applications which allows to achieve these truly massive thousand x typography and what I really wouldn't emphasize about this approach of nanosystems is that it really does require advanced across the entire system staff that are coordinator which I think speaks exactly to the purpose of the workshop that just long when the devices and new architecture and he kind of software known enough who need to have this coordinated advantage of cross the entire system time to really okay so today that's what I hope to speak to you about I want to start by showing you that at the device level it's game on that computing is not dead that we still can get from that's more than 10x benefit in computing by using the devices but that's not enough then we can use these new devices in order to realize new types of systems and architectures monolithic 3d systems if you completely change the rules of the game and then thirdly and most importantly don't you show me that these aren't just slice just words presentation here they were actually able to do some really exciting new applications today using these new types of systems using these new types of technologies so let's do this first point talking about some new technologies to enable these new systems in architecture the technology which ina focused on really for half my entire life is a nobody called a carbon atom - so carbon nanotube is weaved here on the same page here for CNT is just a rolled-up sheet of graphene from a nano cylinder with a diameter of around one and a half down carbon nanotube field effect transistor we're seeing effect is formed by using the CD that the channel of the transistor which through that traditional fabricated source drain and gate electrodes so basically imagine any regular solar kid transistor you just take up a silicon from the channel replace that with carbon and teach and voila everything stays exactly the same okay so I here at MIT done a lot of work on see effects so for instance in addition to enabling that's 10x gain in competing performance can also scale to more aggressive nodes so we've shown for in system of scaled inner logic ever here at MIT this is a sub 390 here in technology note C in fat where the transistor is now around a hundred or so atoms to give a give a scalability okay so how do you make it surf down all of them well this is a schematic of a simplest circuit just an inverter you have a heat X and this was in a pull-up that work in type transistors in a pulldown network and design calls any additional Seamonsters line flow so it still falls a exact same flow that we use make silicon chips the entire day for today the same if I'm away from one key more than computing it going sensor for instance you can focus the CMT's and one of these transistors by putting a foot ization of copper the CTS and now it's a sensor where the sensitivity and selectivity of that sensor is determined by the function ization that we put on top this unit okay so over the last ten or fifteen years been a lot of progress in the field Carbon attitude from about you know twenty years ago or so the first the in fact ever built using a single carbon to remain both that IBM University about ten years ago or so work almost done at Stanford some of which was the focus my PhD with being done to overcome some of the inherent imperfections associated with the new technologies which are prohibited people from building systems out of them to about five years ago where for the first time you could actually build a working systems out of carbon attitude such as a basic microprocessor built entirely from skin facts but of course work hasn't stopped their sins so since coming here at MIT we've a completely reinvented how we manufacture and build surfaces and C and T's we'll give you a couple very quick examples of this so one key piece of progress is ability to know these C Mon which is essential for energy efficient circuits so not just one or two devices that we can make a raise of seeing effects and have them all working for both P and n-type transistors notice in these plots from some actual data we've measured another problem which is that it doesn't look so nice some of these transistors are leaky they don't turn off and this is due to the presence of what we call carbon nanotubes so to show you this really quickly so if here's our transistor ideally all the CMT's in the channel can be semiconducting turn on and off with the gate this is an actual measure curve from one transistor with also a deputies you see it has ideal switching properties button for 2020 grow C and C some percentage of these CMT who even tower which due to these I am growing chirality the CNT have a band gap of zero or close to zero and those can't be turned off by the gates of the name are always on a unique power and can cause a incorrect logging functionality so overcome this problem there are a couple so what approach would be just done groaning so girl these all to be somebody nothing senator CMT's that's the best case solution but it is impossible and I've been saying this for over 10 years now and it's still impossible and I think it will forever be impossible so the next best thing we can do that removes metallic CMT's post growth but the best that's been done is 99.99 percent purity and if you imagine point zero one percent GDP macaque might seem like a small number but when you have billions with the B number C and T's 0.01 percent of a billion is I okay so what's a solution well we have this Brian technique at MIT would you allow us to actually design a service to be completely immune those remaining percentage of atomic property engines so for instance if you just though this regular circuit like we do today it turns out that in order for the metallic C is not deposited in correct logic functionality because of the short that would mess up your computing somewhere that you require around 8 90s period C 99.99 90% of Toxie summit opportunity for that perspective that's about as pure as we can get a silicon wafer which is the most well controlled material in human history I think the feasibility of doing this would be nearly impossible so what a Hendricks didn't figure out what appear to be needed ain't only lead Ethan is actually very depressing I thought that we didn't grow by the mention we came up with this design technique which for the sake of time we'll go through the details of what allow us to design circuits in such a way to be immune to those without CNT we design circuits with what's already tabled a 99.9 percent semi definite C of T's and guaranteed those remaining the LCDs wouldn't cause a problem with our circuit okay so since I Union the technique a lot of success in actually showing we can actually build working circuits using carbon and T the proof is in the pudding so to speak so I just a couple of months ago we show the first bit signal circuits using CFX emotes these totaled around 2000 see invest on the circuit document VLSI will show among 3d image or else be flown with a 3d pretty soon where we basically have an imager on one plate of the circuit and then arrive on top we build a layer of carbon nanotubes logic and right on top of that more carbon atom logic so the imager takes data in on the bottom plane and then in real time use all that data right up to the next level top of it which does actually expressional mean and digitalization and all that they did apparently right up to the way of computing go directly and talk that which actually does a edge detection and could be for instance classification now you have a camera but in real time no of our outputs are DV values to your memory which they need to deal with semester computing let's do classification but a real time your camera for every frame no longer the pixels information is no classification or what is actually see also aqua Neos I will show the first ever arrays he's totally close to 10,000 see effects now and as we get to the end of this talk we're actually integrating seeing effects inside of commercial labs of those boundaries at 150 millimeter scale okay so I I hope I'm going to show you that they've been a lot of progress in the field of CMT's that if anybody's not seen so in people anymore but that's still getting the same systems that we go today using a new transistor I told you that's not going to be partner so how do we be better great how do we get to know the 10s benefit but a thousand of them well if you want even better you need to combine the advantages you can have at the device kill with a benefits you can leverage at the sister architectural level they did not in 3d integrations are very promising path now 3d integration today is achieve the chip stopping so this is when you build the different vertical layers of system on separate 2d jokes and then physically stack and bond them on top of each other we can through so computer tsps tip- vertical the system now these TVs are very large bulky and sparse which limits the vertical density in the physical connectivity between the layers of the jokes so I'll show the experimental is a dream of 3d which is monolithic 3d integration and this is when we can build each these vertical layers directly on top of one another on the same starting substrate to know if applied required because of this model in 3d integration you can either nanoscale these around these significant different vertical edges check which are order manages more than a thousand X denser than Z is where we can really led this massive increase in vertical connectivity is not just doing laser competing a couple of computing between layers of computing with memory that even sensing printers because now this massive increase in vertical conductivity directly translates into an equally large increase their allotted to memory bandwidth which has serious positive impacts for systems today those in terms of energy and performance i'm ghosted three examples of how so but my new only means is this list exhaustion so your memory access time energy so the processor spends less time mean I don't just wait to get data for memory memory access energy is all started because the logic and memories that committee and also custom user contention in the wider connectivity between the layers of logic and memory inter system okay now by despite the promise of month readers are the catch right so it's something sounds true it often is the catch here that's very difficult is not possible to build these regular technologies the proxy temperature for all the upper layers of the circuits has to be very low below 400 degrees C if you go above this you'll melt and damage the bottom layer circuits in your Cho and also just melt when this particular challenge for silicon which is crossing temperatures in excess of over a thousand degrees Celsius so this is where we can really leverage in the use of these new technologies for lodging and sensing carbon antiques remember there's a whole host to use but we focus on our ramp right where now these technologies can be built at very low temperatures below 200 degree C what's at room temperature well within our thermal would never learn I really want to emphasize about this approach without revealing now do get the combined benefits of using these energy-efficient high performing devices with these energy-efficient high-performing architectures which are naturally enabled by using these new devices to begin with and the most exciting part of this approach is that as I mentioned notice cartoons we can actually build these systems neck so whoo that's pretty quickly this was the first month 3d system and we realized it was the Nano system had four layers of C effects and our memory is all sensing the top layer I we actually built this is the picture what it looks like do you think you it what's inside the system we start with a random layer so it can seem us just like a normal chip that you tape out from any boundary the world we do on the regular metal back online processing re-emphasized ideas are very very dense because this is monolithic the integration of earth mountain if denser than what people rather talk without the Baudelaire computing using carbon nanotubes it's those two things that access memory act to circuitry which is critical for enabling that I found between leaders of logic underneath and the memory will be built in the talk shortly as well as many embedded classification accelerators for on chip embedded machine learning and I'll show you more about this shortly then we again we do metals or metal layers between we then do a thin layer of the chip which in this thing's we choose to be memory using armor then again with you more metal layers and they build a force like a chip then we make these carbon nanotubes if you zoom even see the CMT's inside of one of these see effects they go one step further to demonstrate that these feature systems then won't be intelligent taking more than just crunch numbers would actually interact with the outside world will transform a million of these printers from the cochlear TV sensors so now we have a system that has over 1 million embedded gas sensors innocent students so directly onto the top layer of this chip we take a look at these types of systems to have millions or billions of sensors but directly to the top layer this chip all connected in parallel to millions or billions better than that with two layers of marriage underneath thanks to the millions of things to do computing and classification accelerates builder up denieth that these systems can Andy today have four terabytes of information each second from the outside world store that data in Orchard memory the computer net and real-time transferring massive data input new highly processed useful information and I got a takeaway from that demonstration was not that he committed a nice gas sensor it was much deeper than that is what 3d nano system is and what this approach is is it's really a platform it's a demonstration from what future systems have to look like and showed the point if we want to enable this next generation of intelligent smart AI patient I've listed of you know three requirements that the systems have to have and how it was achieve done so first thing no need to order from the parallel by having energy efficient devices we can do that when you use new technologies or like carbonated easy to remember we're also that fun enough if you really want the Navy's new application which require vast amounts of data need to overcome the memorable to be able to pack some mass amounts of data between logic and memory we can do that you'll energy this monolithic three integration which is enabled by these new devices and we're over if you want system to do more than just crunch numbers right if you want systems you can Iraq to the outside world and truly be intelligent then you want system you integrate that sensing directly on show which we can also do these new technologies that enable not just great transistors but also three types of sensors so these are the major takeaways in that demonstration and I'm excited that the work hasn't ended there right because that's just a demonstration import demonstration but something's still done an academic lab so how do we actually take the assistance and actually get them out into the real world well I'm sorry to say that that was not me now and it takes again progress across the entire system stuff from the material level with new types of materials new processing techniques new design techniques I mentioned briefly some cross-linking CMOS and tops and tees all the way to actually introducing carbon nanotubes inside of some actual commercial facilities let me give you two quick examples of how carbon nanotubes can have an impact so this is a first application this is a very close collaboration we have at last year at MIT very close friends and remote devices as well as a clinician over at MGH into healthcare space what's the goal is well why don't we take a system like this that has millions of millions of sensors of gas sensors instead of sensing I I sense different types of alcohol but as a beast and at times but it sounds like alcohol wine beer gorgeous Stella but hey that flow what about food applies to disease right so we're actually doing that now we've actually just finished the first kind of trial over at MGH where instead of sensing what's inside someone's breath we're sensing bacteria greens on a petri dish because bacteria is growing and living and breathing just like us they exhale and smell when you have bad breath it's due to bacteria grown in your mouth that he was really diffuse bacteria growing in your shoes circular hazards the cheese but it's called by bacteria and actually the old technicians working over in MBAs and hospitals actually walk with petri dish that's great bacteria and we ought to be able to tell what it smells like if it's a buttery it smells like the popcorn in a movie theater they know all is this type of bacteria and if it smells like a farm or manure this is a different area and if it smells like sneakers it's dipped up bacteria and actually idea that way um so we're actually putting these chips inside making element peter dishes and kentucky smell identify bacteria if you meet in your Diagnostics i've actually do in a lab over there GA today so that's what example let me give you another very quick second example of how these technologies are actually making a difference and this is in an appeal space for any future binding application this is a dart program it's called penis receipt as part of the ER is led by us here at MIT very close collaborators at stanford who are actually my advisors a company that makes these new materials adult stars they love your family which is giving us trusted foundry here in the US and the goal of 3d EXO seat is to transform a 2d system like this that has separate computing nodes off chip memory which is faced with all become as I mentioned for you big abundant data applications and say hey what about making this system that showed me previously write these monolithic 3d systems now multiple layers of memory and computing fun intertwined within this 3d side so four layers of memory as I mentioned we're using RM is emerging on volatile memory for logic we're using carbon nanotubes they made it a relaxed Magnani or note and just to give you some projections this work comes from Stanford as part of this program alright when compared to the same Miller course of silicon versus a regular 2d chips in the art versus are a ton of new 3d systems all right you see that here there's over a thousand ducks for around a thousand that benefit the energy delayed product we're allowed that benefit coach from is reducing all this time that's spent we have proc Serbian Idol just basically do the memory axes and standing useful computing you're at that time so instead of you would spend 95% your time talking to memory that's flipped on his head now you spend 95% you're trying to and I want to mention that that is really just the beginning I to highlight on this last point you know these are massive benefits are enabled by using these new devices with new systems that's it we haven't changed a software stack we have been optimized architecture so let me give you some food for thought here you know for conversation right so I a lot of competing systems game is built around tiny inefficiencies we do things like prefecture there's a lot of hardware that we use today to actually make systems look more efficient the backyard well if you don't have the sources of in efficiencies can you actually simplify your hard work can you get rid of all these things that you know underneath and surely what about the software right so if all sudden my phone of competing has changed if I no longer have to worry about me Marriott see surely impact the soft bread right to run a system so maybe they're even more benefits there so I think these benefits I'm talking about are really just the beginning so with that I'll wrap up I hope I'd be able to show you that this concept of Naxos in C school stay there really is key to enabling these future bigger but again a patient and that was not just by the sky some dream were actually able to begin tranching this technology from you know academic labs into commercial facts to make real jobs respond surgeons dudes do all the work and I'll wrap up have yeah question so the question is seal now been expanded a tiny bit right so is yield both because using new technologies and it also yield because when you make more layers in the circuit your yield decreases exponentially right so there are many approaches to deal with this type of problem one thing I'll mention is the systems that we're building now are much much bigger than anything I can talk about in the slides so systems that are comparable to something you could actually buy made from silicon fence and no assistant he's never done see what whatsoever so it's the exact same system tape out either works or it doesn't work so when doing these 3d systems and of course you know yield is a challenge and there are many approaches to deal with you note it's actually a component of the 3d SSE program that we have so there's a you know for fir for memory for instance in the upper layers right there many approach that people take to dealing with Erics memory for logics of low more complex so how we design systems today is we keep a lot of computing the processors on the third bottom layer they write line talk to you may reactor can write on top of that memory so it alleviates the problem closely to design but in the future can want to do more in a flexible design with computing like Harper processor cores on every layer then it's something that you know continues to work a lot of stuff they design you know nation forces I think yeah so are so are any limitation are the exact same as native technology so what you can do you know what limits the size of a silicon chip in terms of you it's the exact same equations that impact our you light comes on the cost right if you want to and this is you know actually grow more as long you wanna put more attendance internship you're gonna yield fewer chips that being said I think you know the notion of these three chips may start having many many different across their corporations like each other in extra memory it becomes very distributed right so you can think of a mention like new computer we're just like the internet we went over moved down the entire unit was in crashed right figure out resiliency in math amount of resources I think like why do these types of systems are many ways to deliberate there are many kind of intelligence where ways to just field which are in terms of thermal their processing and design approaches there so right now as I mentioned we keep the process of course on the bottom layer of the chip one of the key reasons for that is that's also read with cool heat sinks are the memory isn't what generates the heat it's the crossing port right when the future if you do want in for everything for you know a hundred corners on the hundreds nervous system then you will need to integrate new types of materials which are ideally suited for these types of uniform amendments and seed spreaders so Tomas back there works in crafting people talk about you know graphene for some experiments so it's not showing stuff right now but in one reflects ability then more debate they require that one to insist then a good question I so I yeah so if you're familiar with our Emma this is a bipolar is every regular hafnium oxide nitride hi stack very mature and that's where we're using it and for the there's a lot of work going on in academia right now and an industry to integrate selectors into the soul of a currently we're still using transistors and tivity this would be a huge problem because now your your memory is here your transistor your silicon transistors with one T and then that means to the side of the chip is where you have your processor so even if you try and do like member you know memory over logic if you have all these selectors there and your memory access circuitry it's still off to the side your processor you still constrained with kind of pin limited access or kind of rounding access to this memory but for us because we can do layers of finish from the top layer it's a easy solution so what we've already done already kicked out from the boundary if you have layers of memory right underneath that we go to layer of transistors using carbon nanotubes and you're right nice that we then have memory active circuitry like decoders and muxes and sense and you're right underneath that we then have right now I have no sister four cores but we have a core or you know more cores right which all can talk through a little spice a memory so we can actually kind of overcome these types of challenges through these new systems or
