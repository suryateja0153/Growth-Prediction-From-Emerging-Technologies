 captions in English please so this is the second video of chapter 12. we will focus on ionic bonding and pure covalent bonding what is the ionic bonding versus molecular or also covalent bonding so note how molecular is synonymous to covalent so you can use one or the other and it means the same thing so the basic units that compose dry ice for example the carbon dioxide when it's solid are molecules CO2 molecules so dry ice is a molecular compound it's made of CO2 molecules and they are packed together in a ordered ordered fashion when it's in the solid state but the basic units that compose table salt which is an ionic compound are NaCl formula units we call them formula units so when you have an ionic compound you call the basic unit formula units and when you have a molecular compound you call the basic units molecules so let's look at ionic compounds first so we know metals have the tendency to lose electrons and so when a metal combines with a non-metal and non-metals have the tendency to gain electrons so one or more electrons can transfer from the metal to the non-metal creating positive and negative ions that are attracted to each other we know that opposite charges are attracted and so when you have a positive ion and a negative ion they will be attracted and that's how you can make ionic compounds and that's what typically happens between non-metals and metals so a compound composed of a metal and a non-metal is considered ionic so by definition an ionic compound is made of metal and non-metals and so the basic unit for ionic compounds is the formula unit so don't talk about molecules when you are calling when you are talking about an ionic compound unlike molecular compounds ionic compounds do not contain individual molecules but rather cations and anions in an alternating three dimensional array so because positive ions are attracted to negative ions the cations will be surrounded by anions and then the anions will be surrounded by cations and so this creates an alternating 3D lattice or array so how are ionic compounds made so for example why is the formula for potassium bromide KBr so we know potassium is an alkali metal from group 1A it likes to lose one electron to become a positive cation with a one positive charge so this is  shown as K becomes K+ plus one electron the electron is gone from the atom K and you have a positive ion K+, bromine likes to gain an electron and become the Br- minus and so chemically we can write this as Br plus one electron becomes the Br- the bromide ion so we can explain why these ions form based on their electron configuration so why do they do that? it's because KBr for example has this electron configuration of 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 4s1 and so the valence shell for potassium is the forth and there is only one orbital with one electron in there the 4s1 and so it's easy for potassium to give away that one 4s electron and so by doing this potassium which started with 19 electrons will have then only 18 electrons and 18 electrons is the configuration the electron configuration for the noble gas argon so when you're removing that 4s one, the electron configuration for K+ is 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 which is exactly the electron configuration of argon so you can write that it's argon in brackets which means it's its electron configuration and we know that the noble gases are very stable they have a very stable electron configuration because all their orbitals are full and their valance shell is you know the 3s and 3p is full so it makes argon very stable bromine has an electron configuration of 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 4s2 3d10 4p5 so the valence shell for bromine is also the fourth and there is two electrons in the 4s orbital and 5 electrons in the 4p orbitals so bromine is closer to krypton you can see that by gaining one more electron in its 4p orbitals and becoming the 4p6 it has the same electron configuration than krypton because bromine has 35 electrons but by gaining one more electron it gets 36 electrons and that's the number of electrons of krypton so Br- has the same electron configuration as krypton and that makes it much more stable so when these elements form ions they achieve a noble gas configuration and noble gas configurations are very stable and so all elements try to reach that stable these stable noble gas configurations let's look at another example why is the formula for aluminum oxide Al2O3 ? so aluminum is in group 3A likes to lose 3 electrons and becomes a three plus ion so aluminum becomes Al3+ and three electrons are gone from aluminum we know that oxygen likes to gain two electrons to become O2- negative two anion so again we can explain why they do this by looking at the electron configuration of aluminium first so aluminum has electron configuration of 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p1 so the valence shell of aluminum is the third it has three electrons in it the two electrons in the 3s orbital and the one electron in the 3p so sorry sorry and so aluminum likes to lose those three electrons in its valence shell and when it loses those 3p1 and 3s2 electrons it gains the same electron configuration as neon because aluminum had three sorry 13 atomic number 13 means it has 13 electrons but by losing 3 it gets 10 electrons only and that's this is the atomic number of neon so then aluminum 3 plus has the same electron configuration as neon let's look at oxygen electron configuration of oxygen is 1s2 2s2 2p4 by gaining two electrons you know filling that 2p orbitals with two more electrons it becomes 1s2 2s2 2p6 and that's ten electrons in total so it's again the same electron configuration as neon so that's why aluminum and oxygen do like to gain two electrons for oxygen and lose three electrons for aluminum because they become electronically like neon which is a stable configuration so each aluminum wants to lose three electrons and each oxygen can only accept two electrons therefore the formula must be Al2O3 they must exchange six electrons in total so six electrons will be transferred in the process and remember how we can also find this formula of Al2O3 by doing the crisscross trick where you take the charge of the anion oxygen the two becomes the subscript for aluminum and the three from the charge of the aluminum becomes the subscript for oxygen but you know by calculating the number of electrons exchanged you see it's six electrons so that's why aluminum oxide has this formula Al2O3 so how strong are ionic bonds? ionic bonds are extremely stable and their bonds are very strong let's look at the boiling point and melting point of sodium chloride to see how strong this is so the melting point for salt is 801 degrees celsius and sorry the boiling point is 1413 degrees celsius which are very high temperatures so that means you need to bring a lot of energy to break the bonds between chlorine and sodium which justifies the fact that this bond is very strong by comparison if you look at water and its melting point and boiling point it's zero degree celsius for the melting point and 100 degree celsius for the boiling point of water so you see that it doesn't require as much energy you can do this at home while melting sodium chloride you cannot do that at home you need industrial furnace so this shows you how strong the bonds are in ionic compounds so now let's look at covalent bonds and let's look at the simplest type of covalent bond which happens between two identical atoms of hydrogens hydrogen is a diatomic molecule and in its natural state which is a gas it is described as H2 so you do not find hydrogen atoms by themselves in nature what you find is a diatomic molecule made of two hydrogen atoms bonded together so how can we explain the bonding in H2 ? why do they do that? well you've seen in the video in the previous recording how this is due to the fact that their respective energy gets smaller when they get together so when two hydrogens get close to each other the electron of one atom is attracted to the nucleus of the other and vice versa so you know how electrons are negatively charged and protons in the nucleus of an hydrogen atoms are positively charged and so they are attracted and so the electron of an atom is attracted to the nucleus of the other and so the greatest electron density is between the two atoms and so that makes the two electrons shared between by the two nucleus they are shared equally because it's two atoms of the same kind so we would call this a pure covalent molecule so what drives the two hydrogens to form a bond in the first place the simple answer is energy and i just said that earlier and too soon actually but yes it's because it lowers the energy of the two atoms by being together it lowers their energy and that makes them more stable because in chemistry you have to realize that whenever you have a low energy it means you are more stable and so H2 is more stable than the separated atoms and you've seen that in the video earlier in the previous recording but let's look at this electron microscope imaging of two rhenium atoms so it's a molecule made of two rhenium atoms and we see them as two dark spots here in the upper part of the image they travel around two carbon nanotubes and that's the lattice so you see kind of two tubes made of contrast, dark and light contrast and so those two rhenium atoms will be moving and settling into the gap between the nanotubes and when the atoms are separated by a larger distance the bond between them is broken but then it reforms so you will see how they are more stable when they are close together so focus on the right side of the image and where right now it looks like one dark dot but there will be two there, don't look at the groups of you know 10 or 12 dots, focus on the single black dot here in the top of the second nanotube here so if you look here you see those two atoms sometimes one is hidden because it's behind the other but they are bonded here and they move and now they are between the two carbon nanotubes and they keep moving because you know atoms are not still they always vibrates and here they keep moving and they stay together let's see if they get separated again oops they got separated but they you know they feel like attracted to each other right and the reason is because it lowers their level of energy when they're staying together
