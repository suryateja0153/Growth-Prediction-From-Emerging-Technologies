 believe it or not this is a diamond and the reason you can't see it is because it's covered with the darkest color on earth in fact this material is so dark that it captures at least 99.995% of incoming visible light but why is it covering a two million dollar diamond and how is it made in the first place [Music] you may remember this color vantablack it was unveiled in 2014 and media outlets called it the darkest color in the world but this color here it's not vantablack it's even blacker and that's thanks to an unprecedented collaboration between science and art it all traces back to this artist DeMuth Streep in 2014 she set out on a mission to find the blackest black her goal was to make a diamond disappear this project explores how values attached to concepts and objects in reference to luxury and art and society meanwhile a scientist named Brian Wardle was on a totally different mission he was working with a material called carbon nanotubes the same stuff used to make vantablack though he was using them to boost the thermal and electrical properties of materials like aluminum but little did Wordle know he was producing something even darker than vantablack Brian was looking into the optical properties of CMT's only because of the art project and so it kind of cost really from this odd project the research to find the blackest black the new material which Wartell has yet to name is ten times blacker than any other color ever reported and that likely has to do with the structure of those nanotubes themselves in this case Wordle and his team grew them on top of aluminum yeah they may not be alive but you can actually grow carbon nanotubes first you cover a material with microscopic metal particles then you bake it at high temperatures in the presence of a hydrocarbon gas and that's basically it carbon nanotubes will sprout out of those metallic particles like plants from seeds you do it in the way we've done it here I'm gonna get the recipe right you can create forest these are very very long you know aspect ratios of like a million right the length of the tube like a million relative to the diameter and that grows into what's called a forest that nanotube forest is the key to creating this black color when particles of light called photons enter it nearly all of them get trapped and then dissipate as heat that's why when you look at this black you see well absolutely nothing no shadows no ridges just black and that made it perfect for streams diamond vanishing project in fact mortals team followed the exact same procedure to grow those nanotubes directly on to a diamond and that's pretty wild when you consider this both is made of carbon it's the same element just the different atomic lattice structure makes them so extreme opposite in the phenomenology in their appearance and as it turns out this material isn't just useful for multi-million dollar art projects scientists can also use it to reduce the glare and optical sensors such as for telescopes that explore distant objects in space if you you know have a material that can absorb the stray starlight then you can look further or and or look in more detail at objects such as exoplanets but here's the thing as cool as this color is it likely won't be the darkest for long because even an absorption rate this high still leaves some room for improvement so keep your eyes peeled for the next color that you can't see you [Music]
