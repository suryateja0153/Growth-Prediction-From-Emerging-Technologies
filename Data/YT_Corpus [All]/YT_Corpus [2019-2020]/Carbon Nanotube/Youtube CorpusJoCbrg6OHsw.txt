 hi my name is Hal Levinson I'm a professor of engineering physics at the University of Wisconsin Platteville my colleagues and I are working on a project that will help a local dairy farmer with his progressive grazing in other words he rotates his herd through different sections of the field throughout the day and this can be a labor-intensive task we're looking into automated yet cost-effective ways that this might be accomplished and we're investigating two tracks a one that would be using virtual fencing and another one that would be using automated physical fencing we're going to be working with our engineering students as well as senior design students to get this done I'm excited to work with the dairy innovation hub because I see this both as one a good source of practical applied projects for my students that two, can have a direct local impact that benefits our community and our region outside of this hub project project I'm very involved with our campuses efforts and bringing Internet of Things topics into our curriculum I'm also involved in teaching our research into nanoscale electronics that incorporate carbon nanotubes. My name is Cyrus Habibi and I'm an assistant professor of Electrical Engineering at the University of Wisconsin Platteville my research background involves instrumentation signal processing and internet of things this project that we are going to work on is about effective grazing. We know effective grazing improved agriculture animal welfare and environment but has been an issue for farmers and the goal of this project is to address this issue specifically we are going to work on virtual fence. Virtual fence is not a new concept you might have an invisible fence for your dog in your property for farmers the same technology doesn't work because a farm might be anywhere between five to a thousand acres and you can't lay  the wire all over the property currently GPS based devices are available but those are really very expensive the farmers need to pay for service in addition to the cost of equipment the objective of this project is to develop product which is not only cost effective for small farms specifically but also farmers are able to electronically change the location of virtual fence I am looking forward to work with Wisconsin dairy hub and my colleagues on this exciting project thank you. I hope that the work that we're doing with the dairy hub will all for one help small family farms get the most from their land in a sustainable fashion and two give engineering students a chance to recognize the opportunities that exist in the agricultural arena and then finally that this will be fun I'm looking forward to working with both my colleagues and with my students
