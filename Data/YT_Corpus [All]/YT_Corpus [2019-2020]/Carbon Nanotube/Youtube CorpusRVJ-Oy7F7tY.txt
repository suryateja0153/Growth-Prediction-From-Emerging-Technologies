 THEY ARE THE STUFF OF FANTASY-- OR ARE THEY? WHO WOULDN'T WANT TO SOAR THROUGH THE SKY LIKE SUPERMAN?  FLYING THROUGH THE AIR IS A FEELING THAT'S ALMOST TOO HARD TO EXPLAIN.  OR HARNESS THE STRENGTH OF 10 MEN.  THIS THING IS INCREDIBLY POWERFUL AND IT'S WAY COOL.  READY TO TAKE A FLYING LEAP? OR SWIM THROUGH THE WATER LIKE AQUAMAN?  IT MAKES YOU A SUPER SWIMMER.  TODAY, TECHNOLOGY CAN MAKE ANYONE A SUPER HERO. SO GRAB YOUR CAPES. NOW, "SUPER HUMAN" ON "MODERN MARVELS." [MUSIC]  THE HUMAN BODY IS A PHYSICAL WONDER. IT'S A MACHINE OF UNFATHOMABLE COMPLEXITY, BUT IT HAS ITS LIMITS. SUPER HEROES PLAY TO OUR DREAMS OF SHEDDING THOSE LIMITS AND WE RELISH THE FANTASY. BUT THE FANTASY IS BECOMING REALITY AS TODAY'S SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY ARE CATCHING UP TO YESTERDAY'S SCIENCE FICTION. TAKE SUPER STRENGTH. NOW, ANYONE CAN ACHIEVE IT JUST BY BUCKLING INTO A SUPER-POWERED EXOSKELETON BUILT BY THE ENGINEERS AT RAYTHEON SARCOS IN SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH.  IT'S GOOD.  THEIR WORK IS FUNDED BY THE U.S. ARMY, WHICH ENVISIONS NOT ONLY MAKING ITS SOLDIERS STRONGER, BUT ALSO INCREASING THEIR ENDURANCE AND LETHALITY.  OH, IT'S WAY COOL. THIS THING IS INCREDIBLY POWERFUL AND IT FOLLOWS YOUR EVERY MOVE, SO I DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE TO DO MUCH OF ANYTHING.  SARCOS' EXOSKELETON IS COMPOSED OF OVER 1,300 SEPARATE PARTS MADE OF EVERYTHING FROM ALUMINUM TO STEEL TO BRONZE. THE KEYS TO ITS STRENGTH ARE ELECTRICALLY DRIVEN HYDRAULICS OPERATING MUCH LIKE MUSCLES AND STEEL CABLES SUBBING FOR TENDONS. IT MAGNIFIES THE USER'S POWER, ALLOWING OUR SUPER SOLDIER REX JAMESON TO CONTINUOUSLY LIFT 250 POUNDS, AND NEVER BREAK A SWEAT.  I FEEL A TENTH OF THE WEIGHT. IT DOESN'T REQUIRE A WHOLE LOT OF EFFORT. WE'VE DONE THAT PARTICULAR EXERCISE BASICALLY TILL EVERYONE GOT BORED AND WALKED AWAY.  THE GENERAL OBJECTIVE IS TO DO A LOT OF WORK OR GO FAST WITH LITTLE EXERTION BY THE PERSON AND LITTLE CONSUMPTION OF ENERGY BY THE MACHINE. [MUSIC] SO GREATER STRENGTH WITH LOWER EFFORT.  THOUGH THIS COMPLEX APPARATUS WEIGHS 150 POUNDS, IT'S AS NIMBLE AS IT IS POWERFUL. IT ALLOWS THE WEARER FULL AND FREE MOBILITY.  IT FOLLOWS YOU AROUND WITHOUT ANY PROBLEM.  I CORRECT IN IT THE SAME WAY I WOULD WALKING UPSTAIRS WITHOUT IT. IT'S EFFORTLESS.  THIS EFFORTLESS MOVEMENT IS A RESULT OF SENSORS THAT DETECT EVERY ACTION, NO MATTER HOW SUBTLE THAT REX IS MAKING. PLACED THROUGHOUT THE ARMS AND LEGS, THE SENSORS DIRECT THE SUIT TO MATCH EVERY MOVE OF THE USER.  THE PERSON HAS TO DO NOTHING MORE THAN COMMAND IT WITH HIS MOVEMENTS AND THE MACHINE DOES ALL THE WORK. IT HAS TO MOVE LIKE THE PERSON DOES AND NOT FIGHT HIS EVERY MOVEMENT.  TO CREATE THIS SYNCHRONIZED SPRYNESS, SARCOS' ENGINEERS STARTED WITH THE FEET AND WORKED THEIR WAY UP.  YOU CAN SEE DOWN BELOW HE'S GOT ANKLE ACTUATORS THAT MOVE HIS FOOT UP AND DOWN. HE'S GOT A ROTATOR FOR HIS TIBIA AND FIBIA, A KNEE JOINT, AND WE BUILT THE LOWER EXTREMITY FIRST THAT ALLOWED THE PERSON TO WALK, GET UP, AND GET DOWN, WALK UP LADDERS, WALK UP RAMPS, KICK BALLS, AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING.  THE LEGS ARE DESIGNED TO ALLOW THE USER TO WALK NORMALLY, BUT STILL BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE EXOSKELETON'S OWN WEIGHT, IN ADDITION TO A PAYLOAD OF OVER 200 POUNDS. HE CAN EVEN HOLD THAT WEIGHT ON ONE LEG.  WHEN HE MOVES AROUND, THIS MOVES WITH HIS LEG, BUT WHEN HE STEPS DOWN, IT ACTUALLY TIGHTENS UP AND IT HOLDS THE WEIGHT OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY AND THE BACK ASSEMBLY, SO THAT WHEN HE'S STANDING IN A FULL POSITION POWERED UP, HE DOESN'T HAVE MUCH LOAD ON HIS SHOULDERS. SO THE MACHINE'S CARRYING ITS WEIGHT AND THE LOAD'S WEIGHT AND HE'S CARRYING HIS OWN WEIGHT.  THE UPPER HALF OF THE EXOSKELETON WORKS ON THE SAME PRINCIPLES AS THE LOWER, PROVIDING THE ARM'S MAGNIFIED POWER WHILE MAINTAINING A FULL RANGE OF MOTION.  THE SHOULDER HAS A LARGE RANGE OF MOTION, MUCH MORE THAN THE RELATED JOINT IN YOUR LEG WHICH IS YOUR HIP, SO THE SHOULDER AND ARM PARTS OF THE EXOSKELETON DON'T LOOK LIKE THE LOWER ONES. SO WHEN HE MOVES HIS ELBOW, THE TWO MUSCLES PULL, THE TENDONS PULL, AND HE GETS THE RANGE OF MOTION THAT HE'D LIKE. THE SAME THING HAPPENS WITH THE WRIST AND WITH MOVING THE SHOULDER IN AND OUT AND WITH FLEXING THE SHOULDER.  ALTHOUGH THE EXOSKELETON'S INTRICATE HARDWARE IS NOW EXPOSED, FUTURE PLANS CALL FOR ENCASING IT IN PROTECTIVE PLATING MADE OF ANYTHING FROM STEEL TO KEVLAR ARMOR. IT'S TOO EARLY FOR THE ARMY TO SAY WHEN IT WILL BE READY TO DEPLOY, BUT ONCE FULLY DEVELOPED, THE EXOSKELETON PROMISES TO REVOLUTIONIZE MILITARY OPERATIONS. FOR STARTERS, IT WILL HELP FREE SOLDIERS OF THE BURDENSOME TASK OF LUGGING AROUND RUCKSACKS WEIGHING AS MUCH AS 150 POUNDS.  THOSE RUCKSACKS ARE EXTREMELY HEAVY AND IS REALLY TAKING A TOLL ON THE SOLDIERS, WHETHER IT'S THEIR PHYSICAL ABILITY TO LIFT SOMETHING, OR BEING ABLE TO GO LONG DISTANCES IN ORDER TO SEARCH AND DESTROY THE ENEMY, I THINK A SYSTEM LIKE THIS WOULD DEFINITELY HELP OUR WAR FIGHTERS INTO THE FUTURE.  BUT FUTURE APPLICATIONS OF THIS SUPER-POWERED EXOSKELETON AREN'T LIMITED TO THE MILITARY.  YOU CAN THINK OF MEDICAL PRODUCTS THAT HELP CRIPPLE PEOPLE WALK OR KEEPING PEOPLE SAFE FROM OVERWORKING THEMSELVES, WORKING IN WAREHOUSES, WORKING IN CONSTRUCTION.  AS THESE ENGINEERS EMPOWER US WITH SUPER STRENGTH BY PUTTING THE MACHINE AROUND THE MAN-- OTHERS ARE TRYING TO MAKE US SUPER BY PUTTING THE MACHINE IN THE MAN. SUCH IS THE WORK OF PROFESSOR KEVIN WARWICK AND HIS COLLEAGUES AT THE UNIVERSITY OF READING IN ENGLAND. COULD THEIR PIONEERING WORK BE THE FIRST STEP TOWARD TRANSFORMING US INTO SUPER CYBORGS LIKE ROBOCOP AND DARTH VADER?  WE LIVE IN A VERY EXCITING TIME BEING ABLE, PARTICULARLY TO LINK HUMANS AND TECHNOLOGY TOGETHER.  AND WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO IS TO DEVELOP NEW WAYS AND NEW INTERFACES BY WHICH HUMANS CAN RECEIVE INFORMATION FROM A MACHINE AND GIVE INFORMATION TO A MACHINE.  TO ADVANCE HIS RESEARCH OVER THE PAST DECADE, WARWICK TOOK A RADICAL APPROACH. DURING A FIVE YEAR PERIOD, HE ACTED AS HIS OWN GUINEA PIG, CARRYING SEVERAL SURGICALLY IMPLANTED COMPUTER CHIPS IN HIS BODY. THAT'S HOW HE EARNED HIS MECHANICAL MONIKER, MR.CYBORG.  THE FIRST CHIP THAT I HAD WAS IN 1998. I HAVE IN FACT GOT ONE OF THESE HERE AND THIS WAS A RADIO FREQUENCY IDENTIFICATION DEVICE AND IT WAS IMPLANTED IN MY LEFT ARM. AT THE TIME, NO ONE HAD DONE IT BEFORE, SO WE DIDN'T KNOW IF THERE WOULD BE ANY PROBLEMS, ANY DANGERS WITH IT AND HENCE I WENT FOR IT MYSELF. WHAT IT DID WAS IDENTIFY ME TO THE COMPUTER IN MY BUILDING, SO THE COMPUTER OPENED DOORS FOR ME, SAID HELLO, SWITCHED ON LIGHTS, THAT SORT OF THING.  BUT WARWICK HAD MUCH GRANDER GOALS THAN JUST ENABLING MACHINES TO RECOGNIZE HIM. HE WANTED THE SUPER ABILITY TO CONTROL THEM REMOTELY, USING THE POWER OF HIS MIND. SO IT WAS BACK UNDER THE KNIFE.  THIS WAS IMPLANTED IN MY LEFT ARM. THE IMPLANT ITSELF CONSISTS OF 100 VERY VERY SMALL ELECTRODES AND THESE WERE FIRED INTO MY NERVOUS SYSTEM. WE CAN STILL SEE THE SCARS FROM THE OPERATION. THERE WERE THEN WIRES RUNNING FROM THERE ALL UP THE INSIDE OF MY ARM, COMING OUT AT THIS POINT HERE AND WHAT WE DID WAS CONNECT ON THIS LITTLE GAUNTLET ARRANGEMENT. THIS IS ACTUALLY A RADIO TRANSMITTER RECEIVER UNIT, WHICH FROM THIS TERMINAL PAD HERE LINKED TO MY NERVOUS SYSTEM AND BY RADIO, MY BRAIN SIGNALS WERE BROUGHT OUTSIDE MY BODY, SO WHEN I MOVE MY HAND, MY NERVOUS SYSTEM SIGNALS WERE SENT OUT TO THIS ROBOT HAND HERE, SO AS I MOVE MY HAND MY BRAIN SIGNALS WERE CONTROLLING THIS ROBOT HAND, BUT ALSO SIGNALS FROM THE COMPUTER COULD BE SENT DOWN ONTO MY NERVOUS SYSTEM FOR MY BRAIN TO PICK UP. SO I COULD FEEL HOW MUCH FORCE THE ROBOT HAND WAS APPLYING.  ONE OF WARWICK'S GREATEST CHALLENGES WAS TO SIMPLY RECOGNIZE THOSE SIGNALS, BUT SIX WEEKS OF EFFORT GOT HIM OVER THE HUMP.  WHAT WE HAVE DONE ESSENTIALLY WAS OPEN UP A NEW PATH INTO MY BRAIN BY THE IMPLANT. WE COULD THEN PUT ELECTRIC PULSES DOWN ON TO MY NERVOUS SYSTEM FOR MY BRAIN TO UNDERSTAND. WHAT IT FELT LIKE WAS EVERY TIME A PULSE CAME IN, WHERE THERE WAS ACTUALLY AN ELECTRIC PULSE, WAS LIKE A CHARGE RUNNING UP MY INDEX FINGER. THE MORE PULSES, THE MORE FORCE.  WARWICK'S IMPLANTED CHIP ALSO ALLOWED HIM TO EXERCISE MIND CONTROL OVER OTHER MACHINES LIKE THIS WHEELCHAIR. BUT THE PATH TO SUPER POWERS BY FUSING MAN AND MACHINE CUTS BOTH WAYS. INSTEAD OF COMPUTERIZING A HUMAN, YOU CAN ALSO HUMANIZE A ROBOT. THIS ROBOT REPRESENTS A BABY STEP IN THIS REVOLUTIONARY CONCEPT. VIA A BLUETOOTH WIRELESS CONNECTION, IT'S UNDER THE CONTROL OF CELLS EXTRACTED FROM THE BRAIN OF A RAT.  THE OUTPUT FROM THE RAT BRAIN IS THEN USED TO DRIVE THE WHEELS OF THE ROBOT. THE ONLY CONTROLLING MECHANISM IS THE BIOLOGICAL BRAIN WITH ABOUT 100,000 BRAIN CELLS.  THE EXTRACTED CELLS HAVE BEEN DEPOSITED ON A PETRI DISH WHERE THEY CONTINUE TO SEND ELECTRICAL IMPULSES.  THEY'D START TO DEVELOP SPONTANEOUSLY CONNECTIONS AND ONCE THEY CONNECT TOGETHER INTO A NETWORK, THEN STARTS TO COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER, SO TO SPEAK.  ELECTRODES EMBEDDED IN THE DISH DETECT THIS COMMUNICATION AND TRANSFER IT TO THE ROBOT. EVEN THOUGH THE CRUDE NEUROLOGICAL ACTIVITY IS JUST A FAINT SHADOW OF THE RAT'S FULLY FUNCTIONAL BRAIN, A LEARNING PROCESS IS IN MOTION.  THE ULTRASONIC SENSORS ON THE ROBOT, WHICH GIVE AN INDICATION WHEN THE ROBOT COMES CLOSE TO A WALL ARE SENT BACK VIA THE ELECTRODES TO OUR RAT BRAIN AND THE NEURON CONNECTIONS, HOW THEY'RE FIRING STARTS TO STRENGTHEN BECAUSE IT KEEPS DOING SOMETHING, A BIT LIKE IN HUMANS, IF YOU DO SOMETHING HABITUALLY, YOU GET BETTER AT DOING IT. WELL, OUR LITTLE ROBOT, OUR RAT BRAIN ROBOT IS EXACTLY THE SAME.  IF THIS RUDIMENTARY GADGET FUSING BIOLOGIC BRAIN POWER AND ROBOTICS SEEMS LIKE A LONG WAY FROM SUPER CYBORGS, YOU'RE RIGHT, BUT HIS OFFSPRING PROMISE TO BE LESS PRIMITIVE.  THE PHYSICAL ROBOT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE SMALL AND WITH LITTLE WHEELS. IT COULD BE A VEHICLE OUTSIDE, SO WE COULD HAVE THE CULTURE DRIVING AROUND A VEHICLE, MAYBE AT AN AIRPORT OR IN A HOTEL OR IN A HOSPITAL WHERE YOU ARE JUST DRIVING A VEHICLE FROM PLACE TO PLACE.  USING THE SAME CONCEPT, COULD A MAN SOMEDAY GAIN SUPER POWER BY HAVING HIS BRAIN EXERCISE CONTROL OF A POWERFUL ROBOTIC BODY? TIME WILL TELL, BUT PROFESSOR WARWICK'S PERSONAL PREFERENCE IS TO GO THE OTHER WAY. HE'D RATHER DEVELOP A SUPER BRAIN, BY FUSING WITH COMPUTERS.  I FIND LIFE AS A HUMAN PRETTY DULL AND BORING. I THINK THERE'S SO MANY THINGS WE COULD DO HAVING NEW SENSES, HAVING OUR BRAINS THINKING IN MANY MORE DIMENSIONS. CERTAINLY THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO DO. ULTIMATELY, I WANT TO HAVE AN IMPLANT THAT LINKS MY BRAIN INTO A COMPUTER NETWORK, SO I CAN HAVE SOME OF THOSE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENT ABILITIES THAT PRESENTLY COMPUTERS HAVE.  AS HIGH TECHNOLOGY PROMISES TO GRANT US SUPER POWERED BRAINS AND BODIES, IT'S ALSO GIVING AN ELITE FEW THE POWER TO SOAR THROUGH THE SKY. "SUPER HUMAN" WILL RETURN ON "MODERN MARVELS."  WE NOW RETURN TO "SUPER HUMAN" ON "MODERN MARVELS." ASK ANYONE WHICH SUPERPOWER THEY'D LIKE TO HAVE AND IT'S A GOOD BET THEY'LL SAY THE ABILITY TO FLY. WE HAVE ACHIEVED IT ONLY IN OUR DREAMS-- UNTIL NOW. [MUSIC]. SKYDIVERS LIKE THESE EQUIPPED WITH SPECIALIZED WING SUITS ARE EDGING US CLOSER TO UNASSISTED HUMAN FLIGHT. EAT YOUR HEART OUT SUPERMAN.  IT'S UNEXPLAINABLE HOW YOU FEEL. THE FEELING OF TRUE FLIGHT AND YOUR BODY IS ACTUALLY THE MACHINE FLYING THROUGH THE AIR, IS A FEELING THAT'S ALMOST TOO HARD TO EXPLAIN.  IT IS TOTAL FREEDOM. [MUSIC]  THAT WAS A GOOD FLIGHT.  ED PAWLOWSKI OF WEST COAST WING SUITS IN LODI, CALIFORNIA HAS LOGGED MORE THAN 10,000 SKYDIVES. HE IS ONE OF THE PREMIER WING SUIT FLYERS IN THE WORLD.  A WING SUIT IS A PIECE OF EQUIPMENT LIKE A JUMPSUIT THAT YOU PUT ON YOUR BODY. IT'S DESIGNED TO CREATE A LONGER FLIGHT IN FREEFALL. IT ENABLES YOU TO COVER A LOT OF GROUND AND STAY IN THE AIR A LOT LONGER THAN A NORMAL SKYDIVER WHERE YOU'RE JUST DESCENDING STRAIGHT DOWN.  A CONVENTIONAL SKYDIVING FREE FALL FROM 13,000 FEET LASTS ONLY ABOUT A MINUTE, BUT WITH A WING SUIT FLYERS LIKE ED CAN EXPERIENCE UP TO FOUR MINUTES OF FLIGHT TIME.  IN A WING SUIT WE'RE ACTUALLY SLOWING OURSELVES DOWN IN THE DESCENT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AND CREATING AS MUCH FORWARD SPEED AS WE CAN.  THAT FORWARD SPEED, AS HIGH AS 200 MILES PER HOUR TRANSLATES INTO LONGER HORIZONTAL DISTANCES THAT THESE HIGH-FLIERS CAN TRAVEL.  THE WING SUIT HELPS YOU COVER A LOT OF GROUND AS YOU'RE DESCENDING. SOME PEOPLE HAVE BEEN EXCEEDING 2:1 GLIDE RATIO, SOME PEOPLE 3:1. AND IT VARIES ON THE PERSON AND THEIR ABILITY. GLIDE RATIO, FOR EXAMPLE 3:1 WOULD MEAN FOR EVERY FOOT YOU DESCEND YOU'RE TRAVELING THREE FEET FORWARD.  IF A WING SUITED HERO WERE TO JUMP FROM A PLANE 13,000 FEET OVER THE STATUE OF LIBERTY, HE COULD LAND NEARLY SIX AND A HALF MILES AWAY IN THE MIDDLE OF CENTRAL PARK. TURNING FALLING INTO FLYING ALL DEPENDS ON THE SUIT. THE TYPICAL MODEL FEATURES THREE DISTINCT WEBBED SURFACES, TRANSFORMING A SKYDIVER INTO A HUMAN VERSION OF A FLYING SQUIRREL. DURING DESCENT, AIR RUSHES INTO OPENINGS IN THE WEBBING, AIDING THE AERODYNAMICS.  IF YOU LOOK AT THIS SUIT HERE, YOU HAVE AIR VENTS THAT COME IN OVER THE TOP OF THE ARMS. YOU WANT TO LOOK INSIDE THE WING, YOU CAN SEE THAT WE HAVE SEPARATE CHAMBERS FOR THE AIR TO PRESSURIZE IN.  IT'S DESIGNED TO ACTUALLY MAKE YOU FLY WHEN YOU EXIT THE PLANE. THE MATERIAL INFLATES UNDERNEATH YOUR ARMS, IN BETWEEN YOUR LEGS, AND CREATES BASICALLY AN AIR FOIL THAT YOU GLIDE ON.  AN AIR FOIL IS ANY SURFACE OR STRUCTURE THAT PROVIDES AN AIRCRAFT LIFT BY CREATING REDUCED AIR PRESSURE ABOVE IT AND INCREASED PRESSURE BELOW.  WE DESIGNED THE WING SUIT TO BE SIMILAR TO A WING. OUR BODY IS THE ACTUAL STRUCTURAL SKELETON OF THE WING SUIT. AS WE DESCEND, WE ARE MANEUVERING OUR BODY IN A WAY TO TURN THIS WING SUIT THROUGH THE AIR, SIMILAR TO THE WAY AN AIRCRAFT FLIES.  IF YOU WANT TO FLY AT THAT 200 MILE PER HOUR SPEED WE MENTIONED EARLIER, TRY THIS WING SUIT ON FOR SIZE. UNLIKE THE STANDARD MODEL, IT HAS LARGER WINGS AND HAND GRIPPERS FOR THE PILOT TO HOLD, TO ENABLE HIM TO CONTROL THE ANGLE OF THE WINGS.  THIS MODEL OF SUIT IS BUILT FOR, SPECIFICALLY, SPEED. YOU'LL NOTICE THAT THE WINGS EXTEND PAST THE FINGERTIPS AND PAST THE TOES, WITH THE SWEPT WING FOR SPEED.  SOME WING SUITS ARE TAILOR-MADE FOR ANOTHER PERFORMANCE ATTRIBUTE NO SUPER FLIER CAN DO WITHOUT, MANEUVERABILITY.  NOW THE LAST SUIT WE HAD ON WAS MADE FOR SPEED. THIS ONE IN THIS PARTICULAR DESIGN IS MADE FOR AEROBATICS. NOTICE THE CUT ON THE WING WITH NOTHING HANGING BELOW. NO GRIPPERS AND THE CUT OF THE LEG WING. THIS SUIT IS A SHORTER CUT TO ALLOW FOR FASTER TURNS. YOUR HANDS ARE FREE. YOU CAN MOVE A LOT EASIER WITH THIS SUIT.  BUT NO MATTER HOW GOOD THE AERODYNAMIC DESIGN OF THESE SUITS, THEY DON'T DO THE FLYING. THE PILOT WEARING THEM DOES.  CREATING DIFFERENT FLIGHT PATHS WITH THE WING SUIT IS AS SIMPLE AS TILTING THE SHOULDERS OR BRINGING AN ARM IN. ARCHING WILL NATURALLY MAKE YOU FALL FASTER, BUT IN THE WING SUIT WE TEND TO CUP OUR BODY CREATING THE SHAPE OF A WING TO GENERATE MORE FORWARD SPEED AND CREATE LIFT. AND THE TAIL WORKS IN THE SAME EFFECT AS A BIRD DOES. WE CAN TWIST OUR LEGS AND CREATE A PITCH WITH THE TAIL OF THE WING SUIT TO ALSO TURN US. YOU CAN DO EVERYTHING FROM FORWARD FLIPS TO HARD BANKS TO FIGURE EIGHTS AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY ROLL OVER ON YOUR BACK, CLOSE YOUR LEGS, HAVE YOUR LEGS COME OVER THE FRONT AND BE HEADING THE OTHER WAY WITHIN A MATTER OF SECONDS.  IN THE WORDS OF BUZZ LIGHTYEAR, "THAT'S FALLING WITH STYLE." BUT NO MATTER HOW MASTERFUL THE CONTROL OF ED AND OTHER WING SUIT FLYERS, THEY CAN NEVER STEER CLEAR OF DANGER.  SKYDIVING IN ITSELF IS DANGEROUS. WEARING THE WING SUIT JUST ADDS A LITTLE BIT MORE TO IT.  AND THE DANGER STARTS THE INSTANT THEY LEAP FROM THE PLANE.  WHEN YOU EXIT THE PLANE WITH A WING SUIT ON, YOU'RE ACTUALLY USING THE SPEED OF THE AIRCRAFT TO LIFT AS YOU COME OUT THE DOOR, SO YOUR AIR FOIL AS YOU COME OFF OF THE PLANE CAN ACTUALLY RAISE YOU ABOVE THE PLANE IF THE PLANE IS TRAVELING AT A FAST ENOUGH SPEED. WE WANT TO WATCH THE TAIL OF THE AIRCRAFT BECAUSE WE CAN HIT OUR HEAD ON IT. SO WHAT WE DO IS WE KEEP THE WINGS CONTAINED UNTIL WE SEE THE ACTUAL OBSTRUCTION, THE HORIZONTAL STABILIZER IN THIS CASE, PASS ABOVE OUR HEAD AND THEN WE CAN EXPAND THE WINGS OUT.  THE DANGERS MULTIPLY WHEN YOUR STARTING POINT ISN'T AN AIRCRAFT, BUT A CLIFF FACE.  THREE, TWO, ONE, SEE YA.  BASE JUMPING WITH A WING SUIT HAS DEVELOPED INTO A DIFFERENT ERA NOW, SO TO SPEAK. WHEREAS YEARS AGO, PEOPLE INTENDED TO FLY THE SUIT AWAY FROM THE WALL AS FAR AS POSSIBLE, TODAY THEY ARE FLYING THE WING SUIT NEXT TO THE WALL, VIRTUALLY SURFING THE TERRAIN OF THE WALL. AS THEY DESCEND LOWER IN ALTITUDE, THEY CARVE AWAY FROM THE WALL AND TRY AND GET AS FAR AWAY FROM THE WALL AT THAT LOWER ALTITUDE AS POSSIBLE AND THEN OPEN THE PARACHUTE.  SO WHAT'S NEXT FOR WING SUIT FLIERS? THE FUTURE OF WING SUIT FLIGHT HAS BARELY BEEN TOUCHED. THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT VARIATIONS IN MATERIALS, WHETHER IT BE A HARDER MATERIAL OR A LIGHTER MATERIAL OR SOMETHING WITH LESS DRAG.  OR MAYBE FLYING WITH ROCKET POWER LIKE IRON MAN. SWISS BIRDMAN YVES ROSSY DID JUST THAT ON SEPTEMBER 26,2008. USING THE SAME JET SUIT HE TEST PILOTED THROUGH THE ALPS, ROSSY MADE HISTORY BY LEAPING FROM A PLANE ALMOST 9,000 FEET ABOVE FRANCE AND SOARING ACROSS THE ENGLISH CHANNEL TO GREAT BRITAIN. ALL HE NEEDS NOW IS A SECRET IDENTITY AND AN EVIL NEMESIS. IF FLYING OVER THE EARTH LIKE SUPERMAN ISN'T WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR, THEN MAYBE FLYING THROUGH THE WATER LIKE AQUAMAN IS. "SUPER HUMAN" WILL RETURN ON "MODERN MARVELS."  WE NOW RETURN TO "SUPER HUMAN" ON "MODERN MARVELS."  WE NOW RETURN TO "SUPER HUMAN" ON "MODERN MARVELS." IN 2008, SPEEDO'S NEW LZR RACER SWIMSUIT HELPED MAKE MICHAEL PHELPS SUPERMAN IN THE WATER AS HE WON A RECORD SETTING EIGHT GOLD MEDALS AT THE BEIJING OLYMPICS. ON YOUR MARK [WHISTLE] HE AND MANY OTHER SWIMMERS IN BEIJING GOT A STRATEGIC ASSIST FROM SUIT DESIGNERS ADVANCING OUR PURSUIT OF AQUATIC SUPER POWERS. [WHISTLE] THIS HIGH-TECH SUIT LOWERED RACING TIMES BY NEARLY TWO PERCENT, A HUGE PLUS IN A SPORT IN WHICH CHAMPIONS AND THE ALSO-RANS CAN BE SEPARATED BY JUST HUNDREDTHS OF A SECOND.  WHEN I STAND UP ON THE BLOCK, I KNOW I'VE THE BEST SUIT ON, TO KNOW THAT YOU HAVE A FEW EXTRA HUNDREDTHS OR TENTHS TO WIN A GOLD MEDAL OR TO BREAK A WORLD RECORD, HOW CAN YOU ARGUE WITH THAT?  ACHIEVING THESE SUPER SPEEDS STARTS WITH A SPECIALLY DESIGNED FABRIC. SPEEDO TESTED MORE THAN 60 DIFFERENT TYPES OF MATERIAL BEFORE CREATING A HIGHLY COMPRESSIVE ULTRAFINE NYLON THREAD THAT REDUCED DRAG IN THE WATER. WITH THE HELP OF THESE SPECIALIZED STRANDS, DESIGNERS CREATED HIGHLY COMPRESSIVE SECTIONS THAT WERE BONDED TOGETHER IN A FORM-FITTING DESIGN.  IT'S SUPER SUPER TIGHT, BUT IT REALLY FEELS LIKE PART OF YOUR BODY WHEN YOU PUT IT ON.  THE SUIT SQUEEZES THE SWIMMER'S BODY HOLDING THEIR CORE AB AND BACK MUSCLES IN A CORSET-LIKE GRIP ALLOWING THE SWIMMER TO MAINTAIN PERFECT BODY POSITION WITHOUT RESTRICTING THE FULL RANGE OF MOTION THAT A SWIMMER NEEDS TO SLICE THROUGH THE WATER. BUT EVEN WITH THESE HIGH-TECH SUITS, HUMANS ARE RELATIVELY POOR SWIMMERS. WE CONVERT ROUGHLY ONLY THREE PERCENT OF OUR KICKS AND STROKES INTO FORWARD MOTION WHILE DOLPHINS AND OTHER SEA SWIMMERS CONVERT NEARLY EIGHTY PERCENT. BUT TED CIAMILLO AND HIS TEAM OF ENGINEERS IN NICHOLSON, GEORGIA HAVE DESIGNED A SPECIAL SWIM FIN THAT CAN MAKE US ALL SUPERMEN IN THE WATER.  I WAS DRAWN TO MOVING QUICKER UNDERWATER-- JUST BEEN THERE, DONE THAT WITH SCUBA DIVING AND WANTED SOMETHING A BIT MORE EXCITING.  THIS TOOL IS GOING TO MAKE YOU FEEL WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO CRUISE THE OCEAN LIKE A WHALE. IT MAKES YOU A SUPER SWIMMER. IT ENABLES YOU TO REACH SPEED AT WHICH YOU COULDN'T EVEN THINK OF GOING WITHOUT IT.  THEY CALL IT THE LUNOCET AND IT CAN PROPEL A SWIMMER AS FAST AS EIGHT MILES PER HOUR, TWICE THE SPEED OF MICHAEL PHELPS. THE LUNOCET PRODUCES 140 POUNDS OF THRUST, THE EQUIVALENT OF A 12-HORSEPOWER MOTOR. A CONVENTIONAL SWIM FIN PRODUCES ONLY ABOUT 40 POUNDS OF THRUST.  WHEN YOU'RE SWIMMING WITH A CONVENTIONAL SWIM FIN AND YOU'RE IN THE POWER STROKE, WHICH IS A DOWN STROKE, WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS YOU'RE USING THE WATER PRESSURE TO FLEX THE BLADE TO THE PROPER ANGLE OF ATTACK AND WHAT YOU END UP WITH IS A VERY SMALL PORTION OF THE FIN THAT'S ACTUALLY CONTRIBUTING TO THRUST AND A LARGE PORTION OF THE FIN IS WASTE.  SEEKING A SOLUTION, TED AND HIS COLLEAGUES STUDIED DOLPHINS AND WHALES, MUCH LIKE THE WRIGHT BROTHERS STUDIED BIRDS.  THEY WERE LEARNING FROM NATURE'S WISDOM AND TRYING TO REPLICATE WHAT NATURE WAS DOING WITH FLIGHT AND HERE I AM LITTLE OVER A HUNDRED YEARS LATER, AND I'M STUDYING WHALES AND DOLPHINS, TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE A MAN SWIM FASTER. WE'RE TAKING THE GEOMETRY AND NATURE'S SOLUTIONS, THE WHALE'S SWIMMING MORPHOLOGY, WE'RE REPLICATING THAT IN THE LUNOCET AND WE'RE CREATING A PROPULSOR, A SWIMMING DEVICE THAT ALLOWS YOU TO SWIM MORE EFFICIENTLY.  THAT EFFICIENCY HINGES ON THE LUNOCET'S ABILITY TO PIVOT INSTEAD OF MERELY FLEXING, THEREBY BETTER MIMICKING THE FINS OF WHALES AND DOLPHINS.  THE LUNOCET IS A VERY RIGID PIECE OF EQUIPMENT COMPARED TO A TRADITIONAL FIN. IT DOESN'T FLEX PER SE, IT PIVOTS ON TWO PITCH AXLES AND BY DOING THIS, IT MAKES IT THAT MUCH MORE EFFICIENT.  BUT EVEN MORE CRUCIAL TO THE LUNOCET'S DESIGN IS ITS CONTOURED WING-LIKE SHAPE.  THE LUNOCET HAS A FOIL THAT PITCHES ABOUT A PITCH AXLE AND WHAT YOU HAVE UNLIKE THE CONVENTIONAL SWIM FINS IS AN IDEAL ANGLE OF ATTACK OVER THE ENTIRE FOIL SURFACE.  THE LUNOCET GENERATES THRUST THROUGH THE WATER MUCH LIKE AN AIRCRAFT PROPELLER GENERATES IT IN THE AIR. THE PROPELLER BLADE'S WING-SHAPED DESIGN CREATES LOW AIR PRESSURE ON ONE SIDE OF THE BLADE AND HIGH PRESSURE ON THE OTHER TO DRIVE THE PLANE FORWARD. THE LUNOCET ACTS THE SAME WAY UNDER WATER, BUT INSTEAD OF SPINNING LIKE A PROPELLER IT PIVOTS UP AND DOWN IN A FLAPPING MOTION TO PUSH THE SWIMMER FORWARD. AS EFFICIENT AS THE LUNOCET IS, THE SWIMMER USING IT HAS TO ADOPT AN UNUSUAL MOTION TO TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF ITS DESIGN. TO ACHIEVE THE PROPER ANGLE OF ATTACK AND YOUR SUPER SPEED YOU HAVE TO ROLL IN A SERIES OF WAVE-LIKE BENDS.  YOUR CORE MUSCLE TRIGGER THE MOVEMENT AND THEN THE REST OF YOUR BODY FOLLOWS IN AN UNDULATION.  AT FIRST IT SEEMS AWKWARD AND THEN IT BECOMES REALLY QUICKLY A NATURAL MOVEMENT BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT YOUR BODY WANTS TO DO. THE AUTOMATIC RESPONSE IS TRYING TO REPRODUCE A MARINE MAMMAL MOVEMENT, WHICH IS A DOLPHIN KICK.  AND ONCE WE START SWIMMING AS FAST AS THE DOLPHINS, WE JUST MIGHT BE ABLE TO PULL OFF ONE OF THEIR SIGNATURE TRICKS.  I THINK AT THE END OF A DAY WE'RE GOING TO HAVE HUMANS JUMPING OUT OF THE WATER GETTING COMPLETE AIR.  I THINK THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING TO BE LUCKY ENOUGH TO GET A LUNOCET ON THEIR FEET ARE GOING TO EXPERIENCE SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT. THIS IS AS GOOD AS GOING TO SPACE. WE HAVE AN ENVIRONMENT HERE ON EARTH THAT IS EXACTLY LIKE THE OUTER SPACE AND THE BEAUTY OF IT IS THAT ANY OF US CAN ACCESS IT THE WAY MARINE MAMMAL ACCESS IT.  WHILE SOME ARE MIMICKING NATURE TO BECOME SUPER SWIMMERS OTHERS ARE USING TECHNOLOGY TO TAKE A GIANT LEAP FOR MANKIND. "SUPER HUMAN" WILL RETURN ON "MODERN MARVELS."  WE NOW RETURN TO "SUPER HUMAN" ON "MODERN MARVELS." [MUSIC] INVENTOR JEFF JAY IS ADVANCING OUR QUEST FOR SUPERPOWERS BY PUTTING A NEW SPRING IN OUR STEPS. [MUSIC] HIS BRAINCHILD, VELOCITY MOTION STILTS, IS THE NEXT BEST THING TO STEVE AUSTIN'S BIONIC LEGS.  A VELOCITY MOTION STILT IS BASICALLY BUILT FOR MOMENTUM. IT ACCENTUATES WHAT THE HUMAN BODY ALREADY DOES IN A DIRECTION. THE VELOCITY MOTION STILT BASICALLY IS DESIGNED SO THAT YOU CAN PERFORM IN IT.  JUST START BY-- JUST PUT ALL YOUR WEIGHT ON THE ONE SPRING, JUST KEEP IT CENTERED OVER TOP OF THIS ONE SPRING.  JEFF'S CLIENTELE CONSISTS MAINLY OF ACROBATS AND STILT PERFORMERS LIKE LUCAS MENDONCA, WHO JUMP AT THE CHANCE TO PAY THE 2,000 DOLLAR PRICE FOR ONE PAIR.  IT IS REALLY REALLY FUN TO JUMP UP BECAUSE LIKE, LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE ON THE MOON, YOU KNOW, THAT FEELING LIKE, "IT'S REALLY GOOD."  USING THE STILTS, JAY HAS BEEN ABLE TO SUSTAIN A SPEED OF 23 MILES AN HOUR, THE SAME PACE AS OLYMPIC CLASS SPRINTERS COVERING THE SAME DISTANCE. AND HE HAS LEAPED AS HIGH AS 16 FEET.  THIS IS DEFINITELY THE LAMBORGHINI OF STILTS RIGHT HERE.  THESE HIGH-FLYING STILTS HAVE ONLY TWO MOVING PARTS. BUT THEY MASTERFULLY HARNESS THE USER'S WEIGHT TO GENERATE THE STILTS' POWER.  THE REAL ENERGY COMES FROM THESE SPRINGS THAT ARE LOCATED IN THE BACK. SO, IF HE BOUNCES ON TWO FEET, YOU CAN SEE THE FLEXION IN THE SPRING RIGHT IN HERE. IF HE BOUNCES ON ONE FOOT, YOU CAN SEE HOW THE SPRING LOADS A LOT MORE AND THE DIFFERENCE BEING IS THAT ALL OF HIS BODY WEIGHT NOW IS ON ONE SPRING SO IT IS EASIER TO BLOW THROUGH THE PRELOAD TO GET THE ACTUAL LOAD, SO IF GOES BACK TO TWO FEET NOW HE HAS TO BOUNCE TWICE AS HARD TO GET THE SAME SPRING.  MUCH LIKE A POGO STICK, EACH STILT CHANNELS THE WEIGHT OF THE USER, PUSHING DOWN THE SPRING AND LOADING IT WITH POTENTIAL ENERGY, AS THE SPRING RECOILS, IT RELEASES THAT ENERGY AND PUSHES THE USER UP.  THE MORE PRESSURE THAT YOU PUT INTO THE SPRINGS, THE MORE RETURN YOU'RE GOING TO GET OUT OF THE SPRINGS.  AND THAT RETURNING PRESSURE CAN BE AS MUCH AS 900 POUNDS PER SQUARE INCH. THAT'S SIX TIMES GREATER THAN THE FORCE OF WATER SPEWING FROM A FIREHOSE. CONTAINING ENERGY THAT HIGH DEMANDS SUPER STRONG WORKING MATERIALS.  THE MATERIAL THAT WE USE IS A HIGH-GRADE ALUMINUM. THE SPRING TYPICALLY IS MADE OUT OF E-GLASS, WHICH IS KIND OF GLASS THAT THEY USED TO MAKE OLD HELICOPTER BLADES OUT OF. IT HAS A HUGE AMOUNT OF PLIABILITY.  JAY SAYS LEARNING TO RUN AND JUMP ON THESE SUPER KANGAROO LEGS IS EASIER THAN YOU MIGHT THINK.  THE NORMAL LEARNING CURVE IS ABOUT 10 MINUTES TO BE ABLE TO JUST KIND OF WALK AROUND, BE COMFORTABLE WITH A SMALL JOG, SOME LITTLE HOPS, THINGS LIKE THAT. WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO IS GET YOURSELF BACK IN THE MINDSET OF, I'M JUST A TALL PERSON AND I NEED TO TAKE STRIDES AND WORK LIKE A TALL PERSON BIOMECHANICALLY AND THEN I ALSO HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT MY FOCUS IS AROUND, NOT AT THE GROUND, BECAUSE TYPICALLY YOU DON'T WALK AROUND LOOKING STRAIGHT DOWN.  WHY ARE YOU LOOKING DOWN? THAT'S ONE.  LOOK TOO OFTEN AT THE GROUND AND THAT IS WHERE YOU'LL END UP. AND ONCE YOU'RE THERE, HOW DO YOU GET BACK UP?  WHAT I TYPICALLY DO IS JUST TEACH PEOPLE TO GET ON THEIR ELBOWS, STRADDLE THEIR LEGS SLIGHTLY AND KIND OF WALK THEMSELVES UP AND THEN STAND UP.  PUSH  HE'S UP.  IN THE BEGINNING, IS REALLY LIKE AWKWARD WALKING, BECAUSE YOUR BODY DOESN'T RESPOND. BUT AFTER YOU WALK AND HAVE SOME HELP, YOU START FEELING REALLY FINE WALKING AROUND AND YOU JUST WANNA LIKE, TRY TO JUMP HIGHER AND HIGHER, SEE WHAT IT CAN DO, HOW HIGH YOU CAN GET.  GOOD JOB.  BUT JEFF'S NOT STOPPING WITH THESE SUPER STILTS; HE'S ENVISIONING AN ENHANCED VERSION THAT WON'T MAKE THE USER WORK SO HARD. HIS CURRENT MODEL REQUIRES 100 PERCENT EFFORT TO RUN AT 23 MILES PER HOUR. HIS NEW ONE WOULD GET YOU UP TO SPEED WITHOUT EVEN RAISING YOUR PULSE RATE.  THIS WILL ALLOW YOU TO USE 20 PERCENT, 25 PERCENT OF YOUR ENERGY TO RUN 25 MILES AN HOUR, SO BASICALLY THE STILT IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO RUN FOR YOU.  AS JEFF ADVANCES OUR QUEST FOR SUPER-POWERED LEGS, WHAT ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF BIONIC ARMS 500 TIMES STRONGER THAN OUR OWN, OR A SHIRT THAT CAN HELP YOU LIFT A CAR. AT THE NANOTECH INSTITUTE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT DALLAS, SCIENTISTS ARE TAKING THE FIRST STEPS TO MAKE THESE SUPER HUMAN FANTASIES COME TRUE. ONE OF THEIR DEVELOPMENTS IS A SUPER STRONG ARTIFICIAL MUSCLE, WORTHY OF THE SIX MILLION DOLLAR MAN.  MANY MEN CAN LIFT 200 POUNDS. IF THEY HAD THE STRENGTH OF OUR ARTIFICIAL MUSCLES THAT WE'VE INVENTED, THEY COULD LIFT 500 TIMES THAT AMOUNT OR ABOUT 50 TONS.  THE ARTIFICIAL MUSCLE PROFESSOR BAUGHMEN JUST MENTIONED IS A SPRING-SHAPED ALLOY OF METALS LIKE NICKEL AND TITANIUM FUELED BY METHANOL. WONDERING HOW IT AT ALL WORKS? THE COILED WIRE HAS A COATING OF TINY PLATINUM PARTICLES. THE METHANOL IS RELEASED INTO THE AIR SURROUNDING THE WIRE. ACTING AS A CATALYST, THE PLATINUM ENABLES THE METHANOL TO REACT WITH THE AIR'S OXYGEN, HEATING THE WIRE. THE HEAT MAKES THE WIRE CONTRACT JUST LIKE A HUMAN MUSCLE.  WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE IN THIS SIMPLE DEMONSTRATION IS THAT THE FUEL, METHANOL IS EVAPORATING. IF THE ARM IS LOWER, CLOSER TO THE METHANOL, THE METHANOL COMBINES WITH THE OXYGEN IN ORDER TO CAUSE A CONTRACTION, WHICH LIFTS THE ARM. ON THE OTHER HAND, WHEN THE ARM IS LIFTED FAR AWAY FROM THE METHANOL THEN IT NO LONGER HAS SUFFICIENT METHANOL TO STAY WARM AND IT DROPS DOWN.  WITHIN EVEN A FEW YEARS, THESE SUPER POWERED MUSCLES COULD BE USED TO IMPROVE ANYTHING FROM ROBOTS TO PROSTHETIC LIMBS.  TODAY'S ROBOTIC DEVICES AND PROSTHETIC LIMBS UTILIZE ORDINARY MOTORS AND HYDRAULIC SYSTEMS. ARTIFICIAL MUSCLES THAT WE'VE INVENTED ARE MORE LIKE NATURAL MUSCLE. FOR THOSE THAT NEED SUPER POWER STRENGTH WITHOUT THE METAL MAKEOVER, THE EXPERTS AT THE NANOTECH INSTITUTE ARE DEVELOPING ARTIFICIAL MUSCLES THAT CAN BE WOVEN INTO CLOTHING. THEIR TEXTILE FIBERS ARE MADE FROM CARBON NANOTUBES. EACH CAN BE SMALLER THAN 1/10,000th THE DIAMETER OF A TYPICAL HUMAN HAIR, BUT 50 TIMES STRONGER THAN A TYPICAL HUMAN MUSCLE.  CARBON NANOTUBES ARE LIKE MINUTE CYLINDERS OF CARBON. SEAMLESS CYLINDERS OF CARBON, BUT THEY HAVE A DIAMETER THAT CAN BE AS SMALL AS ONE NANOMETER. TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF THE SIZE OF A NANOMETER, THINK OF THE SIZE OF A MARBLE TO THE DIAMETER OF THE WORLD THAT'S THE RATIO OF ONE NANOMETER TO ONE METER.  MAKING THESE MINI-FIBERS BLESSED WITH MAXIMUM STRENGTH BEGINS AS THE SCIENTIST BURN HYDROCARBON MOLECULES AT NEARLY 1,300 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT OVER A CATALYST MATERIAL MADE OF IRON. AS THE GAS BURNS, CARBON RESIDUE COLLECTS ON THE CATALYST, GROWING A DENSE FOREST OF CARBON NANOTUBES ON A FLEXIBLE METAL SHEET.  IF YOU'LL THINK OF A FOREST, IT'S JUST A LOT OF TREES ALL STANDING UPRIGHT, SO WHEN WE PULL THESE SHEETS, WHAT YOU DO IS YOU TAKE SOMETHING THAT'S STICKY, YOU TOUCH THE END OF FOREST AND AS YOU PULL, IN OTHER WORDS, YOU'RE PULLING THESE TREES DOWN. BUT AS THEY'RE FALLING OVER THEY STILL MAKE CONTACT WITH THE OTHER ONES SO THEY ARE STICKING TO EACH OTHER. THE AMOUNT OF MATERIAL THAT YOU CAN PULL FROM THIS IS REALLY LARGE.  FOR EVERY CENTIMETER OF NANOTUBE FOREST NEARLY FOUR METERS OF THIS ULTRA-LIGHT YARN CAN BE SPUN.  WHEN YOU FIRST PULL THESE CARBON NANOTUBES FROM THE FOREST IT COMES OUT IN A SHEET PRESENTATION, BUT THEN YOU ATTACH THE END OF THAT TO A SPINDLE WHICH IS SPINNING AND TWISTS IT, SO NOW YOU HAVE A YARN.  THE CHALLENGE THE UNIVERSITY SCIENTISTS ARE WORKING ON NOW IS WEAVING THESE ULTRA-LIGHT SUPER STRONG YARNS INTO A SUPER SUIT AS EFFECTIVE AS SARCOS' EXOSKELETON. SUCH HIGH-TECH COULD RE-EMPOWER THOSE WHO HAVE LOST LIMBS, BUT ANOTHER BOLD NEW INNOVATION COULD ONE DAY GIVE THEM THE POWER TO REGROW THEM. "SUPER HUMAN" WILL RETURN ON "MODERN MARVELS." [MUSIC]  WE NOW RETURN TO "SUPER HUMAN" ON "MODERN MARVELS." THOUSANDS OF SOLDIERS HAVE BEEN WOUNDED IN IRAQ. AND NEARLY SIX PERCENT REQUIRED AMPUTATION, A RATE DOUBLE THAT OF ANY PREVIOUS U.S. WAR. THE ONLY OPTION THESE SOLDIERS AND OTHER AMPUTEES HAVE IS PROSTHETICS. BUT SCIENTISTS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH'S MCGOWAN INSTITUTE ARE TAKING THE FIRST STEPS TOWARD A SUPER HUMAN ALTERNATIVE. USING ANIMAL ORGAN TISSUE, THEY'RE DEVELOPING REVOLUTIONARY BIOTECHNOLOGY THAT MIGHT ONE DAY ENABLE PEOPLE TO REGROW LOST LIMBS. THEIR EXPERTISE IS CALLED REGENERATIVE MEDICINE.  REGENERATIVE MEDICINE IS THE SCIENCE OF LEARNING HOW TO BASICALLY GROW BODY PARTS. THE KEY TOOL IN REGENERATIVE MEDICINE IS CALLED EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX OR ECM. IT'S AN ORGANIC MATERIAL VIRTUALLY IDENTICAL IN ALL ANIMAL ORGANS THAT FORMS THE FRAMEWORK THAT HOLDS THE ORGANS' CELLS TOGETHER.  EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX IS LITERALLY HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF STRUCTURAL AND FUNCTIONAL PROTEINS. ALL THESE THINGS ARE ARRANGED IN A VERY UNIQUE THREE DIMENSIONAL ORGANIZATION AND BOTH THE THREE DIMENSIONAL ARCHITECTURE OF THE MATRIX AS WELL AS THE INDIVIDUAL MOLECULES OR COMPONENTS OF IT ARE IMPORTANT IN ACHIEVING WOUND HEALING RESULT THAT IS MORE REGENERATIVE THAN SCARRING. WE COLLECT DISCARDED MATERIAL AS A BYPRODUCT OF THE AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY AND WE TAKE THE TISSUE, BRING IT BACK TO THE LABORATORY, AND THEN WE REMOVE THE CELLS FROM THE TISSUE, LEAVING ONLY THE EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX.  SCIENTISTS THEN WASH THE ECM IN PERACETIC ACID FOR TWO HOURS TO DISINFECT IT. IT'S THEN DRIED AND CAN BE FORMED INTO VARIOUS SHAPES.  IF WE GET IT FROM THE DERMIS AND THE SKIN IT LOOKS LIKE A SHEET. WE CAN TURN THE MATRIX INTO A VERY FINE POWDER THAT CAN BE SUSPENDED IN WATER OR SOME OTHER CARRIER THAT CAN BE INJECTED.  WHEN THE EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX IS APPLIED TO THE DAMAGED AREA, IT BONDS WITH THE BODY'S NATURAL HEALING AGENTS AND PROMOTES NORMAL REGROWTH RATHER THAN SCARRING. WE CAN LITERALLY SPRINKLE IT ON AN OPEN WOUND SITE AND GET A VERY RAPID RESPONSE TO THE COMPONENTS OF THE MATRIX THAT ARE THERE.  COULD THIS BE THE FIRST SMALL STEP TOWARD A NEW AGE OF SUPER HUMANS ABLE TO REGENERATE NOT JUST SURFACE TISSUE, BUT ALSO BONE AND COMPLEX ORGANS.  THE FIELD OF REGENERATIVE MEDICINE WOULD HAVE AN ULTIMATE GOAL OF BEING ABLE TO GROW ANY BODY PART FOR REPLACEMENT IN A PATIENT THAT NEEDS IT. YOU NEED A HEART? LET'S BUILD YOU A HEART, YOU LOST A LIMB WE'LL TEACH YOU HOW TO REGROW YOUR LIMB. IF REGENERATIVE MEDICINE IS SUCCESSFUL, IT WILL RESULT IN A PARADIGM SHIFT IN THE WAY THAT MEDICINE IS PRACTICED.  AND PERHAPS THE SUPER POWER TO GROW LOST LIMBS FOR EVERYONE.  WHAT'S OUR NEXT LEAP IN OUR QUEST TO BE SUPER HUMAN? [WHISTLE] TIME AND TECHNOLOGY WILL TELL. WHATEVER THE FUTURE HOLDS, THE SEARCH ITSELF IS A SUPER RIDE. CAPTIONING PERFORMED BY PEOPLESUPPORT TRANSCRIPTION AND CAPTIONING
