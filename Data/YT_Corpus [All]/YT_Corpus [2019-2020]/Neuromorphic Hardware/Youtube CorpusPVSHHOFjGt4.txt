 neuromorphic engineering also known as neuromorphic computing is a concept developed by Carver Mead in the late 1980s describing the use of very large-scale integration VLSI systems containing electronic analog circuits to mimic neurobiological architectures present in the nervous system in recent times the term neuromorphic has been used to describe analog digital mixed-mode analog digital VLSI and software systems that implement models of neural systems for perception motor control or multi-sensory integration the implementation of neuromorphic computing on the hardware level can be realized by oxide based memristors spintronic memories threshold switches and transistors a key aspect of neuromorphic engineering is understanding how the morphology of individual neurons circuits applications and overall architectures creates desirable computations effects how information is represented influences robustness to damage incorporates learning and development adapts to local change plasticity and facilitates evolutionary change neuromorphic engineering is an interdisciplinary subject that takes inspiration from biology physics mathematics computer science and electronic engineering to design artificial neural systems such as vision systems head eye systems auditory processes and autonomous robots whose physical architecture and design principles are based on those are biological nervous systems topic examples as early as 2006 researchers at Georgia Tech published a field programmable neural array this chip was the first in a line of increasingly complex arrays of floating gate transistors that allowed programmability of charge on the gates of MOSFETs to model the channel ion characteristics of neurons in the brain and was one of the first cases of a silicon programmable array of neurons in November 2011 a group of MIT researchers created a computer chip that mimics the analog ion based communication in a synapse between two neurons using 400 transistors and standard CMOS manufacturing techniques in June 2012 spintronic researchers at Purdue presented a paper on design of a neuromorphic chip using lateral spin valves and memristors they argue that the architecture works similarly to neurons and can therefore be used to test methods of reproducing the brains processing in addition these chips are significantly more energy efficient than conventional ones research at HP labs on Mott memristors has shown that while they can be non-volatile the volatile behavior exhibited at temperatures significantly below the phase transition temperature can be exploited to fabricate an Aristo a biologically inspired device that mimics behavior found in neurons in September 2013 they presented models and simulations that show how the spiking behavior of these nura stirs can be used to form the components required for a Turing machine NeuroGrid built by brains in silicon at stanford university is an example of hardware designed using neuromorphic engineering principles the circuit board is composed of 16 custom-designed chips referred to as neuro cause each neuro cause analog circuitry is designed to emulate neural elements for 65,536 neurons maximizing energy efficiency the emulated neurons are connected using digital circuitry designed to maximize spiking throughput a research project with implications for neuromorphic engineering is the human brain project that is attempting to simulate a complete human brain in a supercomputer using biological data it is made up of a group of researchers in neuroscience medicine and computing Henry Markram the project's co-director has stated that the project proposes to establish a foundation to explore and understand the brain in its diseases and to use that knowledge to build new computing technologies the three primary goals of the project are to better understand how the pieces of the brain fit and work together to understand how to objectively diagnose and treat brain diseases and to use the understanding of the human brain to develop neuromorphic computers that the simulation of a complete human brain will require a supercomputer a thousand times more powerful than today's encourages the current focus on neuromorphic computers 1.3 billion dollars has been allocated to the project by the european commission other research with implications for neuromorphic engineering involves the brain initiative in the TrueNorth chip from IBM near amore devices have also been demonstrated using nano crystals nano wires and conducting polymers Intel unveiled its neuromorphic research chip called Loihi in October 2017 the chip uses an asynchronous spiking neural network snn to implement adaptive self-modifying event-driven fine-grained parallel computations used to implement learning and inference with high efficiency brain chip Holdings will release an N SOC neuromorphic system-on-chip processor called Akita in late 2019 topic ethical considerations while the interdisciplinary concept of neuromorphic engineering is relatively new many of the same ethical considerations apply to neuromorphic systems as apply to human-like machines and artificial intelligence in general however the fact that neuromorphic systems are designed to mimic a human brain gives rise to unique ethical questions surrounding their usage topic democratic concerns significant ethical limitations may be placed on neuromorphic engineering due to public perception special Eurobarometer 382 public attitudes towards robots a survey conducted by the European Commission found that 60% of European Union citizens wanted a ban of robots in the care of children the elderly or the disabled furthermore 34% were in favor of a ban on robots in education 27% in health care and 20% in leisure the European Commission classifies these areas as notably human the report cites increased public concern with robots that are able to mimic or replicate human functions neuromorphic engineering by definition is designed to replicate a human function the function of the human brain the democratic concerns surrounding neuromorphic engineering are likely to become even more profound in the future the European Commission found that EU citizens between the ages of 15 and 24 are more likely to think of robots as human-like as opposed to instrument like then he used citizens over the age of 55 when presented an image of a robot that had been defined as human-like 75% of EU citizens aged 15 to 24 said it corresponded with the idea they had of robots while only 57% of EU citizens over the age of 55 responded the same way the human-like nature of neuromorphic systems therefore could place them in the categories of robots many EU citizens would like to see banned in the future topic personhood as neuromorphic systems have become increasingly advanced some scholars have advocated for granting personhood rights to these systems if the brain is what grants humans their personhood to what extent as a neuromorphic system have to mimic the human brain to be granted personhood rights critics of technology development in the human brain project which aims to advance brain inspired computing have argued that advancement in neuromorphic computing could lead to machine consciousness or personhood if these systems are to be treated as people critics argue then many tasks humans perform using neuromorphic systems including the act of termination of neuromorphic systems may be morally impermissible as these acts would violate the autonomy of the neuromorphic systems however skeptics of this position have argued that there is no way to apply the electronic personhood the concept of personhood that would apply to neuromorphic technology legally in a letter signed by 285 experts in law robotics medicine and ethics opposing a European Commission proposal to recognise smart robots as legal persons the authors write a legal status for a robot can't derive from the natural person model since the robot would then hold human rights such as the right to dignity the right to its integrity the right to remuneration or the right to citizenship thus directly confronting the human rights this would be in contradiction with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the Convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms topic I and property rights there is significant legal debate around property rights and artificial intelligence in a co h is Pty Limited v you caught Pty Limited just as Christopher Jessup of the Federal Court of Australia found that the source code for material safety data sheets could not be copyrighted as it was generated by a software interface rather than a human author the same question may apply to neuromorphic systems if a neuromorphic system successfully mimics a human brain and produces a piece of original work who if anyone should be able to claim ownership of the work topic neuro memory stiff systems neuro memory stiff systems are a subclass of neuromorphic computing systems that focus on the use of memristors to implement neuroplasticity while neuromorphic engineering focuses on mimicking biological behavior neuro memory stiff systems focus on abstraction for example a neuro memory stiff system may replace the details of a cortical micro circuits behavior with an abstract neural network model there exist several neuron inspired threshold logic functions implemented with memristors that have applications in high-level pattern recognition applications some of the applications reported recently include speech recognition face recognition and object recognition they also find applications in replacing conventional digital logic gates for ideal passive memory stiff circuits it is possible to derive a differential equation for evolution of the internal memory of the circuit D D T W equals alpha W minus 1 beta I plus XI
