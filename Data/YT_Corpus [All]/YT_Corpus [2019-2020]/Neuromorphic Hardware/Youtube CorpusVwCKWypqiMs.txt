 a physical neural network is a type of artificial neural network in which an electrically adjustable resistance material is used to emulate the function of a neural synaptic 'el neural network is used to emphasize the reliance on physical hardware used to emulate neurons as opposed to software based approaches which simulate neural networks more generally the term is applicable to other artificial neural networks in which a memristor or other electrically adjustable resistance material is used to emulate a neural synaptic topic types of physical neural networks topic a da Li ne in the 1960s Bernhard Widow and Ted Hoff developed a da Li any adaptive linear neuron which used electrochemical cells called meme' stirs memory resistors to emulate sine APS's of an artificial neuron the meme' stirs were implemented as three terminal devices operating based on the reversible electroplating of copper such that the resistance between two of the terminals is controlled by the integral of the current applied via the third terminal the ad al ine circuitry was briefly commercialized by the mem astir corporation in the 1960s enabling some applications in pattern recognition however since the memo stirs were not fabricated using integrated circuit fabrication techniques the technology was not scalable and was eventually abandoned the solid-state electronics became mature topic physical neural network Alex Nugent describes a physical neural network as one or more nonlinear neuron like nodes used to some signals in nano connections formed from nano particles nano wires or nanotubes which determine the signal strength input to the nodes alignment or self-assembly of the Nano connections is determined by the history of the applied electric field performing a function analogous to neural synaptic numerous applications for such physical neural networks are possible for example a temporal summation device can be composed of one or more nano connections having an input and an output thereof wherein an input signal provided to the input causes one or more of the nano connection to experience an increase in connection strength thereof over time another example of a physical neural network is taught by US Patent Number seven million thirty nine thousand six hundred and nineteen entitled utilized nanotechnology apparatus using a neural network a solution and a connection gap which issued to Alex Nugent by the US Patent and Trademark Office on May 2nd 2006 a further application of physical neural network is shown in u.s. patent number seven million four hundred and twelve thousand four hundred and twenty eight entitled application of hebbian and anti hebbian learning to nano technology based physical neural networks which issued on August 12 2008 Nugent and Moltar have shown that Universal computing and general-purpose machine learning are possible from operations available through simple memory stiff circuits operating the HAR plasticity rule more recently it has been argued that complex purely memory stiff circuits can serve as neural networks topic phase change neural network in 2002 Stanford or schinsky described an analog neural computing medium in which phase change material has the ability to cumulatively respond to multiple input signals an electrical alteration of the resistance of the phase change material is used to control the weighting of the input signals topic memory Steve neural network greg slider' of HP Labs describes a system of cortical computing with memory Steve nanodevices the memristors memory resistors are implemented by thin film materials in which the resistance is electrically tuned via the transport of ions or oxygen vacancies within the film DARPA's synapse project has funded IBM research and HP Labs in collaboration with the Boston University department of cognitive and neural systems CNS to develop neuromorphic architectures which may be based on memory stuff systems topic C also ái accelerator brain simulation neuromorphic engineering optical neural network quantum neural network
