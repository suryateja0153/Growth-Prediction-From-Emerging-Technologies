 [Music] [Music] concept concept that with devices ever increasing and it was also shown very nice do you wanna be sometimes Randy's course on supercomputers which have on the order of megawatts orders of magnitude larger than what are very much so as hell subside I'm appointed primarily the nuclear size an engineering department so on one hand I don't like this because it's not sustainable right but on the other hand in all those loops I can eat one model of a reactor to go with each artificial service over to run a scale I mean that's good for nuclear energy so come up with materials and devices that can reduce this power consumption at large scale computations that we can use analog resistance which is to emulate synaptic behavior with lower energy consumption and these are units where the conductance states can represent the moon we can achieve multiple conducting states depending on the electrical history that we apply on these units and they also allow computation in memory and here is one example where oxide based resistive switch units could mimic synaptic response in the context of spike timing-dependent plasticity and you can see spike timing versus the conductance change of a biological neuron and the same behavior represented by this resistive switch that was based on hafnium this system so there is really exciting development in this field in using these solid state materials to emulate synaptic behavior and I will go into explaining what type of different transistor switches we can deal with but if you are in this field we should be aware of what targets we are going toward right so this plot this table was also brought up by g1 if you missed it or if you haven't seen this paper I really recommend that you review it even if you don't understand most of the paper there is a very nice section at the end that summarizes the sensitivity to all of these important parameters in terms of the reliability of the training and these include the voltages that the voltage limits that you should apply the resistance limits the number of states that you should obtain the variability that you can tolerate as well as the symmetry in the potentiation and depression curves so this tolerance I will come back to in terms of the variability challenge later all right so that is the target for any type of resistive switch system that we can work on an advanced I just want to give a summary first and this concept was introduced by G 1 where electrochemically u subject metals to redox and you can elect to migrate them to a solid electrolyte and you literally form dendrites and if these dendrites bridge the top and bottom electrode you form a conductive bridge a conductive metal filament similarly in insulating metal oxides you can electro chemically activate oxygen to move into a top electrode or into a metal electrode from the oxide and this could be aerial or also locally finger mentoring and oxygen vacancies left behind if they have electronic states that dope the oxide that can give rise to dokgo conducting channels as well ok and we also deal with phase change materials where Joule heating that we electrically supply gives rise to phase change that allows for metal insulating transitions and these are most of them as they conventionally studied mechanisms in literature and more recently there is also interest that we are also highly interested in in a new word type of resistive switching mechanism and that is based on electrochemical doping of cations into an oxide that changes its conductance upon such cation doping we call this intercalation modulated conductivity again electrochemistry is involved that you take cations form a reservoir pass them through an electronically insulating electrolyte and stuff them into an active oxide that changes its conductance back so I will first talk about our work in this domain and we have also heard a really instructive nice lecture this morning from Professor phim on the importance of small cations that are vital for the signal transmission in the biological synapses in particular calcium potassium sodium so we know how to move such small metal cations electrochemically in liquid which is okay here we are dealing with a liquid electrolyte soft tissue but this is not quite the most compatible but we also know how to move electro chemically this small device small cations in solid state materials just like batteries that that Jennifer also mentioned this morning so we can work with protons lithium sodium calcium magnesium they all have electrolytes that they can pass during solid state and can be implemented as an electrochemical neuromorphic device that can emulate synaptic function in theory this is possible for all of it all of these more cabinets we have chosen the proton to start with and we like proton compared to the other ions that I would mention in the next line so that's what we will call the proton synapse and in this work I collaborate with Julie together with our joint postdoc Shan Hui Yau on the materials and macro scale devices and also with esos Dalai Lama and his postdoc when ji-hoon in scaling down these devices and electrical characterization so small cation intercalation neuromorphic behavior this has been demonstrated in the literature in the past few years and has taken quite a bit of attention including our group and here is one such work where proton intercalation in the tungsten oxide is accomplished but nevertheless by using hydrolysis of water which requires a lot of energy and you also don't want to work with water in an in solid-state device so it's interesting behavior but not quite we have seen the sitter shift from Jennifer's presentation where you run a solid state battery and the lien insertion and extraction from a cathode material gives rise to conductance changes in a three terminal device and this was also advanced with different types of materials from the IBM Group recently which is promising in itself as long as it is able to maintain this space and there is this proton example again from a couple of years ago where proton insertion and extraction from organic electrodes gives rise to contacts conductance changes that could be used to emulate synaptic behavior okay so this is good protons but organic materials this is also good protons but water and our goal is to continue with protons although challenging as they are because they pretty much present the smallest ionic radii among all the small cations that we can deal with which means they should impart the least structural disruption which is important for the stability of the material and the device and again due to that size they have very high diffusivity which would translate to faster of operating speeds as well as lower energy cost okay so the challenge is how can we come up with a solid-state device that is proton based and for that we must use a solid hydrogen source okay so the idea would be we use a solid hydrogen reservoir and electrochemically pull hydrogen out of this reservoir through a conduct proton conducting electrolyte into a proton sensitive active material or channel material whose conductivity can be fine-tuned by controlling the proton content in that layer and similarly electrochemical you can the mound and in this way we can obtain multi-state capability and rather uniform switching rather than filamentary switching so the sketch is simplified here that the proton reservoir which could be a number of metal hydrides there are a number of methods which have very high hydrogen solubility in them such as palladium hydride nickel hydride the column hydrates the electrolyte should be electrolyte proteins such as NAFTA on solid polymers or zirconate or serotype ceramic proton conductors and the active resistive switching oxide are oxides of tungsten vanadium niobium and even more complicated terminal oxides which have electronic sensitivity when you proton dope them and with protons you have to also encapsulate them for really long term retention and we know barrier layers against protons such as alumina and silica can be used in this country okay so what we are doing in this first conceptual device that we have demonstrated is that we start the hydrogenation of the palladium layer from gas phase which is pretreatment only and the electrolyte is Murphy on the active layer is tungsten oxide and as we apply positive current at the reservoir we oxidize the hydrogen sand protons to the solid electrolyte and the electrons to the outer circuit and insertion of the proton into into the tungsten oxide changes its conductance thing so here are examples of passes of 1 micron 5 milliseconds with that's a very large pulse and the changes in conductance that follow this dispersing sequence and it's reversible as I will show in the next slide so again summarizing some of the electrical characteristics of this device conductivity as a function of past or conductivity translated translating tools to hydrogen content so by using these 1 micron 5 millisiemens pulses we could protonate tungsten oxide from nominally 0 to start with to about 0.06 per formula unit and that gives rise to more than two orders of magnitude change in conductivity and we can also reverse this which is shown here as protonation deprotonation or potentiation depression as a function of pulse that gives us these order of 100 states with 200 on to operation so again these 100 states look a lot but not thousand as the guidance for my paper but there were the less were working with these really large pulses and very long durations given our initial electrical equipment so if you reduce this pulse with 2 micro nano second regime then you can fit many more states into this conductance range so it's also reversible that again by passing we hydrogenate bypassing the dehydrogenase and between a certain regime of hydrogen content the conductance response is reversible that tries to turn symmetric potentiation and depression behavior which is also promising for the reliability of these devices in network training and in terms of stability if you subject this material to air proton in tungsten oxide likes to react with oxygen and evolve as water vapor so if you leave it in air it's not simple but if you keep it in inert atmosphere it's very stable it it keeps its retention very well which means that if you work with such systems we must encapsulate them you must isolate them from air okay so what I have shown to you was the electrical characteristics that we could obtain with this palladium hydride nephew on tungsten oxide system and we have also looked into the mechanisms by which tungsten oxide switches it's electronic conductivity upon protonation and here I'm showing the valence band measured by photoelectron spectroscopy before protonation and after protonation and that latter data shows us this new peak which is indicating the filling of tungsten T 2g States in the 5d pen which is consistent with electron donation to tungsten and also from the core level tungsten for F States we can see the formation of tungsten 5 plus States which is also consistent with electron donation to tungsten and from oxygen KH measurements that we performed at Brookhaven National map the NSLs we can see the intensity increase in an energy range which represents the tungsten 5 the oxygen 2p hybridized orbitals because intensity also increases after protonation so as long as we are within the single phase regime that we are not over protonating to change the phase we can reasonably conclude that proton serves as an electron donor in tungsten oxide that gives rise to this electronic conductivity we have also looked into the energy consumption and I must also repeat this is our first set of devices which are rather large on the order of order hundreds of microns channel lengths quite thick Navion electrolyte layer and so it's not ideal but nevertheless from the voltage change during current passing we can compute the energy consumption per stain and that comes to about 3.5 femtojoules per micrometer per say and if you compare that to the state of art in literature which was the organic proton device that I referred to earlier it's comparable to that and we are very excited about this because as I said we're really working with a bulky device that gives this really low energy consumption and we are in the process of scaling down our devices to channel lengths order 1 micron currently and multiple lower than that as well as thinner electrolyte and thinner active oxide layers so we're in the process of making these devices more attractive and we're excited about the current results that we got okay so in summary which is which is what I just said we could demonstrate an all solid-state proton intercalation device which can give us multiple conductance states by extracting hydrogen from a solid reservoir and inserting it into an active channel oxide tungsten oxide in this case and based on the conductance ranges that we could obtain number of states the energy consumption reversibility and stability it looks quite promising and as I said we're in the process of scaling down and also going to different potentially more promising materials within this framework so I will then switch to the oxygen vacancy type studies that the oxygen vacancy type conductance changes that could be implemented for neuromorphic applications okay this is a wider study or what this mechanism is applicable to a wider range of materials and studies that are reported and used out there the first part that I will show the approach form is supported by the IBM MIT Watson a Island and in collaboration with Kerry tolerate MIT and with Takashi Ando and Vijay Khurana at IBM so the goal here we'll go back to the issue of controlling the consistency and repeatability of these conducting filaments that form in oxides that give rise to resistive switching and I will show two studies for this one of them is this project which I will present the approach for and the other is another collaboration which which will come in a few so the idea is resistive switching consistency control and in this case in this project we are going after micro structure and chemical disordered so why do we do this and this was also mentioned by g1 that the cycle to cycle and device-to-device variability of the voltages that you run with the conductance states that you obtain is a challenge in obtaining reliable networks and so here are a couple of examples where the conductance that we read out or resistance in this case can vary by an order of magnitude if not more cycle to cycle and between the same device and also one to two orders of magnitude in this example from device to device so these are really large variations again going back to titles work 30% variabilities apparently acceptable but not an order or orders of magnitude variability so as I said in the previous slide in these systems when we are working with oxides oxygen vacancy filaments the conductance change comes from the properties of that filaments but where is the filament where does it form in between and what are its properties can we control them is the key challenge I think in this field when you are dealing with oxygen vacancy filaments that form an insulating oxide upon electrochemical extraction or instant or insertion of oxygen into these layers this book where is the pyramid and can we control its position and its properties is the challenge in this area so our hypothesis is that in oxides the oxygen vacancy filaments or accumulation of oxygen vacancies when you apply voltage or current should preferentially take place along extended defects like grain boundaries or dislocations and we know this from our theoretical work on both binary and ternary oxides for example here we're simulating strontium titanate and dislocations in strontium titanate and the color code here represents the vacancy formation energy Green being lower and red being higher than Park nominal so around the core there are sites where you can remove oxygen and create oxygen vacancies more easily and this is consistent with the under coordination of oxygen atoms along those extended defect and this could explain the experimental observations for example for strontium titanate formation or contacting filaments along these locations if you want preferentially oxygen vacancies along these dislocations then the N type doped zones also become those filaments were the oxygen vacancies at home similarly grain boundaries or hafnium oxide was mapped by conducting AFM tip and the switching characteristics along grain boundaries versus grain interior is different higher conducting States and lower voltages could switch to higher conducting States along the grain boundaries or hafnium oxide so again extended the effect seemed to play an important role so then the goal of our work is to control the location and properties of those vacancy induced conducting filaments in the most compatible like a dielectric insulating oxides such as hafnia and strontium titanate we started from Hakeem oxide and the starting point is to first control the microstructure of these films that is we want to not deal with random grains or randomly distributed grain boundaries but a well aligned grain texture which can give us similar grain boundaries and rather well-defined paths and once that microstructure is prepared as a platform we can further tune the local crop properties of those extended defects such as grain boundaries case by Chemical doping and depending on the doping type we can make these boundaries more favorable to switching consistency or less favorable to switch across okay so I won't go into the chemical details and we have started with hafnium oxide and by varying the preparation conditions post-treatment we are able to control the texture on hafnium oxide okay so we perform these samples by physical vapor deposition by sputtering at MIT and we also get samples from our IBM colleagues where they prepare the huffing oxide layers by atomic layer deposition and all these samples that we prepared differently we can also subject them to different annealing gas environment and dopant diffusion conditions and then we characterize their microstructure by x-ray scattering and their electrical properties fine electrical characterization okay so in summary we could obtain more textured more single texture films by higher growth temperature conditions whereas if you start with lower growth temperatures and then try to anneal you don't get to a hot you don't get to an else good texture as we get with relatively high growth temperature so I'll just show one example here for that texture control and I will refer you for the results on this to Kevin may my postdocs poster outside and the point is that starting with hafnium oxide by changing the deposition temperature the annealing temperatures as well as the choice of substrate we could control the microstructure of the films and we are correlating those micro structures to the electrical response of the nothing box items so for example here room temperature sputter deposited hafnia gives rise to multiple orientations with a weaker texture that is just randomly oriented grains and grain boundaries well if we gradually increase the deposition temperatures still within the limits of the most compatibility for processing we can start absorbing the texture that preferentially forms certain orientations which means we are dominating the film with a dominant orientation in this case - 1 1 1 which should give rise to more comparable extended effect properties in this hafnia films so again these parameters for texture control and their electrical response you may discuss with Kevin during the poster session with the same theme of conduct with the same theme of controlling the switching consistency his vacancy based devices I will switch to this last project that I wanted to highlight and that is in collaboration with Nicolas fund a mechanical engineering and his students generally tend has been performing certain experiments that I will share with you and we have worked with them together with my students window some JIT computationally to give guidance to controlling the consistency of switching in alumina based systems based on theoretical prediction that we okay and the point will be that you need to do two things apparently in the system so if you are working with alumina as the switching layer electrolyte two strategies simultaneously when you implement them gives rise to very good consistency first is that you must be pip milling after you put the metal contact on top and you must devise this single alumina layer to two or three or more layers separated by the conducting layers in between so if you do two of them together apparently you get really good consistency so maybe a year ago Genji came to me with this data but I divide the number of layers it improves the process but I must put the gold layer and feedmill it without fit meaning it doesn't improve that you get really good consistency so what's happening here that's quite intriguing this result is really promising so it's across more than 10 devices 20 cycles in each and I will show later cumulative distribution functions that it's a really tight distribution so our hypothesis after having seen this procedure and the result was that with fit milling most likely we are implanting gold and I will show other metals into the alumina and Genji has run ion implantation and sputtering calculations simulations that show that you can have a significant amount of gold implantation into the alumina alumina under his feet million conditions and these implanted metals in this case go to start with serve as dopant and that can alter the ease of reduction is of oxygen vacancy formation within the aluminum layer and if so then percolation of these easy to reduce zones could form a conducting path because of gold atoms inducing oxygen vacancies more easily through and subject to large electric view so if that's the hypothesis we can actually test this hypothesis systematically by changing the metal that we implant into the alumina layer and it's easier to do this first computationally or to test this first computationally and we have varied the metal that we implant from metals that are that light electrons more so more electronegative metals like gold platinum palladium and contrast them to other transition metals which are not as electronegative like copper titanium and aluminum and if you look at the formation energy of oxygen vacancies in the vicinity of these implanted atoms in alumina you see substantial decrease of that energy cost compared to the undoped aluminum so it's really pretty much impossible to reduce you don't dope it and gold platinum palladium reduces that formation energy substantially copper titanium aluminum also does that but not significantly enough and if you look at the electronic density of states when we introduce these dopants into alumina we find creational rings in Gap states that arise from gold platinum and palladium not from copper titanium and aluminum and these states localized around the implanted ion in this case gold and this electron localization then weakens the metal oxygen bonds that then make it easier to remove oxygen from the nearby science so that's based on the effect of single ion in the creation of single vacancy but these conducting filaments must have many vacancies and we have simulated that scenario by placing a few dopant atoms and several oxygen vacancies around them and have also compared the formation energy and binding energy of that vacancy channel to the implanted dopant atoms and again we see that with more electronegative ions like gold platinum palladium the ease of forming such a vacancy channel is easier compared to the undoped case or compared to the copper technical luminol case and similarly the binding energies stronger in this case so both of these numbers tell us that there is preferential formation of oxygen vacancy change along the paths where you have the gold platinum or palladium implanted ions and ultimately the increased conductance is introduced from the accumulation of what of these oxygen vacancies so when you have an oxygen vacancy chain you have plenty of England states which not just reduce but almost make that zone metallic life okay so we experimentally went ahead and validated this but now I'm showing you the cumulative distribution functions for the range obtained resistances and similarly we have results for the reset proteges and you can see a much tighter distribution with gold platinum and palladium and a much broader distribution so less controllability more variability with copper aluminum or titanium implanted into another and that trend these three atoms giving rise to better controllability is consistent with the easier vacancy formation and easier vacancy accumulation around these dopants so in summary in this work we could show that by judiciously choosing dopants into an insulating oxide and locally presenting them into the oxide in this case edge milling by film you can have controllable switching thanks to the tune ability of the reduction the oxygen removal from the nearby site where we implanted these iron so with that I will end by thanking again my colleagues and students in these three activities that I have summarized and thank you for your attention the numbers because you are implanting more than just one but it's possible their properties are similar so as we are switching three switching switching agree switching I don't think it's guaranteed that we are switching with one filament only but gold or platinum are so distinct from the base material that they may be switching similarly even if it's not working each time yes thanks and what is the effect of this dope an implantation on their performing for instance they don't need any but before the implantation value needed with this study also you can send electrical music and you also pay multi-phase switching with a very smooth changes set range but I'll even show given the time for it muttering a filthy look worth looking to a gallium implantation because the I am 4/5 ISM made of gallium if that were the case we should seize upon implantation without the metal layer so what we want you to do say thank you to earlier is to just feed mill and then put the metal contact and it was what was so it's not the iron that we are milling wheat that is being implanted that gives rise to this effect metal itself other than the reducing the variation how'd the other device properties change I mean you know resistance ranges endurance retention with this gold implanted devices right so in terms of resistance ranges that there is a certain extent of decrease in the resistance but still quite higher systems to start with and retention we did not check we will see how about the endurance site yes I think yes you have a number Chinese is about five thousand
