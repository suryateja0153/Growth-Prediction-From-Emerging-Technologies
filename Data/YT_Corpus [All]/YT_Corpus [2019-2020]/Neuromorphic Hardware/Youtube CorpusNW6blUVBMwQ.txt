 eggs a scale computing refers to computing systems capable of at least one exa flops or a billion billion ie a quintillion calculations per second such capacity represents a thousandfold increase over the first petascale computer that came into operation in 2008 one exaflop is a thousand petaflop soar a quintillion 1018 floating-point operations per second at a supercomputing conference in 2009 computer world projected eggs a scale implementation by 2018 this proved accurate as Oak Ridge National Laboratory performed a 1.8 x 1018 flop calculation on the summit o LCF for supercomputer while analyzing genomic information in 2018 they are Gordon Bell finalists at supercomputing 2018 exascale computing would be considered as a significant achievement in computer engineering for it is estimated to be the order of processing power of the human brain at neural level functional might be lower it is for instance the target power of the human brain project topic development you topic China as of October 2018 China has two of the four fastest supercomputers in the world China's first exascale supercomputer will enter service by 2020 according to the head of the School of Computing at the National University of Defense technology and UDT according to the national plan for the next generation of high-performance computers China will develop an exascale computer during the 13th five-year plan period 2016 to 2020 the government of Tianjin Binhai new area nu DT and the national supercomputing Center in Tianjin are working on the project the exhaust Gale supercomputer is planned to be named TI a NH III topic United States in 2008 two United States of America governmental organizations within the US Department of Energy the Office of Science and the National Nuclear Security Administration provided funding to the Institute for Advanced architectures for the development of an exascale supercomputer Sandia National Laboratory in the Oak Ridge National Laboratory were also to collaborate on exascale designs the technology was expected to be applied in various computation intensive research areas including basic research engineering earth science biology material science energy issues and national security in January 2012 Intel purchased the InfiniBand product line from QLogic for us 125 million dollars in order to fulfill its promise of developing exascale technology by 2018 by 2012 the United States had allotted 126 million dollars for exhaust kal computing development in February 2013 the intelligence Advanced Research Projects activity started cryogenic computer complexity c3 program which envisions a new generation of superconducting supercomputers that operate at exascale speeds based on superconducting logic in December 2014 it announced a multi-year contract with International Business Machines Raytheon BBN technologies and Northrop Grumman to develop the technologies for c3 program on the 29th of July 2015 President Obama signed an executive order creating a national strategic computing initiative calling for the accelerated development of an exascale system and funding research into post semiconductor computing the exaust scale computing project hopes to build an exascale computer by 2021 topic Taiwan taijuan as the largest global center for the research and development of industrial and electronics technology as well as the center of manufacturing from at least 80% of all computer hardware technology in the world has initiated extensive efforts by Taiwan's various scientific organizations both government and private industries to design and build exhaust scales supercomputers most recently in collaboration with Taiwan's Ministry of Science and Technology and NVIDIA corporation with the focus on complex artificial intelligence applications in addition to modeling and scientific research for the advancement of simulating weather patterns Taiwanese nuclear weapons testing physics chemistry and biomedical science among many other potential applications of such powerful exhaust scale supercomputers in June 2017 Taiwan's national center for high performance computing initiated the effort towards designing and building the first taiwanese IG's a scale supercomputer by funding construction of a new intermediary supercomputer based on a full technology transfer from Fujitsu Corporation of Japan which is currently building the fastest and most powerful AI based supercomputer in Japan additionally numerous other independent Taiwanese efforts have been made in Taiwan with the focus on the rapid development of exascale supercomputing technology such as the Taiwanese Foxconn Corporation which recently designed and built the largest and fastest supercomputer in all of Taiwan this new Foxconn supercomputer is designed to serve as a stepping stone in research and development towards the design and building of a state-of-the-art Taiwanese eggs a scale supercomputer topic European Union in 2011 several projects aiming at developing technologies and software for exhaust scale computing were started in the EU the Cresta project collaborative research into exhaust scale system where tools and applications the deep project dynamic elects a scale entry platform and the project Montblanc a major European project based on X a scale transition is the max materials at the exascale project in 2015 the scalable energy efficient resilient and transparent software adaptation cert project a major research project between the University of Manchester in the STFC des buri Laboratory in Cheshire was awarded C 1 million pounds from the UK's engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council the cert project was due to start in March 2015 it will be funded by EPSRC under the software for the future to program and the project will partner with the numerical analysis group NAG cluster vision and the science and technology facilities Council STFC topic Japan in Japan in 2013 the Rik Iain advanced Institute for computational science began planning an exascale system for 2020 intended to consume less than 30 megawatts in 2014 Fujitsu was awarded a contract by Rik Iain to develop a next-generation supercomputer to succeed the kei computer in 2015 Fujitsu announced at the international supercomputing conference that this supercomputer will use processors implementing the armv8-a architecture with extensions it was Co designing with arm limited topic India in 2012 the Indian government has proposed to commit 2.5 billion United States dollars to supercomputing research during the 12th five-year plan period 2012 to 2017 the project will be handled by Indian Institute of Science IISc Bangalore additionally it was later revealed that India plans to develop a supercomputer with processing power in the exaflop range it will be developed by c-dac within the subsequent five years of approval topic technological challenges it has been recognized that enabling applications to fully exploit capabilities of exhaust scale computing systems is not straightforward in June 2014 the stagnation of the top 500 supercomputers had observers question the possibility of exhaust scale systems by 2020 topic see also neuromorphic engineering supercomputer superconducting computing big data computer performance by orders of magnitude
