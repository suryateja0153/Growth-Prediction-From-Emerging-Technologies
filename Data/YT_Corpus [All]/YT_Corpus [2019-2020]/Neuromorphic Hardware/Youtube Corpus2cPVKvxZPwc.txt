 so it's a great pleasure to introduce uh professor christophe koch today um who's uh joining us from uh from seattle christoph was mentioned uh extensively yesterday uh both in connection to his pioneering work on the biophysics of computation and the very beginnings of the entire field of computational neuroscience as a matter of fact i think we should credit uh christoph with the beginning of our summer course because we were inspired by a similar course that he created uh also in woods hall at nbl on computational uh neuroscience he was also mentioned yesterday by by tomi uh in connection to his uh extensive and seminal work on on unconsciousness uh so christoph is a true renaissance man who has shed light on uh all kinds of problems in neuroscience and systems in science and computational science and it's a great privilege to uh um uh to have him here talking about the relationship between structure and function in the individual system so christoph all yours thank you gabriel i was also the um the doctor father as we say the mentor of gabriel when he got his phd at caltech all right so today i i'm going to talk not about biophysics about our consciousness but about relating function and structure in the visual system of the of the mouth this is all work done over the last seven years at the allen institute here in seattle the vision we've been pursuing here since i came i left caltech and joined the allen is to do something similar to what astronomy has done to build a set of instruments we call the allen brain observatory that are similar to the large-scale astronomical observatories where you can routinely record at high resolution data on a standard protocol and make all this data accessible where people ultimately would will apply i want to do this particular experiment we do the experiment and we make all the data available and i'll come back to that um at the end so i'll talk to you about that i'll tell you about that two points with two very large scale instruments one is optical physiology using two photon calcium imaging and the other one is doing electrical recordings using neural pixel where in both cases we now can recall from 10 50 or 100 000 neurons understand and condition download all the data make all the data available to anyone such as you so if you go to the link in this talk you can see uh there's a link there to our to a data website we're using a standard allen sdk you can download right now there's no no login required no password nothing you can download all the data and all the metadata about all the animals everything that was shown and you can analyze it of course the vast majority of these of this of the spiking activity has never been seen by human eye just because there's so much it's it's a several billion action potentials you know 100 000 spikes for three hours total so in order to do this in order to make this highly reproducible we need a few we need to engineer an entire ecosystem around this so for once we need to have a high resolution three-dimensional coordinate system we've worked on this for the past 10 years it's now sort of the standard coordinate system for the mouse of course the mouse has some advantages over the human because we use inbred mice c57 black 6j mice which is sort of standard in the field so they are highly genetically they're all from the same background unlike you know two different people and then you can see there in this in this picture this is superimposed in image a horizontal cut through a through 1500 mouse brain 1500 all superimposed because you can tightly align it and so we have this two two three dimensional atlas each pixel is 10 by 10 by 10 microns roughly half a billion of them um we have 43 uh cortical areas in one side of course um a total of three not more than three not subcortical areas and white matter structures and so everything we do every time we record whether it's patching from an electrode to get its transcriptome or electrical recording or optical recording we always know within very high resolution where that particular neuron is we also need to build a high throughput pipeline where we take animals here various transgenic animals for instance we do standard surgery always using the same so that we use robots to do this we do intrinsic imaging think of that like fmi so we know for each mouse we do we know precisely where's let's say primary visual cortex with higher order visual cortex we do training understand that in standard boxes where we track the training history of every animal then we either do optical imaging or neural pixels then we do afterwards we we we go back and do intrinsic imaging and then we sacrifice the animal and do histology of its entire brain so we know exactly we can identify for example where the tracks were of the microelectrodes or where if we have particular fluorescent neurons where they are located we have this this pipeline of of you know standard surgically intrinsic imaging you know either this multi-plane multi-photon imaging on your pixels and then the serial two photon tomography for reconstructing the animal we've built this high resolution cost platform registration so we can go back for optical imaging you know six times 10 times 12 times we can go back and image the same the same cells we have a standard sort of way to present visual stimuli so here you can for example you can see in different animals these are different tree lines in each animal we do this imaging and then we have the standard way of mapping uh sort of this is the back of the brain this is primary visual cortex it's the higher order visual areas so we can map so we know when we did optical imaging or when we put neural pixels in here we know exactly where we were both functionally as identified by these intrinsic imaging as well as structurally because we do this histology at the end so here you can see this is a mouse running past a movie a wonderful movie called the top people and this is two photon imaging and we track of course we have cameras and you know we track the movement of the animal and its eyes etc etc and all of this is available so we did this over the the first survey we did lab scale survey of 60 000 neurons i'm not going to talk about here you can just see a snapshot of the way different neurons here for particular neurons respond to different static ratings drifting ratings natural scenes receptor fields movies etc and we also we work with the community to come up with a standard data standard and an ecosystem called nwb new data without borders so it's a large scale pro a project that more and more people are using now to represent cellular data time series of seller data whether that's optical physiology or lactophysiology and it looks like it may evolve into standard for the entire field which would be a great boon to everyone and then we also co-developed over the last uh five years it's a consulting together with janelia particularly tim harris he was really the the chief engineer and then um ucl in in london the welcome foundation where we developed these high-resolution probes called neural pixels so what they are they're roughly they're ten millimeter long covered by titanium nitride very high um precision manufacturing using a cmos well we have 960 electrodes and you can select 384 of them they're spaced at 20 microns apart we're now going to even higher resolution so called neural pixel ultra let's be six microns apart but everything i'm talking about today is 20 microns apart so you have a stick of silicon machined silicon 10 millimeter long and you put it into the mouth at the brain of a mouse we've also developed versions 48 millimeter long for the for the monkey using the same base station so this is the shank one centimeter this is the base and then here in the base you have uh you have all the electronics for amplification filtering and multiplexing so all that you get here is a it's a flex cable you have four wires going out to a central board low noise in tissue actually it's seven micro volt in in in water in salt water small like five micro volts very you know you can see very clean impedances uh fantastic technology has really made a huge difference because you can now record from this stick you can record 100 or 200 neurons and if you put six or eight or ten of them into one animal you can in a single um experiment record a thousand uh units okay and then again there needs to be so we have this this neuropixel workstations where we put on a standard condition six neural pixels um inside the into the brain minimal damage because these are so small they are 22 microns thick 70 microns across 10 millimeter long really it's if you look at the histology it's really very clean okay so that's sort of the the background now over the last 10 years we've also worked at trying to get the structure of the animal so this project involves mapping function on structure so the structure what we've done early on already quite a while ago here where we met in a very systematic way the animals were injected to here in one out of 500 animals we injected either a wild type of a transgenic in a particular subset of animals um we injected in a particular subtype of cell we injected some some fluorescent tracer anterior gold crazer and then we can reconstruct the the the terminals the presynaptic terminals throughout the entire brain ipsilateral and contralateral in all these different structures in the ccf so these are you know several hundred structures and so here you can see this log representation of the of the connectivity uh more recently we published this last year we've done um again under the road viral tracing with with pre-dependent viruses in 1200 animals in distinct mouth lines where we can look at the term the pattern of termination so here we have somewhere in cortex goes somewhere else in cortex and you can see it either you know terminates in the superficial layer only top of layer one or mainly in you know very heavily in in most layers except layer four you can you can see all these distinct patterns here from a cortical source and here from a from a thalamic source then we used unsupervised hierarchical clustering of all these different experiments to identify nine types of feed-forward and feedback connections throughout the entire brain this is not just the visual system this entire brain and then we can do we can arrange a hierarchy for the that involves all 43 in this case the subset 37 cortical areas and 24 thalamic nucleus in a very systematic data driven manner and we can assign a hierarchy score so the hierarchy score think if you have a perfect hierarchy a one-step hierarchy that hierarchy score would be let's say from a lgm to a simple cell in a classical tubulin diesel that's a hierarchy scope one then if you go from the simple cell in a simple step to a complex cell that would be a higher key score of two so you can see the total depth of this hierarchy is only two steps in the entire mouse why it seems so it's a shallow hierarchy compared to for instance if you look at the uh phenomena in macaque well a it's a it's a small animal it's you know it fits comfortably in the sugar cube under a cubic centimeter b cortex is very heavily connected almost you know more than 30 of all connections are actually there but of course the connection strength is log normal distributed so there are lots and lots and lots of parallel uh of other connections so this is so this is what it is okay with with v1 here um at the bottom and a sort of uh the the um orbital frontal areas and some salamic areas at the top of the hierarchy here you can actually see the this is just the uh for the visual system and this is uh for the entire brain all right so now let's try to replicate that structural the anatomical connectivity can we also find it in the pattern of spikes particularly as you get as the animal looks at something you have this wave of spike that comes through the lgn into into cortex and so we've done that over the last five years we put this paper out on bioarchive last year and it's now making its uh this paper and i'll show you mainly figures from this paper it's making its way through peer review so here we have only out of hundred thousand units all registered to ccf so every every cell after so there's of course a huge amount of post-processing involved using in this case kilo cluster two um we have this automatic way particular joseph ziegler the the author of open ethics he did he's the first author and he did all of this where we have for each unit we have 12 different criteria by which we do spike sorting and quality control and all of that data is also associated that's also associate metadata so for each unit you can see what happens if i'm more strict if i do a smaller exclusion criteria or if i change my exclusion criteria and you can then go back and analyze everything all of that is is made available here using sdk okay so this is a setup so we have blue eyes callbacks these other is other areas so we record of course because he's a 10 millimeter long and the the brain from bottom to top as i said roughly you know fits comfortably in the sugar cube so it is under 10 millimeters and so what we do in these recordings we can record from each one of these cortical as all matching receptions but we can also record from the lgn from the this is really the lateral posterior this think of this is a pulvena in the monkey this would be called the pauldina the colliculus and in between of course there are other areas like the hippocampus all of that is recorded so just to show you the difference between doing optical recording and electrical recording we do both of course optical recording we record at 30 hertz we record the fluorescent signals we don't record individual action potentials we we know in fact now exactly what we're recording because we're also doing simultaneously electrical patch recording and optical recording but in general what you're recording optically you're recording in a plane typically cortex because you you know the photons don't go much deeper than layer five we're recording in a horizontal plane genetically identified neurons that's a big advantage fluorescent the signals the other advantage is we can track this over multiple days so we can come back here next day or next week or even next month and record from the same cell at 30 hertz electrophysiology we're recording throughout the entire brain because right we can record we have this long uh 10 millimeter stick that's ca1 dental gyros ca3 of the hippocampus lgn we can go all the way down here to the hypothalamus so electrical recording we're recording at 30 000 hertz rather than 30 hertz so it's a thousand times fast faster and we're recording spikes and of course spikes have some ontological standing that you know fluorescent signals don't really have the drawback is we don't know what we're recording from in general we can distinguish of course fast spiking into neurons from regular spiking cells but other than that we don't know unless we do opto-tagging we don't know the genetic identity of these cells and we can come back the next day and recall from this very same layer 6 neuron in al so each technique like always in in science has advantages and disadvantages there's no best technique okay so you get these you know what you get in this case here you know you get a thousand yards in one experiment and you can look at this now for two hours or three hours bringing up to three hours of experiment health animal runs or sits and runs past movies and scratings and flashes and whatever that's pretty cool pretty unprecedented okay so you can you can see you know we're recording for many animals here typically we're recording from uh six areas sometimes up to eight you know it depends exactly on the exact angle and of course we know all of that because after the we sacrifice the animal in each case we we use optical tomography to reconstruct the the track and to place uh the electrode and then every unit into the ccf and so we can study we know the majority of cells in car in visual cortex you know respond so this is one particular cell as we show the as the animal runs past gabor patches full field flashes from gray to white or gray to black drifting ratings dark motion static raging natural scenes and movies and you can look at you know tempo frequency as a function of orientation you can look at different orientations you can look at the flash the timing when you have a dark a light flash or dark flash you can do classical receptor fields and we do all of that in parallel across entire visual field and so you can get here for instance this is a fraction of cells where we can use this procedure to automatically determine receptor fields and so you can see certainly early on these regions have 70 plus receptor fields okay yeah and interesting if you look at hippocampus because as i said these electrodes go from visual cortex through hippocampal through lgn as a control you can see you know they don't have visual receptor field and you wouldn't expect that okay so this is the the figure that we spent many years to derive this relates traction function so i showed you the hierarchy of last year's nature paper julie harris and mihala fedal where we we we look at the using this unsupervised clustering in 1500 mice we look at the the the connectivity just within the visual system so this is lgn v1 these are different visual error cortical areas lmrlp [Music] nucleus so the two thalamic nucleus is lgn and lp as i said that's like the pulvena these other areas are all cortical areas this is the feet forward and these are all the feedback connections so this is the structure and we can precisely assign to each of these stages and an anatomically hierarchy score so now how can we do the same thing for the electrophysiology well so let's say here we have one we have two units in um the the and the units here are i forgot they're between two visual areas and we look at the cost correlation in response to drifting grading and what you can see here this is the and and then it shuffles the shuffle corrected and it's jitter corrected in the in the cough and corvelogum and we have this sharp peak here with offset of three milliseconds in other words the unit in in v1 this is a v1 unit well these are two units between v1 and lm a higher order visual areas v1 and lm and you can see the v1 defined of the v1 unit follows three milliseconds later follows is followed by the firing of the lm unit and so we look at for such sharp peaks we have a criteria for what a sharp peak is i think it's seven times above stand above above baseline um and within a within a window of plus minus 12 milli plus minus 10 milliseconds so that's a sharp peak so when you have something within this time here that's very sharp we count that and we and and we look at the the offset so here you can see the distribution of of these time lags between v1 and lm cell the mean the median here is 4 milliseconds or something like that and then what we can do so here this is the anatomical hierarchy score difference so here what we do we take this the anatomical one and for each case we look at well between lg and d1 what is the the score difference right between here and here and we plot this here in this two dimensional diagram and then here we do the same but now we do it using this functional criteria we do the median cross correlogram uh time lag you know sort of these time lag here across thousands of uh of um of units and we get this structure and then we can correlate we can say well what is the anatomical difference here between let's say pm and rl and what is the um the time lag between pm and rl and let's compute the cause correlation between those two so the anatomical hierarchy score difference and the median time lag and you would get this very nice very you know with very high statistically certainly we get this very nice relationship using both uh spearman and and parson and correlation and coefficient so in other words the bigger the anatomical hierarchy difference the bigger the difference here between let's see here and here versus here and here the bigger the average time lag in the cross covalent which makes sense now we we also looking at other measures here so we're looking at at four classical we're looking at four different measures and see how these measures change across the anatomical hierarchy so um here we're looking at the at the time the first spike we compute for each of these different areas because we have this great thing we can have in one animal hundreds of cells shown always to the same stimuli so um in many many animals so we can collect all of that data and show for example this is the response to an uh to an on uh and on flash fulfill flash to the lgn okay it's of course the first then this is to um you can see these different areas here okay here they are um here in b we look at the distribution for each of those thousands of neurons we're looking for the distribution of first spike response time in response to this flash okay so the this we we have a criteria for determining what the first what the first sp the the first spikers and we do that for all our neurons and we plot those distributions and then we look here the correlation between mean time to first spike and hierarchy score and again we get this beautiful correlation very strong correlation between the anatomical hierarchy score and the first time to spike in response to full flash here we're doing we're looking we have an automatic way of as i mentioned to you of determining receptor field and here we automatically determine the receptor field size so for example here we have lgn they're smaller somewhat smaller than in a higher order area called am that's almost at the top of the hierarchy here we we superimpose all of the receptive field size here we look at the distribution of them across all the units here's by the way all the the numbers of units that we have so it's you know that that's 5500 units just in v1 alone and again here so if you have these you know these sort of numbers you get these very tight statistically relationship beautiful statistically relationship which of course a lot of jitter right if you look at here the distribution yes so even in v1 you can get some cells that have a thousand square degrees but you know the the average v1 is around 400. but these numbers are large because we're dealing with some mouse here this is not a primate like a monkey or human that has a high resolution phobia anyhow if you look at this you get these very tight relationships you know with these you know beautiful correlations um here we look at um to what extent units are phase log to what extent units are really like a simple cells where they should be completely uh phase logged or to what extent the cell behaves more like um like like a complex cells so so we we we have this this modulation index that really matters the difference in power of the visually evoked response at the unit's preferred stimulus frequency versus the average power spectrum so this is the number and and then we take the and the log of this and um where where where where um small numbers uh indicate sort of uh uh sorry where where large numbers indicate sort of simple cells and small numbers indicate particular negative numbers indicate complex cells because you expect the early on to be simple cells and later on complex health and again if we if we do that you can see some here that you know that where they have really bimodal distribution different areas again you can see this beautiful relationship early on it's primarily simple cells later on it's primarily complex cells and then here we are pursuing something an idea cj wang had has expressed many times in his paper particularly i'm thinking of shortly at all where we try to measure the time scale of neural activity so we first assess the intrinsic time scale of each s of each neuron across all the different brain regions we record from by fitting an exponential decay a function to each unit spike count auto correlation doing spontaneous activity in this case when there is gray screen nothing particularly present on in the environment and we look at the we compute the the autocorrelation and we look at the exponential decay and here the mean intrinsic time scale does not is not correlated with a visual hierarchy at all oh yeah i should have shown this i i haven't shown this i just realized it's not correlated so intrinsically each neuron is not just it's not true that intrinsically a neuron in a higher area has a slower time scale the intrinsic intrinsic time scale than a neuron let's see in v1 however if we look at the response the decay time to visual stimuli which we caught over here by fitting an exponential decay function to the autocorrelation doing a fulfill flash so here you can see some fits here you can see the the distribution to the of the autocorrelation time scaled of all the units and again here you can see the the the correlation so it's certainly true that as you go up the anatomical hierarchy the the the the time scale the the evoke response time scale certainly increases across the uh the the hierarchy which is what uh cj wang has shown in his beautiful models in his um in his neon paper so as you go up the hierarchy there's a strong correlation between mean response decay and anatomical hierarchy score and we also looked at active behaviors in fact we're doing this more and more so here you can see the mouse is running and in this case it's getting rewarded when it correctly detects you can see sometimes the image change right same same same same same same there it was it changes and now it's same same same same sometimes we leave out a flash so it's a really interesting paradigm it really relates to an automated out paradigm what what people have done right to compute p300 p300b things like that but he done in in a mouse so now we can look at what happens in this behavior so this is the paradigm each image is on for 250 milliseconds these are natural scenes and then 500 millisecond blank so here you can see at level of lgn this is when the image changes from a to b v1 and area am this is just one exemplar units of here and so of these units right now we have um it's a smaller number of animals we're still complete this survey hasn't been completed yet but in these animals still you know a thousand units 800 units so here for example you can see that this is for this lgn cell this is for the same stimulus when the same stomach is shown again and again and this is when remember the stimulus is on for 250 milliseconds and this is when the image is changed and we're looking at a at a change modulation index which is the difference of these two over their sum so the cmi this change modulation index is is always between minus one and plus one if if the if the cell responds stronger to the changed image then to the the same one then it'll be positive uh between zero and one zero then they respond exactly the same plus one the the response is much much bigger you know if the larger the cmi the the larger the response to the change and here's in d1 the response is bigger and here's an am and typically you get this first you get this initial transient and then you get a sustained response this is very typical okay so here you can see very nice again correlation this is always because the anatomical hierarchies go from lgn down here to this highest visual area am up here this is time to first spike now for for this active natural scene presentation and just like before when we looked at the the correlation between the uh anatomical hierarchy score and the passive presentation of the flashes here on the active condition we get very similar in fact a highly correlated those two measures at a single cell level but here again we get this beautiful correlation between time to first spike and position in the hierarchy and here also the change modulation index which is always positive goes up highly significant this is under the active condition so this is when the animal has to perform the task here we're doing a replay so the animal gets to see exactly the same sequence the same timing as here the only difference is here the act the animal is not being rewarded and it's just just running well here it's actively being here it's being rewarded so you can see the difference uh that this active behavior makes so lgn for instance there's no difference lgn whether the animal is in an act of opacities is the same but as you go to higher areas the difference grows now we can also do decoding and you can decode for many areas you know here we ask the question we always take 20 um we have a random forest decoder and we look at 20 units in lgn or v1 or lp or am and we ask can we decode how well can we decode the stimulus and we can decode it to some degree and then um so if effectively we we find that we the spiking activity in any area including very early areas like lgn can be used to decode image changes with significantly above chance performance although in lgn it doesn't do nearly as well as high up in cortex now now what we do we we assess how well the decoder performance correlates with the ash behavioral choice of the mouse in each tile right we can say using my random forest decoder from 20 neurons on this particular tile what did my decoder decide what the stimulus was and what actually did the animal decide did it decide it was the same or different and then i can correlate that right how well does the decoder correlate with the an animal uh performance of the animal on the on that trial and this very steeply um correlates with anatomical hierarchy it goes to almost 90 percent once we record in the midbrain reticular formation or some of the pre-motor nucleus of course you would expect that it's it's uh you know 0.25 in the highest area that we record from the highest visual area and goes down basically to chance at the level of the lga so at the level of the lgn although we a random forest decoder can with some above chance probability decode and decode the identity it doesn't relate at all to what the animal does so this tells us the animal doesn't access lgn and so again this is the difference you know you have to be careful with with correlate with inferring correlation just because you can decode something so this is you know rather nice um satisfactory result and of course this is also this increase in change-related signals suggests that unexpected stimuli like this is really an an autumn out paradigm unexpected similiar amplified by successive levels of the hierarchy and this is consistent with some other oddball paradigm in the in the rat but they also compare those general series of hierarchical predictive processing which posit that unexpected signals are professionally passed on to higher profiting stages all right so my last two slides i wanted to come back to this open scope what we call openscope because we are now moving towards this where we want to do the following we want you the entire community worldwide to come up with a clever experiment in principle what we're working on with others over the next three years that it can be in any part of the brain let's say you want to do an experiment maybe a modification of this paradigm maybe a go-no-go paradigm using some particular let's say visual there has to be some restriction let's say maybe a visual maybe an auditory paradigm um you say you submit your proposal to us together with a bunch of other proposals we together with the external community maybe you've done some piloting so you have some idea this sort of can work you have a particular hypothesis you submit your experimental protocol to to our request for proposal we review these based on how interesting they are scientifically and how feasible how easy is it to do you require a particular transgenic animal you require some additional viral injection you know each one of this because we want to do things under highly standardized condition so every time we do things off pipeline they become much more difficult much more expensive once we've selected these experiments we we carry them out on our using our trained technicians you know a highly trained you know robot the the experimental procedure the surgery all that pipeline we we do the recording we we we do the uh post recording histology so we know exactly where we record it we process the data we make the data the metadata all the the qc all of that is is then going to be shipped uh to uh all done via aws so you have the data then you guys can analyze the data this is what happens in astronomy and as these experiments and the instruments become more and more sophisticated i think it's really critical that they become more and more standardized so we can it's all replicable and all the data and metadata are accessible ultimately to everyone upon publication so that's what we're now moving towards so in summary the brain observatory we record from large number of neurons using either optical physiology or multi-photon fluorescence microscopy or neural pixels under highly standardized condition within a high-res 3d coordinate system all the data and metadata is freely available we're now moving to this open scope environment and yeah this is what the first analysis of the this what we call neural pixel survey has revealed about what we find once again the vast majority of this data has not been analyzed so people are now beginning to analyze and a whole bunch of them um because we can just see who downloads it and all sorts of interesting flow of information and sub-communities um within this neuron that you can see there this is our team it's a large effort and we thank our donor for for making all of this possible and with that i'm done i thank you for your attention thank you very much christoph uh this is uh really a very impressive uh work and a lot of beautiful data and uh i'd like to encourage everyone to uh to capitalize on this data and really uh i think there's a lot of fascinating computational questions that can be pursued now with this uh with access to this data and it's uh it's very laudable also that you're making uh all of these available to the community so this is really very very exciting so uh there are many questions in here i'm gonna um uh focus on some of the questions that are that pertain specifically to this talk there are also many questions about um consciousness as well i'm gonna keep those lower priority now so so a couple of clarification questions some people were wanting to know more about how you define the hierarchy in anatomical terms particularly in circuits that have a lot of recurrent uh connections and horizontal connections what how did how do you define the anatomical hierarchy it's a very cool it's a good question we have mad at as i said 30 of all connections you know if if you have a graph of of we have uh 40 we have 70 nodes just in our cortex thalamus on one side of the brain never mind the other one we find you know you should find up to 70 times 70 connections we find 30 of those so this massive connection plus of course there's massive connection within each area here we use a very simplified scheme where we classify each connection based on their pattern of postsynaptic where in which layers they classify we impose this constraint it's either a feed forward or a feedback connection it's a it's a simple scheme so we impose this and then we find this hierarchy in reality of course we know there's it's much more complicated but we you know we and and we simplify this therefore it's rather nice given this this um this simplification that we say either your feed forward or your feedback right now we don't have a third option it is rather satisfactory that then if we look an average over many thousands of units we find this nice linear correlation with the receptor field size with the extent of simple complex with the first time to spike with the decoding with the with the response time but it's an approximation uh another anatomical question here or at least i interpret it to be anatomical uh um people ask whether the connectivity uh follows a small world network uh um it depends where you look if you just look at yes if you look at the entire so people have analyzed that the 2012 paper i mean all of that data has been online that does follow a small world connectivity um although as i said there is lots and lots of um it's sort of yeah yes in a certain condition you can find that again it's more complex because we have a 30 of all connections are present so the small world connectivity typically is in in in in social networks right when you have much when you don't have you know if you look at facebook you don't have 30 of all possible connections among a billion people are present right um the adjacency you know if you think about the adjacency graph it's um it's pretty dense but of course the amplitude of the connection signal varies across its log normal distribution across almost you know a factor of fifty thousand so that just makes it more complex very good i'm reading another question here from marco but do i do i understand correctly that the neurons in the hippocampus did not respond to any of the stimuli aboard natural scenes etc no a few cells did but not it's a small no no small cells a few cells did respond but only a very small fraction did respond to visual stimuli now remember that survey was under passive condition it might have been different and we had we haven't gone back and looked in this active visual behavior we might find some more neurons in any case it's a very small fraction of cells very good another question in the oddball paradigm you alluded to the idea of predictive coding but is it possible that the differences along the hierarchy are can be simply explained as an accumulation of adaptation uh you have more adaptation in uh so you have you pass an adapted signal from lg into v1 from v1 to am and so on and the accumulation of adaptation uh uh gives the results that you show here it can't be just that because that remember i showed you a graph i can pull it up again the difference between the passive and the active right so in the passive conveys this the animal sees exactly the same sequence but uh but now it doesn't have to do any any behavior so if it's purely sort of a path of sensory adaptation um and that explains a little bit but in addition you have this ever-growing uh increase so that is not sufficient to explain the entirety of the signal it explains some fraction of the signal very good um i move on to our next question um i'm not sure i fully understand it but i'm going to read it anyway for the change detection task what would be the role of the hippocampus in the hierarchy and how does this relate to an oddball effect i i mean we just happened to record from the hippocampus because our electrode you know we're interested in the cortex and we're interested in the thalamus right so the hippocampus happens to be in between we pick up all these we haven't really done anything with the hippocampal units we have no no particular hypothesis about the hippocampus i'm not sure the hippocampus is required for this my i guess my gut feeling is you can probably inactivate the hippocampus and the the animals shouldn't have a difficulty doing this task yeah and and we don't make any claims about the hippocampus in the in the hierarchy in that hierarchy graph there we just focusing on eight areas the two visual thalamic areas lgn and the pulvina and six visual cortical areas so we we make no claim in this paper about the hippocampus very good uh crystal this is a a a general question about uh um invasive experiments and neurophysiology um the question is whether inserting probes in the brain destroys tissue and how does that affect our uh our recordings yeah no it's a very good question um we i mean it's very difficult to be sure because the only way to be totally sure is to do a recording without any without any electrodes and that's of course difficult and difficult to do all we can tell if it goes lower and too small and smaller diameter and if you do post reconstruction histology you see less and less damage we've tried early on when we made the newer pixels we made even thinner pokes 10 micrometer poles but we could and 50 10 micrometer thin and 50 wide we couldn't see any difference in terms of for example blood vessel appears or um or dead or inflammatory tissue so while uh and these are acute experiments these are not chronic experiments so while we're not seeing there aren't any there isn't any damage the damage is very small in fact we have to add dye we add dye eye to the electrodes because if we don't have a dye the damage is so little we cannot locate the tracks of the electrode if you have a big electrode it's very easy to in in if you do the histology to see where the electrode was these electrodes are so thin if you if we wouldn't add the dye we would not see the tracks so there's probably likely to be some damage but it's um it's um it's uh minimal very good thank you um are there any plans to conduct uh developmental studies of how the anatomical as well as physiological properties change with mouse development no not right now it's a very good question but no we're not okay so christoph if you don't mind there there are a lot of questions here i'm sorry that i can't do justice to all of them can i uh take advantage of the fact that you're here and use the last five minutes to shift gears to consciousness because there's a lot of questions about uh consciousness so so one of the questions i think there was a discussion yesterday uh where uh uh i think tommy was advocating the idea that consciousness and intelligence go together and i know that you have uh uh strong and different opinions about these so uh maybe you can say a few words about uh intelligence and ai and consciousness yes they're very different consciousness is ultimately a state of being so consciousness i define as any experience whether it's you know just you know banal like tasting tasting a slice of cold pizza or as rare as you know having a mystical experience all of them dreams memories emotions falling in love being angry being hungry being upset about kobe those are all different conscious states and so ultimately their state of being it feels like something in the words of of the philosopher thomas and eagle now intelligence is very different intelligence is really is about doing intelligence is about um you know acting in intelligent way that means you you know you're in a particular environment and you either have to act very quickly or you have to act very slowly let's say you have to plan for your college or you have to plan you know you're doing your phd uh you know because you hope uh several years later you can take advantage of that of that knowledge gain so ultimately intelligence is about behavior now in evolutionary structures those things are related in other words we think if we look at a cost within species let's say within humans uh or um across humans that that intelligence and consciousness is related both at the individual level and at the at the species level but they're really i'm trying to find this picture here you can draw a two-dimensional plane on one axis you can have consciousness and you can have a measure of consciousness like phi some of you might know from from the theory of of uh of integrated information and on the other plane you can have a measure like uh like like intelligence like iq and in principle they can be dissociated and you can certainly imagine if we think about artificial intelligence if we think a little bit about computers that it is certainly possible that you can have computers that will ultimately have human level intelligence or maybe even super uh superhuman level of intelligence but there is no evidence whatsoever and certainly iit uh strongly argues against the notion that digital computers you know for neumann machines will be conscious in other words i t would say yes you can have a super human intelligent you know you can have super intelligence without them feeling like anything so but even if you don't believe that even if you believe in the fullness of time that they can be conscious at least conceptually they are two very different things intelligence i mean that the bottom line is intelligence is about doing consciousness is about being and for people who want to know more and the particular figure that christoph is alluding to he presented that in a cbmm talk uh last year which you can all see the video in the cvmm website i jump quickly to a few other questions where does the cloud stream lie in the hierarchy uh asked by adeniyer ah we're just we okay i don't know we just look it's a research project it's an ongoing research project the the cloudstream as some of you might know it's this mystery structure we all have it humans have it and mice have it it's it's the most interconnected structure by none anywhere in the brain it's a thin structure underneath sort of the this part the insula above the basal ganglia it's within the white matter in humans it's massively connected both ways so it massively projects two cortex and gets input back from cortex we don't know where it is that's a research that we kind of do right now gian batista i apologize if i may finish your name he asks uh are mice and humans uh brain is pretty much the same but a different scales are they very different what can we learn about intelligence and consciousness uh from from mice to humans okay so at the level of a cubic millimeter of of cour if i give you a cell in fact i've done this at my institute i've shown people 12 cells half of the pyramidal cells half of them from human half of them from monk from mouse i removed the scale but people are chance telling one from the other basically the basic heart was very similar the genome is very similar cell type we published last year paper in nature where we compared human uh cortical cell types with small cell types you can map one onto the other they're not the same human cells of course are three times taller because their cortex is three times thicker roughly but they're not the same but they're very very similar and the supposition is that the basic hardware is very similar we have a thousand times more so you know we have 16 billion cortical neurons versus 14 million cartilage in the mouse overall 86 billion neurons versus 70 million neurons you know the mouse fits into a sugar cube one by one centimeter the human brain fits into liter 10 by 10 by 10 centimeters so the supposition of most of neuroscientists we precisely study mouse because they are so similar they're not identical but they're very similar to the structures we find in a in a in a human so therefore also my assumption is yes it also feels like something to be a mouse it doesn't have a voice in itself like we do it can't you know it doesn't worry about the weekend about the coming weekend but basically it is also a creature that has states of consciousness like all of us thank you very much uh christoph uh i'm sorry that we cannot do justice to all the questions there are many other uh questions here in the q a but i think that uh we went through some of the uh through some of the main ones uh christoph was kind enough to share his slides and you have access to those slides via uh via the web page uh for those of you who are interested in uh in christoph's uh uh conscious side or to be more precise his research on consciousness i i i cannot recommend enough uh many of his previous books as well as uh the latest one the feeling of life itself who's that he's pointing to right now and then there are several uh previous video lectures that he was uh gracious enough to to give uh both of mit as well as uh in woods hall so i want to thank christoph one more time and we're going to continue at uh 115 with alexander madre thank you very much christopher and we're exactly on time yes perfect thank you very much that's fantastic thank you thank you
