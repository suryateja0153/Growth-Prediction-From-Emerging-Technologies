  I'm David Shaw, and this is AI News. Millions of plant species exist in the world. And while we've identified a lot of them, there are still many that are unknown. The first step to identifying plants is to know their scientific name. After you know the name, the features of each plant species are categorized into things like family and class. So how can AI help? With a solution that can help identify plant anatomy. The solution is built using deep learning and computer vision algorithms. It's powered by the Intel distribution of OpenVINO Toolkit Model Optimizer. The primary objective of this project is to accurately classify plant species. The input can be an image, a video, or a live camera feed. This article walks you through every step from gathering the data to labeling pictures. It also includes the best ways to capture images or frames from a video or live camera feed, plant recognition using a TensorFlow classifier, and sampling images from the test run. You'll be able to see how the model has classified the plant types. This application can be helpful for modern day taxonomists, naturalists, and even enthusiasts. Plant taxonomy helps us understand the world around us. With the power of AI, just think about what we can learn in the future. Follow the links provided to read the article and learn how you can try plant recognition with AI. Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next week.
