 that's awesome to see you here I'm so excited to be back again at the World Science Festival and today we're going to talk about robots and AI and you know the first use of the word robot was in a play about mechanical men that were built to work on factory assembly lines in the play the robots eventually rebelled against their human masters the play was called are you are Rossum's Universal robots and it was written by a Czech playwright Carl Kay Peck in 1921 the word robot itself comes from the Czech word meaning slave today robots entertain us in movies like when we see c-3po who are r2d2 and many others robots help perform surgeries to heal us and even are part of prostheses they help explore far-off places like going to Mars if everybody remembers the Mars rovers there they do reconnaissance for us in battle areas and go to other dangerous places they also work in factories in fact some people worry about them taking our jobs or that will all become too technologically dependent someday in effect slaves to the robots in this fascinating session which is called to be or not to be Bionic on immortality and super humanism we're going to explore these intersections between humans and robots today and what we might all expect in the future and I'm going to enjoy welcoming our speakers to the stage our first participant is a professor of engineering and data science as well as director of the creative machines lab at Columbia University he's garnered a reputation for challenging the conventional view of robotics by designing self-aware and self-replicating robots please welcome HOD Lipson welcome hi thank you our next guest is assistant professor at Cornell Tech in the information science program as executive director of interaction design research at Stanford University she innovated systems to understand how humans and robots can interact most seamlessly she's new to New York City so please give a warm welcome to Wendy zoo next is Arthur Zittrain professor of bioethics and director of the Center for Bioethics at New York University's College of Public Health his research uses philosophic principles to study and examine the ramifications of emerging biomedical innovations please welcome s Matthew liao she's a film director known for her pioneering work in virtual reality she was Google's first filmmaker and worked with a team of engineers to help develop and field test the 16 camera live-action virtual reality gig and workflow now known as Google jump please welcome Jessica brillhart our final guest is a professor doing physics and AI research at MIT and advocates for positive use of technology as president of the future life Institute he's author of more than 200 technical papers and the New York Times bestseller life 3.0 being human in the age of artificial intelligence work that Stephen Hawking said would help a reader join quote the most important conversation of our time please welcome max tegmark so we're going to take on some heady and inspiring topics on stage with these wonderful panelists today max left on the stage but first I'm going to because with questions we've just talked about some fantastic ideas you know robots and superhuman ISM and so on but can you give us the lay of the land today where our robots an AI may be dominating and where is it that humans still have the upper hand yeah I think it's take a step back this is the world science festival you know it's interesting to see that after 13.8 billion years of cosmic history a lot of human history we used to think of basically everything the biological organisms did is something kind of mysterious that was probably beyond science even though we could understand how rocks moved and stuff and then gradually science figured out things about how muscles and so on worked and we built better muscles in Industrial Revolution started outsourcing that to machines but the mind still seemed very mysterious and gradually artificial intelligence research of course has been chipping away at that too now we get our posterior kicked and chess and then go and soon and driving and and so many other things and although we're very far away from being able to do everything that humans can do with our minds most AI researchers think that we're probably are going to get there in a matter of decades this is the holy grail known as artificial general intelligence and I think we'll talk a lot about if that'll happen and if so what we can do to make it good in the meantime what we have right now is a situation where we have very good narrow artificial intelligence it's much better than us it certain aero tasks like multiplying numbers fast and as I said playing certain games and dealing with massive databases and and increasing a long list of tasks and and we all feel how this is beginning to transform our our daily lives everything from GPS navigation to all the other interactions you have with computers and I think it's easy to underestimate the extent of it actually because as soon as something works machines can do it we stopped calling it AI we sort of define artificial intelligence flippantly is that which machines you know still still cannot do I think finally looking in the next five years ten years we're gonna see huge progress and particularly in the areas where you can make a lot of money off of it so we're gonna see real revolution in healthcare much better than diagnosed also more affordable so it can spread throughout the world and obviously in transportation the transportation sector but really throughout much of the economy I think in these narrower areas thanks a lot max it's really interesting to hear both about the progress of the human mind and understanding these sort of artificial minds and where that may take us how this sort of brings me to you so we've talked a little bit about the intellectual sphere in general artificial intelligence and so on but your work you work a lot about robot robot bodies can you tell us a little bit more about these sort of physical manifestations I think if you if you try to look sort of a long term where what are the next things that AI and robots have a hard time with and some of this is already bubbling in in academia hasn't quite made it into industry there are some areas one of them I think is this whole area of creativity one of these areas where we think we we humans are you know really have a hold on creativity and machines can analyze data but they can't really come up with ideas that's one of the things we're seeing already changing machines that can come up with ideas can can generate creative things anywhere from engineering designs to art and and everything in between so so creativity is one big area I still hear people saying as long as you're creative AI cannot touch you and we're we're you know we're safe and I think and think we're going to have to come to terms with that element as well but but then I think the next area where AI will have a hard time is the physical body so I like I like the analogy of HG Wells when he talked in the War of the Worlds about the aliens that they have not earned their place in the physical world the eye has also not earned its place in the physical world has not crawled through mud and rain and sand we have and AI can live in a computer but if you look at the state-of-the-art of physical robotics we are ages behind things like batteries and material science that aren't growing exponentially as software is so that's the one area where I think we will be safe for a while when you know computers will drive your computers pretty soon but when the car breaks down it's going to be human crawling around fixing it because computers can't do that yet so so the physical body is important then if I look beyond that the big place where the mind and the body come together is sentience and the ability of a machine to have a a concept of self emotions real emotions things like that and I think that that's where that's where things get really interesting and this current brings me to you to you Wendy I was thinking about something that I guess Maxon heart have touched on which is jobs and robots and jobs now what are the sorts of jobs that might be automated and what are human responses maybe to that that's such an interesting question you know about five years ago Lela Takayama and I I'm through this study asking you know we went through the the US Bureau of Labor Statistics like job descriptions and actually had people like rate the degree that people think that the robot could or should do these jobs and you know contrary to what I think anyone wants for their own job people really wanted in general for robots to do things instead of people instead of work with people so you're a job you would you might be willing to work with a robot other people's jobs would be created for robot would just do that but I wonder now if some of that logic might be changing what I think what we've seen in a lot of the recent developments is that AI robotics they work well where they have incredible limitations and you could say the same about people but a lot of the things that robots can do with people who really know how to work with what what's amazing and definitely that's the case with a I like all the the most successful chess playing is happening with these I guess they call them centaurs like there are people using AI as part of the strategy to win a chess game and so I think really what we should all be looking for it to think about how we could use these technologies to change our own jobs instead of worrying about the replacement question because I think the jobs that we have will all evolve to be in a place we're not it will be almost unrecognizable in five years so we've we've talked a little bit about you know robots and people how about robots with people you know what about this idea of Bionic modifications for humans you know robots a lot of times when we were watching I don't know I'd love to watch the you know the robot dog running around but they sometimes seem a little clumsy you know what if if human prospects for jobs dwindle or change you know what what should we do there so there's actually I I think another interesting area sort of robots in people and there right now there's already a lot of devices things like brain computer interface there's something called deep brain simulation and that's something this sort of it's basically you put a sort of thin electrode into your brain and it's connected to a battery pack and about a hundred thousand people today already were something like the deep brain simulation for things like Parkinson's disease for epilepsy for depression but right now the deep brain stimulation is it's kind of dumb it's a it's not a smart device in that it's a it's a it's an open system where you kind of have to modulate the electricity but you can imagine that in five years they right now DARPA is trying to make it into a closed system where they use artificial intelligence so that will monitor automatically monitor your brain activities and then kind of just modulate the brain activities in real time and so that's gonna be you know that's gonna raise all sorts of interesting ethical issues but just on the near-term some of the so I'm an emphasis I'm a philosopher so there are a lot of near-term ethical issues that we should be thinking about so like how do we program ethics into self-driving cars for example right so if the you know accidents are going to happen if the car is gonna go towards five people but you're in the car and then it can it can it's gonna kill those five people but you can the car can drive off the road killing you would you buy a car like that you know that would do that and who decides that who makes that kind of programming decision another near-term issue is going to be something like there's this idea of garbage in garbage out so at like the AI it's only gonna be as good as the data you give it and so if you have a lot of bias theta then that's going to give you very biased results and that's showing up for example already in so some people are trying to use artificial intelligence for sentencing to make you know sentencing decisions and but if you have a bias data that could give you very biased sentencing decision so just I'd like to come to you to follow up on these so we've looked a lot about well notice in a second trust me okay I like a lot about you know the human interactions and but I can't think of a more human response than how we respond you know in artistic ways and in other ways and and as we're talking about you know how were can extend human experience you work in VR and extending human sensory experiences that way now what are some of the sort of uniquely human characteristics you're you bring into your work house here I mean I think VR is very good at challenging human perception probably more than I mean it can extend it but I think the more interesting work in the virtual space and in the augmented reality space and in the AI space is how it kind of it challenges us and the notion of creativity it challenges us in the notions of perception it for me at least has made me question you know the very small sliver in which we can experience the universe and how limited that is can be both celebrated and used in narrative ways in the virtual space I find that the work that I've been able to do in bridging that more into like what is happening artistically with with neural networks and artificial systems has been really fascinating to me because it extends that kind of inquiry in the virtual reality space for sure is there anything that it's brought to you that you would suggest the audience who hasn't maybe experienced it that you couldn't have done any other way uh I mean we talked a lot about branching narratives this idea that it can permeate you know the mass amounts of permeations we can make with with where we're story could go things like that or every single choice that we make can have an actual result that the system then understands and creates and presents to you the idea of character that is driven by a is also very fascinating where the emotions and the intent and the friendship is all based upon how you treat it him or her I say it but you know again that might change and I think also the you know when we talk a lot the company that I started actually after working at Google a lot of what I think about is not so much the way that it's you know the idea of dualism or the binary especially given you know AI it's like evolution based upon getting away from the binary is really interesting and fascinating the idea that all of these technologies VR AI AR will come together and create kind of this new immersive world does new reality that exists for us that both again extends and challenges our ability to our abilities to perceive what it means to be human so we we've just thrown a lot of really fascinating ideas in the air and I wonder if if anybody in the audience would like to ask a question and if you would just say who you are and if your question is directed to somebody on the panel and specific please say that - I see one right in the front here well I hate to but I don't want to put a dark storm on things and I happen to know I think I know where max comes down on this so maybe other people wouldn't train it so we seem to be really good as humans at doing some really cool stuff but malevolence always ends up being present no matter how good we want to be or seem to be it seems like that's the elephant in the room as far as AI goes how do we prevent how do we how do we create a world where all these great things like you're talking about are going to be able to come to be one in fact it seems to me that just preventing the emergence of some malevolent AI on the world this seems to be the biggest challenge we face next you want to hit that feral hot yeah opportunity take a stab I think that the question is also not what AI will do to people but how people people will do the people using AI really that's that's of the shorter term much more urgent question if we get to the point where AI so clever that doesn't need us anymore that that's that's so far I mean we'll be lucky to pass that intermediate phase but where people have this incredible power so I think you're absolutely right there's this there's pros and cons I definitely believe that the benefits far outweigh the risks but there are risks and we should all be aware of them and and how we you know in general people the humankind has been able to use technologies for the better rather from the worse and there's always bad stuff happening but overall we're getting better at these things and and at least I'm optimistic that we'll be able to use this technology positively let me just try to add some optimism to this cheer you up because I think of course you're right that this we make technology evermore powerful it becomes ever more important that we win the wisdom race the race between the power of the technology right and the wisdom with which you're managing it you would never walk into a New York kindergarten with a box of hand grenades and say hey kids you know play with this because the wisdom just really isn't there and sometimes when I see how certain how our world politicians are handling handling hydrogen bombs I feel we've sort of repeated that kindergarten experiment there and I think we should try to do better with AI some of my colleagues are kind of gloomy and think there's some sort of law of nature that any technology that can be developed for harm for military purposes or harming people or whatever will be developed and it is there's nothing you can do about it I think that's manifestly wrong and we have evidence for it look look at the biology you know biology today mainly associated with new cures helping people live healthier longer lives not with bioweapons right why is that that's the technology we chose as a species not that great some sort of crazy arms race around why because a bunch of scientists in the 1970s pushed really hard to stigmatize this and got an international ban around this which has main biology the force for good that it is now and I'm quite hopeful that if we can similarly stigmatize bad uses of AI from Cambridge analytic to lethal autonomous weapons we can end up in a similar future where one day we look back and people will associate a AI with all sorts of ways of making the world better this is biology is today but we're gonna have to fight for it and work hard for it just like that I always just did because it's not gonna happen nobody fault when do you want to know I think there's two things to worry about one thing is malevolent actors and the second thing is just unintended consequences and actually for both things something that's very important is and this ability to simulate world and run small-scale tests and games a lot of times people like look down on games as something that's gonna waste of time or something you do for diversion but it's actually really important in situations like these where you don't actually know what the contingent behavior will result in in the larger emergent space to be able to run small-scale experiments and actually assign some people the job of playing the bad actors and then seeing how things unfold and I think we can't just tell everyone you have to behave ethically let's just do positive things we'll put down some regulations around it and hope for the best I actually think it's really important to be able to anticipate what are the negative things with some of the motivations for some of those things will be so that we can actually stay a step ahead and that also will help we're in situations where there's no malevolent actors at all that happens all the time where everyone is acting totally out of the goodness of their hearts is still terrible things happen yeah yeah I think it's important to run narrative through a lot of these systems I mean it's again it's the thing where like people don't like to talk about feelings or emotions or stories or any of that stuff but what what happens is that you see the permeations of where the stuff could go you understand more fully and more richly where where where things could go and I think we do ourselves a grave disservice if we don't start doing that more now when I agree with both of you said here I think it's so important to think through what can go wrong and and that is so often misunderstood as somehow scare mongering and you see so many silly news articles accusing some scientists of scare mongering for talking like this but this is just over at MIT called safety engineering like the moon mission NASA thought through what could go wrong if you put some astronauts on explosive fuel tanks and launched him into space there was a lot that could go wrong doesn't scare me I mean I was doing exactly what you were suggesting think through what can go wrong you know to make sure they can go right and I think we owe it to ourselves to think see what can go wrong way i exactly saw that it can become the force for good in the world that it has the potential to be I think max is exactly right we need to know you techno realists about these situations and realize the risks as well as the benefits and making sure that I do think that policy and regulations that you know sort of making sure that that's in place and globally as well because I think this technology has no borders and so it's something that we have to it's our society's our world it's our future we have to have a conversation about these issues so so I want to keep on this I love this this topic of so we talked about Oscar system we talked about us and then we talked about us versus us using them I think it'd be good to talk a little bit more about in so we're turning to our second act about creating robots in our own image and more maybe more exploring that and when yet I'd like to come to you to talk about your experiments okay with automata that are like household objects or furniture robots that blend in so that you can see what how humans respond to them and and how you know what if you found out about that or do you see yeah so right now in this moment I'm I'm probably most famous for the work I'm doing in autonomous people how people interact with autonomous cars but that actually comes from these experiments where we looked at how people interact with Ottomans that come up to your feet you know and try to get you to put their feet on them desk drawers where they you know the desk drawer might actually know what you're doing next and offer you tools a garbage cans that drive around and collect garbage and one of the things is that we find that people I feel very comfortable that some of the novelty effects that you see around other robots where people aren't used to seeing the object in space they're just like oh yeah it's a garbage can that's moving and and I think that like a level of acceptance is is very nice I'm when we interview people that we're like do you know what that is of like it's clearly a garbage can that's moving that's like it's just as happening now so one you know they they there there's not this kind of issue of like trust or fear and people understand but the thing that's really interesting is that they they have some instinctual model of intent so one of the things that we saw in some of the videos of experiments around was like it was like a kid waving a piece of garbage in front of the garbage can because he wanted the garbage can to be across the room and so he was trying to bait oh looks like I ran across the room and we're just like does the kid think the Kairos can wants to eat the garbage and so once we noticed that we actually saw all these other moments in the videos where people would like wave garbage and go like it's a dog treat ya like and so that's a inhuman human human robot interaction we often have this aged model or we think people interact with machines kind of like they're people and this is really different cuz nobody thinks the busboys wants to eat the garbage and so there's all the but everyone goes to that model like it's like an animal um and they clearly know it's not an animal they know it's a garbage can and so some of these things like the logic that we all fall to those are some of the things are trying to pull out because it's so useful as designers to build to use that when you're designing how things can move around people so those safe yeah I mean it's one thing I think to engage with the garbage can that you are attributing mm-hmm human behavior to but on how about you know you've seen people mapping human qualities onto robots and machines how you know with work with the work that you do in your lab now is that a problem I think it's you know it's a double-edged sword in one way it's a very empowering for the robot you can see you'll see situations where you know we've noticed in the lab it's enough to stick googly eyes onto an object already as you know can see intelligence there and emotions and it doesn't take a lot really to fool the human psyche in thinking that inanimate objects are intelligent and and in one way you can sort of exploit that because machines in invariably learn from interactions with the world and with humans and to the extent that people can interact with them in any way that they can elicit that interaction that's sort of bootstraps the whole AI process because it's all about collecting data and learning and we know that that even babies learn through interaction and baby might not know why they're smiling but that's Milo elicits more behavior and more interaction so I think we're seeing more and more of that with physical objects and there's something I would argue that is very magical about a physical object that is that is intelligent much more than avatar on the screen or even a VR to the extent we are today when there is something physical out there that is with you in this world and is is is there and and and potentially senses the same thing you sense there's there's this bonding that happens that makes makes that interaction ever so powerful but when do you know this gets creepy at a certain point for people right and there's something called the uncanny valley yeah that's about about that yeah there's there's something called an uncanny valley in in robotics which is that kind of maybe the naive sense is the more human-like something should be the better it would be and what roboticist discovered is that as you get closer to human length but not quite human-like it actually starts to be worse much worse people like get very creeped out and feel really uncomfortable and so so they you know this is this has been studied think map it a little bit so it's difficult to dimensionalize it but I thought the the hypothesis for why this is is because there are aspects where people you know in our evolutionary history where people might have psychological problems or you might have people who are like more sick and ill and don't behave quite right and sociologically that's a danger to everyone so you're very sensitive to things that are not quite normal and so as the robots start to look more like us but be it like when we start to become like really tuned into all these fine differences whereas if you can readily attribute like some other identification like it's not a person it's like a chair a robot then you you're not worried about that like maybe it's a sick person question how do you know how much human to put in that's such a great question I mean I don't know I my feeling is it's not it's an interesting research question but from a pragmatic standpoint is not necessary I think a lot of times the argument for making human-like robots is that well people know how to interact with people you know people also know how to interact what hundreds of thousands of objects you know and so kind of you know there's many other leaping off points that we could use I mean that this raises some ethical questions surely Matthew about humans and and robot interactions with the machines you know does it matter how humans treat the robots and they start to become more human yeah so in Japan there are actually a lot of sort of they have an aging population and a lot of elderly are now being taken care of by robots and it's becoming more so and one of the issues that they're facing right now is that some of the elderly are getting attached to these robots right and so there's this whole debate about you know because they make the robots kind of cute and they do smiley faces and so some of the elderly are and you know they have pet dogs and you know etc etc and that raises so some people are saying that you know we really need to make sure that the robots are very different from humans like so that people can recognize that they're just robots don't get attached to them but I think hots right that we're actually very easily fooled right and that it's very easy like especially once these robots get very sophisticated they can converse with you etc as I try you start to develop some they want to be taking taking care of by one robot rather than another robot is that right that's very you know it becomes very human very natural and so we need to think about those implications for you know when we actually deploy robots into the real world for elderly care as that try said I mean is it a bad thing necessarily if a person gets an attached to a by... I had stuffed animals when I was little like that you know yeah it's not a bad thing so I think that it's not so much of that thing I actually think that I'm less worried about it and part of the reason is that I think that the elderly especially the elderly population these there in these aging homes they don't have a lot of interactions with other people and they're it's you might think that you know if this can give them some sort of emotional comfort that's a net positive thing you might think that in addition to that you should just have that like they should also have more human interactions etc etc that's like they can have relation you know sort of human relationships as well like more people visiting them and things like that but if this these robots can help them in that way I think that that's a net positive thing I start to wonder if it's fair to the robots Yeah right Jessica does this make sense to you I'm looking at you watching everybody yes wandering out of it no I mean it's kind of like I really liked your question about that like I mean I feel like I've been reading a lot about you know gaming culture as well and the idea that you know people say the same thing about gaming you know like well you know they're obsessed with gaming is that a bad thing is that ruining their brains and so on and then you realize that the psychology around game addiction has everything to do with how bad their actual reality is it's not because the game is alluring and the game is wrong it's because the reality sucks so like suddenly you're like okay you know I don't have a job my you know boyfriend's mad at me this isn't true everything's fine you know like it's like it's just bad times or whatever people resort to games or someone will resort to a game because they feel like they're accomplishing something and they can get money and they can make friends and all this stuff and so there's really just an issue with the real stuff that's you know making the not so real but maybe should be realer stuff harder for that person to leave so I think you know in the case of you know someone who's elderly who has a robot friend who's taking care of her the fact that she doesn't have anyone who would take care of her otherwise I think it you know makes it totally okay for that elderly woman to be completely infatuated with her robot so I don't know I find I find that relationship sort of you know kind of what what was being said earlier just the the tension between like what's real and not real and maybe there isn't as much of a difference as we think yeah it's interesting it's a really interesting area I wonder I mean I'm sure trying to turn it to you in the audience again together listening to these thoughts you must have some questions so I'd love to invite people who have questions on their mind to share them now and you still have your question okay can we come back to the front first thank you for being patient what happens when the robots take over and they know everything and then you can't teach literally no ershon that was the greatest pessimistic yeah yeah instead of asking what will happen I think we should ask you what we want to happen right your parents know that one day you're gonna kind of and your generation will kind of take over from us right so they aren't just asking what's gonna happen when you grow up and take over there they're trying to educate you well and make sure that do you want to be nice to them when you're stronger than them and make sure that you have their best ideals and values and so on so if we ever do as a species create robots that have the ability to to take over I think we better educate them well to just like I'm sure your parents are doing with you it's a great question I'd like to maybe get on to our next act if you all don't mind which is and I'm gonna stay with you Jessica because I want to I want to look a little bit beyond human perception and we started to talk a little bit about your you know your work and you did a piece called deep dream VR which tries to start to get at the heart of the matter of machine creativity and from an engineering perspective it'd be great to hear how that the piece was created and the connection to recent advances and neural networks would you touched on before and I think we're gonna also oh yeah interesting for me to talk about this as you as you watch it so I worked you know again I was working with a VR team and filming a lot of things to test the rigs out and I put it to test the rig's out and I was working with I worked with this engineer Doug Fritz to have a system essentially dream on top of these VR images deep dream is I would say a system that's been trained a neural net that's been trained on a lot of images and then told to basically extrapolate what it sees within these images and so you know sometimes they're puppy slugs sometimes they're eyeballs sometimes they're houses and cars and so on and the reason we did this was because we just wanted to see what would happen and I and some of the results were actually pretty neat and some were a little frightening but the really what it was was like one of the first way that we brought in sort of artistic systems to to work with in the in the virtual reality space it takes a lot of processing power took us a long time to even get it to be in stereo which means that your left your right right I see a little bit differently so you see depth in these images as well this one in particular was filmed on Arecibo and this is the tram that you take up to the main platform it's the I guess it's the second largest radio telescope in the world now so you got snakes snakes on Arecibo that's gonna and I think you're gonna see some some kind of interesting stuff but basically you know I'm not I wish I knew more about the engineering up and I have to give Doug the credit for that but I will say that we basically were thinking about how you know creativity isn't inherently human but then as humans how we can work with machines to create and from an output standpoint it really kind of gave us sort of these ideas of like well maybe there are things within these images we just don't see with our eyes or hear with their ears and how we could potentially use artificial systems to help enhance that what's the next question you have that you might like to explore I think yeah I mean there's so many amazing things happening in the in the art kind of AI space it's like Mario Klinsmann is amazing he's been doing basically he's been training a system to create faces which again is is very kind of yeah but he got the eyes right so you see and he now you can actually film yourself an image the system extrapolates on top of your face and adds like Picasso to you and then like holes from different like Renaissance painters and suddenly you're everyone but no one at the same time it's really fascinating it also brings up the whole idea of like could you do that with a celebrity could you do that with like someone who's gone could you should you you know this whole kind of questioning of that as well but really another guy has actually taken your left and your right eye the way they see and switched it in a VR experience so now suddenly you're seeing things through different eyes but the way there's you know kind of like messing by PD and things like that it's really it's it's a wild world but I think I'm more interested in how to apply that functionally in some way and in a way that's a little bit more controlled like we have the capacity to futz with parameters in a way that changes something that's a puppy slug into a pagoda so knowing that what do we do and I think I'm really fascinated by where that could go it's really well yeah youth you in your lab you've had robots do some exploratory creative things like this even painting and so on could we hear a little bit more about yeah so so many different we have a robot that paints oil on canvas and actually that was motivated by by this brief episode in iRobot where the detective goes the robot to say can I can a robot turn a canvas into a painting and and I said well let's let's try that and so so there were not paints on its own initially was painting sort of more like you know it would see something for the live camera and paint it and it makes you know real oil on canvas now it's doing things like painting faces of people that it you know it just wanted our competition painting flowers that don't exist just out of its own imagination but and right now it is actually walking around somewhere in the world in through a street view having its own experiences and I'll come almost see what it's painted it's really it's really but I think I think generally it pushes our in a notion of art and and I can say that I've spoken about this robot a couple times and most people by now accept this idea that the machine can create art but the real controversial question is is it an artist and what I'm really excited about this is is there's no doubt that AI is moving towards a place where it can see the world in ways we can they can see the world in a broader swath of the spectrum you can see the world not with two eyes but with 20 eyes you can see the world in the dark in the radar and in it with senses we don't even have so what would a machine like that paint what how does it translate that experience and for me it's like going to an alien species and seeing what their art looks like I can't wait to see what this machine will create when it sees the world in ways I can't and never will be able to so to me it's a it's a new time for art and it's not just about tweaking some parameters and getting me to create better art or different art that's really to let the Machine create its own thing and see what it comes up with and maybe in the end it's going to be like explaining Shakespeare to a dog like we won't be able to understand it because we won't be able to have those sensations and it will be hopeless but it's it's a Expedition were thinking all right we'll be the dog I mean I'd love the idea that the aliens might be among us and there are some of the some of our creations you know how my machine consciousness or perception differ than from from humans can we speculate on it I think you know this it's a big debate of what is consciousness and and nobody knows and we cloak it with a lot of words but but nobody really has an idea of what's behind behind it but I think you know my model of it is is that a machine is sort of self-aware to something we were in it can model itself when it has the ability to simulate itself when it has the ability to take all that AI that we see today that is borrowing the world and turn it inside and the AI begins to model itself this is what we're trying to do in the lab we have very simple robots that model themselves and and I would argue again it's like you say it's not a binary thing self-consciousness is self-awareness the varies it's a very continuous spectrum and you can have very very simple machines that are that are very in a very crude way self-aware but that's what we're saying and and again when you combine that with creativity you really get to see how the machine might see itself through its own eyes and we'll see where that takes us I mean I feel like there's a perspective which really focuses on the interior life of people I actually argue maybe some of the ways that but we don't really know what's going on in each other's heads but we give each other the benefit of the doubt and I think a lot of that comes from the way that we end up interacting and if you feel like the interactions are while you kind of characterize that as intelligence okay so I think something going to use the term social intelligence we're really talking about like being empathetic and appreciating out of those feelings but I think a lot of it's actually about being able to do the day-to-day negotiation everyday life like I am still amazed because I'm trying to build robots that don't run into people how people are so good at you know actually negotiating passage through doorways and down hallways and it's not done the way that a lot of Robotics just want to solve these problems which is by predicting what the person is going to do and moving around that person because when you are in the space as a robot your very presence in all of your motions change what the people are going to do so the prediction is alone is not enough but there's that negotiation in a kind of online dialogue that happens to the motion is really important and I think what I would think would be real intelligence would be when people in robots are able to do this kind of real-time negotiation that we all do without even thinking about it and if it if it has no interior life but it can like not run into people in that way I think that would be intelligent to me it's it's interesting you say that too when I started in the VR space I was filming with a rake that looked very weird and he would bring this ring into the middle of like a room and he would film people like there was always this thing like yeah you just put in a milling room and it's fine but what they didn't think about was that how people regard the rake actually translates to help people regard you in the virtual space so you had people I actually filmed Google i/o and you had people go up to the rig and kind of blare at it and like check their watch and be like I don't want this and like walk away and you feel awful when you're in that experience you're just like this is terrible but it's that thing where it's like suddenly you're like okay well this thing has to actually look friendly like you can't just stick a bunch of GoPros on and expect anyone to be okay with this in the space and the idea of like live negotiation the things that we don't think about like just I used to actually sit under the rake so if everyone anyone was like that's weird they look down and I'd be like it's fine but yeah it's just the stuff you just don't think about I think the way that a robot sees itself and the way it sees other humans or other robots it's the same kind of AI it's the same kind of intelligence it's not separable the way we see ourselves and the way we see other people it's the same of ability so theory of mind and self-awareness are all very very close close to each other max we've been talking about these ideas social intelligence theory of mind perception and so on super intelligence what what is that could we see a crossing of the line to super intelligence so right now our own intelligence is really limited by what could fit through mommy's birth canal and our artificial intelligence is really limited by our own intelligence and ability to design it but if we can get to the point where machines are smart enough that they can help design ever better ones then pretty soon we're gonna be limited not by how clever we are but we're going to just be limited by the laws of physics which also sets limits on everything and that it's kind of refreshing if you're claustrophobic to realize that those limits are sky-high compared to today you sometimes read these articles in the newspapers about Moore's law is about to fizzle out whatever but all they're talking about there is that this particular technology the power is your cell phones today of shuffling electrons around in two dimensions to compute it's maybe hitting a little barrier and so we're gonna switch to yet another paradigm just like we switched away from punch cards and in the past and there's there's a really fascinating paper by Seth Lloyd where he just works out what are the limits from the laws of physics of how much compute power like one kilogram of stuff can have and it's it's about a million million million million million times above what your laptop can do today so just we could do so vastly more and I think the optimistic note to take away from this is that so if we can harness even a small fraction of the intelligence that's sort of latent in nature and tap into it and have it do good things for us then we're not in a zero-sum game anymore but we have to quibble about all this little piece of land belongs to my country not your country we can get so much more for everybody in terms of resources and in terms of solving the problems we face and if for some reason you want more still more resources than there are on earth of course where that server intelligence you can space travel is a walk in the park there's so much more we could do out there also so so super intelligence has inspired a lot of people that think hey maybe this is the next step in and in the development of life in the cosmos and at the same time of course being the most powerful technology ever invented it's also freaked a lot of people out and being where people say look wait a minute maybe we should like think this through a little bit first make sure it becomes becomes a good thing I personally share both the enthusiasm and the concern that we should think things through a little bit you know first fortunately I think we probably have if it may if you look at surveys of AI research I'm probably some decades and until something like this happens but there are a lot of questions we have to answer first which are really really hard so I think we should really invest heavily in researching these questions to get the answers by the time we need them rather than start working on them like the night before someone switches on a super incoming yeah cramming for the ultimate test this is a great point about asking questions and it reminds me that it's time for me to give you all an opportunity to ask the panel if you have any questions that are burning I see with close to the topic as stated in our title immortality' and super humanism and certainly immortality I've heard the debate whether that's even a good thing or not but certainly nobody I know is really looking forward to death so in at least an extending life where are we currently with being able to replace the parts on us that break down what parts are harder than others and where do we see this in the near future of where it's going with this idea of avoiding death at least a little bit longer when our bodies begin to break down and we replace them with artificial parts yeah I think I think yeah I just want to say that if you a lot of people ask you where's where's the bionics within my lifetime that's kind of the the the ultimate question right I think it femoral as a roboticist I can say that when it comes to sensors and actuators that's pretty close in other words you can pretty for sure replace things like ears eyes knees muscles these things that within reach and anywhere from bioprinting all the way to implants that improve your eyesight that's what then reach when it comes to things like improving your your ability to think to imagine that's a lot harder because we don't understand shove the code of how the brain works and not to say that it's impossible but that part is going to be tricky but there's then there's auxiliary things like using AI to edit the genome to eliminate diseases that kill a lot of people that kind of thing is some indirect it's not the bionics but it's indirect ways of extending life and I think we'll see we already seen the fruit of that and that will extend even more yeah so yeah just to chime in on this I think there are two approaches you can have a biological approach so they're stem celery embryonic stem cells we also know about sort of like telomere shortening as you know like cell death as that release a also people are trying to stop telomeres from you know getting shorter and shorter as a way of prolonging life and then that the you know using CRISPR as a Gmail eating tool might enable us to just sort of even without getting the Bionic sort of as a way of sort of expending life and then there's the Bionic aspect which is I think a lot of people are interested in things like artificial neurons right so again DARPA the Defense Advanced projects research agency is interested in sort of their sort of their building prosthetic memories they're kind of you know people are coming with damaged memories and they're trying to create artificial neurons to replace and if that were possible then you can I think that's probably gonna be the hardest part so we can replace hearts and limbs and stuff like that but the brain is probably the hardest part to replace and but if you can start to build artificial neurons and if they can function in a very similar way as you know biological neurons then you're gonna you know that's going to be another way of sort of giving into life extension there's this thing that we haven't talked about yet which is so we've been talking in the side of the machines becoming more human and how we're responding to that but how about if we decide we want to continue on through something like a brain upload next what is that what is a brain up well coming back to exactly where we started this insight that maybe intelligence and consciousness is not something mysterious that can only exist in meat blobs but actually maybe it's all about information processing we now know that you know it only takes two gigabytes to store your entire DN DNA code like a typical movie download there's not no big deal and it takes about a hundred terabytes to store all the information in your brain so if it's really the information processing that's that matters only well what why do we need did it have it done and meat blobs Ray Kurzweil for example would love to upload himself into a robot before his biological body gets too old so he can keep living on is this science or science fiction as a physicists I'm a blob of quarks and electrons there's no doubt about that and there's nothing special about my quirks they're the same kind of up course sound quirks that make up that made the chair and everything else in here so it's absolutely possible are we gonna figure out how to do it in our lifetime I think it's actually gonna be much harder to figure out how our brain does intelligence then it's going to be to build artificial intelligence and can do all those same things just like it turned out to be much harder to figure out how to build a mechanical bird then to build an airplane if you've seen the TED talk of the mechanical bird and that's great but it took a hundred years longer than the the Wright brothers and if we succeed in building artificial general intelligence even super intelligence you know if that actually happens in the 30 years you're still young and healthy because you keep going to the gym right then there's no particular reason why one couldn't use that technology to figure out how to do uploading and all these other things that that we want to do and just a little word of warning it you you define consciousness there is self as a model of self i I like more the definition of consciousness of David Chalmers here at NYU gives a simply subjective experience you know I experience now when I Drive no colors and sounds and so on motions that I don't know if for self-driving car experience is anything and before you upload yourself or after you've uploaded yourself into this robot you know the Robo Christina that looks like you and talks like you before you switch on your off your biological body body I think you should make sure that you understand whether it's actually having a subjective experience or it's just a mindless zombie talking and I thinking like you because in the latter case it would be kind of a bummer if you switch yourself off because that's it you know and and I think this is a great challenge for scientists to try to figure out the ultimately which information processing feels conscious and after I'd love your thoughts yeah see you so there are sort of metaphysical and philosophical issues about uploading so one issue one question is going to be suppose you can do that you upload your consciousness onto some sort of you know Hardware one issue is going to be whether that thing is going to be you right and you might think it's not because well just imagine a case where you upload it but you're still there you're still kind of standing so which one is you you know it's gonna be the wet where you know it's the meat blob you know that's gonna be you rather than the thing that's uploaded and so if that's not going to be you it's gonna be a bit of a problem I mean I'll have qualitatively you know your qualitative characteristics etc etc but if it's not gonna be you do we you know it's great if your twin is sort of continuing to survive but it's not gonna be you living you know like you're not gonna survive forever and so there's gonna be if I mean there gonna be other way if you won't care about your own survival that you might have to think about other ways besides uploading and one possibility is something that people are talking about which is gradual replacement it's what I was talking about earlier where you gradually replace your neuron one by one and there you might be able to survive and then there's gonna be also ethical issues right with with respect to mortality do we want to live forever so we were talking about this earlier in the in a back room and a lot of people say no death could actually be a good thing because you know it's good to have deadlines right it's good to have you know it's it's nice that this session there's a there's a beginning people get really excited right and then there's a middle and then there's an end like you know but imagine if you know there was in the beginning to this session you could just come in anytime you know for the next hundred years right and then there's no end you know just go on and on you know it seems like it like you know a lot of projects a lot of human projects lose their urgency when there's no deadlines when there's no time limit to that thing and so some people were philosophers worried about that they worried that you know immortality you might get really boring right and they also worried about and then another issue is sort of you know if you can live forever how is that gonna affect your relationship you know so imagine you're 200 years old that means your children's gonna be a hundred eighty years old that means you're their grandchildren's gonna be a hundred sixty years old or something like that right and so what's what's that relationships got gonna be like you know between you and your great-grandchildren who's 140 years old you know so those are things that we should we need to think about once we can extend life longer we'll have to think about it so I I can feel that an urgency in the audience to ask a question or two and I think we have we have a couple minutes left I want to go to the back or toward the back of the room there's a there's a man with his hand do you think computing technology whether it's AI or prosthetics or virtual reality will be a social equalizer and helping people who have been left behind catch-up in certain ways or will it increase inequality in terms of opportunities and resources I know the work that I did at Google which I hope they're still doing is is really trying to get like when VR was sort of beginning like the creators you know working in the film I worked in the film world before then I can tell you there are many of biases about the film world that I didn't want to be reintroduced to this new medium that was coming up and so a lot of my work you know was in an effort to try to get this into the hands of people who didn't who should be using this technology are usually the last to get it thinking about accessibility you know creating VR experiences from the ground up that actually think about those who are deaf think about those who have you know seeing disability as well people who we usually think of second and actually create experiences from the ground up thinking about them first so really trying to figure out ways that we could we could approach that it's slow-going but I think especially in the VR community there is a lot of like there are a lot of great you know women creators out there people of color as well equipment being brought to communities so that they can tell their own stories instead of you know other filmmakers going in and doing the whole cultural appropriation thing all over again you can't control all of it you know you there's it's just things come through and seep in and it's hard to manage that I will say that like you know recently I looked I was asking a friend being like who's doing really cool art in the the AI space right now people I should look at and they're all dudes so you know it's hard and I think that again there's an if there is inherent bias in data there just is like people not everyone has access to the Internet not everyone's giving their data you know like it's what you know the idea of a system training itself is interesting but then is it human if there's no human data it like it's that kind of weird it's it's tricky we have a lot of mess and all of this I think I think that the the general trend is is in in equalizer because you can see for example medical application the max mentioned earlier if you have an app that can diagnose cancer and now you don't need to go to the doctor don't have to have access you don't have to pay to a doctor anybody ever on the planet can have access to this technology because it's in your phone that means more people will get diagnosed that's the beginning we're seeing that everywhere is driverless cars but a lot of people in rural areas to have the kind of mobility that right now only people in Manhattan have so I think in general we're seeing more equalization but of course it's going to be rough that's gonna be ups and downs but that's it I think the general trend I could talk about this all night in fact if it was a couple hundred years I wouldn't I love the idea of leaving on a on a hopeful note and this particular bag of quarks and electrons hopes that we do win the wisdom race as a group in grappling with these amazing technologies could you all join me in thanking the panelists our you
