 neuromorphic engineering also known as neuromorphic computing is a concept developed by carver made in the late 1980s describing the use of very large-scale integration VLSI systems containing electronic analog circuits to mimic neurobiological architectures present in the nervous system in recent times the term neuromorphic has been used to describe analog digital mixed-mode analog digital VLSI and software systems that implement models of neural systems for perception motor control or multi-sensory integration the implementation of neuromorphic computing on the hardware level can be realized by oxide based memristors spintronic memories threshold switches and transistors a key aspect of neuromorphic engineering is understanding how the morphology of individual neurons circuits applications and overall architectures creates desirable computations effects how information is represented influences robustness to damage incorporates Learning and Development adapt to local change plasticity and facilitates evolutionary change neuromorphic engineering is an interdisciplinary subject that takes inspiration from biology physics mathematics computer science and electronic engineering to design artificial neural systems such as vision systems head AI systems auditory processes and autonomous robots whose physical architecture and design principles are based on those of biological nervous systems topic examples as early as 2006 researchers at Georgia Tech published a field programmable neural array this chip was the first in a line of increasingly complex arrays of floating gate transistors that allowed programmability of charge on the gates of MOSFETs to model the channel ion characteristics of neurons in the brain and was one of the first cases of a silicon programmable array of neurons in November 2011 a group of MIT researchers created a computer chip that mimics the analog ion based communication in a synapse between two neurons using 400 transistors and standard CMOS manufacturing techniques in June 2012 spintronic researchers at Purdue presented a paper on the design of a neuromorphic chip using lateral spin valves and memristors they argue that the architecture works similarly to neurons and can therefore be used to test methods of reproducing the brains processing in addition these chips are significantly more energy efficient than conventional ones research at HP Labs on memristors has shown that while they can be non-volatile the volatile behavior exhibited at temperatures significantly below the phase transition temperature can be exploited to fabricate an Aristo a biologically inspired device that mimics behavior found in neurons in September 2013 they presented models and simulations that show how the spiking behavior of these nura stirs can be used to form the components required for a Turing machine NeuroGrid built by brains in silicon at stanford university is an example of hardware designed using neuromorphic engineering principles the circuit board is composed of 16 custom-designed chips referred to as neuro cause each neuro cause analog circuitry is designed to emulate neural elements for 65536 neurons maximizing energy efficiency the emulated neurons are connected using digital circuitry designed to maximize spiking throughput a research project with implications for neuromorphic engineering is the human brain project that is attempting to simulate a complete human brain in a supercomputer using biological data it is made up of a group of researchers in neuroscience medicine and computing Henry Markram the project's co-director has stated that the project proposes to establish a foundation to explore and understand the brain and its diseases and to use that knowledge to build new computing technologies the three primary goals of the project are to better understand how the pieces of the brain fit and work together to understand how to objectively diagnose and treat brain diseases and to use the understanding of the human brain to develop neuromorphic computers that the simulation of a complete human brain will require a supercomputer a thousand times more powerful than today's encourages the current focus on neuromorphic computers 1.3 billion dollars has been allocated to the project by the european commission other research with implications for neuromorphic engineering involves the brain initiative and the TrueNorth chip from IBM neuromorphic devices have also been demonstrated using nano crystals nano wires and conducting polymers until unveiled its neuromorphic research chip called Loihi in October 2017 the chip uses an asynchronous spiking neural network SNN to implement adaptive self-modifying event-driven fine-grained parallel computations used to implement learning and inference with high efficiency topic neuro memory Steve Systems neuro memory Steve systems are a subclass of neuromorphic computing systems that focus on the use of memristors to implement neuroplasticity while neuromorphic engineering focuses on mimicking biological behavior neuro memory Steve systems focus on abstraction for example a neuro memory Steve system may replace the details of a cortical micro circuits behavior with an abstract neural network model there exist several neuron inspired threshold logic functions implemented with memristors that have applications in high-level pattern recognition applications some of the applications reported recently include speech recognition face recognition and object recognition they also find applications in replacing
