 Hi everyone my name is Ted I'm product manager of IEI so today I would like to introduce our new AI computing system to our audiences so these AI computing systems are RACK-500AI and PAC-400AI system solutions so for the RACK-500AI it uses the PICMG 1.3 full-size card with the full-size card backplane and the PAC-400AI is using the HPCIe-C236 PICMG half-size card it uses the PICMG 1.3 full-size card and another is x4 slot so this is the best combination and solution to the user and this AI system is using the Skylake and Coffee Lake Xeon CPU and Coffee Lake CPU can support ninth-generation i9 CPU both of these systems also can be installed with NVIDIA GPU solution and the Intel Movidius card FPGA card and VPU card For the verticals and applications for the RACK-500AI and PAC-400AI they can be used in factory automation AI computing system and machine automation so these systems above are very multiple functional and can be used in very common space like infrastructure space system so for the RACK-500AI system let us take a look for these features it uses Intel Coffee Lake C246 chipset with Xeon CPU and integrated one front-accessible 3.5-inch HDD and another hard disc drive capacity for this system and integrated one PCIe x16 slot and another is PCIe x4 slot for expansion cards and the PCIe add-on cards so for RACK-500AI it has very great flexibility hardware expansion solution for the user so let's go to the RACK-500AI specification RACK-500AI chassis has very common design and stylish design we use navy blue and black color as our system color and the CPU we use Xeon E-2176G CPU it is 80 TDP watts for the CPU used and chipset we use C246 also it supports 9th generation Intel i9 CPU so for the I/O interface we also integrate Ethernet LAN ports two ports and USB 3.1 and the COM ports inside the motherboards you can also do an expansion and for the reliability for operating temperature we can support -20°C to 50°C for the storage temperature you can support -30°C to 60°C for the weight of the RACK-500AI is around 8 kg and for software operating system it can support Microsoft Windows 10 and Linux so for the power input we also integrate ATX power like 350 watts as the ATX power inside the RACK-500AI for the power supply for the motherboard inside the RACK-500AI that is SPCIE-C246 SPCIE-C246 is our PICMG 1.3 full-sized card with the Xeon CPU solution and can support two USB 3.1 Gen 1 and two LAN ports, HDMI display and another feature of this board is it can support one internal DP port for the display and another side of the board it's also integrated with M.2 M-key for storage and SATA 6Gb/s four DDR4 can support ECC and non-ECC DDR4 for the backplane in the RACK-500AI we also integrate the PICMG 1.3 full-size card as our backplane we also integrate one PCIe x16 slot and another one is x4 slot on the backplane design so the main function for the PCIe slots is they can be used for many kinds of PCIe add-on cards and some accelerator cards graphic cards and PCIe cards LAN cards, etc. so for the x16 slot it also can be compatible with x8, x4, and x1 cards so let's go through the PAC-400AI system PAC-400AI-C236 is already integrated Intel Skylake C236 chipset with Xeon CPU and we also design one 8cm hot-swappable fan inside the system and we integrate one PCIe x16 and another is one PCIe x4 Gen 3 expansion slot for add-on cards and PAC-400AI has a compact size chassis design for the system and it's a great flexible hardware expansion solution so for the detailed specification of the PAC-400AI we use the design of navy blue and black as our system color so for the chassis construction we use the heavy duty metal as our design and the CPU we use the 80W TDP CPU and for the Ethernet, we have two LAN ports and two USB 3.1 ports and we have also integrated two USB 2.0 so for the reliability the operating temperature for the system is around 0°C to 50°C and the storage temperature is 0°C to 60°C so for the operating system we can support Microsoft Windows10, Linux and a power input is also integrated inside the system as ATX power we have 250 watts as the power supply so for the motherboard of PAC-400AI this is our standard product HPCIE-C236 so HPCIE-C236 is a PICMG 1.3 half-size card we also integrate functions like two SATA 6Gb/s and two COM ports and two LANs one VGA display and two USB 3.1 Gen 1 ports so for another feature of this motherboard is it can support PCIe mini slot to provide mSATA and USB signal for full-size and half-size SSD and wireless LAN card for the users for the backplane inside the PAC-400AI we integrate HPE2-3S1 that is a backplane for supporting one PCIe x16 slot and another is one PCIe x4 slot for installing many kinds of PCIe cards likes accelerator cards, VPU and GPU cards for the PCIe x16 it also can be downward compatible with PCIe x8 and x4 and x1 signal for the interface so now let's go to the product demo let us take a look for the product so this is our RACK-500AI RACK-500AI is integrated with one motherboard this is the SPCIE-C246 this is a PICMG 1.3 full size card it can support four DDR4 non-ECC and ECC supported for inside the system we also can put three cards and one motherboard and two PCIe cards so as you can see inside the RACK-500 this is our Mustang-V100 accelerator card so you can remove it to install another graphic card like NVIDIA solutions so this NVIDIA 1070 GPU card you can put it to the x16 slot it's very easy to install and you can provide power to the GPU card so this card is very long but you also can put it in the RACK-500AI so this is a very compact size so for another one you also can use another PCIe card or add-on card totally you can put two add-on cards inside the RACK-500AI in front of the chassis design we also have a swappable fan design you can remove it and clean it for the power supply we also integrate a 350W power supply inside the RACK-500AI so the next one let's take a look of the PAC-400AI this is PAC-400AI PAC-400AI has very compact design with an 8cm swappable fan you can remove it and install it and we have HPCIE PICMG 1.3 card as our motherboard inside the system and also you can see that our motherboard can support two LAN ports one VGA port and two USB ports so inside the chassis we've already installed a GPOE card for the PoE functions and one is the NVIDIA GPU card for half-size card you also can put it in the system so this is a very compact size and easy installation solution so this is the PAC-400AI so let's go back to this presentation so I want to introduce the compatible add-on cards for the RACK-500AI and PAC-400AI we have GPOE-2P and 4P cards 2P can totally support 2P and can support up to 60 watts and the 4-port can support up to 90 watts also you can use the NVIDIA GTX card as the GPU card inside the RACK and PAC systems so this is the PCI expansion card for another kinds of card like QNAP SSD expansion card and IEI Mustang-F100 FPGA card Mustang-V100 VPU card and the GT1030 GPU card from the NVIDIA solution so if you want to know more about our products you can visit IEI official website or contact us you can
