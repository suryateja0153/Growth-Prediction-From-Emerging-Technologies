 [Music] i chose the door degree in engineering and it jcu because of the hardware and the software side so the engineering degree to me offered experience in hardware development so that may be circuit design and implementation whereas the it degree offered experience in software development so programming all that kind of stuff i chose to study engineering and i.t at jcu because of the small class sizes and the practical hands-on experience perhaps my favorite subject in the dual degree was computer interfacing and control so in this subject we got to implement our own project on an embedded system in particular my group worked on a remote current sensor the actual implementation of the project from start to finish programming the chip trying to design it actually soldering at the end was really cool seeing it all come together during my undergraduate studies i was part of the jc robotics club so this was a social club which was for all engineering students and within that club i joined what is called the ieee circuits and systems society one of the things i did when i was in the jcu robotics club was attend the ieee extreme programming challenge which is a hackathon for 24 hours where you have to come up with innovative ideas to new challenges for me it's been hugely beneficial so over the past couple of years i've received various travel grants to different conferences in america japan italy and i've recently received the pre-doctoral grant which has allowed me to perform research at the marx institute in sydney the final year of my engineering degree i did a thesis project and that is a one-year research project and mine was on neuromorphic engineering which is an emerging field which takes in the hardware design and the software design so the engineering and the i.t sites specifically it's bio-inspired computing so for my undergraduate thesis i was lucky enough to develop neuromorphic systems which emulated the biophysical processes of neurons and synapses in the brain using hardware so the analogy that i like to use is that computers are very good at doing a small subset of tasks for example arithmetic but we're good at doing a diverse range of things that are very hard to do using a computer so neuromorphic brings it together by trying to replicate these processes that are happening in our brain using circuitry or using hardware i enjoyed my undergraduate thesis so much that the next natural progression for me was to do further research and in my particular case i chose to do a phd at james cook university my phd encompasses different aspects of neuromorphic engineering and artificial intelligence so in addition to trying to implement biologically inspired circuits and systems a large portion of my phd isn't about artificial neural network acceleration or conventional ai the specific goals of my phd are to minimize these deep learning systems and to put them on smaller devices so to minimize the power utilization required for them in the space required after i started my phd i applied for the ibm phd fellowship which is an insanely competitive international fellowship and i was lucky enough to be a recipient of it so next year i have an opportunity to do an internship in person at the ibm research centre in zurich i'd really like to work as a research scientist after i finish my degree
