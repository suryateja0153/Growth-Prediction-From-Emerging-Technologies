 a science or SCN says computationally intensive science that is carried out in highly distributed Network environments or science that uses immense datasets that require grid computing the term sometimes includes technologies that enable distributed collaboration such as the access grid the term was created by John Taylor the director general of the United Kingdom's Office of Science and Technology in 1999 and was used to describe a large funding initiative starting in November 2000 science has been more broadly interpreted since then as the application of computer technology to the undertaking of modern scientific investigation including the preparation experimentation data collection results dissemination and long-term storage and accessibility of all materials generated through the scientific process these may include data modeling and analysis electronic digitized laboratory notebooks wore and fitted datasets manuscript production and draft versions pre prints and print and/or electronic publications in 2014 I Tripoli a science conference series condense the definition to essence promotes innovation in collaborative computationally or data intensive research across all disciplines throughout the research lifecycle in one of the working definitions used by the organizers east science encompasses what is often referred to as big data which has revolutionized science such as the Large Hadron Collider LHC at CERN that generates around 780 terabytes per year highly data-intensive modern fields of science less than pre greater than slash pre greater than dot dot that generate large amounts of e science data include computational biology bioinformatics genomics and the human digital footprint for the social sciences Turing Award winner Jim Gray imagined data intensive science or science Aza fourth paradigm of science empirical theoretical computational and now data-driven and asserted that everything about science is changing because of the impact of information technology and the data deluge east science revolutionizes both fundamental legs of the scientific method empirical research especially through digital big data and scientific theory especially through computer simulation model building these ideas were reflected by the White House's office and Science Technology Policy in February 2013 which slated many of the aforementioned e science output products for preservation and access requirements under the memorandums directive East sciences include particle physics earth sciences and social simulations topic characteristics and examples most of the research activities in tui science have focused on the development of new computational tools and infrastructures to support scientific discovery due to the complexity of the software in the backend infrastructure Ulrich's East science projects usually involve large teams managed and developed by research laboratories large universities or governments currently there is a large focus in East science in the United Kingdom where the UK e science program provides significant funding in Europe the development of computing capabilities to support the CERN Large Hadron Collider has led to the development of e science and grid infrastructures which are also used by other disciplines Topic consortiums examply science infrastructures include the

Sainsbury and the Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown bid to him Treasury to fund a program of the infrastructure development for science which would provide the foundation for UK Science and Industry to be a world leader in the knowledge economy which motivated the Lisbon strategy for sustainable economic growth that the UK government committed to in March 2000 in November 2000 John Taylor announced 98 million pounds for a national UK science program an additional 20 million pounds contribution was planned from UK industry and matching funds to projects that they participated in from this budget of 120 million pounds over three years 75 million pounds was to be spent on grid application pilots in all areas of science administered by the Research Council responsible for each area while 35 million pounds was to be administered by the EPSRC as a core program to develop industrial strength grid middleware phase 2 of the programme for 2004 to 2006 was supported by a further 96 million pounds for application projects and 27 million pounds for the EPSRC core program phase 3 of the programme for 2007 to 2009 was supported by a further 14 million pounds for the EPSRC core program in a further sum for applications additional funding for UK e science activities was provided from European Union funding from university funding council s RI F funding for hardware and from disk for networking and other infrastructure the UK e science programme comprised a wide range of resources centers and people including the National II Science Centre NESC which is managed by the

science program was reviewed on its completion in 2009 by an international panel led by Daniel E Atkins director of the Office of cyber infrastructure of the US NSF the report concluded that the program had developed a skill pool of expertise some services and had led to cooperation between academia and industry but that these achievements were at a project level rather than by generating infrastructure or transforming disciplines to adoptee science as a normal method of work and that they were not self sustainable without further investment topic United States United States based

University topic versus traditional science traditional science is representative of two distinct philosophical traditions within the history of science butthey science it is being argued requires a paradigm shift and the addition of a third branch of the sciences the idea of open data is not a new one indeed when studying the history and philosophy of science Robert Boyle is credited with stressing the concepts of skepticism transparency and reproducibility for independent verification in scholarly publishing in the 1660s the scientific method later was divided into two major branches deductive and empirical approaches today a theoretical revision in the scientific method should include a new branch Victoria stood an advocate s that of the computational approach where like the other two methods all of the computational steps by which scientists draw conclusions are revealed this is because within the last twenty years people have been grappling with how to handle changes in high performance computing and simulation as such a science aims at combining both empirical and theoretical traditions while computer simulations can create artificial data and real time big data can be used to calibrate theoretical simulation models conceptually East science revolves around developing new methods to support scientists in conducting scientific research with the aim of making new scientific discoveries by analyzing vast amounts of data accessible over the Internet using vast amounts of computational resources however discoveries of value cannot be made simply by providing computational tools a cyber infrastructure or by performing a predefined set of steps to produce a result rather there needs to be an original creative aspect to the activity that by its nature cannot be automated this has led to various research that attempts to define the properties that he science platforms should provide in order to support a new paradigm of doing science and new rules to fulfill the requirements of preserving and making computational data results available in a manner such that they are reproducible in traceable logical steps as an intrinsic requirement for the maintenance of modern scientific integrity that allows an extenuation of Boyle's tradition in the computational age topic modeling EES science processes one view argues that since a modern discovery process instant serves a similar purpose to a mathematical proof it should have similar properties namely it allows results to be deterministically reproduced when re executed and that intermediate results can be viewed to aid examination and comprehension in this case simply modeling the provenance of data is not sufficient one has to model the provenance of the hypotheses and results generated from analyzing the data as well so as to provide evidence that support new discoveries scientific workflows have thus been proposed and developed to assist scientists to track the evolution of their data intermediate results and final results as a means to document and track the evolution of discoveries within a piece of scientific research topic science 2.0 other views include science 2.0 where science is considered to be a shift from the publication of final results by well-defined collaborative groups towards a more open approach which includes the public sharing of raw data preliminary experimental results and related information to facilitate this shift the science 2.0 view is on providing tools that simplify communication cooperation and collaboration between interested parties such an approach has the potential to speed up the process of scientific discovery overcome problems associated with academic publishing and peer review and remove time and cost barriers limiting the process of generating new knowledge topic see also citizen science cyberinfrastructure distributed computing he research a science librarianship ease social science grid computing science 2-0
