 [Music] it's my pleasure to introduce our next speaker thomas caulfield he's ceo of global foundries and for those who might not be aware of global foundries they're the premier specialty global fab on the planet and what they do is they make the chips that go inside products that i'm sure you would be aware of but i probably can't talk about yeah and having met tom in the past i mean what a terrific uh spokesperson for innovation for entrepreneurship uh just always been very impressed with tom and i'm certain that you will be too so tom we're looking at hearing from you now hi i'm tom caufield ceo of global foundries you know gf is one of five major semiconductor foundries supporting this amazing half a trillion dollar semiconductor industry which we all know is vital not only to the world's 85 trillion dollar economy but to humanity let me take a moment to you a little bit more perspective on gf essentially we add all the rich features to electronic devices take handsets for example mobile devices we we create the chips through our customers that make them connect to the baseband that enable the image sensor for the cameras that make the audio work that provide secure transactions the touch screen works yes it's very important that these devices have great brains in them but they need the silicon to bring the features to life and that's what gf does in this industry now like most industries our semiconductor energy has has had to respond to the uncertainty and challenges posed by the covet 19 pandemic for gf our amazing worldwide team of some 15 000 employees has responded to these challenges and i'm proud of them and i'm proud to report our operations and business has delivered to all our customers worldwide in unprecedented fashion while maintaining maintaining the safety of each other and the communities in which our teams live safety has been our number one priority you know a year ago at this time i may have been presenting to you on a stage today this pandemic is forcing us to rethink the way we communicate and the way we do business you know more to the point the covet 19 crisis has accelerated the shift to digital transformation as we have all discovered that remote work once considered a fallback once considered the alternative option only if needed can be implemented real time and at scale for the enterprise it's not only to help us cope with the social distinct measures associated with this pandemic but how to become more agile productive and inclusive in the post pandemic world now the very notion of the enterprise network and its relationship to the public and hybrid cloud architectures is being reimagined in real time as we sit through this pandemic and through the lens of this healthcare crisis it's clear we need to widely distribute networks because employees are no longer always present in their enterprise in their company's walled garden of connected security but instead they're logging in from everywhere in the world remotely via a vpn using multiple networks not protected by the company's security this is the opportunity covet 19 has presented to the semi industry this is the catalyst to accelerate the world's next digital transformation so before we go forward and think about the future let's take a step back and reflect and look where we came from for economies to be competitive for economies to be considered first world a policy focused on building physical infrastructure has always been necessary it's foundational infrastructure enables trade powers businesses delivers workers to their jobs creates opportunities for communities you know in a phrase for me it's it's connecting humanity the physical infrastructure projects depicted in this chart have powered the worldwide economy throughout the 20th century investments both public and private range from telecommunications freight railroads energy generation and distribution pipelines roads for transportation water and parks during the 20th century discontinuities or in vets catalyzed or accelerated investment for example the great depression created the public work program the cold war accelerated interstate highway system presently the u.s alone invests about a half a trillion dollars a year in infrastructure and the covet 19 stimulus programs and debate could accelerate that infrastructure investments by adding up to 1.5 trillion dollars over the next five years and for good reason we need gdp growth and historically gdp has grown one point for every one percent increase in infrastructure investments in the 21st century the world will continue to rely on infrastructure to drive the worldwide economy by connecting humanity only now a disproportionate amount of the infrastructure investments will move from the physical to the digital 5g for high-speed networking communications allowing networks to handle a hundred times the number of connected devices than today low earth orbiting satellites to enable high speed access for developing countries and rural communities this enhanced connectivity will help enable future connected capabilities such as intelligent autonomous transportation and the impact to the world economy will be significant you know a world bank study showed that 10 percent increase in broadband access delivers 1.3 percent increase in gdp and in developing countries the ratio is even higher the gdp growth is excess of four times higher so covet 19 has demonstrated how vital and paramount digital connectivity is to humankind's very existence from education to governing to running businesses remotely to shopping and perhaps this present time connectivity is playing the most central role in combating the pandemic at the same time we have stressed the digital infrastructure we live with today and have exposed and highlighted critical weaknesses for example quality speed bandwidth and deployment 53 of the world's population did not have access to internet the societal need for a broader and more capable modern digital infrastructure namely 5g has been accelerated what does this acceleration look like well here's a few statistics and one of the most major internet exchanges in sao paulo is dealing with a 30 increase or jump in traffic you know some 99.55 terabits per second we see a 700 increase in remote access connections to corporate servers a 60 percent increase in upstream data traffic but here's the point it's not the statistics this is not a blip or a spike this is an offset to the monotonic increase of internet use it's here to stay and the rate of growth will now accelerate on top of that discontinuity i say this because i see it in every day in the world at gf and in my personal life you know we're creatures of habit for example even though we had this ability to connect remotely we never really took advantage of it it was always our backup our fallback not the front-up plan we did we always did just more of it we commuted to the workplace every day we fly somewhere in the world weekly to visit teammates customers or suppliers you name it we did not change our life habits significantly or as fast as the digital world was making connectivity and productivity available for us to leverage well covet 19 has challenged our beliefs our self-imposed myths on how we work engage and connect we now believe we can be more efficient and productive as a result of the acceleration of the digital transformation now that we got a taste of how to capitalize it this is not or no different than our forbearers who saw that change in life with the physical infrastruc transformation that took place in the 20th century the so-called new normal is not because we cannot go back to the normal because we see there's a better normal ahead and herein lies the opportunity created by the covet 19 3 trench so what are these three mega trends from gf's point of view well the first is frictionless networking an always on seamless intelligent and secure connection that makes the right choices for you making you more efficient your vital connectivity security guard and digital personal assistant always at the ready another one is virtualization which is enabled by a high-speed backbone of compute storage and connectivity essentially sharing of large-scale digital infrastructure for efficiency the future is in data we've heard it often said data is the new gold but data only becomes gold when you do something with it you take action you make a decision this requires real-time processing of data and analysis hierarchical ai provides the speed scale and compression to truly extract value from the bronto bytes of data that's growing that is in our world today so let's take a look in a little detail on these three trends so let's start with frictionless networking as i said it's always on it's seamless it's intelligent and secure connection it makes the right choices makes you more efficient so you're no more navigating airport wi-fi or third-party cellular data services this is all managed in the background today we need to manually connect as we physically move through the world passwords text authentication numbers etc now how is this any different from the days when we dialed yes i said it and i own it we dialed a long distance call the operator came on or some voice came on and said hey you need to dial a one to make this call call please redial using a one and you said to yourself if you know i need to make dialogue one why can't you do that for me why do we think our network is any different today than those telco networks that we have to do all this work to guarantee our own connection and security the frictionless network of the next generation of digital includes a digital security guard and it does all this authentication and security automatically and in the background it connects to safe networks and rejects bad ones it provides the automatically and manages the connection to offer higher security for transactions like secure pay transactions or blockchain based authentication services also part of this is you have your own virtual digital assistant it's always on and available it understands and even anticipates what you need for example let's say your digital digital assistant hears a conversation you're talking about vacations taking time off and it automatically does some search on locations it recalls conversations you had about places you'd like to see and it does a whole bunch of research on flights and hotels and pricing you know you get to focus on the trip and the things you need to do and all this time you'd have spent doing research has been done for you this is just one of thousands of examples and i think we're only limited by our imagination of what a digital system could do for our life okay let's uh let's move on to mega trend number two virtualization there are several types of virtualization and what they all have in common is the need for high speed backbone of data processing storage and transport this is an important aspect for the next digital transformation let's look at network function virtualization or nv nfv is a great example it's essentially network processing is done in the cloud data is transported from a dumb access point to clouds for processing and then returned you don't put all this capability in every radio or every access point virtualization of the network enables the services to be delivered and scaled at significant bandwidth with speeds and at much lower cost than from processor-enabled access points we use today also the flexible nature of virtualized networks the speed and deployment of new services can be really greatly enhanced a new feature will come via software push versus a hardware upgrade to the user beyond this darpa and other research agencies are beginning to completely reimagine the network through concepts such as distributed heterogeneous networks where data optimizes its own path through the nodes based on user-defined priorities like cost latency speed and again this can only be activated through cloud-based network virtualization the other view of virtualization is interesting it's the human side the personal virtualization which is the concept of the holographic telepresence of the individual for example in this picture you see a family gathering and maybe not everybody can make the trip but they're more present than just a two-dimensional image they're a holographic presence look zoom or google meets type meetings that has certainly saved the day during the covet 19. you know by now we've done this for more than four months seven days a week 12 hours a day i think we can all agree that personal virtualization would enhance the interactive nature and engagement experience in meeting remotely to do this personal virtualization of these holographic telepresence data rates need to significantly improve over 500 gigabits per second for even small holograms with latencies less than five to ten milliseconds this is a significant uplift from where we are today so let's move on to the third megatrend it's hierarchical ai hierarchical ai is having artificial intelligence everywhere from devices to sensors from the edge into the cloud this is effectively how we turn gold data rather into gold we use it to do something make decisions take actions hierarchical ai improves efficiency by first parsing the data to extract important information and then compressing it so you move more efficient transport and to compute and store we will need data compression capabilities on the order that's a hundred thousand to one you know roughly the bio-inspired estimate that with the human brain or how the human brain works in addition to data compression hierarchical ai will need new and novel compute architectures for example neuromorphic or systolic systolic computing without new compute architectures the current path of moral moore's law scaling in single digit nanometer transistors transistors is approaching at a dead end it's not technically limited it's a date with destiny for another reason i say this because data centers alone if we continue on this path will consume all the world's generated electric power within the next two decades if we continue to blindly take this present day approach with highly inefficient compute architecture you know using smaller and less efficient transistors generation after generation i think this is the semi industries analog of climate change we know it's coming in time not an immediate crisis but a crisis nonetheless hard to change without the catalyst of an imminent crisis or threat therefore the path of least resistance is to continue doing what we've been doing and kick the can down the road for thousands of tomorrows contrast that to the new architectures that are much more power efficient over a thousand x more efficient you know moving significantly closer to the processing efficiency of a human brain which is you know 20 watts when similar computation on today's architectures take megawatts the third mega trend that is accelerating the next digital transformation is hierological aai this next chart courtesy of the sia and src captures the issue of compute power consumption on a global scale the consumption of power is accelerating which is being driven by worldwide adoption of lifestyle changes enabled by the digital infrastructure and will result in power collision course if we don't change direction take the example of computing power consumption in 2017 data centers consume three percent of the total worldwide electric power by 2040 computing dominated by data centers will consume a hundred percent of the world's energy production at current rates and inefficiencies of compute architectures the world's entire energy production isn't going to be used only for compute but the point is that the path is unsustainable as an industry we need to change this path so how do we do this how do we avoid the power collision course that i just described well our industry needs to adopt innovative solutions so we can flatten this curve there are a number of innovations that can flatten the curve and significantly lower power consumption of the digital infrastructure novel compute architectures neuromorphic systolic optical networking solutions that support ai everywhere data compression low power connectivity and security you know just don't take my word for it follow the money there's an explosion of startups you know over hundreds developing new compute architectures companies not encumbered by their history but inspired by the opportunity so gf has a response to this this next chart shows you what we're doing about it we want to participate and more importantly enable these mega trends we believe in this future and the solutions required to deliver this future and as you can imagine we are focusing our r d and capital investments consistent with these mega trends we are developing specialized application solutions to enable power saving innovations you know for example our finfet technology we put low power logic and low power srams we're the leaders in fully depleted soi solutions for new compute architectures that we have the combination of good digital performance great connectivity and embedded memory this brings ai to devices sensors and the edge of the network we have and will continue to innovate in silicon photonics to enable high-speed backbones for data processing storage and transport and our rf solutions based on soi technology for client-to-edge connectivity and our sigi solutions for edge to client our world class and we'll continue to make investments to continue to continue that performance and then lastly we're going to put embedded memory features and enablement and all our technology platforms for security so let me close with the with the following you know two years ago gf pivoted from moore's moore's law scaling because of the physical limitations of our business scale and the resulting unsustainable business model we had to concede 25 of the foundry tam to focus our efforts to provide differentiated solutions to 75 percent of that very market we believe the rest industry will eventually have to do a pivot of their own not necessarily because of the physical limitations of moore's law or business scale and the unsustained and unsustainable business model but for the physical limit that not even scale can overcome the world just doesn't generate enough electric power to support the future compute workloads required for the next digital transformation we can't stay the course gf stands ready to do its part and is excited for what the future holds not only for our industry but for humanity and lastly let me thank patrick and dan for inviting me to the summit he gave me an opportunity to get dressed up after four months thank you everybody you
