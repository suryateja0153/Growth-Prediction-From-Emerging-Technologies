 Hi my name is Tim Shay I'm a cognitive scientist and Accenture labs future technologies are indeed group in San Francisco we are excited about neuromorphic computing we believe it has the potential to make a dramatic impact on both edge computing and the data center. We're exploring business applications of neuromorphic computing across a number of industries in the automotive industry, we see this new technology enabling easier ways of interacting with smart vehicles through voice, And gestures. Neuromorphic computing could enable adaptive systems like emergency braking to operate at low power and eliminate disruptions due to poor connectivity. We're collaborating with university researchers to develop an end-to-end sound classification system that can run on Intel a similar approach could diagnose mechanical issues based on sounds from a vehicle and would notify the owner for maintenance In another industry like oil and gas this technology could enable our client to monitor remote infrastructure for problems like pipeline leaks Intelligent edge computing is going to be a key component of an enterprise computing strategy With its unique capacity for efficiency and adaptation neuromorphic computing offers tremendous potential for our clients.
