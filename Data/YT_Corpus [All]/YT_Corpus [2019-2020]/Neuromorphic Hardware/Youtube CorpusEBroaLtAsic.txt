 The right answer is with neuromorphic hardware. We use neuromorphic hardware instead of classical computer architectures to decrease the energy consumption and they latency that these systems require. Besides these advantages, we can also work with the data coming from the sensors in a local way, without a connection to the cloud. Therefore, neuromorphic hardware is the right solution for HAI.
