 very honored to speak here especially to to start this fabulous cast of speakers later in the day and I will actually I realize I'll probably connect to all of them in my in my presentation here and I added a couple of words to the title quantum computing with atoms and optics and if I were to cut to the chase I would say that the qubit part the quantum parts done and those are the atoms they're atomic clocks and I say they're perfect meaning they're much better than we need them to be all of the challenges remain in the classical controllers and that that in our technology means optics so this is a picture of a semiconductor a chunk of silicon plated by gold that's part of the controller these are just electrodes that allow individual atomic ions to hover float above this ion trap and they're glowing because we're shining CW laser light on the atoms and they're fluorescing and the control of them has other lasers that execute quantum gates and I'll dive a little bit into that technology but first since this is a talk on quantum computing I thought I would start on very broad tones defining terms and so forth and this this may sound a little overhyped and I don't want to I don't want to stress it that much but the the the high-performance computing community is running scared a little bit now because we all know that Moore's Law will not continue forever at least how it has over the last many decades because the individual transistor elements are getting too small and we can see even in the last few years it's starting to saturate there are many other forms of computing that are starting to make the light of day and neuromorphic computing and so forth quantum computing is one of them and it's not exactly clear that this you know what the what the coverage of quantum computing will be but I put this plot up here because in the days when Moore's law started were early days of transistor development solid-state transistor development and one richard fineman was intrigued by the fact that that computing elements could be built from solid state and he imagined the day when they could be shrunk down so small that each transistors a few molecules or few atoms and that's where we'll be and if we follow Moore's law now that's where we'll be in the next couple of decades but what finance said in this lecture in 1959 incredibly visionary he said when we get to circuits of individual atoms there will be completely new opportunities for design and I think at that time it wasn't known what those opportunities would be I think by now over the last few decades we understand that opportunity is quantum computing and the reason is there's new opportunities of course is that when you get down to simple forms of matter with very few degrees of freedom the laws of physics change and those laws of physics quantum physics may allow us to compute in new ways and that's the opportunity so they're very briefly most of you this is probably review for most of you but quantum bits are very much like classical bits zeroes ones except because of the quantum superposition principle information can be stored in parallel even at a single bit level so quantum bit is a superposition of 0 and 1 and it's very hard to draw that because we live in a classical world here and this is a classical projector but that's a single electron of course in two states at the same time and it has weightings of the two states and what's there lots of ways to couch the strange opportunities of quantum one of them is that when you measure a quantum state you have to use probabilities probabilities have to be invoked they come out of thin air in other theories of nature probabilities are used because of our ignorance but in quantum mechanics you have to use it so that's one strange feature of quantum mechanics and so what happens of course is that the state collapses to one of two definite states depending on the waiting's of the original superposition now it gets interesting when you put many qubits together even two there's something called quantum entanglement and in this case this is a particular entangled state of two quantum bits and you can see when you measure such a system you'll see you'll see one of the two states with perfect correlations even though individually they're totally yeah so the the concept of entanglement is this is in a sense having connections or wires without real wires it's due to the structure of quantum mechanics and that to me is the essence of quantum computing we're using connections that aren't there should say that with quotes because there's lots of subtleties involved in that so the story of quantum computing and where it came from and and how you could do something interesting is if it's a very subtle one and I'm not gonna be able to touch on a whole lot of it I like to think of it as a good news bad news good news story and the first piece of good news might be apparent from this the fact is that we get exponential growth in storage when we add qubits together with three qubits there are eight states you can store with lots more qubits you get this exponential growth every additional qubit gives you twice the state space to store information if you want and for instance if you wanted to compute a function you could do it in parallel with the same device with only one input but the input has a superposition of all the numbers okay and when because it's exponential growth it doesn't take too much scaling to get something you could not think of doing without quantum with just a few hundred qubits you're representing a number of configurations that's more than the number of fundamental particles in the universe so even with Moore's law even if Moore's law were to continue forever you still would not be able to approach what you could do potentially with a quantum computer with just a few hundred qubits that's the great good news it's almost too good to be true and it is when you think about a computer you have to measure it of course and when you measure it that's the bad news and the more complex the superposition the less information you get out right if you have two to the three hundred inputs and you make outputs and you make a measurement you only get one answer and you don't know what it was it's random so that seems very bad I'm sure Fineman realized this in 59 and didn't know how to put it together but in fact 20 or 30 years ago there is a final piece of good news that was I would say codified more by David Deutsch than anybody else and he showed that there are cases where you can have interferences between these amplitudes it's very hard to draw but if you imagine all these inputs in superposition these red dots are called quantum gates they allow very specific interferences to occur entanglement to be formed and so forth and what happens here is you have this exponentially rich input state it sort of gets forced down to one output or a few outputs and that you can measure you can measure in the there's very little entropy in that output State and the point there is that when you make that measurement in some cases it can depend on all of these exponentially many inputs ok so that's the basic idea of quantum computing and I'm sweeping a lot under the rug because not every problem can be stated this way what type of gates do you need to do something interesting well there are there are a few applications out there I would say the the the the killer app in quantum computing as you might know is factoring large numbers and this is pointed out by Peter shor about 20 25 years ago and he basically showed how you could build a quantum circuit with a polynomial number of gates that would allow you to factor a big number and what's remarkable is that classically the best-known algorithm still scale exponentially with the size of the input and so they're very very broadly what he showed is that you can take a quantum wave function with lots of lots of states this would this would have like six or seven qubits whatever log base two of 39 is maybe you need some more work space and execute quantum gates so that the wave function does this it sort of coherently evolves to the two factors of the number you're trying to factor and then we make a measurement you can get information on all those inputs sounds factoring and I would say the problem with factoring is that to factor an interesting number requires thousands of bits you probably need error correction because you need you need billions of operations and these this is sort of like an analogue computer the noise will add so you have to do error correction so you probably need trillions of operations and millions of qubits so this problem is still far in the distance it was back in 95 when I first got in this field and it is now feels like it's the same distance away but the good news is there are other problems that are it's a even more interesting and more widespread than factoring that have the flavor of having an output that globally depends on inputs so optimization is a little bit of a catch-all but when you optimize a very complex function there's only one optimal answer or very few numbers of answers and they can depend on all the inputs this is a simple one if we have a function of just two variables we can clearly see the minimum but if you have a function of a thousand variables the configuration of those variables that results in the minimum or the maximum minimizing some cost function that's a really hard problem and there are all kinds of combinatorial problems from from finance from physics from chemistry that look very interesting for quantum computers to solve now that said we don't yet have a proof that any one of these applications can be exactly solved on a quantum computer but there are hints that they that quantum computers could be a heuristic that gives you a better answer than any classical approach could be the Traveling Salesman is my favorite because it's very easy to depict what's the shortest path between a bunch of cities and the problem here is there's too many configurations once you get a few hundred cities and so that type of a logistics problem is I think where the field is headed and it's good because this is more broad than just factoring so I want to talk about hardware because it will it's an exotic form of computing and therefore demands pretty exotic hardware to do the job so my colleague bill Phillips is fond of saying that a quantum computer differs more from a classical computer than that classical computer differs from an abacus and what he means here is that these two machines follow the same abstract theory given by Alan Turing they're both Turing machines one is electronic built with transistors it's very fast and and and you can have trillions of transistors here but they're the same rules while I'm computing is totally a different set of rules and so I guess I would say corollary to the statement is that why would we ever expect a quantum computer to look anything like the classical computer if it's that different and so that's why we have to maybe step back and look at anything that supports quantum here anything that that we use in quantum research to think about building devices from them so the last five or eight years have been very exciting in this field primarily because we're starting to see systems engineering quantum systems engineering building a device that a third party can use without knowing every detail about what's inside we need an application but maybe we need a device first that somebody can use that might not be an expert in quantum physics to use it so superconducting qubits is one one path forward where superconducting currents they sent they and they flow without dissipation so it's it's a perfectly interesting qubit to think about the scale-up problem looks very hard because every cube it's a little different they're man-made and I would say the leading candidate is maybe even more exotic or less looking like a classical computers not solid-state at all individual atoms and this is what I want to talk about and the opportunities with atoms are many fold one of them is that atomic qubits are right they're identical they're not man-made they're given to us so these atoms are atomic clocks and they have the same features that atomic clocks have in terms of their longevity their coherence and so forth and like I said at the outset the challenge is how to control them how to make gates how to hold on to them and isolate them from the from the environment so I want to talk a little bit about that and I'll note also that that industry is getting involved in this field in a big way mostly with these two technologies there are a few others as well and these are very well-heeled companies that are especially computer companies like IBM Intel Microsoft and Google that are looking to to next new models of quantum computing and a host of startups of course the government here in the US I've listed a few of the big investments some of them are in intelligence agencies Department of Defense Department of Energy and so forth so now turning onto this technology of individual atoms dive into a little bit of atomic physics we store our qubits within individual atoms very much like two levels are stored in an atomic clock so pick a good two-level system that is insensitive to external perturbations like nuclear spins something like this and that's the potential qubit now atomic ions are very interesting because they interact very strongly through their Coulomb force I'll tell you a little bit how we harness that but again because they have very low idling errors almost zero and they're perfectly replicable the atomic systems are scalable fundamentally scalable in a way that no solid state system could ever dream okay now it's interesting that to control these atoms we need we need optical sources we need lasers to do this and this is a hundred percent of the challenge in the technology I'm dealing with so to give you a little idea here and also there's a little bit of history in this picture the atomic qubit that I've been investing in for a long time is atomic you terbium it looks a lot like hydrogen actually spin one-half nucleus and one outer electron and so they're hyperfine levels and we store our qubit in the so-called clock states of this ion and we drive coherent transitions with with the pulse laser and the history there is I'm a I come from the field of cold atomic physics CW lasers you know with with eleven digits of stability and the wavelength so I've my whole life up till when I went to Michigan in 2000 I was very scared of pulse lasers and and you know it's it's nice to nice to speak in the same session that Donna and Gerard are and I'll add that Phil Buxbaum my colleague in Michigan they got me less afraid of pulse lasers and I have to say that this this particular band of pulse laser at 355 nanometers it's I'm sorry it's not femtoseconds 10 picoseconds it's too broad bandwidth for us at femtoseconds but this laser is very much like a CW laser it's so well engineered it's used for lithography it's an industrial standard coherent makes several hundred of these a year and even though I love playing around with lasers I used to do that a lot I'm happy that this laser only has one knob and it's the Amnon and that that makes this a system this laser runs for years and years without thinking about it that's very important and it has all the coherence we need it actually is sort of a frequency calm and narrow beam frequency comb that we I won't talk too much more about it but we were able to coherently drive this qubit and apply forces with this kind of a laser beam and yeah it's a pulse laser not super high power but okay so I want to show a little animation on how we build a small register of qubits and entangle them involving this type of a laser and CW lasers so the idea starts with with a bunch of laser beams this is a multi-channel a OM to talk about that later if you want and these laser beams are all fed across this chip now we first initialize all these qubits with a CW laser that does optical pumping and then we execute a quantum circuit so this is space and time we're going through forward in time now these these lasers these 355 nanometer lasers they're basically optical tweezers and we're gonna hear from our - Kanaan via video on the physics of that we're driving forces between these atoms and that's how we can couple the information and and execute quantum gates and this is a small quantum circuit that executes some some computational tasks and at the end of the day we send another CW laser for measurement and it's a very simple measurement if if the atom glows it's in one if it's dark it's in zero so that's it a lot of optics here in fact that's as I said many times now that's a hundred percent of our challenge is the optical controller around these perfect qubits so this is an example of an algorithm a very small one I won't get into details too much it involves three four five this is ten cubits and it has I don't know 50 or so operations these are head of our gates these are Ising gates controlled z gates i won't get into the details but this is a quantum computation it actually is an algorithm it's called the hidden shift algorithm it's it's an Oracle algorithm it's sort of useless but it's a benchmark demonstration if you have ten cubits you might think of you know measuring the fitness of your system running this algorithm it says if you're given two functions and they're identical except the inputs are shifted by some unknown amount what is that unknown amount how many queries you have to make of these functions to find the unknown amount well classically you need a lot you have to evaluate many inputs to figure this out but quantum you can do it with just one query so you can see both the inch same thing and the useless thing I mean nobody's gonna give you a quantum computer and tell you what's the hidden shift here but it's interesting because it does give you in a sense something an opportunity could not do classically and so you know this is this is the initialization the gates and then the measurement at the end and here we we programmed all 1024 hidden shifts two to the tenth is 1024 on the vertical axis and this is this was the measurement if things were perfectly already had a one on the diagonal here but you can see there is some noise it's very structured noise if you look closely you can even see the little circles here and these lines we understand these noise they have to do with crosstalk and and you know imperfect laser noise and so forth but we understand the entire air budget in this algorithm and we're working on building more and I should say this comes from inq the startup that has three full stack quantum computer systems right now now back to the University of Maryland we've we have several systems that we're also building up this is a little bit of more of a physics experiment but with lots and lots of qubits and what we've studied there is not a quantum computing circuit but what we might call a quantum simulation and in this case we were able to apply a Hamiltonian that is an Ising model between all pairs of spins and it's a long-range Ising model and it's anti ferromagnetic so it's frustrated there's lots of entanglement in the ground state of that of that Hamiltonian and we have a transverse field so this is a very simple textbook model of something that admits a phase transition in this case we've been studying something called a dynamical phase transition and it has to do with the competition between B and J if the spins are prepared along X and and and and the Ising coupling is very big they're already along the x direction so nothing very exciting happens but if B is much bigger than J then they process around the z axis so do they stay around X order around X or do they process around Z and by varying B and J we can sort of see different dynamics again I sorry I have to kind of rush through this but this is the total magnetization the brightness of the of the chain and you can see when B is small compared to J we not much happens to the initial magnetization but when B is bigger than J they sort of go to 0 they process around Z and I would call that a phase transition it's a very smooth it's a very smooth transition between these and I think this is with only 16 spins or something we can now look at the correlations we measure every possible correlation of these spins and this is something that you can't do in a real solid and now as we vary the number of spins and very be everyday we see sort of a dip emerging but it's still even up to 53 spins where they're you know two to the 53 configurations you know we don't see a real pronounced dip but when we look at the N body correlation function in this case we're looking at the size of the biggest domain in the system is we vary B over J we see a much more pronounced kink here and I will say that we couldn't compute where that kink was going to be the system is too complicated so I'm not claiming this as a real model of a real material or it's even interesting but it's something you could not compute using classical physics so to me that's kind of interesting so how are we going to scale and I would say in the atomic physics realm of quantum computing it's often said well with transistors we can print to Billy of them on the chip even the superconductors we could think of how to print thousands and thousands on the chip but with atoms you're showing me data with 10 cuba's or 50 cubits how are you gonna really scale well the scaling in a sense we have the fundamental ingredients because when we add an atom we know it's the same it's all a question of controlling it from the trap itself we have to make the trap big enough to hold these atoms and one way to scale beyond 10 or 20 cubits is to just add atoms and you might say well now you need a million laser beams well not really you could imagine having a fixed set of laser beams and and shuttling the atoms around the beams very much like a tape moves across a head there's some overhead there you have to move the atoms around but that's actually very mature technology at shuttling atoms back and forth and I would say Dave Wineland and his group at NIST Boulder I was there and in the 90s we really pushed this this vision of shuttling around corners and so forth and it NIST they're doing some wonderful experiments moving atoms between different zones even the technology that needs to improve there is the ability to make chip traps that are that are more agile they allow us to do many more things none of this is quantum though this this ion trap is just it's a chunk of a bunch of conductors that hold voltages and we have to control those voltages now when we want to scale beyond hundreds of qubits and this is where it gets really wild we're going to almost certainly have to adopt a modular architecture just like we do with multi-core classical processors and the great thing about atomic qubits is that they're optically active we can map the qubit from the clock state the spin to two properties of a propagating photon polarization or or color or maybe a delay may a degrees of freedom there and we can think about inventing a very high-level architecture where individual modules of ion traps with dense connections inside these red boxes are augmented by by photonic connections and everything over here is classical this is just in a non-blocking n by n cross connects which you can build this this is a CCD camera these are beam splitters and for instance when two pixels on this CCD fire that means depending on the configuration of the switch box that qubit is entangled with that qubit so it's a modular architecture that allows you to scale now what you sacrifice here is connectivity just like in the classical case you can't easily do a gate between this transistor and that transistor you have to move things around that's certainly true but it allows you to build the system up and if it's modular then you can really think of an industrial proach where you stamp out the individual modules so there's lots of work that has to be done and I think we look forward to having lots of on chip photonic waveguides that allow us to move this information back and forth so the real problem in the scale up and many people will visit our labs and amo and they'll see this and they'll just say okay dice visiting here so this this table actually has it has two ion traps but our first experiments were involving two atoms they were about a meter apart and we were teleporting the information between one atom and the other we could actually say we teleported Adam but it's of course just the information it's one cubit and it requires a great deal of control a lot of these are CW lasers that have to be stabilized and locked to nine or ten digits there is a pulsed laser on the table on this table it's way over here you can't even see it and all the electronics you can recognize these topical controllers we'd love top teeka they've they and and and other laser companies are starting to modularize their lasers even and on that note and this is with very little exaggeration everything you see here is in that box right now this is this is a new project that we started a few years ago largely funded by IEEE ARPA and they funded us to build a a small quantum computer system to do air to do an error correcting code but it afforded us the opportunity to really design top down and so we've contracted with many outfits to help this make this happen including coherent that makes the lasers Harris I didn't talk much about this 32 channel acoustic modulator is a beautiful device that Harris makes for the semiconductor industry and we told them you know it's a beautiful device but you need to be making it for atoms not not for CMOS masks and they agree and so we're partnering with them on this the top guy mentioned a Oh sense as well making making individual modular eyes lasers that can be locked all put in a drawer and fiber delivered and finally Sandia makes makes the the silicon chip trap I showed before so this is starting to look like a product and that's of course the story behind inq we wanted to add professional engineering and not the university engineering which is a little bit of a oxymoron I think to do engineering so well that a third party could use a device it's very hard to do that in a university setting so there's the box you can sort of see there's lots of cables that's kind of ugly these are CW lasers all fiber prompt these are FPGAs that are controlling the RF the AOM channels and the DC of the electrodes on the trap and there's a very agile software controller that runs all of this stuff but the actions right here this is where all the improvements going to happen and we look forward to making that even smaller and inside there is the chip I showed earlier the sandia chip there are many ways to make this chip I didn't mention that the atoms are about a tenth of a millimeter above the surface and that's why it looks like a bowtie weave we shine lasers across that surface they focus tightly without hitting the sides so that's what's going on there now this this plot I borrowed from my friend Hartmut Neven and Google he leads a Google quantum effort and it's sometimes called the quantum supremacy chart and what we have here is the number of qubits and the number of operations the circuit depth how many can you do it's pretty clear if you have some number of qubits you'd probably to make use of that system you want more and more operations you know to be up and to the right and in fact if you're not sufficiently up or not as efficient and not sufficiently to the right you're in this pink zone where it's not so interesting so we can classically simulate what goes on if you only have if if you have 50 cubits you'd better be able to do several hundred operations on them if you have a million cubits but you can only do one or two operations not interesting if you have three cubits but you can do a billion operations not interesting you have to do both and with trap dying technology we're it's easy to speculate in the future but you know the black data and the gray data this is this is existing research and we look forward in the coming years to pass through this so-called supremacy boundary whether there's going to be something interesting there or not it remains to be seen and when we when we get sufficiently high in qubit number and circuit depth we have to do error correction and with the trapped ion technology we don't worry about that yet because the passive errors are so good we don't need to worry about error correction we really think we can get in this land of treasure with several hundred qubits several ten thousand operations with passive control and what's what's a little bit of a disappointment I think what's happening in solid-state quantum computing is they're moving up and to the left maybe not a surprise in a solid state system when you make the system big there are many more types of errors that can come in there's crosstalk hairs and the differences between qubits gets magnified when you have a big system and the idle errors when you leave a solid-state qubit alone all by itself because it's tightly coupled to its environment the solid the great thing in atomic physics is that these atoms the background is of real vacuum some people may say well we're back to vacuum tubes well you know quantum mechanics may demand that because there's very little inner I'm in the vacuum is is perfect there's nothing there and furthermore the optical controllers of these atoms allow us to reconfigure the program and they allow us great flexibility and applying new types of algorithms there's no wires between these qubits so with that I wanted to back out and talk a little bit about the the big challenge ahead in this field which is to do quantum engineering and this is since I work inside the beltway I get roped into working with with the government on something called the National qualm initiative and I for this audience especially the optical society SPIE and the National photonics initiative played a huge role in in Congress actually passing this national carminative Act and I show a picture here my Kramer and I were sort of leading stakeholders we formed this group across the country to lobby and Laura Colton who used to be the federally Ehsan at OSA and now David Lange here they've been tireless in getting us connected to offices in Congress and this amounted to the nqi Act in December you know broad bipartisan support the President signed it immediately we have there people from our community in the White House now that are advising NSF and do e and NIST and also the defense and intelligence agencies on how to coordinate so the especially for this crowd the the the goal here is to get op optics engineers to start thinking about quantum and so with that I guess that's all I had to say I wanted to put this joke up here this is the cover of a tech review from last year that you could say quantum computing somewhere in here there's a lot of hype in the field but there's a lot of promise and so very quickly my group at the University of Maryland funded by many many sources in Washington and the the company inq which I'm sort of stepping back from now there they're about 35 employees and if you're interested in this and you're an optical engineer that wants to do quantum please give us a call we're going to probably triple in size over the next couple of years and we're you're hiring aggressively thank you [Applause]
