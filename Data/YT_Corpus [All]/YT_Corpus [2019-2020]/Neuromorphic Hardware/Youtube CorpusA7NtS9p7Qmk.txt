  I'm David Shaw, and this is AI News. Did you know you can build deep learning and inference applications on a P.C.? The AI on P.C. Development Kit from Intel, comes with everything you need to develop deep neural networks and computer vision applications. With hardware and software, source code, and even tutorials, it helps accelerate the creation of new and compelling AI applications. The kit contains a powerful combination of an Intel Core Processor, Integrated Graphics from Intel, and, for the first time, an Intel Movidius Myriad X Vision processing unit. This enables high-performance and low-power AI workloads. The three hardware engines run a diverse range of AI workloads, to deliver a comprehensive breadth of raw AI capability for mobile P.C.s today. It allows you to deploy deep neural network applications more easily. Use preloaded, trained models to run-- Microsoft Windows Machine Learning applications, and Intel distribution of OpenVINO Toolkit applications. Follow the links provided to read more details about the kit, including pre-installed software and hardware, and get yours today. Thanks for watching, keep developing, and stay tuned for the next episode.
