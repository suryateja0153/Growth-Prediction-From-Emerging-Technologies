 whole brain emulation WBE mind upload or brain upload sometimes called mind copying or mind transfer is the hypothetical futuristic process of scanning the mental state including long-term memory and self of a particular brain substrate and copying it to a computer the computer could then run a simulation model of the brains information processing such that it responds in essentially the same way as the original brain ie indistinguishable from the brain for all relevant purposes and experiences having a conscious mind mind uploading may potentially be accomplished by either of two methods copy and transfer or gradual replacement of neurons in the case of the former method mind uploading would be achieved by scanning and mapping the salient features of a biological brain and then by copying transferring and storing that information state into a computer system or another computational device the biological brain may not survive the copying process the simulated mind could be within a virtual reality or simulated world supported by an anatomic 3d body simulation model alternatively the simulated mind could reside in a computer that is inside or connected to a not necessarily humanoid robot or a biological body among some futurists and within the transhumanist movement mind uploading is treated as an important proposed life extension technology some believe mind uploading is humanity's current best option for preserving the identity of the species as opposed to cryonics another aim of mind uploading is to provide a permanent backup mind file to enable interstellar space travels and a means for human culture to survive a global disaster by making a functional copy of a human society in a matryoshka brain ie a computing device that consumes all energy from a star whole brain emulation is discussed by some futurists as a logical end point of the topical computational neuroscience and neural informatics fields both about brain simulation for medical research purposes it is discussed in artificial intelligence research publications as an approach to strong AI computer-based intelligence such as an upload could think much faster than a biological human even if it were no more intelligent a large-scale society of uploads might according to futurists give rise to a technological singularity meaning a sudden time constant decrease in the exponential development of technology mind uploading is a central conceptual feature of numerous science fiction novels and films substantial mainstream research in related areas is being conducted in animal brain mapping and simulation development of faster supercomputers virtual reality brain computer interfaces connectomics and information extraction from dynamically functioning brains according to supporters many of the tools and ideas needed to achieve mind uploading already exist or a currently under active development however they will admit that others are as yet very speculative but still in the realm of engineering possibility neuroscientist Randal Kohn has formed a nonprofit organization called carbon copies to promote mind uploading research topic overview the human brain contains on average about 86 billion nerve cells called neurons each individually linked to other neurons by way of connectors called axons and dendrites signals at the junctures synapses of these connections are transmitted by the release and detection of chemicals known as neurotransmitters the established neuro scientific consensus is that the human mind is largely an emergent property of the information processing of this neural network neuroscientists have stated that important functions performed by the mind such as learning memory and consciousness are due to purely physical and electrochemical processes in the brain and are governed by applicable laws for example Christoph Kok and Giulio Tononi wrote in I Triple E spectrum consciousness is part of the natural world it depends we believe only on mathematics and logic and on the imperfectly known laws of physics chemistry and biology it does not arise from some magical or otherworldly quality the concept of mind uploading is based on this mechanistic view of the mind and denies the vitalist view of human life and consciousness eminent computer scientists and neuro scientists have predicted that specially programmed computers will be capable of thought and even attained consciousness including and Tononi Douglas Hofstadter Jeff Hawkins Marvin Minsky Randall a cone and Rodolfo Ling ass however even though uploading is dependent upon such a general capability it is conceptually distinct from general forms of AI in that it results from dynamic reanimation of information derived from a specific human mind so that the mind retains a sense of historical identity other forms are possible but would compromise or eliminate the life extension feature generally associated with uploading the transferred and reanimated information would become a form of artificial intelligence sometimes called an info more for no morph many theorists have presented models of the brain and have established a range of estimates of the amount of computing power needed for partial and complete simulations using these models some have estimated that uploading may become possible within decades if trends such as Moore's law continue topic theoretical benefits and applications topic immortality or backup in theory if the information and processes of the mind can be disassociated from the biological body they are no longer tied to the individual limits and lifespan of that body furthermore information within a brain could be partly or wholly copied or transferred to one or more other substrates including digital storage or another brain thereby from a purely mechanistic perspective reducing or eliminating mortality risk of such information this general proposal was discussed in 1971 by bio gerontologist George AM Martin of the University of Washington topic space exploration and uploaded astronaut could be used instead of a live astronaut in human space flight avoiding the perils of zero-gravity the vacuum of space and cosmic radiation to the human body it would allow for the use of smaller spacecraft such as the proposed starker and it would enable virtually unlimited interstellar travel distances topic relevant technologies and techniques the focus of mind uploading in the case of copy and transfer is on data acquisition rather than data maintenance of the brain a set of approaches known as loosely coupled offloading LC o L may be used in the attempt to characterize and copy the mental contents of a brain the L Co L approach may take advantage of self-reports life logs and video recordings that can be analyzed by artificial intelligence a bottom-up approach may focus on the specific resolution and morphology of neurons the spike times of neurons the times at which neurons produce action potential responses topic computational complexity advocates of mind uploading point to Moore's law to support the notion that the necessary computing power is expected to become available within a few decades however the actual computational requirements for running an uploaded human mind are very difficult to quantify potentially rendering such an argument specious regardless of the techniques used to capture or recreate the function of a human mind the processing demands are likely to be immense due to the large number of neurons in the human brain along with the considerable complexity of each neuron in 2004 Henry Markram lead researcher of the Blue Brain Project stated that it is not their gold to build an intelligent neural network based solely on the computational demands such a project would have it will be very difficult because in the brain every molecule is a powerful computer and we would need to simulate the structure and function of trillions upon trillions of molecules as well as all the rules that govern how they interact you would literally need computers that are trillions of times bigger and faster than anything existing today five years later after successful simulation of part of a rat brain Markram was much more bold and optimistic in 2009 as director of the Blue Brain Project he claimed that a detailed functional artificial human brain can be built within the next ten years required computational capacity strongly depend on the chosen level of simulation model scale topic simulation model scale since the function of the human mind and how it might arise from the working of the brains neural network are poorly understood issues mind uploading relies on the idea of neural network emulation rather than having to understand the high-level psychological processes and large-scale structures of the brain and model them using classical artificial intelligence methods and cognitive psychology models the low-level structure of the underlying neural network is captured mapped and emulated with a computer system in computer science terminology rather than analyzing and reverse engineering the behavior of the algorithms and data structures that resides in the brain a blueprint of its source code is translated to another programming language the human mind and the personal identity then theoretically is generated by the emulated neural network in an identical fashion to it being generated by the biological neural network on the other hand a molecule scale simulation of the brain is not expected to be required provided that the functioning of the neurons is not affected by quantum mechanical processes the neural network emulation approach only requires that the functioning and interaction of neurons and synapses are understood it is expected that it is sufficient with a blackbox signal processing model of how the neurons respond to nerve impulses electrical as well as chemicals synaptic transmission a sufficiently complex and accurate model of the neurons is required a traditional artificial neural network model for example multi-layer perceptron Network model is not considered as sufficient a dynamic spiking neural network model is required which reflects that the neuron fires only when a membrane potential reaches a certain level it is likely that the model must include delays nonlinear functions and differential equations describing the relation between electro physical parameters such as electrical currents voltages membrane States ion channel States and neuromodulators since learning and long-term memory are believed to result from strengthening or weakening the synapses via mechanism known as synaptic plasticity or synaptic adaptation the model should include this mechanism the response of sensory receptors to various stimuli must also be modeled furthermore the model may have to include metabolism ie how the neurons are affected by hormones and other chemical substances that may cross the blood-brain barrier it is considered likely that the model must include currently unknown neuromodulators neurotransmitters and ion channels it is considered unlikely that the simulation model has to include protein interaction which would make it computationally complex a digital computer simulation model of an analog system such as the brain is an approximation that introduces random quantization errors and distortion however the biological neurons also suffer from randomness and limited precision for example due to background noise the errors of the discrete model can be made smaller than the randomness of the biological brain by choosing a sufficiently high variable resolution and sample rate and sufficiently accurate models of nonlinearities the computational power and computer memory must however be sufficient to run such large simulations preferably in real time topic scanning and mapping scale of an individual when modeling and simulating the brain of a specific individual a brain map or connectivity database showing the connections between the neurons must be extracted from an anatomic model of the brain for whole brain simulation this network map should show the connectivity of the whole nervous system including the spinal cord sensory receptors and muscle cells destructive scanning of a small sample of tissue from a mouse brain including synaptic details as possible as of 2010 however if short-term memory and working memory include prolonged or repeated firing of neurons as well as intra neural dynamic processes the electrical and chemical signals state of the synapses and neurons may be hard to extract the uploaded mind may then perceive a memory loss of the events and mental processes immediately before the time of brain scanning a full brain map has been estimated to occupy less than 2 by 1016 bytes 20,000 terabytes and would store the addresses of the connected neurons the synapse type and the synapse wait for each of the brains 1015 sign APS's however the biological complexities of true brain function eg the epigenetic states of neurons protein components with multiple functional states etc may preclude an accurate prediction of the volume of binary data required to faithfully represent a functioning human mind topic serial sectioning a possible method for mind uploading is serial sectioning in which the brain tissue and perhaps other parts of the nervous system of frozen and then scanned and analyzed layer by layer which for frozen samples at nano scale requires a cryo ultra-micro Tomei thus capturing the structure of the neurons and their interconnections the exposed surface of frozen nerve tissue would be scanned and recorded and then the surface layer of tissue removed while this would be a very slow and labor-intensive process research is currently underway to automate the collection and microscopy of serial sections the scans would then be analyzed and a model of the neural net recreated in the system that the mind was being uploaded into there are uncertainties with this approach using current microscopy techniques if it is possible to replicate neuron function from its visible structure alone then the resolution afforded by a scanning electron microscope would suffice for such a technique however as the function of brain tissue is partially determined by molecular events particularly at synapses but also at other places on the neurons cell membrane this may not suffice for capturing and simulating neuron functions it may be possible to extend the techniques of serial sectioning and to capture the internal molecular makeup of neurons through the use of sophisticated immunohistochemistry staining methods that could then be read vehicle focal laser scanning microscopy however as the physiological genesis of mind is not currently known this method may not be able to access all of the necessary biochemical information to recreate a human brain with sufficient fidelity topic brain imaging it may be possible to create functional 3d maps of the brain activity using advanced neuroimaging technology such as functional MRI fMRI for mapping change in blood flow magneto encephalography Meg for mapping of electrical currents or combinations of multiple methods to build a detailed three-dimensional model of the brain using non-invasive and non-destructive methods today fMRI is often combined with Meg for creating functional maps of human cortex during more complex cognitive tasks as the methods complement each other even though current imaging technology lacks the spatial resolution needed to gather the information needed for such a scan important recent and future developments are predicted to substantially improve both spatial and temporal resolutions of existing technologies topic brain simulation there is ongoing work in the field of brain simulation including partial and whole simulations of some animals for example the C elegans roundworm Drosophila fruit fly and mouse have all been simulated to various degrees the Blue Brain Project by the brain and mind Institute of the occult Polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne Switzerland is an attempt to create a synthetic brain by reverse engineering mammalian brain circuitry topic is shoes topic philosophical issues underlying the concept of mind uploading more accurately mind transferring is the broad philosophy that consciousness lies within the brains information processing and is in essence an emergent feature that arises from large neural network high-level patterns of organization and that the same patterns of organization can be realized in other processing devices mind uploading also relies on the idea that the human mind be self and the long-term memory just like non-human Minds is represented by the current neural network paths and the weights of the brain synapses rather than by a dualistic and mystic soul and spirit the mind or soul can be defined as the information state of the brain and is immaterial only in the same sense as the information content of a data file or the state of a computer software currently residing in the workspace memory of the computer data specifying the information state of the neural network can be captured and copied as a computer file from the brain and re-implemented into a different physical form this is not to deny that minds are richly adapted to their substrates an analogy to the idea of mind uploading is to copy the temporary information state the variable values of a computer program from the computer memory to another computer and continue its execution the other computer may perhaps have different Hardware architecture but emulates the hardware of the first computer these issues have a long history in 1775 Thomas Reid wrote I would be glad to know whether when my brain has lost its original structure and when some hundred years after the same materials are fabricated so curiously as to become an intelligent being whether I say that being will be me or if two or three such beings should be formed out of my brain whether they will all be me and consequently one and the same intelligent being a considerable portion of transhumanists and singularitarians place great hope into the belief that they may become immortal by creating one or many non-biological functional copies of their brains thereby leaving their biological shell however the philosopher and transhumanist Susan Schneider claims that at best uploading would create a copy of the original person's mind Susan Schneider agrees that consciousness has a computational basis but this does not mean we can upload and survive according to her views uploading would probably result in the death of the original person's brain while only outside observers can maintain the illusion of the original person still being alive for it is implausible to think that one's consciousness would leave one's brain and travel to a remote location ordinary physical objects do not behave this way ordinary objects rocks tables etc are not simultaneously here and elsewhere at best a copy of the original mind is created neural correlates of consciousness a sub branch of neuroscience states that consciousness may be thought of as a state dependent property of some undefined complex adaptive and highly interconnected biological system others have argued against such conclusions for example Buddhists transhumanist James hee has pointed out that this consideration only goes so far if one believes the self is an illusion worries about survival and not reasons to avoid uploading and Keith Wylie has presented an argument wherein all resulting minds of an uploading procedure granted equal primacy in their claim to the original identity such that survival of the self is determined retroactively Lee from a strictly subjective position some have also asserted that consciousness is a part of an extra biological system that is yet to be discovered and cannot be fully understood under the present constraints of neurobiology without the transference of consciousness true mind upload or perpetual immortality cannot be practically achieved another potential consequence of mind uploading is that the decision to upload may then create a mindless symbol manipulator instead of a conscious mind see philosophical zombie are we to assume that an upload is conscious if it displays behaviors that are highly indicative of consciousness are we to assume that an upload is conscious if it verbally insists that it is conscious could there be an absolute upper limit in processing speed above which consciousness cannot be sustained the mystery of consciousness precludes a definitive answer to this question numerous scientists including Kerswell strongly believe that determining whether a separate entity is conscious with 100% confidence is fundamentally unknowable since consciousness is inherently subjective see solipsism regardless some scientists strongly believe consciousness is the consequence of computational processes which are substrate neutral on the contrary numerous science believe consciousness may be the result of some form of quantum computation dependent on substrate see quantum mind in light of uncertainty on whether to regard uploads as conscious Sandburg proposes a cautious approach principle of assuming the most Pam assumed that any emulated system could have the same mental properties as the original system and treat it correspondingly topic verification issues it is argued that if a computational copy of one's mind did exist it would be impossible for one to verify this the argument for this stance is the following for a computational mind to recognize an emulation of itself it must be capable of deciding whether to Turing machines namely itself and the proposed emulation are functionally equivalent this task is uncomputable due to the undecidability of equivalence thus there cannot exist a computational procedure in the mind that is capable of recognizing an emulation of itself topic ethical and legal implications the process of developing emulation technology raises ethical issues related to animal welfare and artificial consciousness the neuroscience required to develop brain emulation would require animal experimentation first on invertebrates and then on small mammals before moving on to humans sometimes the animals would just need to be euthanized in order to extract slice and scan their brains but sometimes behavioral and then vivo measures would be required which might cause pain to living animals in addition the resulting animal emulations themselves might suffer depending on one's views about consciousness Bancroft argues for the plausibility of consciousness in brain simulations on the basis of the fading qualia thought experiment of David Chalmers he then concludes if as I argue above a sufficiently detailed computational simulation of the brain is potentially operationally equivalent to an organic brain it follows that we must consider extending protections against suffering two simulations it might help reduce emulation suffering to develop virtual equivalents of anesthesia as well as to emit processing related to pain and/or consciousness however some experiments might require a fully functioning and suffering animal emulation animals might also suffer by accident due to flaws and lack of insight into what parts of their brains are suffering questions also arise regarding the moral status of partial brain emulations as well as creating neuromorphic emulations that draw inspiration from biological brains but are built somewhat differently brain emulations could be erased by computer viruses or malware without need to destroy the underlying hardware this may make assassination easier than for physical humans the attacker might take the computing power for its own use many questions arise regarding the legal personhood of emulations would they be given the rights of biological humans if a person makes an emulated copy of themselves and then dies does the emulation inherit the property and official positions could the emulation ask to pull the plug when it's biological version was terminally ill or in a coma would it help to treat emulations as adolescents for a few years so that the biological creator would maintain temporary control would criminal emulations receive the death penalty or would they be given forced data modification as a form of rehabilitation could an upload have marriage and child care rights if simulated Minds would come true and if they were assigned rights of their own it may be difficult to ensure the protection of digital human rights for example social science researchers might be tempted to secretly expose simulated minds or whole isolated societies of simulated minds to controlled experiments in which many copies of the same minds are exposed serially or simultaneously to different test conditions topic political and economic implications emulations could create a number of conditions that might increase risk of war including inequality changes of power dynamics a possible technological arms race to build emulations first first strike advantages strong loyalty and willingness to die among emulations and triggers for racist xenophobic and religious prejudice if emulations run much faster than humans there might not be enough time for human leaders to make wise decisions or negotiate it is possible that humans would react violently against growing power of emulations especially if they depress human wages emulations may not trust each other and even well-intentioned defensive measures might be interpreted as offense topic emulation timelines and AI risk there are very few feasible technologies that humans have refrained from developing the neuro science and computer hardware technologies that may make brain emulation possible are widely desired for other reasons and logically their development will continue into the future assuming that emulation technology will arrive a question becomes whether we should accelerate or slow its advanced arguments for speeding up brain emulation research if neuroscience is the bottleneck on brain emulation rather than computing power emulation advances may be more erratic and unpredictable based on when new scientific discoveries happen limited computing power would mean the first emulations would run slower and so would be easier to adapt to and there would be more time for the technology to transition through society improvements in manufacturing 3d printing and nanotechnology may accelerate hardware production which could increase the computing overhang from excess Hardware relative to neuroscience if one AI Development Group had a lead in emulation technology it would have more subjective time to win an arms race to build the first superhuman AI because it would be less rushed it would have more freedom to consider AI risks arguments for slowing down brain emulation research greater investment in brain emulation and associated cognitive science might enhance the ability of artificial intelligence AI researchers to create neuromorphic brain inspired algorithms such as neural networks reinforcement learning and hierarchical perception this could accelerate risks from uncontrolled AI participants at a 2011 AI workshop estimated an 85 percent probability that neuromorphic AI would arrive before brain emulation this was based on the idea that brain emulation would require understanding some brain components and it would be easier to tinker with these than to reconstruct the entire brain in its original form by a very narrow margin the participants on balance leaned toward the view that accelerating brain emulation would increase expected AI risk waiting might give society more time to think about the consequences of brain emulation and develop institutions to improve cooperation emulation research would also speed up neuroscience as a whole which might accelerate medical advances cognitive enhancement lie detectors and capability for psychological manipulation emulations might be easier to control than de novo AI because we understand better human abilities behavioral tendencies and vulnerabilities so control measures might be more intuitive and easier to plan for emulations could more easily inherit human motivations emulations are harder to manipulate than de novo AI because brains are messy and complicated this could reduce risks of their rapid takeoff also emulations may be bulkier and require more hardware than AI which would also slow the speed of a transition unlike AI an emulation wouldn't be able to rapidly expand beyond the size of a human brain emulations running at digital speeds would have less intelligence differential vist of this AI and so might more easily control AI as counterpoint to these considerations boström notes some downsides even if we better understand human behavior the evolution of emulation behavior and a self-improvement might be much less predictable than the evolution of safe diNovo AI under self-improvement emulations may not inherit all human motivations perhaps they would inherit our darker motivations or would behave abnormally in the unfamiliar environment of cyberspace even if there's a slow take off toward emulations there would still be a second transition to de novo AI later on to intelligence explosions may mean more total risk topic advocates Ray Kurzweil director of engineering at Google claims to know and foresee that people will be able to upload their entire brains to computers and become digitally immortal by 2045 Kerswell made this claim for many years eg during his speech in 2013 at the global futures 20:45 International Congress in New York which claims to subscribe to a similar set of beliefs mind uploading is also advocated by a number of researchers in neuroscience and artificial intelligence such as Marvin Minsky while he was still alive in 1993 Joe Strout created a small website called the mind uploading homepage and began advocating the idea in cryonics circles and elsewhere on the net that site has not been actively updated in recent years but it has spawned other sites including mind uploading dot org run by Randall a Kohn who also moderates a mailing list on the topic these advocates see mind uploading as a medical procedure which could eventually save countless lives many transhumanists look forward to the development and deployment of mind uploading technology with transhumanists such as nick bostrom predicting that it will become possible within the 21st century due to technological trends such as Moore's law michio kaku in collaboration with science hosted a documentary sci-fi science physics of the impossible based on his book physics of the impossible episode 4 titled how to teleport mentions that mind uploading via techniques such as quantum entanglement and whole brain emulation using an advanced MRI machine may enable people to be transported to vast distances at near light speed the book beyond humanity cyber evolution and future minds by Gregory s Paul and LD Cox is about the eventual and - the author's almost inevitable evolution of computers into sentient beings but also deals with human mind transfer Richard Doyle's wet wares experiments in post vital living deals extensively with uploading from the perspective of distributed embodiment arguing for example that humans are currently part of the artificial life phenotype Doyle's vision reverses the polarity on uploading with artificial life forms such as uploads actively seeking out biological embodiment as part of their reproductive strategy topic skeptics Kenneth D Miller a professor of neuroscience at Columbia and a co-director of the Center for theoretical neuroscience raised doubts about the practicality of mind uploading his major argument is that reconstructing neurons and their connections is in itself a formidable task but it is far from being sufficient operation of the brain depends on the dynamics of electrical and biochemical signal exchange between neurons therefore capturing them in a single frozen state may prove insufficient in addition the nature of these signals may require modeling down to the molecular level and beyond therefore while not rejecting the idea in principle Miller believes that the complexity of the absolute duplication of an individual mind is insurmountable for the nearest hundreds of years equals equals see also
