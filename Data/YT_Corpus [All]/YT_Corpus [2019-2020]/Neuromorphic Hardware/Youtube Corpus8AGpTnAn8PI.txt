 hello everyone i'm going to present our work weekly supervise the multitasking representation journey for human activity analysis human activity analysis is a core part in many user-centric applications and it opens up a vast potential to improve our daily life there has been extensive research on human activity recognition using different sensors and different machine learning algorithms but most previous works have some limitations for example most of the previous works focused on learning from one aspect of the data like only recognizing the activity or only identifying the person however activity recognition and person identification are closely related sharing knowledge between related tasks leads to learning generalize the representation helping to reduce the risk of overfitting and therefore combining them into one multitasking model is reasonable and can be beneficial for both tasks second many personal identification methods are based on irs face or fingerprint these methods require specific cooperation from the users it would be better if the person identification model can take different inputs to complete the identification task some other works identify person based on limited number of activities for example gate recognition based person identification it assumes working is the only activity to be performed during the identification but in real world this assumption may not hold in this work we proposed a cms networks based on multi-task model the model will map the data into two representation spaces one space for the activity the other space for the person in the activity representation space the data will be grouped together if they are the same type of activity or stay away from each other if they are different activity types similarly in the person representation space if the data pairs are from the same person they will stay closely but if the data pairs are from different person they will stay away from each other we visualize the representation vectors in the two representation spaces the first row is the activity representation space and the second row is the person representation space as we can see that each type is grouped into its own cluster in each representation space we compare the results from our model with the results from other published works as we can see the proposed multitasker method achieve the competitive performance on both tasks compared with the supervised single task approaches in most situations in the second experiment we expanded at the proposed multi-task model to include additional attribute representation learning here we choose the gender of the person as another representation learning task the experiment results show that three types of different representations are learned successfully so we know this model can be easily expanded to other related representation learning tasks in the third experiment we consider that in real world application it will be impossible for the model to have complete and perfect information about the similarities between all data items and for all attributes of interest therefore we divided the data set into two parts of equal size one part of the data only provides the similarity information of the activity types while the other part of the data only provides the similarity information of the person identities as shown in the result table with only partial similarity information the performance of the multi-task method is relatively close to the performance of the multitasker method using the complete similarity information so it indicates that with partial similarity information the model is capable of effectively utilizing cross-task information to achieve performance that is competitive with other models to further understand the effect of the multitasking learning framework we conducted a series of application experiments each single task model is trained to learn only one task and we can see from the results that expanding the model from single task learning to multi-task learning does not cause performance loss in most cases on the contrary the performance of model is most of the time better than the single task models okay this is a short presentation about the paper thank you
