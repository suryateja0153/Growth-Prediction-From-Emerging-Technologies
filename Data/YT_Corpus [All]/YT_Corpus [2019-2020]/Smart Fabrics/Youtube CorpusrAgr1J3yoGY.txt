 hello everyone my name is daniel i'm a third-year phd student from ex-discovery lab at donald bust college today i'm going to talk about capacity content based objective recognition on interactive fabric using capacitive sensing this work was done in collaboration with two undergrad interns lou and the ug as well as my advisor teddy and the shindong before go into detail of this work i want to briefly show you what capacitive is and why it can be useful capacitive is a capacitive sensing technique that makes very aware of the object is in contact with this includes things like food items and dinnerware it can also determine the change of what's inside objects like containers or cups for example it can differentiate between milk coke apple cider cold and hot water in a regular glass cup and those many everyday objects around us are made or covered by the fabric there are numbers of verifications that are enabled by our system technique such as turning a cluster into a data tracker with our smart textile or a smart tablecloth for recipe helper next step add a slice of cheese although there are a number of techniques to enable interactive fabric the one most related to capacitive is testable by jungkook at all testivo demonstrates a negative fabric to recognize metallic object based on inductance in contrast our work focuses on non-metallic arbitrary data also very common in daily life all work complement existing research with a new sensing technique that is based on capacitance next i will explain how the sensing works for capacitive when object is placed on a textile sensor that is made of conductive electrodes the capacitance among the air source will change due to the permittivity of the aperture and the different material of the object will bring out different permittivity resulting different capacitors thus capacity will recognize objects by measuring different changes in capacitance next i want to talk about their approach for fabrication first we're using an adhesive to bond a conductive fabric to a textile substrate then we use a desktop garden machine to cut out the electrode and load connection after cutting we'll be heating again and then purely unnecessary pieces of so the pattern is clear next we need to connect the column electrodes to connect the column electrode using a sewing machine or hand stitch to contain a conductive thread for each column then we attach your conductive fabric to the bottom of the ground plane the sensor is completed to make data sensor accuracy and the robustness will be a 10 participation study we test 20 everyday objects including kiwi avocado grapefruit critical and so on each object was repeated for 10 times in a randomized order we pre-trained a model shooter before a study and the real-time recognition in the study in turn our system can achieve overall accuracy of 94 percent this is increasing results especially for the items which have a similar strap but have a different content or material such as kiwi and avocado in addition we also evaluate how well the system can recognize different type of liquids for this variation we recruit a volunteer and asked her to test six type of liquids including cold water hot water coke apple cider milk and beer each drink has a tiny sample for training and a tiny sample for testing the results show the over frequency of ninety percent the worst case which was bigger if we remove resulting a higher accuracy of up to 96 percent with that i would like to conquer our work with street techno messaging first we present non-mechanical object recognition technique or active fabric using capacitive sensing we measure the accuracy of our technique with several experiments we demonstrate unique applications in apple biologists technique thank you for taking the time to listen i'm happy to take any question now
