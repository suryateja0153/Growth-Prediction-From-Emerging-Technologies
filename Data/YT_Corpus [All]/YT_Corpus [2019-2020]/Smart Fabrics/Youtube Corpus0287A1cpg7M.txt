 Hi, my name is Stacy Flynn. I'm CEO and co-founder of Evrnu. 90% of all clothing in the world is made out of either polyester or cotton, and cotton is a very water intensive crop. It takes about 700 gallons of water to make one t-shirt, and we're disposing of about 50 million tons of clothing waste every year, so it's a big problem on a lot of levels. Evrnu takes garment waste, and we essentially break it down and convert it into new fiber. It's a unique process where we're liquefying garment waste, and turning it into higher-quality fiber than the fiber may have been when it was new. We want all products to essentially become future supply. So one of the coolest things we can do is then take that fiber, create new premium clothing from it, and then break that clothing down again in the future. We're running a variety of different pilots with scaling partners next year. We're working with Levi's, Target, an unnamed athletic brand, and Stella McCartney.
