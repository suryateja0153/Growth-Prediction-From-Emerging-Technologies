 now earlier this year i brought in a heavyweight in the world of cycling aerodynamics to gtn none other than simon smart from drag to zero we explored a number of products that claimed to give us an aerodynamic saving we looked at that saving versus their cost giving us a cost per watt and it seems like you guys enjoyed that but in all honesty we were only just getting started there were so many more products that we wanted to look into but just simply ran out of time so here is our slightly more geeky version of cost per watt version 2.0 okay so as with last time we're going to be comparing a bunch of products that all claim to save us a certain number of what's going to be looking at that saving alongside their price therefore allowing us to calculate how much each and every one of those what's is costing us of course this isn't exact science there are so many variables at play when we look at cycling aerodynamics but someone that does have a very good idea in this department is simon smart he has probably more cycling aerodynamic experience than most people in the world with 15 years of experience as well as experience within f1 so i think he's a pretty good place to start and a very good source and he did a very good job last time so time to give simon a call [Music] right hi simon thanks uh thanks again for joining us today now we're gonna get a little more geeky today but before we do that should we start by setting some baseline rules as we did with last time now you you typically do like your testing at 50 kilometers an hour um we're going to run it a little bit lower than that we're going to go 40 kilometers now this week yeah that's right it's it is can be very confusing because you know the numbers are if you quote a wattage gain at 50 kph it's virtually double what it is at 40 kph so the numbers we're talking about now are more realistic and related to someone who's racing at 40kbh which is what we're really interested in but sometimes the numbers might feel quite small but they're actually quite significant okay so should we delve on in and i'm gonna i'm gonna start with a i guess a slightly unusual one maybe not something that people think of as something to get aero gains in and that is their pedals now a lot of people out there using something like a look kio2max pedal or similar and i want to compare that alongside something like the speedplay zero aero which is well essentially as the name suggests it is an aero pedal and it's almost got a covering around the base of it so it's a very sleek design now what is the kind of difference between those pedals what are we seeing and then what's the what saving yeah it's surprising how sensitive the flow is around the foot and um you can you can imagine that you know a messy pedal can really disturb the flow on the under on the sole of the foot and it's not something you really ever think about because you're never really looking at it but it's quite a hard thing to test you know when you're when you're starting to deal with people peddling um and using penalty mannequins and things it's quite challenging because it's quite a dynamic environment so um you know that's how our jobs getting harder and harder these days because we're trying to identify those small gains um with a lot of kind of noise in the system so uh once things start spinning rotating it's it's harder to take those measurements so you know there's there's a sort of bandwidth there you you know you might find with someone it's or like three watts and someone else is it it's a what and a half but there's a level of us experimental error in there as well you've got to include so i'd say you know as a as a safe as a safe bet it would be a good a nice clean two-watt game okay and you've tested more people than probably anyone out there so you'll know and that's like in terms of a cost per watts um i mean speedplay zero aero pedals typically come in at around 230 pounds that's about 115 pounds per watt um and actually before we move on i i'm right i think i'm right in saying the speed play zero arrow pedals have like a dim dimple effect on the on the base um what is it around these dimples that we why are they seen on aero products what do they actually help them do well i mean it's a bit of a yeah people do question it because it's obviously it comes from the famous thing with it with a golf ball and uh uh you know a lot of these these shapes you consider in in bicycle and amazon aren't spinning like that um but and it's really um texture in the the flow and personally probably a finer texture would give you a slightly better result than having the dimples on there now moving on to hydration systems now this is really interesting so we talked a little bit last time around kind of just bottles on the frame versus no bottles behind the saddle this time i actually want to talk about the front hydration systems so we're seeing more and more bikes with integrated hydration systems but also you can get the add-ons of aftermarket hydration systems so um can we delve into this then so what is it like maybe a potential what saving because i believe there is between having no hydration system on the front and then having an integrated hydration system that's right um the really clean integrated systems like a nose cone and tend to uh give you the same frame drag when the wind is straight on but as you go into a crosswind you actually get a side force and a side effect from the nose cone so you find that um yeah i'd say we you know typically you could expect to see maybe a one up to one and a half watt gain from that nose cone device in a crosswind um so overall on average if you said for all the conditions you're in maybe it's a something like a 0.7 watt gain that that would be fair and um similarly with some of the aftermarket bottles as well we do find some similar advantage with the with the advantage in the crosswind so i mean taking uh like a canyon speed max there they're they're older model now if we looked at their their setup without a hydration system which comes in at around just shy of three thousand pounds versus their integrated one which is around six and a half thousand pounds that would be around three thousand five hundred pounds per watt saving but obviously you're getting a lot more than just an integrated hydration system with that um so actually looking at an aftermarket product one of the most popular ones is the profile design area systems now as you kind of have mentioned they are really good but i imagine probably not as good maybe as the fully integrated system so let's say a what um saving with that and that you know you're talking 110 pounds per watt there so yeah interesting and next one we're going to move on to is chain rings so this is again something that people maybe don't always think of but a lot of bikes typically come with the kind of the the open design chain rings but there are closed designs or tt aero chainrings um what is the kind of saving we could see on these such a ring yeah it's interesting one actually i mean to be honest we've been more driven by going to the big the big rings because of you know other other reasons for gearing and it is then when you actually sort of i was looking at looking at the flow and cfd and you appreciate how much it does tidy up the flow it's surprising it really does help to align the flow which is it's such a messy area down in the middle of the bike you know around your feet the bottom bracket i think again it's a it's a tricky thing to measure um because you really need need to have something peddling but i'd say that it's around 0.7 what gain that we get from a you know a nice aero chain ring yeah so i mean typically like a an aero chamber you could pick up for around 90 to 100 quid some cheaper obviously um so yeah we're talking 90 quid for 0.7 what saving i mean if we did equate that to a what saving you're talking 129 pounds per watt but anyway that's getting a bit complicated there next interesting bit though is um it's bar tape now you'll have noticed um a lot of viewers will have noticed a lot of people now opting for nobel tape or kind of skateboard grip tape and i'm i'm quite keen to delve into this with you what is the reasoning here and what is the saving if there is any actually um more so than ever with that everybody's going to the hydro levers if the diameter of the of the actual um uh bar isn't sort of flush um you get some flow separation behind there so actually by putting the tape on there if at worst doesn't cost you anything and it it could be a small small game as long as it's not too thick um so yeah so having grip tape or um a finished foam tape on there is absolutely fine and if anything i'd say i imagine it could even improve drag by 0.2 watts or so okay that's very interesting all right next one then um socks now um everyone likes to poke fun at triathletes for not wearing socks of course but um what about compression socks and then also the sort of the aero trip socks that we see mostly like tt riders wearing um but also there are other brands out there like endura doing them for triathlon and what are the sort of savings we see from no socks compression socks and then your fully fledged sort of aero trip socks yeah i mean the compression socks has got you know obviously they're not necessarily designed where someone's choosing the texture for aerodynamics but it happens that the the rough um materials i tend to use are actually effective and i'd say typically can give you a you know a half watt to a what saving uh but the thing about texturing as well is it tends to uh work at specific speeds so that's the real challenge with fabrics is that you can find a fabric that's really fantastic 45 kph but it could be slower at 40 and slower at 50 um so it's the challenge some fabrics are better at covering the speed range and giving you an advantage over the whole split speed range so certainly if you go to the other end of the spectrum i would say that you know you could gain from a trip sock with you know with discrete trips up to maybe let's say four watts so we've gone from the compression socket say half a watt to four watts but and the other thing is if it can also be slower as worth the trips in the wrong place so what we find is a a middle road or something that's always working is something like the ribbed um fabric it's not overall as fast as a a trip but it works 95 percent of the time rather than i'd say maybe personally it's a very difficult thing to predict but you could say that it maybe only works 10 or 15 of the time and then what sort of kind of saving might we see on um one of those what are they they're safer kind of trip stock then oh sorry yeah i didn't mention that so i i'd say um you could assume an average of a safe to watch gain from from a trip at the trips off with a with you know fabric or a textured fabric yeah so sort of 25 pounds for those kind of socks and that's 13 pound per watt so that's pretty good now next one and i know this is going to be a tricky one to answer because it's around helmet position this is so personal and dependent and you can have a very good aero helmet on someone but it could be pointing up in the air but i do want to talk about kind of having the tail of the arrow helmet proud from the body and then the tail of the arrow helmet tucked into the body into the back what the difference we might see because and there are also ways in which we can achieve that right so i just wanted to get your input on this one yes that's a really interesting one i think that is quite fascinating to look at the helmet development over the last 10 years i mean when i think back to when we were first testing riders um most most helmets had long tails and and that was one of the challenges if if you didn't have that helmet in just the right position it would it could be actually detrimental and a tail sticking up invariably could be costing you maybe i'd say typically two and a half watts um as opposed to making a helmet fit someone properly um and that's what really drove everyone to the to the short tails because in a lot of the time you know i think sort of it was almost like bad education back then for the few people who come in the windsun they knew it was important but for anyone else they just stuck a helmet on tails sticking up in the air the helmet was slower and then stubby helmets were born and they were actually going faster because the tail wasn't working in the first the first place and now i see we're coming going through an evolution we're coming back to this mid-length tail and the end of the day a tail if it fits right and it's filling that void around the back of your neck and controlling the flow onto your shoulders it has to be a winner but it's that challenge of as you say making it fit right and finding the helmet that works for you and i know um some brands are making helmets now that adjustable so you can adjust the tilt something that i've done before and i know you have done with athletes as well is actually putting some kind of like foam padding in the front and almost tilting it around yourself um i mean i i've picked that stuff up for 10 quid i think you i think it's like go-cart padding or something like that um like what is so we're saying it's like two and a half watts something around that region for a tail sticking up in the air versus down and that's a pretty good saving if you can get that to work so that's what four pound per watt that's not bad um but as you say obviously it's worth checking out other helmets especially for triathletes who are racing over longer distances when you might be moving your head around quite a lot and not being able to hold that arrow position so that's really interesting now we're kind of done with the cost per watt but i did want to go into some fun kind of additional sections so um one was around bolts on our frame now i've seen plenty of athletes i haven't done this myself before but taping up bolts on their frame like does that actually make a difference well i mean it's it's against again it's a broad question you could have if it's in a sensitive area you know taking a bulb can make a quite a big difference but i i suppose the way i have a lot of experiences that is when when we're developing frames quite often we use a modular sort of mules with sla printed parts that we screw on and and then we will sort of clean it all up and and fill those holes in manually and and i'd say it's often it's not as much it isn't as much as you usually you'd imagine i don't think i think i see a lot of people that are absolutely paranoid about a bit of tape that's sort of you know not they've not put a tape over over their bolt hole and um i think in in some ways you could have yourself over more of that bit of tape isn't like stuck perfectly down to not bothering in the first place but yeah it's the kind of thing it's it's it's good practice and yeah i guess you know if we were if you cleaning up a bike and we were testing it in you know doing a final wind tunnel test or something you wanted to make sure it's all perfect you might find 0.2 watts or something in there that's good news um and then finally um a watch on your wrist and like triathletes yeah obviously the distance to the race they want their metrics the the data there um and yeah having a watch is the obvious answer for that does it make a difference having a watch but bulging out on the side of your wrist um i think um again in position if you've got a higher arm position then actually having the if you can if you when i i used to um when i used to race with a watch i would always just twist it around and and if it's on the back of the wrist it's not really costing you much if if anything um if you look into cfd or something you can see that you've got this sort of low pressure sort of in the cavity behind and by filling it with a watch or something actually could improve drag slightly so it's in a c you can almost get it in a similar position as you do with the today's kind of current um garmin mounts where you aim to get the computer sort of between a bit behind the behind this area here um so i wouldn't worry about it too much i think it's just around around the back if it's around the front then yeah i think it probably could cost you a what or one or two watts okay that's really interesting well there we go that's um answered it for some athletes out there well thanks ever so much for that today simon nice to see you brilliant no problem well that has been super interesting i think simon deserves a whole series on our channel because he has a wealth of experience for sure i hope you guys have enjoyed today's video if so please do give it a like do get involved in the
