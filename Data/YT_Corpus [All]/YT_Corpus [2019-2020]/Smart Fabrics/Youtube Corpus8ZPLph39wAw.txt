 [Music] chameleons can famously change color to camouflage themselves communicate with each other and control their body temperature scientists have tried to copy these color changing tricks for stealth technologies anti-counterfeiting measures and electronic displays but the materials they've developed so far can't compete with chameleon skin now researchers have made a flexible film that changes color in response to stretching pressure or humidity they report the results in acs applied materials and interfaces by tensing or relaxing their skin chameleons can change the way light reflects from guanine nanocrystals under the skin's surface producing what's known as structural coloration these structural colors are different from the pigments that give many other creatures their hues similar to these structures cellulose nanocrystals can self-assemble into an iridescent film but the films are typically fragile and unlike chameleon skin they can't be stretched without breaking fae song you song wang and colleagues wanted to develop a highly flexible film made of cellulose nanocrystals that changes color when stretched to increase the flexibility of cellulose nanocrystals the researchers added a polymer called p-e-g-d-a and used uv light to cross-link it to the rod-shaped nanocrystals producing films with bright iridescent colors the films were both strong and flexible stretching up to 39 of their original length before breaking during stretching the color of the film changed gradually from red to green and then changed back when relaxed according to the researchers this is the first time that such brilliant structural color changes caused by stretching and relaxation have been achieved for cellulose nanocrystal materials the film also changed color with pressure and humidity the team wrote the letters scu on the film by pressing down with an inkless pen then they increased the relative humidity to 100 percent which caused the letters to disappear reducing the humidity made the marks show up again the researchers say that the new bio-based smart skin could be useful for strain sensing encryption and anti-counterfeiting [Music] measures [Music] you
