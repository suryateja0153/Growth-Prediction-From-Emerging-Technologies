 okay all right this is war King no idea how to no oh gone out shut the door come back oh it's so weird I can see myself in the past hello can you hear me is it working how does it come how do I find out sound I see you hi is the sound on can you can you hear me hmm maybe I should ah muted okay hi everyone I'd seeing lots of people Hey hello I am sitting hello yeah yeah this is so fun Oh No okay so I'm gonna carry on I'm gonna mute myself because otherwise I hear myself back in the future so hi everyone sorry I'm just trying to get used to this because I've never done it before so my name is becca rose and i am a digital artist maker educator based in Bristol and Jocelyn from co.labs kindly invited me to do a session on e textiles because I do a lot of making midi textiles and yeah so I'm gonna share some techniques and some ideas what else I've got a list here so I'm gonna refer to my list and we're gonna make a circuit from scratch and so I'll show you how things work the techniques how they kind of work has a system I have a book and I'm going to read a little passage from it and that's about it I will explain as I go so please ask questions and and yeah it's really great to be here lots oh look my mom is here oh that's so funny um my mom lives in France so I don't get to see her very often so it's nice to be here in this digital space but yeah thank you collab for having me and hopefully and this is really useful and if you're not joining live and you can see this later hopefully some of these techniques you can use in your practice in some way so where should I start yes so maybe I'll just start by speaking a little bit about being a creative technologist because um the collab is kind of this intersection between creative practice and kind of technical practices and so what I'm going to be showing today electronic textiles sellable circuits in textiles is this kind of intersection between the kind of textile practice knitting sewing lots of kind of handcraft skills and more technical practices such as making circuits or other objects and yeah and so my I'm an artist and I'm coming from that perspective so what I'm going to talk about today is maybe a little bit more about some creative ways that you can use materials and I'm just basically giving myself a disclaimer because I probably say things that aren't 100% tecnica rep and I'd be very happy for you to share feedback in the comments about some better more technical ways of speaking about things but I'm coming from a textile practice background so that's the way I'm going to speak about things today um and yeah what I was gonna do is I have another camera view and so I'm going to kind of talk mostly with my hands and with materials and so you can go along but I'll kind of maybe switch between and this view see me in my kitchen and kind of close up of my beautifully manicured nails and and yeah um maybe I'll just get started because it looks like a few people here already yes so let's just um let's just move into this kind of you gonna work yes maybe young okay so here is the other view it's just straightening it out of it so you can get as much yes thank you here so here is my little making space yeah so yeah I want to start with talking about some materials that we use in electronic textiles but maybe before that I will just show you a circuit that I'm going to show you how to make in a bit and I said in the in the link if you've read the information I've said that I've been exploring some different materials from around the house that we might be able to make sensors with and so this little circuit here I found these spoons these tiny little cute spoons in a cupboard and they make a great sensor because they are conductive and they make a little switch and so what I'm going to do today as well as kind of show you some other materials it's just show you how to make specific a close-up of that and little circuit it's got a battery in it it's got a light second at all LED lights and it has someone to serve no thank you to fella um it has these lovely stitched circuitry using conductive red which is a kind of nylon base thread two interwoven with copper so that you can use it to make some really beautiful circuits this is a chain stitch here and then it's got this as you can see so you kind of see the light I've been the batteries bed because I've been using this for a couple of days now since yesterday sorry but yeah you can kind of see the light flicker on and off when I touch these two spoons which okay makeshift light sensor and if I had more space I can kind of jingle this around and show you how you can wear it kind of on your head if you imagine that the light is going on off but I don't think you can really get it within the frame so never mind that I can just kind of imagine the kind of movement that these spoons jingling around would sense so that's kind of where we're aiming and and to do that we will need some conductive threats to make the kind of the traces the circuitry and I have a few different conductive thread the one I'm using mostly so instead of in a textiles instead of using wires and we use conductive threads and this one here is the one that I mean I really like has lots of problems too it's not the best material but and it's really great because it's very conductive so you can sew really long circuits and it still works and just a little box of these so this is what I'm going to use um and I'll just get some of this out and just show you a few different materials okay so this is the thread snip and it's hard to see it's very thin there we go it is really beautiful the color is so nice and it's it's um I think this is a five-ply actually it says on the box what is it saying seven so it's seven different or seven different very fine copper and threads woven and plied come twisted around this nylon core and this is the kind of basis of each II textiles is using threads instead of instead of wires or kind of harder materials and the nice thing about these is they're pliable you can sew them into any shape you like you don't have to have straight lines you can have curves and you can do lots of lovely things with them like late you can make lace you can knit you can do crochet and all sorts of different techniques and I'll show you some in a while so that's one one material I see and my neighbors doing some drumming so you can might get to do that hopefully okay so this is this this material here is it's made by a company called Carl Grimm and they're based in Germany and the reason I use this because I really like the material but it's actually quite hard to get hold of the way I got a hold of it was through working with collaborator Annie Laird and who bought kilo because a kilo is the minimum that you can buy so I kind of have just shared a little bit of her stock and if you are interested in getting hold of some of this one one way of getting hold of is to sharing it with other people but also one top tip that I found out is that you can get multiple spools made up so for example just three of you at once you know you can ask them to spool it into three three reels like this and then you don't have to deal with like splitting up like I've done onto these kind of where is it tiny cardboard spools these cardboard spools are quite good for sharing though I often take them to workshops with me and then if someone's really keen you can kind of just give them a small amount and then that helps people get started not having to buy kilos of the material because that can be expensive so before I use any of these I thought I'd show you another this is another thread this is one that's a lot easier to get hold off yeah and and here we go where are we yeah so this is a slightly darker material it's made out of steel not copper and has it got a core actually I'm not sure I think it's got I think this one is a slightly different setup so the one that I showed you at the beginning actually I'm going to scratch it arrange show you I can't scratch it away yeah so this one here yeah can you see in the middle it's got like a nylon core and the copper is wound around that nylon core whereas this steel thread is actually got microfibers combined with steel in the actual material so it's not got a kind of core which means it's a much nicer thread to sew it it's less brittle it's really soft but it also means that it is not so good for like longer distances so if you're gonna have a really really long circuit you would have a lot more resistance because this and you wouldn't get so if you had a light on one end of a circuit it wouldn't be as bright as if you use this lovely common stuff so that's the reason why I use the copper because this it's less was less has less resistance in it but they're both nice to use what else oh yeah so I'll show you another material and then we're going to look at the kind of resistance to what I was talking about so this is the yon conductive yarn and just close to the camera as well so this is a really nice material it's similar to the steel based thread I just showed you is based it's got steel microfibers woven in with yarn and so it's kind of a lot softer than steel based thread and and it's actually much more resistive so if you were going to have 3 3 you're going to attach this these three different threads to a circuit this first one will be really brave because it's just basically pure copper superconductive this second steel one would be a little bit duller and then this yarn would be really dull because it's not very it's not very good for passing current through it doesn't it's quite resistive but that could be like a bit annoying because you're like oh I wanted to make these bright circuits and bright lights but actually it's really great because it's you can kind of make senses with that what I mean by that is for example this pom pom pom pom this pom pom has a kind of regular yarn and also some of this conductive yarn that I just showed you and it's when I squeeze it going like this whichever one loves to squeeze pom poms right it changes it makes it I squeeze really hard it makes the cup all of the little traces in there closer together and it will make the light stronger because it makes has less resistance when you squeeze it and that means that you can do really nice things with this material or you can kind of make all these lovely things like pom poms or other things and you you can squeeze them and pull them or or press them and they change in resistance and you can end up making some really nice sensors with them that sense squeeze pull push and kind of different feelings which you can hook up to a light or your computer or something else to trigger different things so that's those different materials now what I'm going to do is I have my multimeter I'm just doing a little shout out to East stitches Bristol which is a group that I'm part of and also wicked fabrics these are two stitches or a textiles groups that meet regularly and share ideas and knowledge and so this is my multimeter I'm just going to get out of this little case it's the cutest multimeter ever so what is a multimeter well this is a multimeter is used it's a bit like a probe I suppose and you can use it to look at circuits with them so these little the two probes and you can kind of literally use them we use them as kind of eyes to see what's going on in your circuits so you kind of I can't lost lost the plot you only look so for example get my get my yarn here this is the yarn I just showed you and I'm gonna turn my multimeter on two to the third setting this see that so there's off second setting is this one here which looks at current and then the third setting there looks it's got this little amiga sign I'm just about seen and that measures how much resistance is in a certain material so and it uses arms which is what they made a sign stands for yeah so let's just see what what that means in actual real life it's probably gonna be hard to do show you and do at the same time so you'll have to trust me that something is happening maybe I can try doing a bit placer so for example I've got it on I've got my two ends and I'm going to put one here one here and get a reading which we do Oh reading on my multimeter which says 300 and fit lost it 300 I'm reading upside-down 1000 okay approximately this amount of conduct conductive yarn is a thousand ohms which if you don't know the scale that doesn't really mean much but so let's look at another bit of conductive material so we can kind of compare the two so that was the yarn let's look at steel which you can hardly see on the table but it's that so to do the same that is it's 8 ohms so well it was quite a big difference then so this one for this amount was about thousand and then this one for this amount which you cannot see because because it's a black dress is about 8 ohms so quite a big difference between those two and then let's just look at this lovely same distance I know it's gonna be not very much this isn't oh my god who is it's a 1:1 on so we've got thousand eight and one so you can kind of get an idea I mean even though maybe that number doesn't mean anything you do get an idea of different kind of scales of resistance in that material and maybe a little bit more about the model I have a comment we have a multimeter oh yes so there's a really good question I have a automatic multimeter so my eye the reason I've got this one is because it's very cute it's tiny can fit in your bag and it's it what it does is I will I will look at a circuit with it don't like I just did and it will kind of waiver around trying to work out what's going on and it in it it's a bit annoying sometimes because it just kind of the numbers change and you have to sit there patiently waiting and but the nice thing about it is it just does it all for you it's like automatic you don't have to do any like thinking beforehand which I like and there are other kinds of multimeters which I don't have at home with me now but they called they're more manual settings and the way they work is you'll do the same things you set you set your dial on to the UM measuring resistance section but there might be three options to choose from and you're like oh my god what am I gonna do it says 2200 or 2000 for example I can't remember what the exact same and so what you have to do in your head before you start making the measurement is you have to kind of work out what scale you're going to be working at so for example what I've just what I just did with this copper and if I was using an automatic sorry a manual multimeter I would I would set it at 20 ohms because I'm like okay it's gonna be around 0 to 20 because it's quite but you know it's quite low resistance so I would kind of make that measurement in my head it's gonna be in the tens basically um and then this the second one is still I'm not sure I tested it so I know but you might not know you might think oh it could be it could be 20 it could be a hundred so maybe you would try it with the 20 and you would get the results or you could try with the 200 setting and you might have a 0.1 or something like that which means that you need to move down the scales to get the better reading and then the final one this yarn I measured first what did I say it was a thousand so you'd be like oh man this is gonna be really resistive I'm gonna put it all the way up crank it up to 200 because it's going to be in the hundreds so you're kind of just like making that assumption before you start and pudding and meat and diet and putting the right dial according to what you think that will be yeah hopefully that makes sense it's difficult to explain without the actual thing here but you can play round the back so whilst we're here of the multimeter as I said I have been been looking at different materials from from my Roundhouse like thinking about what's conductive and I found a few things that kind of have a really low resistance for example coins like is literally zero on my multimeter that's one I have this little teapot which again has a really low resistance so just things that are metal around the house can make you can use and kind of with etext oils kind of embed them into your circuit somehow so these are all ones and all you need to do is just take your multimeter and literally just put it on the arms and just try things out to see it's another way of looking at things and looking at the world the single resistance is actually this one is yes pretty low it's like 0.1 or something because it's quite quite cleaned up quite then conductive so those are the two there's that's the way to you tomorrow to meet elsewhere been using it okay so what I'm gonna do kind of look at some different ways of using the multimeter and I am going to show you how to make a circuit with some of the materials that I was showing you and so put some fabric this is an old sheet that I have at home that I just cut up and what I thought I'd do first is I'm gonna cut a bit thread I'm just gonna briefly show you how to make stitch because even though some people might have this kind of maybe domestics knowledge of making stitching and knitting not everyone does so what I found in the classes that I've taught in the past is that we must not assume that we all know how to do a stitch and how to do it and I'm going to do it with a regular thread just because it it makes it easier to see easier to use and practice so if you're going to practice it I would recommend practicing as a stitching with a regular thread sew and so the way I'm starting is what the needle just threaded the needle with Smith cotton and I'm just going to do a running stitch down here and the way that I start stitching is I make a small stitch in the fabric do another small stitch a new stitch we go so that what that does is it really secures the thread into the material and no need for knots it's just a really nice way of doing it and then a running stitch is literally you put your needle in to the fabric and then you come out again like this in a straight line there's one stitch and then you just keep on doing that and you can also do multiple stitches at the same time there we go so just straight face up so it's just that's the kind of most simple stitch and although I've done chain stitch on the circuit that I've done shown you I'm going to just carry on with running stitch because it's a lot easier and let's just tie that off and I'll tie stitch off in exactly the same way as you would starting off so just three small stitches this okay and just cut that off then there we go so there's just a really simple stitch so let's get let's get started because in the process of doing this I can show you some other tools that we use infinity to exercise I'm just gonna cut a bit actually I'm gonna use I've only got one of these little embroidery hoops so I'm gonna take this off and use this one and you don't have to use an embroidery hoop but it does make your life a lot easier she's gonna be doing stitching so today from all whoops okay so that's just right there we go so that's our beginning surface and what I'm what we thought in the circuit but I showed you before is we have an LED like a light and we had we're gonna use some of this conductive thread and we have a battery and I made I made at the battery Harbor with kind of DIY version which you can just about see the battery is kind of tucked away in there but I'm going to use one that's kind of better for sewing into circuits for the moment just cuz it's bit quicker and these are custom-built this was this is by a company called kitronik but you can find these in lots of different companies sell them Adafruit sells them I'm trying to think of who else sells them you can also find them in technic Germany has a company that SERPs makes small batches of them you can find them online quite easily so yeah don't worry about that and then the nice thing is as they've been designed they've got these holes in the side and they've been designed so that you can use a needle to just needles just stitch them into there it's quite easily so that's that and then what was the other thing oh yeah I have the sensor but I'm gonna do that later okay so at the moment I've only got two things and I'm gonna have a sensor at the bottom here which I'm going to add at the end and so when you're designing a circuit one of the most important things to do is just sit for a moment and think about where everything is going to go oh I have it there's a message listening to the scissors listen it yep this isn't listed these okay just put point in these scissors these are fabric scissors and I've got a little marker here that basically says do not use these scissors they are fabric scissors and you can blunt your scissors by by using them on other materials so if you ever know anyone that uses texture they literally will cry and scream if you use that their textile scissors with paper or anything I've seen it happen and it's like literally the worst thing ever and they do make these these textile scissors because they're quite good quality they make such an amazing sound different to I think different paper scissors I love them so don't use these bird paper and yes so that's those yeah so we've got those two things and then what the first thing to do is just think about where everything goes you would be surprised by how many times people might make a circuit and then like build it all so it's like oh it's so beautiful yeah great and then they forget to put the battery in and then it's like oh where does the battery go so make sure you include the battery and I'm just going to draw a little dot where that the batteries gonna go where the LEDs gonna go and then I will do a little dot where I'm gonna put the sensor two dots because essentially what what this spoon sensors are here is they're just a break in the circuit so it's just where you normally if you just had a circuit with a battery in LED connected the light would be on the whole time and these just kind of allow you to either shimmer the light using spoons or turning on and off so that's what that's for and then I watched I do first I'm gonna put the LED on first cuz that's fun I'm actually going to use I'm so sensitive but with my scissors is that I'm going to use my little nail scissors to cut this conductive material with because because I'm just don't wanna even this metal might learn my scissors yeah I haven't I have like a knee-jerk reaction to using nurses okay all right we're gonna thread my needle you know people say um the neat that threading the needle is the most difficult thing and so maybe we can just look at how I do it because I've been doing it for such a long time that it's kind of become second nature and it's difficult to explain but basically the this conductive thread is actually really hard to work with because it frays and so if you ever get in trouble and it's fraying too much at the top like and you can kind of unwind itself you see that it's kind I'm wound and it's frayed don't try and thread that just chop it off and start again that's so you might need to take a bit more I normally take about an arm's length of fabric because that's how much you can sew is to just take a bit more than you need and then you can just rip it off if you need to and then what I do is I get a needle that has a reasonably big high but not too big because it'll be difficult to sew it and then squash the thread into my fingers and like pinch it into a finger thumb and then here we go now I'm not about to do it there it is okay so oh yeah this is a chat going on yeah I would definitely keep my scissors away from in the office away from anyone away from housemates whoever just maybe just keep them on you in your pockets don't let them out the site it's a recommended way of doing it I know someone I have a friend that wears scissors as a necklace around her neck and she actually won't use this colored scissors she only use black and white scissors because she loves black and white yep so afraid of the needle and then before I start I am going to curl my legs of my LED so this is an LED let's just get a battery I have this little set of batteries which they got from the pound shop in the UK which i think is also known as the dollar store maybe in the US and they had a set of eight and it has different kinds and some of them aren't very good so that one has got some good ones let's use this one a slightly better yeah very good so have a little coin cell battery and they're pretty easy to get hold off [Music] let's have a look so this is so there's my LED that's it working and has to talk by the LED for a second it's got two legs here we go and one of them is longer than the other and then your battery has two sides one is positive and one is negative and you can see it's positive because it has a little plus on it so I always ask Peters people what they think about what they think which leg might be the positive and which might be the negative of these LEDs because it has to go one way or the other way won't work it only works one way and if you think about it the easiest way to remember it is the long leg is bigger and positive it's plus bigger than negative and so the long leg is going to be positive and and generally when you ask that question people get it right but these these legs as they are this stand aren't going to be very good to sew into my circuit so what I'm going to do is a really lovely technique using these pliers and these players are designed for jewelry so they have this really lovely honed nose rather than other kinds of players which have a flat end on here and what you can do with your legs is you can curl them and make just there and make these cute little curled up points that you can sew a bit like these points here on the battery and let's just start doing up okay so I'm gonna go with the negative leg first and the way that happens is you just take the end there and you just twist it try and make it so you can see at the same time it's really satisfying there we go so can you just twisted a little bag and then I'm gonna open it out to make it easy to sew so it's flat so I can sew flat on your line use the fabric and that was the negative leg and then here's a top tip on the positive leg if you go a bit further down and you twist you can have one small hole in one slightly larger and that way you can tell what positive and what the negative list without having to test it because that's one thing that has does happen if you twist them okay show you so you can see it's a really nice kind of tangible ready to see what's positive and negative to you you see we know that this is the negativeness because legging you can keep track especially if you're doing like a hundred of them and you need to sew them in okay so that's going bad uh-huh and then I'm gonna do my little trick me do my little trick [Music] whoops okay one thing about this fabric is it can be miss sorry this thread is it kind of quite naughty my friend used to call it Brown doing it just like knots like brambles just slowly all right so I secured the fabric there's three different pumps to the subway three different tiny stitches and now I'm ready to which I do let's just see what we lack and minuses that's the positive so I'm going to go positive to positive on the battery and you can see it's the positive it's quite a little plus sign so it's so important like all right all right so maybe I'll do two more stitches I'm trying to like stitch this so that it's nice and secure because then you get a better connection in your circuit whoops there we go that's enough we're done about six I reckon five or six counting let me know okay there we go so then that's one side of the circuit is is secured and then I'm just gonna do a little dot to where I'm gonna start Tucson you yeah okay sure let's do this running stitch Audrey is Bromley I've got more chat bending LEDs leg in small circles yes it's good once some people also color one of the legs in like they might color them to the negative leg in black and that also works but you know the bending thing you're gonna bend them anyway you don't have to get a pen or sharpie just make sense really all right again very neat there we go there's my start of my circuit let's get this battery in I'm gonna do the same thing with the battery that I did just now with the LED one just secure it this batch was finished yep the right one and if you want to any point and kind of test that it's working your multimeter comes into play at this moment so you can use another function on the multimeter just to test before maybe before you cut it cut the thread you might want to test it first and then you don't have to like fill around and start again so on this this particular multimeter if you go to the same function that I went to just now which is the Amiga sign the roms there are some different symbols and what I do is that you select we want to have the symbol that looks like a Wi-Fi signal out here so let's select select and you can't really see very well but there's a little Wi-Fi signal here which is kind of just it signifies sound I think and what that is is a continuity tester and it just tests to see if there's a connection between two points in a circuit so for example I'm going to put one part of the probe here where I've sewn to and one part here and you can hear that it's saying yep there's a connection so I'm like ok I've done the I've done that I've done ok I can I can cut the wire now and and start on the next part of circuit ok so I'm just going to do couple of stitches and they're not making massive tiny mess haha anyone who's used this this is gonna tie it off in the offices to my scene well you use this thread will know that it really does get naughty so it's like looks like you're you know it's good for some reasons and about fathers but you still use it ok no let's just get so one thing about the multimeter and I'll put some links in the video is there's some really nice versions of the kind of concept of continuity checker multimeter by some differently textile artists for example Hannah Hannah Wilson who's part of a collective called Hoboken has made an on the hook multimeter and that is where it's using a crochet hook to measure the resistance as you're crocheting so you can make your circuits with this crochet hook and then it will tell you what your resistance is so that you can kind of test the circuit as you're making it which i think is really nice just and you know what I'm talking about this kind of DIY tools and there's another artist called araignee push surely I will put the link to her work in and she's done a project what about tooling and thinking about the kind of tools that are different or the kind of intersection of tools from textiles and electronics that each textile is used because you're kind of there's two knowledge bases you are using one of them is kind of rich and diverse history of textiles and the tools and knowledge that come with that and then there's also this technical tools like the multimeter or the kind of conductive materials and kind of rich history and knowledge of that and when they come together they make a whole new set of tools and so she's been exploring the kinds of tools that you might use or want when there's many textiles and electronics intersect and one of the tools that she's designed was a kind of pin cushion where you can use a pin cushion as a multimeter I would I really want one of those she's also been developing some different using kind of safety safety pins and kind of actual dressmakers pens as ways to kind of probe circuits because these probes on the multimeter are always designed this kind of work so they they've been what you can actually literally put a pin into your fabric and test the conductivity of it alright just tell yourself hey I should test it I didn't test the last one whoops [Music] [Music] now I am tested now I probably should have done as I was doing it but nevermind say yeah and yeah great okay so I have a working circuit let's pop a battery in there and then let's just use something lose this coin now just put it across yay it works oh it's 2.30 good you can see so I'm using this coin as a sensor there we go okay so I'll show you how maybe you could embed that in a second so that's the kind of basic layout of the kind of really basic circuit and at the moment is just in this proof it's a bit abstract but you can imagine how you can kind of embed that in different contexts in kind of clothing or in different doesn't even have to be in clothing it could be you know you can use lots of people using paper with the same kind of concepts but with kind of sticky tape that you can actually feel the circuits on the copper tape or kind of some people have made these kind of can use these materials to make speakers and you're literally kind of listening to the vibrations of the fabric through that so I will show you now a couple of senses that I made around the house using just found materials and one of them is obviously the coins which you can kind of see there put spoons I've shown you the spoons and what else other things these are really nice so we call these these butterfly clips in the u.s. they have another name I can't remember but they reason they're called butterfly clips is because they actually look like a butterfly I think they're called binder clips maybe in the US but you get them in different sizes and these really small ones are really cute and and again there we go so they they you can kind of use these to complete a circuit and you can just do something quite fun you know maybe you have a few of them or maybe they're connecting in different ways it's just stuff that you have other things oh yeah more coins so I found a massive jar of coins and then I also found probably you have this this bag of coppers which maybe you have and I just thought it was quite fun to use the bag of cotton coppers as a sensor and the way that I was doing this was maybe that way was to you stick one coin on to the end of the crocodile clip so these are if you've not seen them before sorry I just what is out there seen people knew what they were these are krookodile clips I think they are called alligator clips in the US which is you know but they've cool that for obvious reasons they they look like a crocodile and actually this is another thing that people have been iterating on in terms of textile tools because this this kind of bites of the crocodile is actually really bad for for fabrics it kind of specially has some beautiful silks it really could damage it so this is where kind of the pin techniques of using as a probe so instead of having this kind of nice clip you could just pin into the fabric and it much nicer join or this you can get some really nice smooth clips I think you can only actually at them in the US and their copper base and they don't have this horrible bite to them but for the moment I'm gonna use them because that's what I have at home right now so I have one end of my circuits into a penny and then there's a little hole in the bottom of this bag of coins I'm going to stick the other here we go stick that onto a couple of coins and stick that in the bottom and then put that onto my circuit okay so my see this my bag of coins is my sensor and I'm like yes so yeah that's another thing that's quite fun I was speaking to some friends yesterday and they were saying spoons with a fun thing or aluminium foil which most people have you could play around with that what you might have oh here's something else always use this first so these are great these things these are coins with holes in them just share them up here we go causing them amazing we don't have these points in England or the UK so there's quite exciting and these are a combination I think of Chinese and Norwegian coins and and yeah they all have that I don't know why they have closing them but it's amazing and so again I've got my crocodile clip attached to my circuit and the other side onto the coins and again you can kind of see the light flicking I stand in the way of light you can see more and so if I move the coins around you can kind of see and look how how nice they move they move in such a wonderful way because I've kind of tied them together with the yarn so so just like I can show you do some really fun things with that oh it's someone's just selling the Communist Japanese yen okay I'm sorry I don't I didn't know where they came from I found them in our just in a random draw in our house so yeah so that's another thing that you can do and I just love the way that moves I imagine it just like kind of wearing that around your neck or as a bracelet to be really fun and then finally another thing which might messy but you know I just thought let's go with this look I just found a random pile of keys and yarn in the bottom of the drawer at touching in a drawer in a cupboard and I was like okay let's make that interesting really going for how messy the things are right now for everyone what's going on so here we go I'm gonna just attach the crocodile clips random leads to keys in this bundle of yarn and mess and then let's see what happens some will it work no it was working there we go so occasionally all those keys might join and and then they create this kind of messy sense so and you can just imagine there we go this kind of joining so they're not drawing directly to each other they're joining through this kind of tangle and then there's keys use imagine how place where you can be with different materials that you find so yeah there's some different custom home sensors and what should I do maybe yeah let's try the pump on see if this works I haven't used this for a while so maybe works so that was pom-pom on here yeah lights gets brighter when you squeeze it really hard and it actually works really nicely as a stress ball so yes Oh in the chat someone says everything is plastic oh no maybe you have to go outside of the office kitchen is a really great place kitchen and then like that draw that just has random stuff in it I feel like everyone must have one of those random draws oh I didn't try the cheaper quickly let's do the teapot because that's really fun and so this is I don't know if you have these this is like a teapot that it's it's a teapot it's kind of quite meta it's a teapot that has tea in it and then this goes inside your cup and then it like infuses the tea inside the teapot but it's not a teapot I've seen your it's quite fun and so yeah I've made a little switch with this so I'm gonna put one end on to the handle of the teapot and then the other end on the lid and I realized that it kind of had this this long bit of wire or these bean beads don't really work so I've kind of bypassed them and I'm just putting the Concord RK on the lid and then let's hopefully that works yeah we have a teapot Swedish I have no idea what that is useful for or anything but it's just fun things that I had in my kitchen truck there we go so you could have that on permanently or you could just be like no you use my switch to any off okay so those are all the different things that I have found the house I realized that I might it's already been almost an hour of me talking so I don't know if anyone has any questions um I didn't get through like half of the things that I wanted to talk about today but maybe if you have questions you could let us know and I can ask answer them or like I have I have like a whole pile of materials on my kitchen table that I can kind of show and maybe they're relevant yeah so just let us know in the chat yeah I was going to show you some things about the Arduino so I won't go into too much detail about that but what I will do is show you what an Arduino looks like and how you would connect it to the circuit what what even an Arduino is just grabbed one here so these things here so my second to the side move over analog come in digital so and these are different to different Arduino and they are their Arduino this is kind of official Arduino this one is an older one it's called the Arduino Uno and these have been around I think maybe like two years 15 years I'm not sure they've been around for a while but I still think they're the most brilliant prototyping tool ever and I love using them and so basically what I would do with this Arduino well this one which is a clone of the original and I use I normally get these from my classes because they cost $7.99 and they work really well and the other thing about them is that without an official Arduino you have this kind of writing I'll talk a little bit about that in a second you have this writing on the side of the headers and this clone is kind of the only one I could find that also has the writing on the side of the headers so for teaching or for like not putting pins in the wrong hole it's brilliant um so what I would do theoretically and this may be little bit abstract but and I would have my sensor wherever my sensors gone michaelis let's find a sensor where pompom and I would have my pom-pom attached like I just had it but instead of having attached to the circuit so that the light turns on and off in my circuit here like this when I squeeze I would put my green over there not actually there but I would replace this circuit and I would put I would and use some wires to get the information from how I'm squeezing this or the kind of the information into the Arduino and then that sends that information to a computer and then there's a whole world of possibility you can do so you can your computer could play a fun song when you squeeze this or it could kind of maybe play a relaxing song because you're obviously really stressed out you need to squeeze the pom-pom and it kind of calm you down maybe you could do some breathing meditations or something like that and so we're going to into a lot of detail about that because I realize time is running out but essentially all of these kind of analog sensors and circuits that I've been doing can be used with an Arduino and the idea of that is just this wonderful possibility for sensing the physical world and kind of bringing that information into the computer so it's just a world waiting to be explored now I have some quest there's loads of questions hang on um would you would love to learn Oh if you okay so someone says we'd love to see product you have done so I haven't got lots of my projects here um but I do have one thing which I grab here besides yes so a couple years ago I love experimenting with kind of messy things as you can see and a couple years ago I was experimenting with darning or fixing mending with some of these conductive materials so I was using this which is the conductive yarn to mend socks and and then using those kind of mended sensors as ways to kind of get information play music turn lights on and off all sorts of things and so I have one here and this I say just say this but this these books are wonderful I'll put a link in those it's the Easter edie textile swatch exchange and it's a lots of different swatches that different artists making e textiles have kind of they make a swatch everyone makes for example there's 30 people everyone make 30 swatches and then exchange them as a way to kind of exchange these very physical material knowledge is in a way that's tangible and so here we go here is one of examples of the sensors and this one is kind of coming here it's got it shows you kind of how the sensor works here and then it's attached into here with a magnet so I can actually take it out and so this is I obviously you've got I when I made this up I managed to get my favorite and sparkly sock which has terrible holes in the bottom and then I've made these sensors and when you're wearing when you're wearing these socks you can kind of pass in that information into an Arduino or something like that and then trigger things with a computer so that's one thing that I've made but you can also check I'll put my website in the comments and you can check that out as well any more questions the inspiration well maybe that's inspiration you guys doing a back oh that would be nice I would love to come back I notice says I think it'd be nice to make left over pins yes that would be great to use left over pins and I'll put a link to a Renee's work because she's got some really nice 3d printed components that literally could um okay I think I'm gonna leave it there if there were no more questions and just say thank you everyone for your comments it was really fun I was so nervous but actually it was great and it's really nice to have everyone in my kitchen and hopefully we can do this again so I'm going to log out now so thank you
