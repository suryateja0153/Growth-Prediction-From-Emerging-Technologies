 as you've built your infrastructure on poweredge servers with esxi the bedrock of the modern data center creating a responsive and dynamic fabric through vcenter is essential unlike the traditional approach of operating a network of boxes that are individually managed solution admins can now interconnect poweredge esxi r series and vsan ready nodes through zero touch fabric deployment thanks to os 10 smart fabric services enabled on networking switches from dell technologies this modern approach establishes a fabric that deploys manages optimizes and automates a network as a single entity and connects to an external network through os 10 smart fabric services turn manual touch into zero touch flip wasted time into strategic time protect against human error deploy more predictably and onboard new devices dynamically ultimately gain automation at scale and faster time to productivity another factor that sets os 10 smart fabric services for esxi apart is its single pane management through vmware vcenter enjoy 100 fully automated zero touch day two operations for vmware esxi virtual networks while onboarding esxi server interfaces through openmanage network integration or omni what used to require extensive coordination between server and network teams now has been reduced to a single individual capable of managing the entire environment without prior extensive or expert networking knowledge as end users require services through the data center network and security teams work with solution admins to define and enforce their policies through vmware vcenter while smart fabric services ensures implementation and compliance automated autonomous fabric deployment fabric expansion and life cycle management for esxi make os10 smart fabric services the way to optimize poweredge esxi servers to get on board visit us online
