 [Music] [Music] good morning it's January 31st 2020 I'm Kimberly from fat corner shop I have a ton of stuff for you guys today this livestream might go two hours hopefully it doesn't but please be patient we just have a ton of stuff so at the very end of this video I'm gonna show you and talk to you about how I start all my searching techniques and I learned those from Lisa Bonjean so it's really her technique that I'm using and I'll be answering questions and just live demoing what I do I'm it's not for everybody and we'll talk about that in but we want to start off with bluem topia so bloom topia if you don't know is our charity quilt for 2020 we're raising money for make-a-wish and with all of your help we have raised twenty thousand two hundred sixty four dollars yay and so uh we are trying to get to thirty thousand from you guys and so we just have ten thousand more to go Kevin and I are gonna give ten thousand dollars and Mark Dunn is gonna give $10,000 from motive fabrics that's gonna grant us five wishes with make-a-wish when you donate at the link in the comments um it is goes directly to make a wish and so we are kicking it off it is our first free pattern so our first release of the free pattern so on our blog everything is listed and there's papers that you can print out that look like this so if you're gonna make this have a quilt kit I'll show you the kit here is the kit and it has everything you need for the quilt top the binding it has a specialty ruler and it has triangle paper in the background and the full pattern here's the little ruler so and it also has the full pattern for the entire thing if you don't want to wait that's the only way you can get it early is to buy the kit so this is what our kit looks like it comes in this cute little box and here's our backing set and the back says 2020 but if you don't want to use the kit I'm gonna tell you the fabric requirements and I'm gonna show you some things that we have done in-house to show you what it would look like if you don't want the kids because this is all about raising money for make-a-wish and we're asking that if you're gonna do this for each pattern or each block you get five dollars you can donate once or multiple times or you can donate as little or as much as you would like anything that you do we totally appreciate so and the fabric requirements if you're not going to buy the kit you would need six yards of background 20 fat quarters and three quarter yard binding for your pieced backing that is a little bit more complicated it's one a quarter yards background two fat quarters two fat eights and then five and a quarter yards for all the big piece and that's if you want to do a specialty piece backing this is all on our blog the jolly jabber and this morning we released block one and block two so over and under is our first block and release one and our block two and release one is bright future so you're gonna make make each of these blocks twice no once so you make two blocks so I'm going to show you what the blocks look like and all of this information is on our blog so these are the blocks that Chelsea made Sheree and Chelsea are the designers of this fabric which is summer sweet so this is the first block that is over and under and this is what you would make if you have the kit and this is the second block so this is what it would look like if you're making it with the kit and now I'm going to show you some different variations if you want to use fabric from your stash Teresa made this from harvest Road which is the collection by Leila boutique and I'm just gonna show you the two blocks and her piecing is perfect look at that I know this one is by Nancy and this is flower garden by Lindsey McCray this is stiletto and Deborah made this one and the designer is basic right this one is memoirs by three sisters and Sue made this block and so you can see that with all of this you can come up with a totally different look this one is speckled fabric and she used an Essex background and Krystal is making this one so there are our blocks so that that can help you really think outside the box if you want to do modern or traditional or contemporary or whatever obviously we have kits to make it easy for you but you can download the list of fabric requirements and use whatever make sure to use our hashtag which is on the screen and I'm gonna show you I'm gonna answer questions on that before I show you some other free stuff that we have do you have questions Lily oh sorry there's no question it's using the over-and-under block from release one this fabric is caning day joseline designed it and SU made it and Mike from my long arm quilter quilted it so super pretty right you can see that in any collection okay I got to show you the back the back is amazing this is awesome you like it Lily I know I like it I might have to do one like this I haven't done one like this before so I really like that so that's a totally free pattern and then our second finishing pattern all it uses the Bright Futures variation block a completely free pattern that you can get on the blog so all of your information on fabric requirements everything is listed and here it is this one is smaller this is our finishing pattern too at Jocelin designed it nova stitched it and mike from my long arm quilter quilted it it uses the earlybird block the star accent fabric is strawberry jam and the background is garden variety so you can see that Nova's just used fabrics from her leftovers or her scraps to be able to put this together this is a great I love this one it would make a great table topper or just a little accent to your house so let me know if there's any questions on any of the bloom topia and then there is a little bit more for bloom Tobi that I'm going to talk about but biggest you know huge thank you from everyone at fat quarter shop Kevin and I $20,000 I mean every time I'm a little OCD about clicking on that link okay how much have we raised how much have we raised because if I say I want to raise thirty thousand I really want to do it and we do have a pop-up that we can use that's gonna show you our different goals and so these are our goals and so you can see that we had a goal at 8,000 and that was our finishing one the free pattern and then we had the goal of 15,000 so we released that today and then we have two more so when we get to 22,000 there'll be another free pattern and when we get to 30,000 there'll be another free pattern so there's even more to look forward to so if you you know if you don't have time to make the really big quilt which is our quilt kit you could all obviously you know maybe use one of the smaller ones and donate five dollars for one of the smaller ones or anything that we can do to get the donations up is really what we're doing so let me know if there's any questions on that before I go to the next one sorry all right Julie Washburn said what is the specialty ruler oh okay so the specialty ruler makes this right here so see how this little tulip is not a 45-degree angle it's more of a no it's like just not a straight angle so it's a ruler that will you make it bigger and then you trim it down but if you don't buy the kit because the only way you can get that rulers and the kids and there's a template in the pattern to do it so it makes I don't know anything about angles that maybe that's what my daughter is struggling once y'all nursery right now but um it just is like a angle that you can't make automatically in quilting a night that probably makes more sense all right Tracy Eckert was asking when I bought the kit does that money go to make a wish so basically the way that Kevin and I do it is we just say we're gonna write a check for $10,000 because of profits of the kit if that makes sense because there is a cost of buying the inventory I mean it's all very complicated sorry all right and then next question Chen Jessica Knox was asking what fabric is the pink on the back for one of the samples that we had to show okay so the very first sample it is a belief strawberry jam denise is gonna it is canning day sorry canning day by Corey odor alright and then we have to Supercuts yeah first one from Linda Prather she just gave us $10 so thank you so much Linda thank you they're super piggy and we also had another super chat from Gabriel Fuentes for two dollars he says Thank You Kimberly for all you do thank you thank you k bro he's so cute alright and then we also have a new YouTube member Cassie Barker she just joined right before we started the stream thank you so welcome Cassie yay all right and stitch by stitch was asking can you remind me what Bella white you love to use I'd like to use color 98 or 97 or 200 the one that I use the most is 200 but I do like all three of those okay so I'm gonna pop up on the screen real quick the dates for the for the bloom topia so you can just see it and so that is going to show you like if you're going to be sewing along these are the dates and these dates are all on our blog and that will really help you if you want to stay on track so this is kind of the whole schedule and then for cross stitch which is the other image that she just had so that is just the corner of the cross stitch and so with cross stitch we are also offering a free cross stitch and so that was released this morning also and so for the cross stitch we were just saying you know if you did the cross stitch you know we thought $15 would be reasonable to donate to make a wish and so that was released this morning we um have a crosses channel which is called fat quarter shop know that quarter floss tube and you can go back on Tuesdays video and it has all the information that you would need we would love for you to subscribe to it but that was released this morning also the cross stitch so just to let you know that we're trying to that's how we're trying to get to 50,000 this year versus last year by offering more you can see that we're really doing a lot trying to offer a ton of stuff and we want to give a big thank you to Priscilla because a Priscilla from the real housewives of cross stitch finished it for us and it is right over here and you can see it tada it's so pretty so big shout out to her and um so the next thing I was gonna talk about was this week Lori Holt was here she's getting on a plane right now to go home so I'm so sad but we did a quilters cottage photo shoot so the quilt is behind me the book is coming out in May um it might come out a little bit earlier but Lilly's gonna zoom in so you can see all of the quilts um it is we had a cross stitch and then at the very bottom there's a fence and then under the fence or three quilt blocks and this is what it was based on so this is one of Lori Holt's first cross stitch pattern she published it's just it's we have this available now and it's called quilters cottage and we got so many emails and so many phone calls and so many livestream comments that they wanted this in a quilt so she put it together in a quilt with the vintage happy collection and so it's hanging on the wall we went to Fredericksburg and did a little photo shoot I'm in the book our instructions to make the quilt go cross stitch is totally separate but also to make the table runner which is right here so this is the table runner and the pillows that you see right here also so those instructions are all part of the book and so that is brand new and we've got some photos from the photoshoot and that we can show you just to show you like some of the photoshoot so this is the cover of the book and so there you can really see those quote blocks that are at the bottom of the quilt I'm sorry and then this is I think this is the first photo that we did so this is the table runner and the house that we voted in was really perfect and this is this is so funny there was like a vintage phone and every one of us I think picked it up to see if we could really dial but if we look there's no cords so I was kind of like yeah that would have been smart if I would have seen if there was cords so it's kind of making fun of myself in my head who would you have dialed if it worked I don't know I don't know buddy I was like what a bull I think joseline dialed zero I was like where does zero go even cuz like when I was the kid zero went somewhere but now I don't think zero goes anywhere it was like operating and then this was um it was the built-in desk oh no it wasn't a built-in desk it was like a built-in nook in the wall and then the desk fit perfectly so and we decorated we're sending that sewing machine home with Laurie today so she's got like five or six of those and then there's the cross dish which is available now and that's just like a little shot of the bed and just cute little photo yeah so these are just photos okay oh wait okay so there's Lily there's Lily she's videoing her so inor messing with the machine or something mm-hmm and oh there's Lorri so there's Lauri and the left and that was everybody trying to figure out how to get the get the quilt on the wall and we put it up with contact what are those things do you did we we traced commands hooks yeah command hooks and then it fell down so then what do we do we ended up having Jocelyn and Cary there on the sides hold it up for the photo so that's mr. honey in the top-left sister honey yeah so that was quite the adventure yeah okay yeah so let me know if y'all have any questions of course that is the quilters cottage book it comes out in May it might come out earlier because we got the photo shoot done already in January um if you have any questions on that book gets all Lori Holt designs yes okay Linda Gillespie was asking the book has several patterns so it has the pattern for the quilt kit which is a sari the quilt the quilt the big quilt which is behind me it has the pattern for the table runner right here the flower and then three pillows one two three and then the cross stitch which is right here is totally separate and it'll be like we'll have a picture of the cross stitch in the intro just to talk about you know how Laurie designed that and how you know it morphed into a quilt iris Rivera's asking is that all piecing or there's applique to all piecing so Laurie does a lot of free applicators that she does with Riley Blue in conjunction with Riley Blake all of the books that Laurie and I do together under the it's so Emma brand are all piece so that's how she kind of keeps it separate Karen Anderson is asking what size will laurie holds pillows B these are 24 inches and she put 26 inch pillows inside them all right and then Terry oh sorry go ahead we're gonna we're gonna confirm him I might be a little bit off on that but I'm close I'm within the 20s and then Teresa says whoever does your septic or eating is really good yay Cody right yes I think she might have also been saying at the photo shoot Oh at the photo shoot okay so at the photo shoot Lori did that and Sara and Jocelyn and me and Lily just stand around and like what do we do next yeah well I'm not good at styling I'm not speaking for Lily I'm speaking for myself and like I don't know what to do yeah they're a lot better at it so I just stand back and I'm like just tell me what you need you didn't tell me what to do yeah it works out really well I was trying to take a nap though I was so tired that day if you want to picture what my picture hey YouTube members um got got to see some other behind the scenes pictures of the horses actually ordering Kevin lunch okay so these are 24 inch pillows and we put 26 inch pillows inside so that they're puffier that's how Lori likes to do it of course you could put a 24 inch pillow form inside let's see we have a super chat from Susie Clary for $24.99 thank you thank you Susie and we also have a new YouTube member Ashley mass welcome Ashley thank you oh I like your super figure to fly off the screen and then give you your confetti cannon yay all right and Jennifer Daniel Johnston's asking what as the Starbucks you're drinking today oh that's what I always drink it is a black unsweet I see extra ice no water so um there's up some other new Laurie items coming that we have the first one is baked with love which is right here so um I'm not gonna take it off the ladder we're just gonna zoom in this is a pre like a kit that's put together in a little box from Riley Blake and it is using vintage happy fabric and it's little ovens and that should be coming um in the next month and then the other one is right here it's called good morning mugs table runner and it also comes in a cute little box and those are coming soon they're just packaging them right and those also use Fanta chappie which is the collection that is in the quilters cottage book so there's that and we got those for photography so I thought we should show those since we're borrowing them and we're gonna send them back so by the time the kids come in the quotes will not be here so I thought I would show them ahead of time they're on our coming soon page and you can click to be notified when it arrives are there any questions we have a new YouTube member Virginia Matthews welcome Virginia thank you yes like I said there's just a few extra behind the scenes pictures there for members this week as the perk we had a lot of fun at the photo shoot okay so up motor Blockheads is a new three so along that Moda is hosting this year it's gonna run through February of 2021 they're gonna be giving you 56 free patterns there's going to be a six inch and 12 inch and then some of them are gonna have different sizes and I decided to go ahead and start mine it's completely free and all the information would be on the motive Moda blog and it links to the different designers and that's where you will get the pattern so you can refer there and I am going to there's a lot of free finishing patterns available on that blog but I'm gonna use Laurie's farm girl vintage to finishing which is right here so I'm going to be using this finishing with the motor block heads so I'm gonna show you and I'm gonna be doing it row by row so these are my first three blocks so block 1 block 2 block 3 so I'm just going to be making the harder blocks in the 12 inch size and the easier blocks and the 6 inch size and one thing that I'm doing I'm gonna give you a little tip you don't have to do it if you read her book it's gonna tell you what to cut to add the Sacheen I cut my strips bigger and I'm trimming my blocks down with the creative grid seven and a half inch square ruler CGR 7 and the CG RSQ 14 and this is the 14 and a half inch ruler so I am just adding my Fasching much larger trimming down and that's how it looks so perfect because I didn't make it perfect I trimmed it to be perfect and that does I know you're gonna email me and tell me that ways fabric I'm sorry I know it does but I would rather have perfect quote then then I'm extra fabric so let me look and see if I have some notes in here and in my little quilt quilting journal I'm just keeping track of how many blocks I've made that are six inch how many I'm making they're twelve inch I am using 44 - 1 6 - 11 for the sashing for my 12 inch blocks 55 195 - 19 for the sashing for my 6 inch blocks I am going to be making 20 12 inch blocks and 36 inch blocks I'm using mostly mechanic island from Innokin Simpson and then just a ton of scraps or just you know stuff in my stash that I have I just went through and pulled all my creams so that I have a lot of creams and this is gonna be really fun and then what I will be doing any applique block that comes through or maybe a block that just doesn't fit my style I'm going to be using blocks from vintage Chris vintage Christmas spelling bee farm grow vintage one and farm girl vintage 2 and I'm just gonna pick traditional blocks or blocks that I like so that it can be really a Kimberley quilt and I don't have to feel like I have to applique if I don't want applique and I don't I'm also using the cream mode of mix fat quarter bundle that we sell and we put that together just for this quilt and we have some shout outs of people that are stitching on the motor block it so we'll show those so you can see kind of what other people are doing this one's really cute this is Amy Milan Milan yeah and she is using little snippets by Bonnie Gmail which is an older line and that's great that's the way to use the older fabric you don't have to buy anything new you can just use what's in your stash already and this is Nancy Rogers and I love hers I'm not fabric I'm not sure exactly what fabric this is but I think it's Mota and I like the little fussy cut leaf in the center and then Jill in ketteridge anyone following motovlog has three here's my week one block my plan is to use scraps from projects throughout the year and I'll use six inch and 12 inch and I'll have a quilt representing all the projects I completed in the year so that's a great idea and this is Susan Caston gwai and so you can see that she printed out her pattern and she put it on the Lori Holt books and that we have a couple left of and then that way she can cut and then peace with the books and standing up and Sandra Jacob this is block three and she said she had a bit of a struggle with fabric selection and she loves that Queen Anne's lace so I think Queen Anne's lace is the fabric collection or the design and then Mary and Levinson Lambert here's the first two blocks of Mott Blockheads looking forward to every Wednesday and I think she's using Holly Taylor fabric from Mota yay so um I love that everybody is doing that but it's a great way to you know get a free pattern feel like you don't have to buy anything and have something to look forward to they released the patterns every Wednesday so and I've seen a lot of the blocks they're super cool they do have some questions deirdre power Powell asking about the extra Aloha hole quotes we had on set is asking if those are reservable they are you just get a notification when they come in stock we're not reserving on more pre-selling in but we have a ton on order so I don't think we're gonna sell out we might sell in without within the first two weeks but not the first day I say that now but I mean I we ordered a lot of them all right Laurie Santa Maura says what size triangle paper was used please about your Mona blockheads oh I used a bunch so this one I used one and a half inch finished right here for this one this one I didn't this one I didn't use any and this one I can't remember but I did use triangle paper for this one I think it's one-inch here I can look for every 1/2 inch finished so these are the same so I used 1 and 1/2 inch finished so far but I'm gonna be using any time there is a half square triangle I always use triangles on a roll and then I just figure out in my head how to figure out what I need for that but I do think making the blocks and one of the things that I hear over and over is oh you know I made my blog it's I'm supposed to be 6 and a half but it's 6 and a quarter that's why I make my session bigger and trim it down um if you're somebody who doesn't like to waste fabric don't do it but what I did is I'm just making big strips and then just cutting I'm not even cutting it down into the rectangle I'm just cutting big strips adding them chopping them off it saves time and then trimming down and that's how my blocks are looking so perfect and also starching which I'm going to talk about at the very end alright and stitch by stitch was asking if a pattern is only available in PDF form on your website can I call customer service and have them mail me a printed copy I don't have a printer I don't know I mean that would be really hard cuz then we would have to for everybody who called so I don't think we could do that yeah but I mean you could definitely like save it go to Kinko's yeah if you don't like just open your laptop and just put your like you know put it on your screen and then just so from your screen yeah that's what I do a few people are suggesting staples as well and Office Depot that's places you can go print places a print Thanks you cannot print places I think okay so I just wanted to remind you guys that we are doing the FQs so down it is from February 1st to March 31st all of that information is on the Jolly jabber blog and I just wanted to remind you all the information is on there but we are gonna start with a Nara fill thread so either like a spool or a cone so you just take our fill and then you can have a before and after photo and you're gonna stitch with whatever you start with from February 1st to March 31st and kind of see like can you use a full spool or a full cone by then but we do have a coupon and that's what I was going to remind you of the coupon is 1/5 SE w do w in 15 so down all the informations on our blog and today is the very last day to use that coupon for 15 percent off any aurifil thread and then we have some people that are going to join us with that so I'm just going to show you some cute little pop-ups of people that are sewing along with us yeah wrong one give me one sec okay evil olive quilts okay so she's gonna use Article 67 27 yay and then Pat bro is using let's see if we can figure out what color that is no I can't figure it out let's see uh-oh 2020 color 2020 no that's so damn tough so soda that's what I was gonna say too and I was like we know that's the year yeah I don't know what Coach is using but it's a good one yeah I feel like it's 2021 maybe yeah I bet you're right and then aunt MOA she's gonna be using Color 2024 yay yay okay so I wanted to show last year we did a free pattern that uses the H 100 triangles on a row it is a free pattern on our blog called patchwork pinwheels and it's all finished and what I did was I used leftovers throughout 2019 and put them into a quilt so that I didn't have as much leftover super cute and it was quilted by Gina tell of thread graffiti and here's the back on the back I used this print from Laurie holt it is the home Dec print and we are currently out of stock but more will come in stock in march/april it just sold really fast and so that's super I'm super excited that Gina quilted it and super excited that I'm done with it so again completely free pattern on our blog and that was what I did last year and you can see that from that quilt there was a ton of pieces and so it ended up being a little bit of a chore to use up all those pieces because it was taking me forever to make those tiny pieces so I decided for 2020 to do something much easier so that I wouldn't be spending so much time on the after so these are the blocks that have done so far I'm just gonna show you some I'm using the log cabin paper six inch it's back in stock it's by its so Emma and that quarter shop but this is so this is some Mac and Mac Island that is gonna be left over from what I just showed you which is the motor block heads and we do know that it is pronounced Mackinac for those of you sorry I'm good yes sorry and this is early bird and this is leftover from a quilt that I'm about to show you that's next it's early bird what at home oh sorry it's called at home but it's Bonnie Camille that's leftover from the quilt that I have below and then this is leftover from holly berry which I used on the quilt for Cori odors next book called a berry odor Kaveri and what I have found useful is using the add 1/4 ruler and the seam quick scene press and I did a video with Lori's that will come out in a couple of weeks I'm showing how I use it but this really helps with the sewing them and I'm using color mm that I always use with arthel so I kind of keep it in this little box and it goes in my drawer and then I just pull it out as I need it and then you can see that I've got like this pad already pulled up you know what I mean like it's all ready to go so let me know if y'all have any questions on that it's been a lot of fun because those are a lot easier to do than last year's I think I cut off a little bit more than I could chew last year I was like oh my goodness what a bad idea Sharon burka Meyer says how many pinwheels were on that quilt you know yeah I do we're gonna get the pattern but yeah it's on the pattern okay and then just comment from Deidre Powell she says shout out to y'all for the ultimate beginner cold series I can't thank you enough taught me a lot and really gained confidence Thank You Deidre so the pinwheel there's 440 pinwheels and 1760 houseware triangles that's too many for a leftover quote so yeah and it's that completely free pattern okay so coming up we have the charming baby book by Melissa Cory it is coming out in a month or two and we're gonna have a sew along so I'm on the pop-up we can show the sew along dates before I show the quilt so you can see kind of what we're going to be doing that's the cover of the book and then this is gonna be we've already got this on our blog so if you need any of this just go to our blog but we're starting on April 7th and it's got all your fabric requirements and anything you would need to know we have put online and now I'm going to show you the quote so I'll just kind of rotate it this is using the at-home collection by body and Camille and you can see that those were some of the log cabin blocks were leftover fabrics from this super super cute and big shout out to Jeana tell of thread graffiti she quilted this one for me and it came back oops last week super fun super big quilt and on the back there is a we have instructions for a piece baggy and this is how the pieced back he looks and I put in a label from the Sweetwater label company in there and I just kind of fit it in and it just has my name it doesn't have the ear or anything so that's just totally optional so that is that so let me know if y'all have any questions on that I know I've shown that before but I thought it was really cool that it's back and I'm gonna take it home it's so cute I think it's the first cool to have ever made that's red and green any Shaw is asking whereas Schuyler oh we didn't have as many quilts so he didn't come today sorry he's downstairs working yeah he's probably sad he misses me no I don't know he might even be off today I don't know I do it earlier is he here yet yeah sorry no I don't know I think is I don't know I just show up a new video it's a show that's funny Marilyn want to think of anything else cuz it gets in your head like before you know what I mean like I don't know Marilyn Monroe says well there'd be courthouse step paper like log cabin yes and then I think we had some shoutouts for a log cabin as well if we wanted to go back to those yay oh that's cute so she used different fabrics throughout I really like that one that's urban quilts that's like a mix of modern and contemporary I like that and then see Kelly quilts that's super cute and so you can see that when I did mine I kind of use the same fabrics and everyone here is using different and so that looks really good and then KS curse - that's cute I think that's all sweet water and then Susan Caston way that's cute and then she's got a little frame that holds the papers I need that let me get me one of those and then Michelle rile low that is Sugarcreek super cute Oh pink ervil Jody Van Dyne Griffin super cute look at the old lucky pen holder we were at a antique store yesterday and Laurie bought something that she's gonna make into a pin holder because I was like what is that she's like I'm gonna turn into pinkish and I was like Oh cute cuz I wouldn't ever thought of that and then Kim West oh my gosh she's got a lot done 24 blocks yay and then Angela minge Ballinger and Amy Comiskey so I'm so excited okay and see hers looks more like a courthouse set because she's not using the light and dark she's just using random so that's a way that you can make it look totally different and then Anna Keys super cute and she's doing 12-inch so that's cool and I believe we have a few questions Kathy Crocker says what size triangles on a roll for the pinwheel quilt one inch H 100 and then Ann Marie mckowski was asking is there a hashtag to use for the log cabin blocks there is let me find it real quick no there it is yay 20/20 log cabin cold all right funny comment from Jennifer Danielle Johnson she says when he held up the the baby coil she said perfect size for all the grown-up babies in our lives I know really and that's the that's what we wanted to do with the baby quill is because sometimes people don't want to buy like a baby book because you know you might not have a grandbaby or a kid like all my kids are older so I really like that we did this so long because they come and give you a reason to buy the book because then you can do more with the book than just and when I was categorized in my books yesterday I was kind of doing like a baby section uh you know what I mean like modern anyway I was organizing my books and there's really not a lot of good baby books out there so I was kind of like good and then a few people have been wondering what the pillow on your left is so I'm gonna do that next okay or at it soon I'll just do that now since you asked okay so pillow talk um is the new book that we published for a digit are it's super fun it has 25 pillows in it and we've been doing a pillow fight on our blog which just been a lot of fun so you can visit our blog and each week it's like um it's like a basketball bracket that's the only way I can think of it I'm it's like you vote and then each week you vote and then you advance and then at the end there's gonna be a winner so these are the pillows for this week and you can still vote so this first one is by Melissa Corey who is the author of fat quarter baby not that quarter baby charming baby and this is the chevron pattern and she just used low-volume prints so cute I really like it and so see you can see like the effect she did of all the colors and then this book I can tell this is tilde fabric sherry Falls of this in that pattern company this is the Mother's Day pillow and she used the old rose collection by Tilda so you can vote to see which one you like better and see who advances I like all of them they've all been really original and then on this one let me see what kind of application she just she just used fusible fused it down and didn't put any stitching on it because that's what a lot of people are saying on like Facebook and my facebook group can really stitch quad a lot of people are saying they're just using a fusible sticking it down and then like Gina tell was talking about it and just not quilt not doing stitching on it because it is just a pillow and you know a lot of times you switch out your pillows and you're not like sleeping it's more decoration you don't like need it to hold it forever like a quill would which is really good and I think it's like really I think Gina really encouraged other people to do that and not be so scared of applique okay Shelly Stuart's asking where do we go vote on the blog so go to the Jolly Trevor and it's one of the most recent posts you can even search pillow fight and then you can see like all the other or pillow talk you can see the previous pillows that one I lost you didn't vote for me yeah what use you versus it's right okay show the backs please so this is Cheri's and below back and same thing here below back and it's funny because they look the same oh that's a wholly random but yeah they're not the same but they look the same they're one's a little bit lighter that's crazy that they both use the same back name alright Jamie M was asking is there a chart of how many a log-cabin paper blocks equal various size quilts no that's a good idea we can do that for the blog that would be a good blog post mm-hmm and we have six inch size and twelve inch and we could use it like as a guide we could yeah we could do a little blog post on it I mean we can't do it within a week but I bet within two or three weeks we can put a blog and then I am going to what I'll do and around June when I have enough blocks that's when I had enough blocks last year to design is I kind of laid them on the floor and I'll come up with some kind of design that's not just you know not just four by five I'll do something a little bit more creative and then that will be a free pattern just like patchwork pinwheels was but that'll be later in the year as I see kind of how my colors come together that kind of thing I have to kind of see how it's looking and then we just got a super chat from Susan McAllen for five dollars Thank You Susan I love watching is a little Cape flop what's my favorite part he's so cute he didn't want to go to uh he didn't want to get up this morning and so I was like piggy come on we gotta go to take care cuz I talked to him like he's five and he would not move and I had to like pick him up and had a carry him in daycare I was like he doesn't really want to be here today but he was still asleep he was so good in the car he didn't get in my lap he was so good he was so tired I don't know why he was so tired sleeping boy lots of people said that they voted for your pillow Kimber oh it's just so you know I'm good so a farm girl vintage we're still stitching along with that that is of course Lori's look farm girl vintage too and the blocks for this week the first one is the maple leaf block Teresa Williams make both of these this is week 27 and the milk cow block which is week 28 and for the eyes she did can you zoom in Lily she did um I think it's really cool how she did it she they're really fat French knots like really fat and then the button see the little buttons so she used some Oh Laurie's cute little buttons to put the little nostrils so that's cute so I think we have some pop ups of things that you guys have sown which is really cool sorry we're kind of moving everything off cuz we're gonna move stuff on in a little bit so this is the stay-at-home quilter I really like that name and so those are last week's blog super cute and then said with love that is cute that is older sweet water fabric Wow that's a good pulling from your stash cuz I like both I like that and this is eager Ferraro every time I see her name I think it's like a fancy car I think of like I don't know something like ever re yeah are like there's another car that's like some funky name it reminds me of Ferrero Rocher like that that's what it what does that mean okay whatever I thought it says that we have the photo shoot oh okay I didn't eat it and then genus will super cute that's Bonnie female fabric and look Valerie and stitches oh my gosh that looks so good looks so good and then when diem Darlene super cute I like the what are those called yard sticks Oh how do you see yeah that's really cool yeah yeah and then Grammys girls and more Oh cute little bees and then Patsy wheeler super cute hummingbird thread so it's fun how to see like how everybody's blogs how people are keeping up how their blocks are all coming together and then we're back to brown one okay Teresa said I wish I could so as well as Teresa a fat quarter shop - yay that's funny because they have the same name oh and then a few people were wondering since the one of the blocks had the button sewn on and already is it a good idea to sew the buttons on now or wait after quilting it depends on your quilter most people do the buttons at the end like if it was me because I use I use when I use Gina tell to do my quilts or Mike from Mike I put the buttons on after but you if you're gonna have somebody do the knot pantographs but like free motion then you can put it on before it's really up to your long arm quilter to be honest mm-hmm and what they're comfortable with that kind of thing and if you're home you know if you're quilting at home what you prefer mm-hmm it's a total preference and I'm probably one of those like people that like at the end forget to put the buttons on so alright and we do have another new YouTube member Christine Martinez welcome Christine yeah okay so we have just a couple more things to show you before I show you my star chain so this is a brand new bag that came and stock and Laurie brought me one so I thought I'd show you it's like it's

so let me know if you guys have any questions on anything because we are going to be at or I'm going to be talking about starching in a few minutes so will we're gonna kind of move everything and then but I'm gonna answer questions yes we're gonna have a special starching segment coming up here um first off Linda Prather isn't asking how do you send a picture to get it on shout out sorry we're moving a table right now that's what squeakin did your picture what you do is you can just post it on Instagram or on Facebook on Kimberly stitch squad some people emailed them to me and we obviously can't show everybody's we wish we could but yeah we just kind of pick stuff that we think is fun and we don't want to leave anybody out or anything so yeah just post it you can even say I want to be featured on the live stream yeah yeah um and then yes so hashtags Kim released his squad make sure you join those too Marsha Baker it just reminded everyone to make sure to hit the like comes up button it's right below the video there's like a thumbs up thumbs down if you like what you're watching hit the thumbs up also helps us out a lot helps us reach new quilters yeah and Amy Young had been asking how did Emma do at her dance competition oh not so good I thought she did great but uh her critiques were not and she was like my cookies were horrible and I was like it's just a dance like it's fine but yeah and we're going to another one this weekend so we're gonna be in Bastrop and Christopher is going with us and so and tomorrow is my 17th win in an anniversary so Kevin's gonna come congratulations I know Lilly you know though I'm getting kind of getting old yeah so I'm hopefully he can come it's really close to home but it's a hip hop convention so I told her I said I'm not gonna watch because it's just too loud it's just too much it's overpowering um but it's gonna be a lot of fun and it's good because it doesn't start to 8:45 tomorrow so I can sleep that a little bit which is always nice but she does have a class tonight from 8:00 to 9:00 and then I'm in charge of a pizza party at 9 o'clock tonight which is my bedtime so we're gonna see how that goes because um I'll probably be have sleep okay Theresa is asking would you consider kidding any of the quilts from the kkona calendar I ordered all the fabric for the January quilt and was wishing there was an easy way to buy it all so if you just call Elda and say I'm looking at this one you know she would obviously have to write down your name and your credit card number and your address and then she could pull the calendar and she could find it on the rock if it's a Robert Kaufman free pattern she can find it you know give her time she can download it and then she can just figure out what SKUs and then just put together a kit for you on the one you want we couldn't get all of them but I'm sure we could do a custom kit for you so a question here that's a great segue Claudia Olivieri oh great last name says good morning when you can please ask Kimberly if she starts as her backing fabric and how does she deal with all that fabric okay so on backing you're supposed to starch it because you start to the front half of the time well 20% of the time I search the back 80% I don't because I don't have time and I never really wash my quilts so it's fine with me but um you should and to do something that big you just starch it and just I'll kind of talk about it when I do it but I put it over a like if you're backing say you it's four yards but you're gonna do a two yard cut and a two yard cut and stitch it together I would cut it starts the two yards let it dry starch the next one let it dry and just drape it over something really big like a thin Southside or you know something where it could really dry all right and I do need to switch my battery real quick so what we're gonna do is we're gonna cut to our loading screen and then we'll be right back okay [Music] okay so I'm going to kind of show you what I do first I want to credit Lisa Bonjean she's the one that taught me we have a link to the video that she taught it to me like five or six years ago it's amazing this is what I do first you should not pre you should not starch pre-cuts because they will shrink so I wouldn't if I was working on a pre-cut when I say pre-cut I mean layer cake charm pack or jelly roll because they're gonna shrink now if your pattern will work with that shrinkage that's okay everything is going to shrink about half an inch it's gonna shrink in one direction not both directions so you just decide what works for you you should starch the back and the binding if you start to the front I don't always do that but really when you're quilting or sewing or crafting do whatever you want to do like and don't feel like you have to do this if you don't want to starch don't starch I'm just showing you what I do but you don't have to this is just I really want my blocks to be perfect so the first thing that I do is in my drawers at home like my drawers like my what do you call them sure yeah so I got these boxes like two years ago or a year ago at Target they're just square boxes and they happen to fit my drawers and what I do is in the back of the drawer I have my unsearched fabric and in the front of the drawer I have my starch so this is the fabric this is vintage happy too which is also in the quilt behind me and I am using this on the Cheri McConnell 2023 block the month so I've used these fabrics because I've searched them so I don't starch I like just I do like to starch everything at the beginning of her project that I've been so busy I haven't been able to so I'm going to show you how I start and then what I do after it starch is it goes in the starch bucket so that if I'm gonna use these and the remaining blocks but I always keep my start and my and searched separate that's just something that I do I mean you can feel it and tell but it's what I do so I'm gonna take I'm gonna take this half yard and to starch I'll show you how I starch so I will leave it together okay I have a Amazon link to what I use it is really hard to find where I live and it is there's been a change in starch company it's not Agra original hold they also have a heavy hold or a heavy heavy whatever and it's in all the stores in Texas but I think it's too heavy so I actually have to run the Amazon link below that's where I purchase my starch because I cannot find it in stores I wish that I could because um it's really hard for me to find so anyway this is what I use and what I do is I take a ironing board and I put a scrap fabric so this could be like a leftover fabric or it could just be a Kona but I don't change it except like every six months so we just put a white here so sometimes I use like leftover backing that comes back from the quilter and we're just using white today so that it doesn't confuse you but I just use scraps whatever I have but I don't change it very often so I don't iron I just take it straight off the bolt or however and this is how I start so Lily can get kind of up close but what I do is I'm gonna try to do it really fast because I do like it to be smooth and if you start if you start and stop it kind of won't be smooth and you might get spots so I'm gonna just kind of do it and then we'll talk through it so I try to go very even and I go I just I guess you always have to watch what I do but I I go really fast and I never stop when I'm doing it because I don't want like I said if if it gets uneven you can get spots then I flip it I'm gonna do the other side and I won't iron this until it is completely dry yes it takes about eight hours to dry four to eight hours to dry I try to do this at night and then let it sit over em overnight so now it's all wet and then what I do is I have this little drying wrap and I make sure it's even and I go like this and I let it dry now a lot of you have said you know oh and then I have a rug under it so in my sewing room at home I got these rugs off of Wayfair wait there's a great place to get rugs for like 50 bucks they're just cheap rugs and that way nobody slips in the bathroom and this sits in a shower it could sit out on her it could sit on your rug and you could put towels down but I would recommend just some cheap rug or Bed Bath & Beyond you know they always have that 50% off coupon and I will just starch now it's gonna shrink but I'm gonna have crisp results and again Lisa Bonjean is the one that taught me this I do not wash so ask me any questions you have but I do go through about 12 cans a month because I I am counted yes we have a few questions are gonna let a few more roll in just disclaimer for everyone - we are in a very well ventilated room right now yeah so make sure like when you're doing it at home and tap like the window open and stuff because you know spray cans and all that if you have corn in your starch it can cause bugs and the bugs will eat at it starch is no longer made with corn from what I've read and I'm still won't damage and for me I really want it to be perfect but when I die I don't care what happens to him I mean nobody's gonna know like when I'm dying I'm dead I'm dead so like I don't care if it did I mean I know that sounds horrible but like to me it's just not a thing that I worry about too much I can do another one I'll just do another one while I'm talking so I'm not just standing here yeah we do have a lot of questions really and I'm just yeah okay I'll do this as I go cool okay so if say you had something like the bloom topia kit would you starts out or not yep and there's if you ever buy a kit from fat quarter shop or blocks a month since a quarter shop there should always be enough fabric for that to happen yes and I did make blue topia and the quilt that I made is on a traveling Roadshow but I did starch the front and on that when I did starch the back and there's plenty of fabric and the kids Alysha Edgerton was asking why so much starch it is just what I like I like it to be 100% starched it takes on all of the shrinkage out so that when I make a block and I'm if you just make a block and you starch as you go it's gonna shrink as you go and I like my blocks it just gives me the perfect and bringing my room took my saree and see this gets wet and crunchy so the one I have at home is like super crunchy and I it just doesn't ruin this so if you look at my block right here you're gonna see it's really all the points are perfect it's super crisp you're not gonna see wrinkles it's super starch I just like my quilts to look like this and that's how Lisa Bonjean quilts look it's and she also does super super small piecing she does a lot of if you buy any of her patterns or her books she does like one inch squares and two inch squares and tiny tiny piecing and she can do that and achieve that look by doing this and this is obviously her method so I learned from the best alright okay Cathy new furrow says why did my mom used to poach her starch stuff in the fridge have no oh okay so there's a product called stay flow and a no peach and Gabriel use it on Kimberly stitch squad and they've talked about it and so if you have questions on stateflow it's much cheaper you can ask them I am Gina tell was super nice she sent me some I tried it it was just not it was number one too much work number two too much mess and for some reason I didn't like the texture of it and that's it's the same thing with the heavy it's just too much texture it's all about do you want it how you want it to feel and so I didn't love stay flow but it is a much cheaper option you can use best press that's a more expensive option I like this because I can its aerosol I know it's bad for the environment I'm sorry but there's no way I could sit here and best press I have to it wouldn't work um so this is all emits can be to me when I think about it this can be very controversial topic and quilting it can be very like risque because it's like people are very passionate about what they do and why they do it and you should do it this way whether this is just what I do people have asked I'm showing it but you do not have to do it my way I just this is the way that I get the best results and it's been a game-changer for me because I used to starch as I went well then you have to wait for it to dry and I can just starch and and this this um thingamajiggy drying rack sorry it folds up so when you see it you can get a lot on it and I also have on my bathtub now this is a room I do not use it's a spare room I don't use the bathtub so you don't have to worry about that but I use all of this and then I use um pipe I'm someone in Kimberly stitch squad gave me the idea and Kevin and Peyton made them for me a couple years ago it's like PVC pipe and then you put it on the bathtub and so I dry in the shower and in the bathtub oh she told me to sit down all right yes we have a lot of questions yes so we're gonna get through them and you know don't feel like just because I do it you have to do it or I'm not I don't know I'm not like preaching to the choir you do you do whatever you want to do all right okay oh yeah for those of you asking for the brand it is faultless and then it's Niagara that's what it says on the bottle the fault was niagra's its original original hold and I have heard some people's cost some people like different areas have it in their Costco which is I used to use a different brand that it's no longer available and I always got it at Costco and it was cheap and so I'm spending a ton of money on this starch because it's more expensive because I have to get it from Amazon and all that um but it works and all right cherry gingham was asking do you typically leave the fabric folded when spraying and drying yes if it is a backing I don't because that's just too big if it's a backing I'll just pull it all open and then just put it all over the whole thing and just let it or over the top of the shower or outside on a fence okay like when I wash my quilts which is very rare but I will wash it and then dry it I will just hang it over a fence outside because to me it's like it dries it better but you can do that with the back game just put it on a fence or put on your patio or you can starch outside if you don't want to starch inside because you can put the drying rack it's super easy to put up and down because what my in-laws come we pull all this down you know clean the shower you know make sure all the fumes are out of there all that stuff and we do also have a link to the drawing rec that we're using on voted on Amazon and somebody gave me the idea from Kimberly stitch squad I copied someone's idea all right for people using best press which you still do what you just did right now I would maybe try to go to first of all it can be really expensive but you could go to Home Depot and see if you get like one of those things you can put in the can that's used for paint and it turns it into an aerosol and you could do it that way yeah I believe that's how to of the pink does her okay start stuff she talked about that during our live stream I did go to Home Depot I will tell you a funny Home Depot source so sorry I'm really bad at like anything like paint anything I'm just poor below so I went to Home Depot the other day no I went to Lowe's and I needed to get four little light the little glass fixtures so I got them but I got one that didn't match and Kevin was like do you know that you guys like that's why I should never go to Lowe's or Home Depot for myself because I don't know what I'm doing and a lot of people are wondering when you get to pressing your starch fabric do you use steam or not I do because it's already shrunk but I let it completely dry so like like when I say completely dry I mean completely crispy and you can see when I cut I cut out of a corner you can see each of these I bet they're all at the same corner I just cut out like a corner I just cut as little as I can and then that's how I keep my fabric I don't know just kind of cut a little piece so that it's not that messy when I go back to it and with this quilt and I'm making the block six inches less to show them in the last week one of the last live streams I'm gonna use I'm gonna try to use my leftovers as like a patchwork backing because it's gonna be more of a small quilt and I think that because I started with half yards that I'll be able to get six and a half inch squares and put them all over the back that's my plan anyway do you starch pre-cuts okay so I starch layer cakes but they shrink so your pattern has to be for something that's nine and a half are smaller I start charm packs but you got to have something four and a half turn or smaller so if your pattern uses the full pre-cut you cannot starch I always starch back quarters I always starch fat aids but the truth is I always try to starch everything but if a pattern calls for it you can't because it's gonna shrink half an inch one direction so you just have to see but I also don't I never use jelly rolls that's just a secret I don't know why they're messy they get everywhere I just I you my favorite pre-cut is a layer cake but I waste a lot of fabric doing it but I am you should not pre wash a layer cake charm pack from any charm pack alright well the colors run from the starch I know but I also I mean good quality fabric from like a quilt shop should never run it should you should never see like green or red on the pipes or blue or anything like that if you do then you shouldn't use that fabric because it's bleeding okay okay is there an odor okay starch yes that's the one thing that I don't like about this fabric this is called durafresh scent technology smells like flowers I'm not a fan of the smell but I've gotten used to it and now my Sonoran just smells flowery and the old product that I used to use didn't have a smell at all and I loved it because I don't really I don't wear perfume I don't like all that like the other day we went to we went to Chile and that was like way too much cologne we were like who anyway um yeah it does have a smell that I don't love the heavy hold does not have a smell but I had to weigh do I would I rather have it so stiff that I could hardly so with it or would I rather have it where I could so with it and smell so and I do I put a um I did put a little lamp thingy that you can put the what does that called where you put the scent in it and it melts Oh SNC cincy but not that brand but you know like that kind of thing I think I got it at um apparently Cracker Barrel and then I put that in the room and I turn that on sometimes so then it smells like vanilla rather than the starch so that is the one thing that I did do because it was bothering me okay and then if you were to wash your quilt with the starch wash out yes and people have asked me before can you see the starch not on this brand sometimes if you get a brand that flakes you know you're gonna see it but it just and then it's super stiff now like my blocks are super stiff but you can see when it's quilted it all just relaxes with the batting and sinks in and Pauline Suleman was asking Oh Simon sorry what does that method of starching stop the edges from writing so much I never really noticed maybe I don't want to say yes but I don't really notice a lot of fraying and my clothes so maybe I haven't not starched and so long that I don't know how to answer I'm sorry if that makes sense I think it does a little bit keep it free yeah yeah or denisa is the effort hurt it does stitch by stitch says so if you starch use the fabric then put leftovers away for years do you then restart it no and I keep my leftovers I have a drawer for starched leftovers and unsearched leftovers everything is always separated that's why I have them in the box but so in the box I have everything in my sewing room I'm currently using and I only have so many drawers so I have to finish those drawers before I can pick something ups else up but when it's done I have a I only have two two shelves that are leftovers because I don't like to keep a lot of leftovers because I like to use it all up like with the patchwork pinwheels that kind of thing and I keep them separate and let's see how do the quilts feel once they're done totally normal totally soft I mean they're crispy when they go to the quilter when they come back they're totally fine yeah so the quilting kind of helps um make it feel normal yeah and I can tell you like um my quilters love me because my quilts are always like peace good so I know they love me because there's not a lot of waviness on the quilting machine all right a few people are wondering if I starch I'm still experimenting with that I haven't heard Kimberly's method yet because I haven't bought that much starch yet but I did accidentally by the heavy hold version of the faultless and I really like the way that smells I also really like the way the best press lavender smells yep okay a few people wondering what was the old starch and why did you switch so the old starch was just faultless and then one day when I went to a chi because I would get it at HEB in Costco it just wasn't there and I couldn't figure out why it wasn't there and on the live stream somebody said oh well Niagara bought faultless and I couldn't find it in the store so then I purchased something on Amazon and what came was the firm version and then I was like wait it's really thick and and like I said like if Lily wants to use firm great like everybody should do their own thing like don't just do what I say because if you like it do it and so I kind of Oh Niagara then they reached out to me and they sent me a bunch of different bottles to try and this is the one I like and so now the only source the only way I can is Amazon when I went to Houston the last two weekends we went to Target one of the days and I did look because it's cheaper at Target obviously and I couldn't find it in Houston either so um I just order it and I used that Amazon affiliate link and I I'm always asking him where's the link because I want to order the right one but I I go through about 12 a month at a minimum so it is expensive it adds to the cost to me it makes it go faster once I mean obviously it's a lot of work to starch but my favorite part of quilting is searching and cutting and binding not the piecing forget that I could care less about the sewing machine I mean I love my sewing machine but still like my favorite part is cutting and so when it's nice and crisp I love ironing I love all that like it would be great if I had a team where they just sewed and I just starched iron because that's my favorite part I don't know why I just love it like I just love the I think the Christmas a few people are asking no terial magic no I tried it no it what it does is it gives that it shrinks it up and makes it shriveled do not do it I tried it one time and when I tried it I tried it on like a whole collection and it runs it so yes I thought that too don't try it yeah that's more for like if you want to turn it like if you want your yeah if you want a crunchy or if you want your fabric to act like paper yeah it's used for projects that would typically use paper but you want to use your fabric for yeah and like if you use that it'll have like great grids or something and you have like stuff on it mm-hmm yeah don't do that and that would be really expensive yeah it is a lot more expensive than the other starches let's see Vicki on Facebook was asking does having the fabric starched Allah wear out your machine needles quicker no and I'm horrible about changing my needle I am I do i do do it every project but I really should do it like every like there could be days where I could sew eight hours straight so that obviously you should change it that day like you shouldn't let it go um but yes I don't think so at all and I mean needles to me needles are like you can just buy like ten pack along for super cheap yes yes but yeah um everyone's saying all the different ways that they like to start some people use flatter some people don't start it yeah Debbie Taylor who used to work for us she uses it has a different name but it's in the starch section at the store it's called oh gosh is it called but she used to use something that was different and she loved it like she swore by it I can't think of the name of it but it's similar starch but different it's it's like that what you just said a bit different so everybody kind of has their thing that they like and you should you know just try it and if you don't like it don't do it if you don't I mean everybody should just do what they want to do and I don't ever want to come on here and tell you like do this or this is the way that's not you can do whatever you want at home like that's the best thing about crafting if you start doing something because somebody else is like do this and you don't enjoy it it's gonna take all the fun out of the project so you should you know I just I've been quilting a long time I used to just start not that heavy but I would starch and iron and starch and iron that would be ironing forever and then when Lisa Bonjean came up with that method she happened to be filming like the very next month and we did a video on it and I have never gone back and I always try to credit at least like as it is her idea primitive gatherings she came up with it but it's changed my life it's awesome um and we do have a super chat from Teresa first $20 she put a little it's like a big lemon hugging a little lime it's very cute oh my and then she said gotta feed my fix keep you running thank you I love that we're so appreciative okay and we did have another you new YouTube member Susan summers welcome Susan thank you the last name summers reminds me of yeah her name's Susan or Suzanne yeah obviously it's Suzanne Somers oh well you're tight yeah well is he alright I was thinking used to do the Jazzercise her
