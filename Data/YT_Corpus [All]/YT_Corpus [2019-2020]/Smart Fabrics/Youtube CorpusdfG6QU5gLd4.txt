 Hello, I'm Emma from F&P Interiors and  today we're going to have a look at   the scheme I created for my husband's study.  I live in an 18th century farmhouse in Sussex. So I started with this lovely Christopher Farr  fabric called Ozone - it's in colour smoke. I   like the gentleness of the colours, the muted  shades as we have a lot of wood in the house,   it's nice to keep it quite light and bright. On the sofa, I've chosen is this Vence fabric by  Osborne & Little. It's a lovely tweedy fabric,   really hard wearing as the sofa is used a lot,   and a nice punchy contrast piping.  My husband loves contrast piping! I added a couple of cushions to the sofa  this is the Mulberry Hounds fabric in velvet   and obviously the dogs - we have three dogs in  our house - so it seemed rather appropriate.   I then, as I mentioned my husband  likes a nice contrast, so I added the   Varese by Designers Guild backing and piping  to pick up the colours in the cushion. We have a nice central stool in the room where  we put the magazines, cups of tea, coffee   and occasionally feet! So I've done this in this  lovely Johnson's plaid which is a nice grey,   beige and cream, and it looks very smart. We have another chair that has been in the  family for many years which was re-upholstered   in this Mavic fabric, Safari. It's a really  lovely cotton velvet, also very hard wearing   except when the rabbit comes in - he  likes to chew the piping on the chair! We're about to have the room redecorated  so I've chosen this linen-look   wallpaper from Boråstapeter. It's  very similar in colouring to the paint   that I have on the walls, but I just thought  a little bit of texture would be rather nice. And finally I've got a new chair  that's coming into the room,   and I've chosen this really lovely No.9  fabric, Kazbek, which I think will add   quite a bit more zing to the room and a  bit more fun which my husband will love.
