 we present rapid iron on a new prototyping principle for e textiles we build a tool with two wheel axles that can hold different trace and functional spools by pushing the device down a spring-loaded iron transfers adhesive functional tapes and patches onto fabrics for instance this allows to integrate traces in a sketching like fashion and supports elastic shielded and detachable connections further we present a comprehensive library of components for more details see our paper
