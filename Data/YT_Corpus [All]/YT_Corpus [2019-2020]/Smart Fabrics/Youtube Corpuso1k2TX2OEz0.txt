 [Music] have you run my name is Sara Wilson I'm a designer here at Google and one of the creators of this series design is we made this monthly talk series to really make space for those working in design creativity technology those working in that intersection to make space for really discussing topics that help craft a future that we all want to be a part of so today's talk is a really exciting one it's about curiosity which makes me excited it's really about not looking at problems that exist today but thinking about putting curiosity at the center of your practice to think expand your imagination also think about new problem spaces so our speaker leaning now is a material engineer a designer and an assistant professor at the human-computer interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon she's an adjective of mechanical engineering and material sciences and engineering she leads a team at the morphing matter lab which sounds very cool developing materials tools and applications of adaptive dynamic and intelligent morphing matter from nano to macro scales her work is increasingly relevant to the design field particularly looking at the intersection of the physical and digital world coming together so let's give it up for and my topic today is design is passionately curious so great minds are curious these are Leonardo da Vinci's sketches when he was trying to study the fluid dynamics so in particular this is this is the water flow or fluid flow in general and later on the Caltech professor I use computational approach to visualize the blood flow that was envisioned by him many many years ago and this is one of my favorite Bauhaus instructors and also one of the greatest painters in the history plea so he actually was immensely curious about how the plants grow the based on how branches are formed he designs his art piece and also he's tried to study the routing mechanism and created imagine of paintings of routing routing and this was actually a work from one of my dear inspiring friends Iran Sharon so he's a physics from the University of Hebrew so he when he does this demo he likes to basically tear off a piece of paper so it turns out if you tear off a piece of paper or if you tear maybe even just a trash bag let the like shown on the screen you will see all these wavy patterns formed on the edge and he developed basically both the mathematical and also physical models for this wavy pattern formation and eventually that explained basically how our plants and flowers and even corals grow along the edge this is due to the cell differential growth and with this with this discovery he wrote some science papers but in addition this is actually one of the craziest thing he did I really liked so he put some chemicals selectively on different areas along the edge of the leaf and after a cup of days he started to see a whip hadn't formed basically his sculpting nature if you think about it it's not through genetic modification but it's through the idea of reconstructing nature through geometric parameters so when I started to encounter this beautiful stories either in my life or in other people's life I always have those scenarios in my head these people are curious so da Vinci he used to run into the sand right after horses passed by on his Street because it you to study send and my dear friend Iran he will staring at those leaves for months and months try to be excited by the waves or you know in Newton he was excited by staring at a piece of Apple so I think these curiosities are really the driven force for the advance of art and science in the history but what is relevant to design maybe you guys want you to say design is actually practical when we talk about science and art not necessarily their function there their goal is to be functional and be helpful and useful for our daily life but design as we know one of the major missions is to be practical so maybe this is not a right statement design should not be curious design should be probably problematic and analytical but hope through my talk though I wanted to share another vision and I want to convince you guys with my vision so design is actually curious and curiosity driven design is a legit method if you want to create novel design and design applications so I started my journey of being curious almost seven or eight years ago when I was still a TV student at MIT Media Lab and then I along the way he invited all the other people to join my journey so this was a new lab I found it two years ago at Carnegie Mellon University after I graduated so now I have all these curious minds that are joining the journey to explore how a human centered design can be transformed into a curiosity driven design and in the lab with developed materials and thinking about constructing hardware and software tools for these materials and also thinking how we can leverage them for applications so this if you agree as one of those classic methodologies to think about a design that is human centered indeed I am situated in the human-computer interaction Institute a human centered design is one of the major practices a lot of the professors and students do and after I joined this HCI Institute at CMU so I try to replace basically the center and put curiosity there and you started to see the change of the surroundings as well so I wanted to share four stories that is my curiosity and my students curiosity in error in nature context and processes so let's start with the first story curiosity in error for makers who are sitting here who had experience playing with this low cost a few statistician printing platform like MakerBot basically you know when you 3d print those artifacts they are very easily to warp and they are not going to be kept flat that's why you know there are more expensive printers try to put things into an oven and try to keep the temperature consistent but we were thinking we observe this phenomenon and we have two questions one is why why is things warped for those cheaper 3d printer and second question is can we try to take this this advantage and try to store it and we try to make this disadvantage into an advantage so this is what we figured by the way I am NOT a polymer chemist I I had to go into it by reading high school textbooks again but that was because I'm curious so here is what is actually happening so when you for polymer basically the polymer chains like to stay in this chaotic state basically like a random spaghetti so when you try to 3d print those thermoplastic polymer on a printing platform basically you are forcing the polymer chain to go straight you are you are you are melting it down and use your your your your speeding up as you are extruding it right but the preferred state is this chaotic state so it has a tendency to go back to be more chaotic once it's printed when you heat it up this is what happens basically the polymer chain try to contract and you will see a bending effect and that is undesired it's the wattage defects of your 3d printer and but then we went ahead and tried to engineer this webpage and actually we tried to create even larger rabbit this was started when I was a artist in residency in pier 9 at Autodesk so we can control how much it works or in other word how much it'll Bend with our material configuration as well now you can print things flats super fast and very reliably and then trigger it to cell fold back into a 3d shape so for example this rose flower was printed as a flat disc and in consequence consequently turned into this self-assembled rose when you put it in hot water and this is the process so this was when this flat disc is printed and this ring when you dip it in hot water as I mentioned it was self assemble into a 3d rose and we were able to come with Headingley simulate how the folding will happen or what shape is a fold into as well and for again for people who had experiences little bit of experience with 3d printing you know in order to print this rose you know when to one scale you may need to take about eight eight hours because there are a lot of supporting material consumptions actually ends up really a material consuming and also the removing the support is going to be a big headache but with our method you can take only one hour and without any post post processing effort to get this rose and you can do more things in addition to Rose you can sell fold a boat a chair and even an arbitrary shape like a bunny and among all those my favorite is this chair so for example you can make any flat disc self-assembly into a shape that's actually functional we were envisioning this could be used for IKEA furniture so I here make all the furnitures flat because they save there a lot of the logistic cost but once it's at your home you have to manually assemble it and you know slightly more complicated more expensive IKEA furniture actually take forever to assemble what if you can flap this ship a furniture back home and then by just apply some hot hot air with your hairdryer to get shape assemble there if you want you're just putting in your bath so we that one was a very very small model we didn't this would this is actually a one-to-one scale chair services we were able to morph from a flat shape remember you guys my lab is called more female her lab so I will keep using this where it's more in addition to curiosity so on the left hand it is the 3d sorry it's the 2d shape so the color actor actually represents how much each pin within this grid would shrink so when you dip this in water it will contract and Packo up into 3d and eventually form the chair services on the right hand and we are envisioning basically a sustainable manufacturing pipeline that's empowered by a term called 4d printing but the idea is that when you are printing it you are saving printing time and the material and then you save shipping cost and once it's on site it can self-assemble to save yourself assembly effort and eventually this this shape that's 3d can be flattened into 2d when you need to for example move to a new house you can flatten your chair again it's reusable in that sense and if you decided you completely don't like it anymore you can recycle the material completely because PLA which is the material we use for this for this project is made of cornstarch that's like a known fact right for a lot of MakerBot hobbyist so I continue with my second story so how the curiosity in nature can also lead us to interesting inventions or interesting design so I grew up in Inner Mongolia so this is some of the common pine trees I would I would see when I was a child I used to go out to pick up mushrooms after rain and another thing that I will pick up alone along the way is the prank home so maybe you notice it before so after the the scales of the pinecones are often closed and when you put it on the balcony for a couple of days or the scales will open up as a kid that used to play this game so I'll put it back in your water again and after a couple hours you will say get close again if you think about it this is a super intelligent smart material the transformation is empowered by water intake there's no electricity but this material is responsive smartly to the environmental condition and it is a reversible process yes we are talking about a nature engineered smart material here and this is basically a speed up version of how the pine cone can open and close and after I joined my graduate school I got my memory back of how I play with pinecones because I started to study smart materials I started to read science papers and realized pinecone worth a science publication and there are many many plants and each of them almost is another science paper and they had all very different and interesting transformation behaviors and they are all electricity free and powered by nature so this case for example is a seed pod it all the the leaves will form this basically helical helical structure to shoots out the seeds once the seeds are the be the bean once the beans are matured so this is another really magical plants actually my lab or czar studying this very intensively so it's a seed in the desert when the rain comes so the seed will basically form a coil in motion and drill itself into the ground so the seed is so smart that it can recognize when is the best timing for itself to be seeded and it is purely based on a transformation mechanism of a coil and this is another flytrap plants basically cause a very rapid back cooling behavior to capture flies it's actually eats meat basically and in morphing matter lightweight study all these kind of morphing mechanism from nature if you ask me why what problem we are trying to solve we are not trying to put solve any problems we were just you know curious and we want you to study the science of it and how nature is constructing them and the smallest unit of a morphing matter so far that's responsive to moisture water in general is this is this bacteria we have been studying this since the days when I was a PhD student at MIT so this was a special bacteria called bacillus subtilis Madho bacteria the reason we chose natto because it was after it was discovered in Japan it was considered a food so it's completely safe for designers it's easy to play with and easy to imagine where this can be used and it has a very interesting story so Japanese actually found this when they were when the samurai was on their on their trip to a battle so the figure the soil being carried by this dry rice stock made bag tasted much better and later on they figured it was the bacteria inside the dry rice talked fermented soybean and since then this has been a breakfast in Japan so if you you go to Tokyo you ask for metal this is what you get and and we actually ended up putting this soil being under microscope you will see actually billions of bacteria covering the the soybean and this is the natto bacteria we are studying and a although we are using this novel function out of this Asian bacteria is its actuation function and if you place this bacteria on a thin film and try to trigger it by breathing on it you actually will see the bacteria as well and that will pull the substrate app to form a bending motion so if you try to deposit this bacteria in and order you can get different origami structure that can be responsive to to moisture environment so here we were steaming on on top of these films we printed and it's super sensitive to the skin so this was happened by accident remember my same today it's a invention driven by curiosity so we didn't know this thing can be used for wearables we ended up making up variables because it's super sensitive to the skin and we consulted new Balance folks and then they give us this heat map told us where is the most sweaty apart on your body and we ended up following their heat map and developed this garment and you have all the flaps on the back of the garment and when the body is cool basically all the flesh flaps will be closed and when the your body gets wet ears the flaps will open up this sounds familiar because it's basically how the pinecone works and it's powered in this case the transformation is powered by by our sweat mmm so another interesting part of this is it was a curiosity of our team as creators who initially did this project but it ended up that the curiosity spreaded to every single person we worked with through this project so these two dancers they are professional dancers from Boston Ballet Company we asked them to model for our garment but they ended up getting really curious how this bacteria work and they wanted to feel the they wanted to basically imagine what would happen if they try to dance with other living beings on their body so they actually ended up inventing some interesting dance moves because they they were thinking they are dancing with other other things on their back so we were inspired and started to talk about a art exhibition called Dancing with billions of bacteria eventually ended up some live shows both at MIT and also somewhere else I remember there was once maybe in Wired the UK in London yeah this is the video to document the whole process [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so our curiosity actually drove us further than this design project so we we were thinking because we're using a bacteria which is called bacillus subtilis it turns out to be a model bacteria for genetic genetic engineering labs and you can easily modify its DNA to embed other functionalities I know in bay area nowadays synthetic biology is a really hot topic and you guys all know perhaps making a little bacteria glow is the easiest trick you can do with with synthetic biology so that's what we did so we ended up making the bacteria can also glow and this glowing can get more and more intense as you get sweaty ER as well so you can start with the condition a piece of fabric that can glow more and more intensively as well as open up when you are getting sweaty or running in dark and we showed this piece as a garment sculpture in between kind of thing in Centre Pompidou in Paris and so this is this is pretty interesting because we got it published in science advances and scientists liked it but in the same time artists also liked it and go back to my whole statement of curiosity-driven design maybe some of you guys don't agree with me and have indeed deeper understanding our vision of what today's problem driven design is to my shallow understanding I think problem driven design is pretty much problem focused apparently your design is towards a specific function but in terms of curiosity driven design in my head I think the design can start from somewhere and ended in in a random place or in many possible places so you think about this biologic bacteria project yes we made a functional garment we actually ended up doing some gene tests for the sake of reading the paper and talking to our sponsors but we also ended up kind of encouraging the curiosity from the artists the dancers who we are working with and for it's getting personal when we started to produce the video I actually see it also as a video production project it's my first time being a director thinking through the storyline and trying to be really not compromising the visual effect although it is a research project from a graduate school and also there are you know interesting social and cultural discussions that are coming from this project and these are all not quite functional you know in a conventional sense when we think about a problem driven design I didn't do any user studies neither my collaborators for example and we were basically based on our intuition trying to think what is the best and what is the most interesting way to inspire both the science and also the art community so to move on I also wanted to share the story of how we get really curious in in the processing in the process of making something even people in the audience even you are not a physical designer let's say our hardware designer I'm pretty sure you agree with me there is a joy there is a joy in the process of making it's a it's a independent from whether it's tangible media tangible tools you are using or it's digital media and digital materials you are playing with it is the process that that really inspire us to to come come up with interesting ideas or inventions so after I joined Carnegie Mellon I noticed in our neighbor lab they have a lot of fancy knitting machines industrial knitting machines and the professor who run the lab Jim McCann tried to convince me that 3d knitting machine is really winning the game of 3d printing comparing with 3d printers for yeah for person who has been working on printing forever I'm like yeah I have to try this he must be right because he made a bunny that's 3d within ten minutes how cool is that so I got to study a little bit more and this one of the videos he shared with me so it is how 3d knitting machine work don't get confused with the with the with weaving I know Google does a lot of weaving weaving fabric this one is how your sweater really is is fabricated so you have many needles basically the needles will pull a single single thread and form out those loops and loops after loops rolls out the rolls that's how your sweater is made two important two important factors to play with materials to play with one is the bed the bed that embed all the needles and the other one is a yarn carrier that carries this single thread that you can make loops with and it turns out there are multiple beds you can play with and there are more than a single yarn carrier so basically that's how you can mix different colors in your sweater so we of course from morphine measure lab we wanna make everything morph looking at Jimmy cans little bunny I'm like can we try to morph the bunny so ended up working with my PhD student leah and also colleague Scott a professor Scott Hudson to think about how you can embed tandon into one 3d meeting two paths so what is Tandon so so this is tendon driven mediate are the effects basically a threat that that can be pulled and as you pull it you can trigger whatever that you needed you can imagine Mikey will be interested in this kind of project because they can meet it the shrew but with the shoelace already meet it into it right with one machine needing to pass because that will save a lot of time for the fabrication so there are two essential roles one is to need horizontal tendon this turns out there are some some tricks you can play with this V bat knitting visit two needle beds to interlace a horizontal tendon and there are also tricks you can use to embed vertical tendon by adding another young carrier that carry this blue tangent tendon thread and with horizontal vertical tangent you can start it to embed diagonal tendons into the structure so until this point by the way we you know what are the killer apps for it we are barely a problem driven anyway so I encouraged Leah to move ahead and trying to think what fun demos we can do and first of all she showed more technical demos she's like oh yeah now you can embed any arbitrary directions you can make very robust robotic tentacles these were the things soft robot is really like to use to demo how robust their actuation or how flexible their actuation techniques are and we ended up also knitting a little bunny tribute a tribute to Jim McCann the professor and so for the Pawnee there are imbedded tendons that are white so in this case we actually can trigger the bunny to move its ear and also hug you so there is a little capacitive sensing capacity Aaliyah's favorite so there's a capacitive sensing patch at the heart so yes we are also meeting meeting sensors into this structure as well but sensors for morphing lab are morphing levers are low-hanging fruit actuations are much more intellectually challenging and that's what we'd like to focus on but anyway so I started to until this point we were still curiosity driven but I started to try to tell a better story to raise funding to support the work and like imagining you in bed alexxa into this trough robot now everybody's everybody's talking about personal soft robots personalized robots at home but it still all look like hard gadgets right whatever if you have a fluffy toy that can also respond to you tell you the weather hug you when your baby are crying or when your grandma are feeling lonely so there are a lot of interesting things about 3d knitted soft robots because not only they are soft robots but also they are they are textiles right there are soft goods and there are emotional attachment and effective interactions you can build on top of those and if you started to combine more conventional 3d knitting techniques like shade and texturing together with our attendant technique you can think about more interesting products for example this pleated lampshade that can be triggered to open and close on the fly or a sweater that has a smudge shoulder to pat you and we talked about maybe this can be petted by her mom from Inner Mongolia while you're not sleeping after midnight in San Francisco trying to play video games or maybe just a warning system to tell me hey you were like over speaking tonight please stop right now so there are many many ways you can start using bad DVD informations into into those smart goods once they are textiles and that's why I am interested in encouraging this type of work from a margin matter perspective so we not only play with 3d knitting machines basically we get really curious whenever we see fancy especially expensive machines and this was another one is a half million dollar laser cutter but it laser-cut in super high precision it's a printer from professor cameraman Judy's lab so we ended up cutting all those zigzag conductive traces out of copper once you make those conductive traces out of copper which is super conductive you can embed all kinds of sensors and semiconductor based electronics into into your into your system so we are showing stretchable fabric as a technical demonstration so we ended up making a super so by the way the super lady Catherine she is actually material science senior students who is an offer in the lab she's just modeling it on the side but we ended up making all the patches for different functionality so you can sense temperature motion basically whatever you want and viral data very health health sensor 1 pixel cameras we made we customized the function for different parts of the body this is one of my favorite so as you are eating depending on if you're eating potato chips or Apple do a little bit of simple machine learning tricks you can monitor that it's a simple microphone but it detect the food type you can imagine this will allow you or alarm you to eat more apples than than chips so my last story about how curiosity will will make your life and job more fun and more inventive that is the curiosity in kitchen and you can maybe also call it curiosity materials and I have been really interested in studying materials especially smart and responsive materials in kitchen and this was one of the stuff you mentor is viral documentaries in China so so I saw there are a lot of material that are that are more feeble for example you can stretch the noodle as long as you want and when you try to fry a bread in hot oil you can get a big balloon so that is to do with the thermal expansion law right and when my grandma also tells me if you try to cook dumplings you will see when it's floating on top of water that means it's done so there they're also interesting balances so there are always you know science combined with our daily life so we started to list all the possible physical phenomenons actually talked to a physics trying to figure this out because I love working with physics because they also do use this thing to them like curiosity but they always end up with immensely useful conclusions so so we decided to choose sweating rate to start with our journey inside the kitchen so everybody knows swelling this is starch one of the main ingredients in your pasta so when you cook a piece of pasta the starch will attract all the water molecules and cause the sweating behavior that means your pasta becomes softer and bigger it's super simple but it turns out if you try to decompose all the edible ingredients you will find different sweating rate different sweating ratios sorry and rate for different raw ingredients for example cellulose or fiber components inside the food we have a completely different sweating ratio comparing with starch so with this is actually a simple piece of jell-o I'm talking about the jello you can actually buy it from CVS or Target so it's a single piece of jell-o but in the center part we covered the jello with a bit of cellulose and then you can see the growing rate this is the swelling rate of the center part is slower than the edges where there are no cellulose cover so I play this video again this is the center part grow slower because it's composed of both cellulose that's less swellable and gelatin but the edges are only gelatin and that's cool so I played the old trick if I try to 3d print the cellulose selectively to some regions on a super swellable gelatine film maybe you can start to play with the swelling ratio of this film and that way you can make a flat film turn into a banded shape when you cook it so you can also make a flat disk that turned into a potato chip shape when you are cooking it and you can be a bit fancier if you combine with some composition or a simulation method you can make a disc that turned into a flower and then the flower will go kind of dead by the end as you cook it and this is the some of the [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so all the shapes you you are currently seeing they are after being cooked when they were made they were all flat so yeah so it's a self-loading project ourself folding materials if you will and until this point again it was driven by curiosity but then again I had to get some funding to support my students so I tried to tell a practical story behaving like I'm an engineer and a practical designer so I told the food industry hey if you make all your past our flat you can save a lot of shipping and packaging costs for example macaroni compared to flat spaghetti pasta will will actually spend a sister the other way to say it so flat pasta can save compared with macaroni can save almost 60 years more than 60% of the packaging space because for 3d shapes you pack a lot of air but Italians like pastas in 3d shapes because they have different textures they are paired with different sauces right so there may be a market there and we also told the story to the media after we publish the work packs - when I was at MIT and it went viral everywhere and people were thinking this pasta is really becoming true and we started to receive you know ask oh actually the American kitchen asked us to do a live demonstration tell American husband makes opinion pasta you know live on TV so of course we said no because all these shapes were made of gelatin never things you like faster and there's a very small market for gelatine self-folding pasta so but I ended up giving a talk in Milan and this was maybe right before I joined Carnegie Mellon so I was happily going there because I'm like finally I got a chance to talk about this vision of self-loading pasta - Italian see how much they can serve but yeah I ended up really a great event and the mayors of I forgot maybe the culture mayor us the umeela actually were there I was there and all the audiences really liked the idea so the even caught me in touch with a Italian pasta company and we ended up actually getting semolina flour grown from Italy into our lab and trying to experiment with them with a bit so the whole vision is that we wanted to actually make it happen because it seems like the world really liked it and maybe needed and this is this is this is the real pasta and the work to say they don't have any additive ingredients whenever I say engineer food they were like people don't like GMOs and synthetic chemicals but here there are just the semolina flowers and you can see the top is before it's boiled and the bottom is after its boiled and these are a collections of pasta we offer to the Italian pasta company we are currently working with and again so on the black background they were before before it's being boiled and now it takes it mately 10 to 15 minutes for it to morph because they are just normal flour it takes similar basically exactly the same process to cook them [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] yeah we are also telling the joke that maybe now the joke is coming true the tastic company is actually trying to license the technology from CMU so next time you try to propose you know fancy Italian restaurant you can customize your food to carry information carrying the information that sounds very Google and and IOT right Internet of Things through your food how fancy is that so we also ended up working with a high-end French cuisine restaurant try to see how this kind of experience Piron food or smart materials can enrich our foreign Tiny's [Music] [Music] so I want to explain the very last one a little bit so it's a long piece of know you're putting in water if you cook it for a bit longer time I started to chop itself into smaller pieces you can imagine you can cook with in one pot for both yourself who like longer noodles for his texture and your kids who like shorter ones for easier digestion so in a sense you are programming the the cook ability and the texture and the shape through the pre-programmed logic into into your food I'm almost done with my journey and summarize with little bit of immature theories here just capture my own thoughts so again talking about back about the problem driven design so yeah I I know you guys also talk about this divergence for the knees converge for a specific use cases and diverge for design process and converse for the final solution but however this goes you start from a specific design Co almost you kind of ended up solving that specific problem you are targeting but coming back to this curiosity-driven design we're kind of random so you start with some sort of a goal you really make yourself or your students slightly oriented but then you started be more like maybe like you know a person who are driving a boat with but without a compass you are doing the detours or you're stopping along the way and you sing beautiful beautiful sceneries and get distracted and you completely get distracted you may not get back to the original goal you set but along the way you discovered all those beautiful beautiful things and you may find the continent of America eventually but the whole point is that think about this food project we are trying random things pasta was sort of a go at the beginning cell folding pasta but real goat actually honestly it was self footing dumplings I wanted to make for my mom in China because every time I went back she she she she spent a lot of time cooking but some things are really hard to sell more cannolis are much easier but we also ended up you know it's exploring the self chopping food and fine dining experiences and nowadays were even doing sell food in cookies all these knowledge is they are they are share the different is shared they are shareable and that's all because we are curious that's all because we were kind of doing these things random we are making friends with the materials in the lab we are being patient we are being focused and we are also trying to combine our scientific ways of doing experiments and culturing insights with our ways of thinking through the design practices so why designers why designers are important for these kind of examples I showed you you can argue you can be a material scientist in order to engineer piece of pasta to sell food as a designer I'm not sure if I still would call myself a pure designer I do have a design undergrad degree so I think there are a lot of things I contributed along the way for the examples I showed you so yes we started with often phenomenons we put them into fancy machines and different you know mechanical chemical testing facilities to understand and the capabilities of the technology I call it possibility of Technology but once all these possibilities are there what's the next step that's actually when designers can play a really important role because we can think about the purpose of the design we can leverage our intuition and sensation through the practices of design thinking to to better leverage this possibility eventually what technology will be used are actually decided by the designers in the team this has been my honest honest journey so so take this as an example the the self shop you know those I just said the the fact was I was working together with a chemical engineer who is a postdoc at MIT Chemical Engineering Department in the lab and we were trying to find engineer the self more in fact with one degree you know resolution accuracy but then we figured some of the pasta dissolve faster than other one it turns out we are just buying from the same chemical company to gelatine but have given molecular weight molecular weight basically represents how long the polymer chain is if you remember high school chemistry and she was frustrated she was like oh this is not controllable we bought the raw material this time and I was like this is cool you can cook and control the dissolving time if you try to compose those two materials with the same within the same noodle you can then make us you know timer basically programmable know though that can self chop itself so I think it is to some extent her solid scientific knowledge and my intuition as a designer gave birth to the self trapping path noodles and of course along the way I tried very hard to equip myself with more rigorous engineering knowledge because I do believe as I shared if you know more about the scientific theory and also the processes of how machines work how materials work you will you will be able to infuse more of your design thinking and senses and sensations to the early stage of your your project development and I believe that's true beyond this kind of fictional margin matter research that we are doing and passionately curious is not something new I stand told us curiosity is really important and also being passionately curious extremely important so in my lab I keep telling my students no matter what kind of technical background or design background they come from they should try to combine their rigorous thinking with the imagination and fantasies with reality so ultimately if they can be passionately curious with the kind of the humble subjects they are dealing with like thermoplastic or expensive and fancy subjects like the bacteria we are playing with they can all results in exciting outcomes and I'd like to thank all the curious minds behind the projects I just listed and talked about and all the funding supports along the way and yeah I'm happy to answer any questions or if you guys want to get in touch email us is shared here thank you thank you so much for your amazing talk it was absolutely mind-blowing I just had one quick question on the bacteria I noticed there's almost like a symbiotic relationship between the human being and the bacteria I was wondering have you I work with a lot of people work with CRISPR have you thought about using CRISPR to genetically reprogram the bacteria to actually give it more of what what it's doing or new features yeah so we we didn't use CRISPR there were some in a engineering we did to make the bacteria glow a response responding to responding to sweat but uh if you check the paper that was published in science advances it's actually called multifunctional genetically modified nano actuator so the whole vision behind was you can there are many synthetic materials you can use to make this piece of fabric responding to your sweat 1 selling point of using bacteria is that you can genetically modify it to make it multifunctional for example you might be able to engineer a piece of fabric that will generate some perfume along the way when you get sweaty err and we even talked about if you need some of those act active functionality into it you may need to actively feed the bacteria you can have a piece of garment every night instead of putting it in a normal closet you put it in a nutritious closet that has flowing nutritions every night so you can keep torturing your bacteria we didn't go that far we did called some attracting some interest from indeed some venture capital firms in San Francisco area I do believe there are some things can be done and you can do a lot of the health-related sensing with it too I know they're already commercially available products that basically use biology biology approach to extract the chemicals from your sweat and indicate that with color we can definitely indicate that with the shape as well if you will thank you so much for being here I'm very inspired I am curious about what other areas of is your lab curve being curious about well like what are you guys working on next like I mentioned so we are actually on there are many different levels just in terms of technical developments with one of the missions being a research lab in a university is that we wanted to keep pushing the limitation of technology or in other ways was creating platform technology that can benefit the majority not just the single lab so we are aggressively trying to develop more easy to use computational tool to allow the morphing matter to be fabricated one challenge is those more matter they are highly nonlinear soft materials for most of the case is very slow to simulate if you want to capture the precise morphing behavior so we were trying to integrate machine learning and a numeric simulation method to make computing computational tools easier and slightly more fun side so we started to investigate more natural morphing organisms nowadays the desert plants that's that country itself into the ground is this one thing we're exploring with the hope that maybe one day after a California fire you can just deploy some artificial seeds with the zone and it can quickly read planetary the mountain not sure even if it's practical but you know I'm just curious and what else yes so that's a that's on the kind of application side so we are also trying to nowadays trying to this is not just because we are curious this is actually because we want you to benefit the humanities we are already trying to see now we are having more and more knowledge in terms of how to tame and manipulate things to morph and sense and morph in a sense we are trying to actually put this into more more practical and relevant application area for example for health can you make smart drugs or smart surgical tool that you can swallow inside your body and to certain things rather than just making pasta can you actually make it beneficial for your health or for drug deliveries and minimum invasive surgeries but these are a really long term scientific inquiries I don't I don't see you can you can buy a piece of pasta maybe I can see that you know a few years but yeah surgical tools that can self deploying into a tweezer and then you know you can get out once it's done is surgery maybe you have tears thanks everyone for joining us tonight this is been super inspiring and mind-blowing is someone in the back said the abbe join us next month we will be talking about design is play our next speaker so everyone have a great evening [Music]
