 hey guys, welcome back to a new video, so today I am talking about google's new smart headphone cable. where we can with the help of different gestures can change the volume, and play and pause the songs or media, like moving forward or backward or skipping to the next song and soo many things with help of some gestures only so here they are using helcal sensing matrix, where they are using the strands of fibre they are actually using braid of the strands so for getting it you people might have seen the nylon wires or the wires of coconut (in india ) so that's how they are here  a braid of strands,  so just like that in HSM the strands of fibre optics are used so in the braid of fiber optics they use a special type of light which helps in generating visual feedback, so you as you all are watching how far they have reahed here in this, so as all can see how its working with gestures like changing volume and so many things, so coming on to how this thing is working so basically its a fusion between textile and technology, so here the braid of fiber, using a special type of light with these braid of fiber so when we have this setup and then when we do some moment or some gestures with our fingers like if you people touch it or twist it or turn it or slide on it etc a signal gets produced here, so this is what we are calling helcal sensing matrix here and its not like its something very new i mean in last year google even showcased a jacket of nike where they showed things getting controlled from the jacket, and this thing has a lot of scope and google for now is calling it I/O braid coming to the thing that when it can come, so for now we can't say much about as there is a lot of development to be done the results are just 94% and there is still a lot of work that has to be done here, for now the biggest thing on which they are working on is that they have to give a control so that no accidential command gets  its place here because in general in the real world using something like this in earphones specially the wired ones there wire gets a lot of touch and twist and things like that in day to day life so for that they will have implent a controlled  sensing here, so i hope that they there will be some more control optimisation, in some modes where it will work and some where it will not work and there are chances that in starting this might not work that smoothly but the way touchscreen improved so it will also, if we see its scope we have a lot in this world as this can not only control smartphone this has the potential to control  or act like controller of a lot of smart products, and if we will use this product correctly it has a lot of potential, so these gestures i think will be controlling a lot of smart products in future, so what you guys think on it please do let me know in the comment box so that's it for the video guys, i hope that you guys will like this video and share this video with your friends and family, and if you are also interested in tech videos like this then please subscribe to my channel and hit the bell icon for  future notifications.
