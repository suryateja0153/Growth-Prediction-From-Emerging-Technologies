 this video introduces damages provoked on smart and D texture systems during their laundering damage is provoked Tony texture structures may be classified in three different categories mechanical chemical and temperature damages probably the most important are mechanical damages that are result of wear and tear during washing process and of collisions with other textile goods present in the job during the washing process it may be considered that mechanical damages are directly proportional to angular speed and accelerations of the drum during the cycle chemical damages are due to the water using use during the laundering and its softness but also to the chemicals from detergents for instance it is obvious that bleaching agents have very negative influence on the conductive silver plating layer or conductive polyamide yarns those agents accelerate oxidation and modify adhesion between the silver plated layer and polyamide filaments temperature damages have similar effect on the adhesion of the silver plated layer as the swelling of polyamide is not similar to the swelling of silver in the conductive layer cracks and ruptures between those two materials conduct to the disappearing of the conductive silver layer and to the sharp decrease of the conductive yarns capacity to convey energy and data similar phenomenon provokes bad contacts between conductive yarns Bologna takes the motherboard and other components of it x-ray structures such as sensors actuators power supplies and computational modules on this slide the table on the left side summarizes the level of stress only Texas archers during the washing cycle water and chemical stresses have been separated in order to better identify they are corresponding inferences on the right side of the slide a same image and an optical microscope image of the conducting gun made of silver plated twisted polyamide mono filaments are shown after several washing cycles on both images it is possible to observe areas where silver layer disappeared in black color of the same image and invite in microscope images do two different techniques of image acquisition this slide shows some images of the unprotected surface of silver plated polyamide mono filaments reading conductive yarns before washed tests and after 5 10 20 40 and 50 mild silk wash cycles it is important to state the conductive yarn composed of two plies of 34 conductive monofilament seach have been sewn on the texes up straight before the washing even if the low-speed stitching is performed the needle and the bobbin have damaged you see with conductive layer this is visible on a image these damages are however more important on the outer monofilament that have been dyed contact with the needle the analysis of all the same images indicate clearly that damages underwent by conducted threads very important after water cycles this has also been measured by an ohm meter it is obvious from 10 results the textual motherboard made of conductive stitched lines must be protected at least mechanically by TPU thermal deposited layer or by some other means as for example non conductive overlapped embroidery this slide shows damages underwent by an electronic miniaturized model designed and produced on a flexible PCB dedicated to ECG monitoring and single recording on the left side the battery has been integrated together with miniaturized module encapsulated in order to extend a washing cycle this module has been connected to washable text-based knitted electrodes that have been in contact with a skin on torso however after only one wash cycle the dried model stopped to record the ECG and this misfunctioning was due to the battery oxidation the incarceration did not completely stop the humidity to penetrate and damaged a battery on the right side only the module without the power supply a battery together with other components embedded to the same adder it has been washed Wendy Texas system has been dried and module connected to a battery it worked perfectly well according the ECG signal from the flexible skin electrodes and sending it to a smartphone with adapted software on this slide an array of SMD LEDs soldered with a soldering paste the encapsulated with the silicon has been realized no texture substrate containing conductive yarns dedicated to LEDs power supply in order to realize light-emitting textiles two identical light-emitting textile as headaches has been have been realized first one has been protected with a sheet of TPU that has been deposited on the whole surface containing LEDs and conduct the ants on both sides of the fabric the second one has not been protected only LEDs have been encapsulated using silicon super X G and all 777 same as for the first array after depth both light emitting textiles have been washed 50 times and after 1 2 5 10 20 30 40 and 50 wash cycles light emitting textures have been tried and tested by connecting them to a power supply before the washing all the LEDs were perfect perfect light emitting the following side shows the result in terms percentage of LEDs still working on this slide it is visible that for the light emitting textile protect me TPU sheets only few LEDs stop to work even after 50 mild silk washing cycles on the other side the second light emitting takes a lost all working LEDs after 30 wore cycles as LEDs have been all encapsulated it may be concluded that conductive yarn stitched howtechs a substrate within textile motherboard lost progressively their capacity to power LEDs is their resistance increased too much because they have lost their conductive layer
