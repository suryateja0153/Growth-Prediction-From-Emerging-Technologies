 Probably the best part of the whole creative process is the moment when it turns from something that we've been dreaming about in our heads into a real physical thing. We like to say that anything you can take a nap on, Block Shop will make it. Our whole business is rooted in celebrating this ancient practice of hand block printing. We're constantly trying to push ourselves to improve our design language and to make things that will hopefully stand the test of time.
