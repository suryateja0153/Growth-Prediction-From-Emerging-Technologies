 [Jen] Hi! It's Jen and Tammy back with another notions video and of course Tammy, who is perpetually on the hunt for the next cool notion has found it! [Tammy] I have found a cool notion Jen! [Jen] She showed this, I'm like "what is this?" [Tammy] What is this? [Tammy] Oh this is cool! [Jen] Alright! [Tammy] This is a Bitty Buddy. You're like, what the heck is that? You still don't know right? I know. [Jen] I'm in suspense! Show us! So it's a collapsible bag and you can see how easy it is to set it up. You just undo the elastic and it pops right up. [Jen] Wow! This is like super light. [Tammy] Isn't it cool? [Jen] This is like a slinky! [Tammy] I know! It's so fun! [Jen] So when, tell us, [Tammy] What would I use this for? [Jen] Yes! [Tammy] Okay! I like to keep this on my cutting table. When I'm cutting a project and I have scraps and you have the leftover 2 and a 1/2 inch strip that I've cut squares off of. [Jen] Yeah? [Tammy] What do you do with that? [Jen] Oh. I do! [Tammy] You throw it in a pile. You throw it in a scrap basket. I put it in here so then I have all the scraps from my project together in one place. Yeah! So then if I make a mistake or I need more squares I know right where to go. [Jen] She's smart! [Tammy] Oh Miss Jen! No! It's just experience! [Jen] Mines, some on the pile, some fell in the trash, some fell on the ground. [Tammy] Correct! See, and they're gone! And you don't know where they are. And so then you're hunting for this little scrap of fabric. Well I have all mine with me and then I have them together. [Jen] I love that but you know what I'm thinking about, you know how we've run on quilt retreats? [Tammy] Oh yeah.[Jen] And if you've got on quilt retreats I'm always like, "where do I put my thread?" because there's never been one trash can at the end. [Tammy] Yes! [Jen] And I end up, I'm embarrassed to tell you this. I have like this lunch bag I used for the kids. [Tammy] The paper lunch bags! With masking tape! [Jen] I always inadvertently tear it off! [Tammy] Yeah! [Jen] Getting up. [Tammy] And they get full, fall off. [Jen] That's probably what I would use that for! [Tammy] This is perfect! This is perfect for garbage. I also have one of these at my sewing machine for threads and garbage that I place in here. [Jen] So you have more than one again! [Tammy] Of course! I have 2! I need 2 of them! [Jen] So I see! [Jen] I get the idea for the whole like trimming because I've done that. Where I went to cut some half square triangles and I cut it well I miss cut it. I wasn't using very good rulers at that time, that was kind of before Creative Grids. [Tammy] Yep! [Jen] And I was scrambling to find more of that fabric. [Tammy] You had no idea where it went.[Jen] If it's in here, [Tammy] you know where it is. [Jen] I'd get it! [Tammy] I get it. [Jen] Get a couple of these! They're like under $10! [Tammy] They're under $10. They've got this elastic on them. You can hang this off of your cutting table if you want, to get it off your cutting table, hang this. [Jen] You could almost put that under the one foot of your of your sewing machine, and this hang off. [Tammy] Yes! Yes! And it would hang. Yes! So it's not taking up table space. Fun! I love this! [Jen] I love that! [Tammy] Yeah! These are very handy and easily collapsible. [Jen] And they scrunch down. [Tammy] Easily collapsible, yet the elastic holds them together just like that. [Jen] I can see multiple, even putting notions in there. [Tammy] Notions. [Jen] Rotary cutters, marking tools, kind of all in the same little spot. [Tammy] Yes! So they're together. [Jen] Guys! I'm gonna get 2 of these at least. [Tammy] Perfect! [Jen] So Tammy, thank you again! [Tammy] You're welcome! [Jen] Now we've said it before we see, oh my goodness, hundreds of notions. [Tammy] Hundreds of notions. We do, literally. [Jen] And we only want to pick the things, I know you only pick the things that truly add value to the sewing space, [Tammy] That's correct! [Jen] make us more organized and to add to the joy of what we love to do. [Tammy] That's right! I love them! [Jen] So thank you for finding this! [Tammy] You're welcome! [Jen] This is the Bitty Buddy. And I'm gonna add two of these and is this the only color by the way? [Tammy] Yes! Purple is the only color for now. [Jen] Okay, well I'll be sure to get those. I hope you will too, and we'll be looking for more notions. [Tammy] Definitely. [Jen] And we'll see you next time! [Guitar Tune]
