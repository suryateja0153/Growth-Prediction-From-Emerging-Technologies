 Can humans become bulletproof? What sounds like a superhero power, is now a reality. Scientists have injected spider DNA into goats to create super silk 3 times stronger than Kevlar, and that is jus t the start. Spider silk is composed almost entirely of protein. It is about three times stronger than Kevlar and about ten times stronger than steel and more elastic than nylon. We grow large amounts of spider cell gene. We cut the gene, we splice it into the goat DNA and we splice it together. Then, we take that and transplant that embryo into a goat. The goat ends up with a baby goat that now has the spider cell DNA in it. But Dutch artist JALILA ESSAIDI and her team had an even bolder idea. They merged the silk with lab-grown human tissue. We provided the artist with spider cell fabric, then her collaborators actually grew the skin layers on top of that fabric. And of course, there is only one way to test this - by shooting a bullet at it. They placed the new fabric over ballistic gel and pulled the trigger. The spider silk withstood the speeding bullet! Scientists have also begun to use silk-worms with spider DNA, and the U.S army has a $1million deal for future body armour.
