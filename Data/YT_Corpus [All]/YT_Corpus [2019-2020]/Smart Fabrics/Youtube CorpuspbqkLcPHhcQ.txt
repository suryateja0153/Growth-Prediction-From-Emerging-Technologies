 hi my name is Cindy rang with the fabric patch in Ephrata Washington our website is www.fabricpatch.net/ struct your masks I know that I am NOT everybody's cup of tea because I talk a lot but the reason that I talk a lot is because I want to know the reason why so I'm not just going to tell you what to do I'm going to tell you why I do what I do so that you can decide if that works for you or not so we are going to go through the patterns how to alter a pattern how to change the pattern for for Jessie's mask this was the one if you watched our video last week we discussed this because most of the mass we've made now over a hundred and seventy thousand masks all that were given away and we've done craft passion's pattern we liked her pattern the best just because it seems to be a bit generic there's only four sizes they were fitting just about everybody but now that we're done with all of the donations what we are wanting is people want to know how to make a mask that they can keep that they can wear that fits them perfectly through shopping through flu season through winter through whatever and that's where the Jesse Killian mask comes in and that's what we're going to talk about today if you missed last week's video you can still find that on YouTube but just briefly I want to mention a couple things about last week's video we've been doing YouTube videos not for a long long time but we started making masks on March 9th and when we started doing that we explained a lot of different things and the process and we didn't necessarily re-explain that with every video so we talked about what type of filtration we like to use what types of products you can use what happens when you can't find what you want and again you have to decide for yourself what mask will work for you a lot of people like a mask with a disposable filter something that you can put something in and take it out for me personally I didn't want to deal with that I didn't want to handle something I didn't want to run out of that filtration piece and I knew that no matter what I needed to wash this mask every day and maybe multiple masks per day so I wanted everything to be washable and our mantra was that it had to be wearable washable and breathable you don't want to wear something that's too hot and you obviously want to be able to breathe through it so you can wear it for extended periods of time and again you want to be able to wash it otherwise you're constantly remaking things so for us what we chose was a nonwoven material in the inside and again you can watch those other videos but the idea of a nonwoven is it's almost like paper and so if you have the right product for the inside particles are not going to make it through the thing that we've settled on that we like the most is the Olli it comes in lots of different colors but it's basically the same thing as halyard 600 which is a surgical sheeting and only fun is the fabric equivalent to that it's 100% polypropylene and again all of that information is on the other videos so you just make your decision for yourself if you want to put a pocket in there for a filter or not so now that I'm a retired nurse practitioner and a quilt shop owner that I work with my daughter so last time people were concerned because I was all up in her business but I'm all her business although the line every day in lots of ways I still hug her a couple times a day so we share the same air and what happens is we are in a quilt shop that is closed we have a 5,000 square-foot quilt shop in Central Washington and that's what we do now so having a medical background but a knowledge of fabrics that was why it made sense for us to develop the masks and most of our friends are quilters and healthcare professionals and so it was an easy transition for us to find an army of people that would help us to make the masks to give to our first responders so that being said that's why last time I was telling people that I take my mask and I put it on like a necklace every morning that freaked people out here I want to tell you don't just walk around wearing your mask like a necklace that wasn't really what I meant I mean that is what I said that is what I mean but Breanna and I are in this shop all by ourselves nobody else is in here we're sharing each other's air we're contaminating each other no one else what happens is maybe once a day maybe three times a day somebody pulls up for curbside pickup so my whole thing is I didn't want to put the mask on take the mask off put the mask on set it down put it in my pocket because you don't necessarily know what those surfaces are like and where did I set it down how long did it sit there what is now dirty so when I keep it here what's happening is these germs are these germs so these are her germs it's no big deal so if she's gonna - out real quick and just talk to somebody she's just gonna hold it up over her face because the whole idea with this is she's now keeping her germs to herself she's not going to breathe on anybody in that car now it is true that she and I are touching the outside of this mask well I should have mentioned of course you wash your hands of course you wash your hands you had wash your hands after you touch everything and the other thing those people were concerned because they said well this is so filthy dirty well that could be so let's say that she went into so go ahead and put it on all the way and if she's going into Walmart where she's again keeping her germy breath to herself she's going to maintain that six foot distance but also keep anybody else's germy breath now it's true that this is dirty but this is no dirtier than this this is no dirtier than this so all of this air is the same air so even though she's touching the outside of that mask and now here I'm touching my hair all people are gonna say something bout that but um she's still gonna wash her hands she's still gonna wash her hands she's just and this advice this is me being a cult shop owner quilt shop co-owner hanging out going out for curbside service this is what works for us if you are out and about the other thing that I see is I see people in their cars in their cars with their masks on that's great but if you're getting a little bit hot same idea that's all I meant is just have it ready to go because your air in your car is your air you're probably okay you just want to have it ready because people that would pull up and be digging around in their purse for their masks and that's what I kept thinking is oh my god don't put that on you know where has that been and you know picking it up so that's my only thought is that you do want to keep it clean and I'm just gonna review a couple of great comments that we heard after last week's video and then we're gonna get right into the sewing so if you feel like you've already been constructing the masks and you don't need the tutorial you won't necessarily need to stay around for that but let me just share a couple of quick things with you we are going to talk about measurement with Jesse's mask and we are going to talk about if you don't fit into any of his 18 sizes how you can adjust that pattern and we're gonna share that in just a minute but there was a couple things that were super brilliant and people kept asking about the t-shirts and said well can you just show that so let me just show you this is just a t-shirt a knit t-shirt and all you have to do is take this and cut we were cutting 1-inch strips and if you just cut a one inch strip you know and depending on how big your t-shirt is you can cut this this is a 12 inch strip of that and all you have to do is pull it and if you stretch it see the whole thing curls up itself so people were asking questions about the t-shirt material and then it's flat at this end so you're able to go ahead and tuck it in there after you've sewn your mask and you've turned it right side out you're able to go ahead and take this tuck this in there where you want them to be and so top sew that down so you have your ties so these are super nice you can also do the same thing it is stretchy material so you can go ahead and do it with your ears but people were asking about adjustable earpieces and this was Todd from maybe also Atlanta Todd was showing this which was super smart and so what he did was he either took elastic pieces or the t-shirt pieces and all he did was he just took a pony bead wrap to this around threaded the bead through there there we go then you can just hold that up and pull that on to there and if you've pulled that on to there then what you have is this adjustable slide so that you can make your earpiece fit you I haven't personally tried that to see if that's going to hit my ear but I don't think that it is because this is on this side and this is on that side so that was just a really nice little tip that Todd shared another tip that was really good was they I had showed in the last video how to stretch your paracord and then burn it and oh my gosh probably 50 people told me all you have to do is pull those out so look how smart that is I learned something new and then you can just flatten that whole thing and it's not quite as stiff and it ties a little easier and you can do the same thing you can do that same adjustable paracord with that same bead so you have that same thing so anyway that was sort of smart so I just wanted to share those and then people were asking about the coffee closures and they said explain again what those are so I meant to bring my bag of coffee but on your bag of coffee this is what's on there so that when you go to seal your coffee back up it's you know it's like that so if you have a local coffee company they will probably just give them to you if not you can order these on Uline and they're super inexpensive and again the ones that we like they have just a little bit of an adhesive because of course that's what they're for is to put on the coffee bag and that'll hold it in place and I'll show you these when we're constructing our masks so oh one other last thing is people were asking about the measurements what is the measurement for around the head and when we talk about the constructing the mask well yeah go ahead and let me just show you something so everybody is different when we were doing when we were making all of these masks that we were sending out we pretty much did ties just because you know as long as we knew if they had a large face small face whatever a beard this was going to fit but the ties the elastic is very very very different we found the same thing was true with the size of the head I mean how big is the head and so we measured a bunch of people's heads everybody was way way way different so again now that you are making a mask for you personally your husband your daughter your whoever you really have an opportunity to take some measurements and I should mention too that the reason there's no children sizes is because if you're two and under you should not wear a mask they're not supposed to because they'll actually get hypoxic so they shouldn't go to the grocery store anyways no they need to stay home anyway come on vacation go grow up all by yourself he's been liking that it's super nice yeah so what you're gonna do if you're going to do this type of mask which people are liking and Briana again they freaked out that I touched this and she's putting it on but I know I am a total germaphobe you might not believe it but there's double dippers never get invited to my house again there has never been a five-second rule our house if it's dropped its dead and if people come in and they have some sort of a cough or a cold yeah like chases them with Lysol I am NOT nice about it I'm not nice had cancer twice and even your suppression going on so I feel a little vindicated now with these masks because now when flu season comes and our shop finally reopens they are gonna have a mask on so um I feel really I feel good about the whole mask thing so anyway all right okay so she's got this on and she's got this measurement here and that's why people like this because her hair's are not getting all messed up with the ties and it's really staying in place and you don't have to worry we're gonna turn you this way you don't have to worry about the back of the ear thing so people are asking well what is the measurement of this okay we're gonna take that down again for a second or take it off so just do the measurement and so what we're measuring so here we have our little tape I know you're not able to see this so just trust me that we're measuring from where the mask is going to end which is going to be about there so go ahead and turn for me Brianna we're gonna come over and we're going to measure right here and so she is roughly 12 inches is that measurement so the magical number when you're dealing with anything elastic is 2/3 2/3 because what you want to do is if this is 12 inches then 2/3 of 12 inches is going to be 8 inches so this piece is 8 inches long because then it'll fit 2/3 and stretch another third which will keep it tight so that's the magic number for waistbands it's the magic number for your hat bag it's a magic number for all of that measure that number whatever that is your elastic strap should be 2/3 if you want it to be very specific keep in mind where you might be wearing it and you might have a measurement here and you might have a measurement here again if you feel like you know you really want to make sure you have a perfectly fitting mask one that you're going to be washing and hanging on to those are just the measurements that will help alright I feel like we've answered the burning questions that people had the last thing before we get into resetting up to so is people had questions about printing the pattern so Jessie again one of my new favorite people he is an engineer he is a numbers guy he wanted to make sure that it was easy but in making sure that it was easy the pattern is 18 pages because what he did is do you have a narrow face an average face or a wide face and so you choose that number and then he wants to know what is the measurement from your nose to your chin and you have six different options for that so you really start with a really good measurement and we'll again we'll review this in just a second but people were saying they couldn't print off the pattern to get this scale correct because he has a little scale measurement up here what you do is it's a printer setting so what you have to do is make sure that your printer is set print to scale not print to page and then it'll print to the correct scale and then you'll be okay so alright we're going to get reset up and then we'll see you right back go ahead and talk about Jesse Killians mask and again people keep asking well where's Jesse's website where can we buy Jesse's mask Jesse again a friend an engineer who loves numbers loves designing things he has no website he's just interested in a good fit and he understands CAD programs and numbers and so he's done a great job with this the only thing is that it's 18 pages we talked about that earlier so what you want to do is you want to start with some measurements so if you are making masks for a family who is maybe a couple states away or whatever you can still do that if you just have a couple numbers so we'll use Brianna again so what you want to know is you want to know nose to ear measurement and by nose dia measurement and again on our website have a little diagram with an arrow that shows so we're going from the bridge of the nose so right where the glasses would set and we're gonna go right to the edge here and we're gonna come around to in front of the ear so with Brianna that happens to be five inches so that's her measurement from nose to ear the other thing that I want to know is I want to know nose to chin so I'm going to go in exactly the same spot and I'm gonna come down to just underneath the chin so that if I kind of put my finger there it's going to rest right underneath her chin that measurement on here her from nose to chin was four and a half inches and then again I showed earlier you if somebody wants the elastic that goes all the way around the back no that measurement also so once you have that measurement we'll be able to look at the pattern the way that Jessi wrote his pattern is that once you have those two numbers he actually has a little graph that will explain and that you might have an arrow face an average face or a wide face you can look through all of that if you want to if you're kind of a numbers person but basically the easiest thing to do is find the closest pattern to your measurement so for Breanna and I both this was the one that fit us the best we couldn't find one that was exactly five inches from nose to ear and four and a half from nose to chin but we found one that was similar so if you have to modify the pattern you would modify this pattern in the same way that you would a dressmakers pattern so what we would do oh and you know let me just show you this for a second that was why I left this one here is that see the difference look at the difference between this pattern so if somebody has a longer face that's why it's important to know look at how if I made this mask for somebody who had this size face it would never fit if I made this big huge mask for somebody who had a smaller face it's not going to fit even though the length might be the same you might find another one where maybe this part is the same but look at the length that's different you don't want that gap at the end so that's why the measurements are a nice thing okay so let's go back to how to adjust this measurement so just like it's a dress pattern if what our problem is is that this measurement the nose to chin measurement if I need to take a quarter of an inch out of there all I'm going to do is I'm just going to take my scissors I'm going to cut into here and then I'm going to overlap this by a quarter of an inch okay I thought I would just go ahead and show this process and maybe alleviate some of the questions so if you remember the mask that we're making is for somebody who has a four and a half inch measurement from nose to chin and a five inch measurement from nose to ear the closest one that I could find was a four and three-quarter and a five and an eighth so what I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead and take this you can see that this is where I've made my cut and I just have this little mat here and so here's my quarter inch measurement is here's an eighth here's a quarter right here so I've got this lining up right on the edge and I'm going to overlap this to the quarter inch see where that's at I'm going to take a piece of tape and I'm going to tape that so now I'm a four and a half inches here so this one is this one is five and an eighth so I'm going to decrease this measurement by an eighth and since this is from nose are from nose to ear I have to decrease this measurement across the bottom and across the top it doesn't really matter just make sure that you're not on the curve when you're doing that and that you're doing it on the straight of way so same thing is gonna happen I'm gonna come over here and here's my little here's my eighth of a measurement right here so I'm just going to lay that there and I'm going to overlap that line by an eighth of an inch the truth is I probably wouldn't change this by an eighth of an inch I'd probably would just sort of let it go but I feel like just to be able to show you how to do it I'm just gonna show you and then this one so see how that would kind of pucker I'm just gonna go ahead and tear that the rest of the way and overlap that and see where I'm at there I am I'm gonna come over an eighth of an inch and so you can see how easy that would be to modify this pattern you could modify this pattern even if you were adjusting it by a full inch a half an inch whatever you needed to it doesn't matter once you have this pattern and you have the measurements on there go ahead and label it tape it you know close it back up and label it so you know whose it is because then what you're going to do is you'll trace it on to your freezer paper so you've traced it onto your freezer paper again what's going to happen is when I iron this it's going to stick to that so that then I can go ahead and cut all the way around so that's what I've done here is I went ahead and had my fabric wrong sides together you can also do right sides together or I think Jesse writes on his pattern face to face which is right side to right side I've done the same thing my lining material of choice is the only fun or the Hilliard 600 basically the surgical sheeting which is going to stop things that are point zero one micron so I have these so now what I'm going to do is oh no I'm not I'm gonna cut one other set of these and then I'm gonna go ahead and go to the sewing machine okay so I have cut out the pattern pieces and this is really fairly similar to our very first video that we did the construction is really not considerably different it's just the shape is a little bit different so if you watch that in the first video there's probably no real for you to watch it this time the only thing that I'm going to add is exactly how I put the nose piece in because they think on our original video we were still using the aluminum and stitching through the aluminum and I'm going to show you a little different method for that there's lots of different ways to do it I'm just going to show you the way that I do it so if this is your first time making the mask again here's my little template that was the exact size of the one that I'm making I've cut out two pieces of my lining material I have two pieces for the outside of my mask and two pieces for the inside of my mask if you are using some sort of a fusible pellon or something else perhaps you've ironed it to the inside of your fabric whatever it is that you're using again mine of choice is the Olli so what I'm gonna do first is I'm just going to go ahead and put right sides together or again what Jessie says is face to face and I'm going to I have my quarter inch foot on my machine because everything that you do with quilting is your math is based on that quarter inch seam and you're going to sew that curve people ask well why can't you just put it on the fold so you don't have to sew that seam but it's because it's a curve so a fold is straight and a curve of course is a curve if you're making the model that has pleats in it then you can put it on the fold but of course I'm sewing this curve okay and then I'm gonna do the same thing with this one and with this one since this is my lining what I'm gonna do with my lining is I'm gonna go ahead and take my lining pieces and so I'm actually going to sew through oh whoops sew through four layers and you can I tend not to pin if you are making masks so you don't want to put excessive holes so you would want to use binder clips should probably grab a binder clip to show you what one looks like this is what a binder clip is so they come in different colors and then all its gonna do is just just gonna hold it so that you're not putting pin holes in anything you can get them in different colors and they'll just hold it alright so we're gonna do the same thing now we're just sewing through four layers making our curve making sure that we're staying our quarter inch when we get to that binder clip we're just gonna pull it out possibly readjust if we need to do that alright so the way that I put in the nose piece is this way so let me look here for a second this is this is the top of my mask I know that because of that great big dip right here this is the bottom of my mask so Jessie actually has put on the pattern he has a little drawing there where that goes oh I should remember to tell you you actually have to clip your seams just a little bit don't clip into the seam itself but if you clip it it'll lay flatter so we're just gonna cut in just a little bit a little okay so we're gonna open this up and then what I do when I put my nose clip in is these little coffee things these are the 7 inch ones I cut them in half that gives me my 3 and 1/2 inches it has that tiny little bit of adhesive on it I'm going to come down about an inch and I put this over if you do dress seams if you open everything up then you know you've got all of these holes out to the outside world so instead you want to nestle your seam so your holes so I'm going to go ahead and oops put that in the center like that so that's going to hold it down where it needs to be and then what I'm gonna do is I'm going to take this lay this over the top and I'm going and this is just a little scrap piece of fabric and I'm going to sew all the way around some people have found that what they wanted to do is mark that so you know where that is but for me I feel like I can feel it and so I'm just gonna come in here move my thread out of the way and so I am right on the edge and so I can feel it and kind of see it and so again if you want to draw something so you know where it is you can I'm just gonna come down to the end I can feel right where that is my needle in the down position turn turn one more stitch and again you probably can't see it but I can feel right where it's at and needle down gonna turn it I'm just gonna come back and I'm just gonna back stitch all right all you have to do is you can come in and you can trim off some of this extra stuff here no one is going to see this so you don't have to go super close but you just don't have to have a whole big flap there so then your nose piece is in here and the inside of my mask I do have this funny little seam I'll trim off my little stitches there but you don't see anything else and that is the part that's close to my face because the inside of my mask is red and then what we'll do this is the outside of my mask and again this is the upper part because here's the great big dip so all I'm going to do is I'm going to put this one turn these around so they are right sides together or the way Jesse would say it face to face and I'm going to put those together and again using my binder clip and I'm going to Nestle my seams so that all of my holes are covered I'm going to put my little binder clip right there and then what I'm going to do is I'm going to sew this whole seam across the top all the way down and then we do the same thing at the bottom I'm going to nestle those seams in there put my little binder clip on there and I'm going to sew that seam through all of those layers across the top and the bottom I'm gonna do that really quick and we'll be right back so I have sewn the top seam and I've sewn the bottom seam and so I've got my right sides together and then the only thing I did is at one end you can see that I sort of back stitched a couple times the reason for that is I have to turn this whole thing right side out now if you are somebody who's going to have a filter pocket or something else you will construct this differently but again that's not my method or my pattern because I just want to wash the entire thing whether you throw it in the washer or the dryer or you hand wash it or you microwave it everybody has a different idea about washing and again you just want to do what is most comfortable for you make the decision that's best for you and that's good so you're just going to turn it right-side out and it goes right through there without any trouble at all and then once you've turned it right side out you just have to kind of fuss with it a little bit so what I do then is I go to the iron and I'm going to poke all of those out and I'm going to press all of this nice and flat nice and flat all the way around so that all of my seams what will happen is when you're pressing it it'll give you a nice clean edge and it'll kind of seal any of those holes so you can see that's where my nose piece is this is the outside of my mask all I'm going to do then is to tuck this in and if you find that this measurement is still maybe a little bit too long you can adjust to that just a little bit if you want to because this one you can see all I did was I tucked in about a quarter of an inch and I've pressed that down because that's what I'm going to do when I go to put in my ties so whether it's ties elastic whatever you've decided to do you're going to tuck those in and then you're just going to stop so this closed so that's it there will be some independent decisions that you'll want to make but this is the way that we construct our mask that is a personal fit and one that will last through washings and one that you can wear out and about and have for flu season so happy sewing
