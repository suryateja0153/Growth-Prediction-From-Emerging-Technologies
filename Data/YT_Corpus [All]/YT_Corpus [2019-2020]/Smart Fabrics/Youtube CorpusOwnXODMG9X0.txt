 In this video I'm going to show you how I fixed my current car, spending the minimum It doesn't have many years, nor many kilometers but it still had broken things and other things I wanted to improve. The first one was the trunk’s door, which didn't open I already knew this when I bought it, and as I was told, this happened just the day before I went to buy it It didn't matter to me, and I was even a little happy since in the official workshop they budgeted this arrangement in 250€ it was a common failure and the button was damaged But it's as easy as going to the junkyard, taking that same piece from a car that works and put it in yours. It cost me about 5€ and you only have to remove the rear panel of the trunk, a couple of screws and a cable But if you don’t find the spare part or this happens to you in a different car sometimes it is as simple as removing this cover, and underneath there is a button that doesn’t work because it has broken a spring, then you put in between some rubber, and it works With this the trunk opened perfectly, for about 5€. The next thing was that the copilot door didn’t close So, if someone got there he had to hold it, or I had to tie it with a rope, or better, not get there because it was a danger Here my first solution was to hit it hard, more and more but that didn’t work, so I went back to the junkyard and bought a lock or mechanism Taking it out is quite simple, it has two metal wires one hooked to the inside handle and another to the outside one you remove 3 screws you see when you open the door and normally you take it out from inside the door you have to remove the panel When it's out, you just have to check that you haven't broken it, that it still works and you put it in your car same process, but the other way around This cost me a little more, about 30€, and it was super dirty, obviously, but at least the door already closed So I came back from the junkyard with the door closed The following is something I wanted to improve, or change, the seats didn’t fold enough and I wanted them flat, because when I was behind there was no room to leave your feet and I didn’t like it The best thing is that you can do this with a butter spreader and a Torx key, which is cheap material I'm explaining it in detail, but it doesn't have any mystery it's just because someone may be a little scared to see how so many pieces come out of the seat What you have to do is to remove the plastic protector on the side of the door, which is fastened with a screw Now, you move the seat forward and see that underneath there are 2 other screws, to remove the back In this case it's plastic, if it was leather you would have to uncover, which is actually what comes next But don’t worry, all this is reversible, no need to cut fabric, or unseam or anything, it won’t be noticed later The seats have like rings below, or sometimes plastic tabs, which make the fabrics fit one with the other You separate it and roll it up a bit, like someone who lifts his jacket up a bit Under there, there is a screw, just on the side where we have removed the plastic, which holds a plate this is what makes it stop and prevents the seat from going further forward or down Once you remove that screw the plate is loose but to get it out and so that it doesn’t act as a stop it is necessary to dismantle practically the whole seat It's very simple, there is a screw that holds the back that is, the backrest, you take it out and move the backrest forward so you can remove the plate It's like a washer but oddly, all it does is annoy don’t think that the seat is going to work badly or anything like that Now we have to reassemble everything put the plastics we have removed, the screws, especially the one that holds the backrest join the fabrics so that they aren’t wrinkled and put the back, the protector As you can see, the seat is still blocked in the normal sitting position, a little more back but the funny thing is that if you want, you can fold it forward, but not to this point as before but completely flat, so you can to put your feet or have more cargo space "Now I have a table" The ideal was that the two could fold down, and they can, but in the driver's seat you have to remove this which is the height adjustment lever I'm not going to tell you the whole process because you just have to remove this cover, remove this screw and the rest is to remove the piece of plastic remove the fabric, etc., the screw, the plate and that’s it With this and removing the driver’s headboard or throwing the seat far back enough the seats would already be flat, and you can put a mattress or feet, it’s cool The only thing I was missing was a little table And right in the junkyard, next to my car’s model, there was a minivan that had this type of table But I had to look for one that wasn't too loose or broken because it seemed people tried to pull them out with their teeth They go with rivets, so you have to use a drill and use it for a while until the rivet breaks and you can take it out As this seat has nothing to do with mine, I took the piece of cloth where the holes were made I bought an aluminum sheet for about 4€ to reinforce the back of the seat because I didn’t want the table to be flimsy I also reinforced the anchor points of the table because I saw in the junkyard that most of them split here because they were very soft as standard, look Then I applied cold welding, which mixes two bi-component elements and this holds even to weld metal Installing the table was quite easy I just had to pick up the fabric, copy the holes in the metal board and also in the back of the seat Then we make the holes, put the screws and table set Well, you have to use the welder to melt a little that part to fit the support and also take into account that there are going to pass the rails of the head But I was lucky and had a good time I cut the screws, because they were too long and put two nuts, so they didn’t loosen The table was super rigid, it won’t sound when you drive and when it's raised you can leave the phone the fun things is to be able to use it as a support for tablets or things like that without having to install gadgets It either serves you as a mirror, in case someone wants to make up behind, or to watch videos or eat some chips Next thing, I began with the mechanic part. For this, you raise the car with a jack, which can be this one or the one you carry where the wheel and a keg The car was practically perfect I think it was the best of all the ones I've bought, not a leak, not a looseness, not a worn rubber... it had always been in the garage and all the maintenance done in the official workshop It was noticeable, I had little to do with it except changing the antifreeze, because it had nothing it was practically empty, at least the tank, but the radiator was fine But I didn't just fill it or simply change it because I saw that in the tank there were some dregs or something that and I didn't want that to get into the system I made the typical drainage hole in these plastics with a drill, because they have a lot of holes but there wasn't one where the antifreeze was going to drop and it would have flooded with liquid Once I did the hole, I opened the plug, you can it remove entirely and it comes out a lot and dirty everything or you can have patience and take it out quietly If you remove the top cap of the radiator, it comes out as if it were the Niagara Falls and you end up in a moment, which is what I did in the end because I had put a plastic right underneath The antifreeze was brownish, it wasn’t at its best but usually when you buy a car they told you "this can last you 150,000km or 200,000, or forget to change it” But no, this is not so, the cleaner the better for the radiator and everything, so it doesn’t break Like the deposits in the tank, which in this case seemed little but if they are fat they can go to the water pump and if it is plastic like some BMW and it can break the engine in a heat So I took out the tank to clean it. It's quite easy, they usually have a hose hooked with a clamp, a couple of screws holding it and it comes out, below or above. To clean the deposit, you take it to the faucet, fill it with water, empty it and so on a lot of times until there is nothing left If you still see that the bottom doesn’t come out use a brush which doesn’t scratch because otherwise dregs will stay more easily in the future But this is nothing, I’ve seen stones in a friend’s car, mud as if it was a flowerpot, the radiator ducts plugged and even so the car continued working perfectly This is because in most Japanese cars the antifreeze tank isn’t like the typical were water goes to pressure and all that but they are overflowing systems, thus, what overflows from the radiator ends up there, if not, it isn’t used After leaving the interior perfect, I cleaned a little the outside because I couldn’t see the marks of the levels when I looked through the hood, being transparent plastic and on top dirty, they weren’t noticeable so what I did was marking the minimum in red and the maximum in black then I mounted it and filled both the tank and radiator For this I always use a homemade funnel, so as not to stain the engine What I realized is that there is a better way to measure the level of antifreeze without even opening the hood by the air intake on the right, you can see the tank perfectly and also the black strip indicating it is full Another thing I wanted to be able to control was if the car warmed up This is usually seen by the temperature of the coolant but in the picture only the typical warning light comes out, in case it overheats What I did was changing the original radiator cap for one with thermometer It has a copper probe inside so you can see it when you open the hood. There was nothing more to do to the engine The only thing, removing the noise from the timing belt, listen. For this you just have to apply rubber or plastic hydrator apply it a couple of times and it stops making noise This way the belt will also last longer, but if it is damaged, it won’t be magically fixed Maybe the dirt also influences in the sound, I don’t know but the engine had a lot, so I wanted to leave it as best as possible It's something I usually do before touching anything on the engine and in fact, before changing the antifreeze I gave it a small pass The key to get it right is to use a lot of rags or wipes which are cheaper, and clean it by hand, which is a bore, but the result is much better Then, if you want to remove most of the grease and embedded things, I use a steamer with distilled water Not the typical water hose, but water that doesn’t conduct electricity I've already made a very detailed video of this, so I'm not going to elaborate on it just clean it and then hydrate the plastics This way you go from seeing something like this when you open the hood, to this I think it changes a lot the opinion you can have of a car when you see the engine like that, I like it better Then I had to clean the car outside, thoroughly, because the roof was getting worn It's made of polycarbonate and you could tell by the windscreen area When it's very dirty, I usually do it in 2 steps: first, you go to the gas station, throw 1€ in the washing machine and do a first wash It is important not to do it in roller machines which in the end leave the car full of micro scratches and later it gets dirtier and worse when the sun impacts it, so it’s better to do it yourself with the hose Then you take it home, or where you don’t bother others who are waiting and there you finish cleaning with a bucket and rags I use a trick now. Before I took gloves to clean the car, which cost 2€ each and ended awful what I do now to save money is using girl's socks because they are super soft, worth 1€ two pairs or even less and serve to clean the car without scratching it It's important they are winter ones, fat. Instead of costing 2€ a glove, they cost you 20cent, more or less When you have a worn roof or any other plastic thing in the car, it doesn't matter how much you clean it because when it dries you notice the wear again. The solution in these cases is usually to sand everything with a very fine sandpaper and lacquer it again but for 1cm of roof as is the case, it isn’t worth it. What you can do is wax it but with a wax which isn’t removed as soon as you wash it or it rains 4 drops, but one that lasts indefinitely they're often called ceramics or things like that in this case it doesn’t have a specific name, Walili says in the can, and it can last you years and if you have the car in the garage even more I applied it on the roof, in the headlights, in the back ones too, well, in everything that is plastic which in my car is even the rear windows, not all the entire glass, but the smallest piece You apply it with a sponge or 'pad', how it is usually called, and it remains awful it seems that it is all greasy You let it dry, and when it can no longer be removed passing a finger you take a very clean cloth of microfiber and rub. It'll be hard, the harder it is the better because it'll last longer, so to say Rub until you remove the remaining wax, but there will always be wax covering the micro scratches To do it in the ceiling the best thing is to take a chair or something that doesn’t move because you are going to make force, I used a log, and look how it is, it looks crystal and perfect If you have time and patience, you can use this throughout the car, both the body and paint so that it is protected and lasts longer I only applied it where there were scratches to disguise them, because polishing it makes the paint wear off and I prefer to do it only when there are more serious scratches With this you can notice the scratches a little less and I'm fine, I don’t want to paint the whole car for that nonsense The interior, even if it doesn't look like it, is the cleanest of all the cars I've bought so far And yes, it is still dirty but it was no big deal The knob and steering wheel were especially worn, or so it seemed but cleaning the steering wheel with wipes I removed most of it, leaving the leather as if it was new even changing the touch So I cleaned it conscientiously, since it had marks that looked like wear but it was simply dirt I really liked the way it was, until I got to the junkyard and saw another new steering wheel "Wow, that steering wheel, it is super clean and beautiful, it seems newly upholstered" So I cleaned the steering wheel of the car for nothing, well, to use it clean for a few days In principle I didn’t intend to change it, but after seeing this which was perfect, I had to buy it It's very easy to remove just remove the airbag by removing the 2 side screws disconnect a couple of cables, this with the battery disconnected because otherwise it can go PUM! and then remove the central screw It's pretty hard to remove it, I show you the result, you have to pull towards you and that's it When going to pay they asked 150€, and I said but how is that possible, and I was told it was for the airbag so I disassembled the airbag there and they charged me 30€, only for the outer ring If you think about it, they sell leather covers worth half of that, so having it already made, perfect, is a bargain To mount it in do the same the other way around but look at two things, that the wheels are straight when you take out the old wheel and that when you put the new one they haven’t moved, otherwise it'll be turned over And second, that the cables's box, the steering wheel's sensor and all that, coincide with the holes because otherwise the back moves and you break it Then you put in the airbag, the 2 screws and connect the battery Move your face away a little to start the car, just in case and test the horn works, the power steering, check it goes straight and doesn’t make noises... it is very simple to do and if you do it with care everything will be perfect I am delighted with the change, because it has been cheap and easy. Now I have a steering wheel that looks like a current car, and the other looked like the '90s which I have nothing against, but I like this more The knob couldn't be fixed, or I didn’t feel like doing so because it seemed it had been chewed by a dog, I went directly to the junkyard and looked for one but there wasn’t any, so I ended up going to Mitsubishi because the Colt is compatible and quite cool but with so many trips to the junkyard looking for other parts, I found the one I needed in perfect condition To remove it you pull up, be careful to put a camera in front, and then put the new one down by squeezing With the new knob and steering wheel, the car felt differently, it didn't look like it was 10/15 years old but 5 at most As for the seats and upholstery, it was really good, I just had to give it a pass without having to remove dirt the roof had makeup marks but they were removed easily, but in general the interior was great it even had an air freshener which I took off because they always hit the front glass In the rear glass, the curtain was a little dirty, but with ammonia and water in equal parts, it comes out well everything that is cloth is cleaned very well like that I took the opportunity to clean the edge of the boot, where the water and dirt falls from the ceiling so it becomes very dirty and you can notice it a lot when you open the hood besides you could rub your clothes if you open the hood to close, so it’s better to clean it With this the car was practically perfect, except for one thing I couldn’t find, so I had to do a botch It was the rear-view mirror, which had duct tape on it. I spent months going to the junkyard to look for the mirror, but there was no way there were cars that didn't even have doors And you'll say, through the internet... I looked at it and they were more than 100€ I wasn’t going to pay 100€ to remove a piece of insulating tape, because I really only wanted that I have never folded the mirrors and what I didn’t want was to see this I began to remove the tape and underneath there was plaster, yes, the one they put on your arm when it breaks a mess... sometimes it is better not to touch when you break something, because you break it more than it was because to remove all the remains of plaster you can’t imagine how long it took, more than fixing the mirror or cleaning the whole car, it didn’t come out in any way I tried with the girl's sock, with the rags, with polish and by rubbing some things came out, but others not even by rubbing with a stick so I just removed the superglue, because it also had that, filing with a razor if I removed some paint nothing happened because then I was going to paint it Especially on the inside I filed enough or scratched it so the glue would grab, because I’m using glue but not a normal one, you’ll see later When I left the mirror clean by doing the same they do with the parquet floor, removing the first layer with a knife it was very whitish from so much filing and product To recover that, the first thing is to clean everything well, I did it with the steamer just like in the engine then hydrate the plastics or use the heat gun, to recover that layer by joining with the plastic inside Then, with a mini-drill and the polishing head I removed what was left of silicone, plaster or the magic mixture they had applied, but I removed a little paint As I had gray sprays of other cars, I tried first with one from a Honda Jazz and it didn’t match but I also had an aluminum spray from the rims of an Audi and that was perfect I applied more layers to make it look good, and the glue I used was same as the one for the table which even welds metal, is bi-component and all that I applied a lot, both at the base and the side to hold as doing 2 forces, from top to bottom and left to right when I placed it in its position I put some tape, not to leave it like that but to hold it while it dried After 48h I removed all that, cleaned the little glue the insulating tape had left which was nothing compared to the plaster, and this is the result For my taste, great, it is a fix of 1€, not noticeable except if you want to fold it, but the mirror is still functional you can move it with the inside lever, so what else do you want? Well yes, I want a mirror in the junkyard or a cheap one, but when I find it Meanwhile, I'm very satisfied with the repairs, but especially with the car. I changed it for a Smart fortwo, the small 2-seater and with this I enter anywhere, I park it anywhere I go everywhere, but with more power, more engine and more seats In the end the maintenance costs of any car are X, if they are X+1 or X-1 is a little bit the same And I know I've said it before, but when I buy a car is the idea I have, I want to keep this car for a long time that doesn’t mean I won’t buy another, restore it and so one, because in the end is something I like to do and I think you do too For those who don’t know my channel, I’ve done this other times, with other cars, in much worse condition, this is quite well
