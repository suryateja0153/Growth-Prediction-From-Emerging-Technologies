 hi I'm Philip ink here at fat quarter Shoppe studios and in this video we're building on the last two videos the first one talked about concept and storytelling in creating a fabric line the second one talked about drawing and doing the digital renderings of the fabric really developing the fabric turning those concepts into life in this video I want to talk about the actual producing of the fabric which is a whole different beast and it's where we really get into sort of more of the engineering side of what I do the creative is essentially done but I also really love this part so come join me well I'll show you how you actually produce a fabric collection so the first thing I need to do is communicate to the mill which is in a different country goes through a middleman which is my production guy at free spirit who is the greatest person on earth hi Alberto so he's my number one production dude at free spirit and he handles all of my fabrics and talks to the mills and Ganim just gets the fabrics to turn out the way I want them so there's a couple of things we have to manage in this situation one is my printer will never ever print out the color I actually need it to be so I print out the designs as I've designed them but I have to put together a package that communicates the actual color I want each thing to be so I have to communicate the colors to the mill in a way that they understand them and the best way to do that is to give them actual swatches to match to so the way I do that is I send out these sheets that have actual Pantone chips on them and I don't always use Pantone colors it's a brand of color matching chips that you can buy sometimes I use paint swatches from the Home Depot sometimes I have to cut a swatch off the shirt my mom is wearing that day if it's the right color so people wear a lot of black in my studio so that I don't attack them for their clothing swatches but so what I usually do is I put together something like this so this is for this print in my true colors and each print is two colors and so what I've done is taken each print and here's the colorway the the SKU number so they know which one I'm talking about the color name of that print and then I put the two swatches of the colors that are gonna appear in that print so I have the SKU name what the print number is in this case it's PW TP 1 4 8 and these are the each of the 12 individual colors of each print which I have printed out here just for reference for the mill but this is what they're actually matching to so the mill is gonna match to each of these color swatches and that's what's gonna create the colors in the fabrics because my fabrics are screen printed I can actually call out very specific ink colors that they can custom mix to create exactly the color I want and so when I get those fabrics back I actually don't go back and look at the swatches many people do but I don't make sure that they're exactly match to what I sent I look at just what's in front of me and say do I want to buy that fabric is this the best possible version of this color because things change when they when you get the actual swatches back from the mill so what I typically get back is something that looks like this so it has my fabric on it and it's marked on here the color number and you can see across the top here that I also have the color numbers so this sort of medium teal is color number two this one's color number three color number four so if ice want to say to them you know this green is a little too yellow I go to the green swatch up here and say change color number five to either a new swatch or I can say make it to stay bleuer or I can say make it 10% darker so there's a lot of ways that I can communicate how I want them to change that color but what I'm trying to do is give them the most easily comprehend Boleyn structions that I possibly can because again I'm dealing with people in a different country through a middleman although Alberto is the greatest that has to communicate all of these differences in order to get the perfect piece of fabric so a couple of things I'm looking at when I get my swatch like this so this is actually a swatch from 108 inch wide backing fabric and even though that fabric the repeat on it is 36 inches wide by a hundred and eight inches tall this is all I get to look at so they can't actually print a whole bolt of fabric for me in order to just look at for color so they end up printing just a small portion of it that a representation of the fabric that I have to look at and say is the color good is it sitting right they mark for me where the selvage is going to be so I know which direction it's facing to make sure that's been done properly or the way I want it and so I look at all of this and there's little tiny things that I'm looking for in here of course color number one is the color right is it sitting on the fabric right is anything jumping out is something too gray is something too bright even though there's no such thing as too bright but I'll ask myself the question just in case and so another thing that I'm looking for here is print quality so I'm looking at is this color sitting next to this color creating any issues and what we call that so it's kind of hard to see in here unless you're right up on it but where this blue this sort of aqua color is meeting this really yellowy green color when those two colors overlap it's creating a small section of green where the yellow and the blue meet is creating a small little green line that's what we call trapping it's where two colors overlap and create a third color so I have to look at that and say because there's a certain amount of that I can't get rid of the only way to change it is to make one color darker so it covers it make one color lighter so it doesn't affect the other color so much so these are all the little decisions that I'm gonna make once my swatches come in and there's a little bit that I have to consider here so most of these swatches that I'm looking at we're actually pulled or screen printed by hand they weren't printed on a machine so I know there's a small percentage of that that's gonna be fixed when it's actually produced properly on a machine on a large screen printing machine where the actual machine is making an even run of ink across the screen so this is done by hand so there are portions of it that maybe the pressure was a little off because it's human error right so there's a little bit of that that I have to consider and know that some of that will get incrementally better so there's a lot of guessing in this in all reality we do quite a bit of guessing that some things will improve there are oftentimes something that are just not fixable and then I have to go to a totally different I either have to completely change a color which actually if it has happened many times twice in recent history once on a line I did called tabby Road where I got the colors back and it was awful my fault I had I don't know if I was sad that day or what but that line came in so drab and pale and washed out that I had to recolor and restrike off this is what we call a strike off restrike off the entire collection which is not something I want to happen because it introduces a whole bunch of variables takes a whole bunch of time and you know every day that we're set back in production can be an extra week in what it takes to deliver the fabric so we have to be really smart about how we tell people and communicate what we want this fabric to look like so that we don't have to go back and change things it's very rare that I go to a second round of strike offs I might on one or two pieces but typically never more than that after designing about a thousand fabrics I pretty much know what I'm getting into although it did happen on my newest collection homemade was another one where the actually the pink colorway which is called morning came in really gray and Mavi originally that that machine on the pink back or the aqua background it's sort of a pinky orange machine on an aqua background was originally on a gray background and it looked so dreary that I couldn't take it and so we recolored that print sent it off again and it came back in pinks and aquas and oranges and was a million times better so it's rare but it does happen that we have to send something back and have it completely redone so once all of these are approved I send my approval so you can see on this piece I have approved TP that's me I sent this back with my signature that it was approved and then the production starts so they take these samples back free-spirit has a copy in their offices and the mill has a copy in their factory and every yard of fabric they produce has to match back to this swatch that has my signature on it so it's and if it doesn't then we can return the fabric essentially and say nope didn't turn out right that's never actually happened but I imagine that's how it would happen I don't actually know because it's never happened but they match everything after that back to this swatch with my signature on it and that's what ends up in the stores so after all of the strike offs are approved and all the fabrics done I've sent in at this point while all this production is happening so I've approved everything it's all been sent in now it's gonna take about 12 weeks to actually print the first run of the fabric so this is before anyone seen it this is the fabric that I get like four or five months in advance in order to make all my samples and my quilts and show you how it's gonna look that's all of this yardage that ends up on the color cards that goes out to the stores so they can see what they're buying hopefully hopefully they're buying it and so one thought while that's happening that's when I sit down and I write out in a way that people can read it the story of the fabric collection that's when you know I'm designing the selvages have already been designed so I designed the selvages I determine what shaped the dot on the selvage is if I want it to be a different shape or if I want it to be a circle sometimes I like it just traditional dots on a selvage sometimes I like it to be a little shape of some kind it just depends but this is when I start designing the quilts and working with other pattern designers to say hey I've got this fabric line coming I want to see what you do with it and I send out digital images and then they send me pictures of quilts that they've designed we start determining what's the best way to show the fabric line this is when I start I actually send a list of the order the fabric will be in in the bundles so I don't know if everyone does this but I do I like to I like to control the order that all the fat quarter bundles or design rolls or charm packs the order of the fabrics in that I think shows it off the best because sometimes if they're all jumbled it doesn't really tell the story of what the full color spectrum looks like I like to determine which pieces on top of the bundle and which is on the bottom of the bundle because when you're in a store when you're looking online you can't always see inside the bundle so I make all those decisions while the production is happening so when the sample yard age my advance yardage actually comes in for me to start making these things I'm all ready to go and in the meantime I've probably also started the next fabric collection at any given time I'm in some stage of five different fabric collections so I'm at one time like currently at home I'm drawing my fabric lied that'll come out late next year I have one fabric line that I just approved strike offs three days ago my true colors fabric collection which is going out to stores right now and they're the shop owners are looking at them so Kimberly's probably looking at it saying who is this - like a pink character do I even want to buy this of course she does she loves me so she's looking at this right now trying to determine if she's gonna bring it into her store there's homemade which is currently being printed and getting ready to ship in March and there's monkey wrench which has only been in stores for a few months so that's actually six I think I don't know it wasn't counting but various stages of fabric line so I am on Instagram and social media talking about the line that's in stores even though I have these four other lines backed up waiting in the wings in different stages of production getting ready to go so it's not like we design a fabric line wait for it to come out and then design another one it's a constant cycle that's always ongoing so I'm always drawing something marketing something selling something producing something so all of these things are all happening simultaneously on various fabric lines so if you ever come up to me if you see me like at the grocery store or Best Buy or something and you come up to me and you say Oh blah blah blah your new fabric line and I stare at you blankly it's because I'm trying to figure out who you are what part of the industry you're a part of and what you're talking about because if you're a home so er you're talking about the one that's in stores if you're a shop owner you're talking about the one that comes knacks that no one's seen yet if you work at free spirit or the mill oh you're talking about the one after the one the shops are looking at that no one's seen yet and if you're talking about either of the last two then I'm super freaked out because you're in my head cuz I'm the only one who knows about this so if I stare blankly for a minute before I catch up to who I'm talking to and what we're talking about that's why so thank you for watching my video on the production of a fabric line I hope you watched all three because they all sort of link together the concept and and storytelling of a fabric line the drawing and designing of a fabric line and the production of a fabric line asked of a bunch of other videos that I filmed for fat quarter shop that are up here so check out fat quarter shops YouTube channel
