 Tthe way this works is you have the data here and this is a grid we've already gathered. So, if I want to look through the concrete I will project it on top. First of all, I'll look at the surroundings so the iPad picks up the space, then I will look at it. The data is placed on the concrete. So what if I want to mark? what I'll do is I will make it transparent and I can also unpin it, which means I can throw away the grid paper. This allows me to go and point and mark. What I can also do is flip it and now you can go and look at it. And I can also pull out the rebar.
