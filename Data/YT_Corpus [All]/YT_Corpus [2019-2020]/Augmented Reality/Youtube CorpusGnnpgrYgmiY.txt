 (upbeat electronic music) - My work in AR is really has to do with working with sight specific art and it's really because I'm interested in the kind of, interdisciplinary play or the interstitial, you could say interstitial play of the real world and the virtual world. It uses the cellphone camera or a camera to synchronize a virtual three dimensional space with the real space around you. And that allows you to put in objects, to put in characters, to put in a scene and so on. And have it be synchronized with the environment around you. There aspects of this that are magical and wonderful and in a sense seductive in some way and then there are practical reasons why we need to explore, it's important to explore media that is developing around us. I feel that because it is a very new and somewhat astounding and revolutionary medium in some senses. I want to you know, a sense chart it, at a very early stage. Explore it, see what it can do. Experiment with it. (upbeat electronic music)
