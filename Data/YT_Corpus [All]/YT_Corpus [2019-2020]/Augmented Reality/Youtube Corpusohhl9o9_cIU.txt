 hello my name is yuna jung from industrial design department of chist in this presentation i will be presenting about vika there is a projected a local branch for interactive kinetic art this research was conducted with hanjong kim jaiwanyun and oliveirotechna we can support the creation of the interactive kinetic art in the form of a layered picture frame it is changed according to the human behavior and environment using sensors and motors during the creation of interactive kinetic arts the students can experience engineering computational and artist aspect all together however it is difficult to design and make due to the various elements also many tools and workflows increase the difficulty are usually sculpted around the physical and digital environment several tools have been introduced to support a similar task but there is a lack of research examining an integrated prototyping environment we present wika beca is an integrated environment supporting the whole creation process in a single workspace a projected ai system with mobile device efficiently make the interactive table top the protected information connected with physical components enables the programming and simulation on the workspace physical components are applied from the initial place of prototyping using an airplane and this supports the iterative trial and error process by freezing the workflow with wika non-export can create the interactive kinetic feature frame to begin the user sketches the idea and decides how to interact and test the connection of components by placing the sensors and motors on the airplanes the next step is to set the rules for logical relationships the user can set the input condition with physical sensor and user can set the corresponding movement of the motor and then the user can test the rule while examining projected barriers on the workspace the rule can manage it by removing or adding blue airplanes the user can define a desired path of mechanism by adjusting the location of airplace and the scan of the projected image the user can save the component location with airplays and we can give our guiding information about the conference position and how to fix them once making is done the user can test the interaction and movement it is possible to further change or replace the rule these are some examples made by novice user using wika because basically implemented with javascript apis you can check the detail in the paper and we have a lot of possibility to improve weaker in the aspect of system configuration detection technique hardware component program method or limitation of expression but most important point is to provide seamless workflow with thoughtful interface design and through the user study we can check that we can enable the participant to concentrate on the outcome of the task even without a concrete concept an additional study is necessary to verify the effect of the integrated environment and workflow this is the end of my presentation thank you for listening
