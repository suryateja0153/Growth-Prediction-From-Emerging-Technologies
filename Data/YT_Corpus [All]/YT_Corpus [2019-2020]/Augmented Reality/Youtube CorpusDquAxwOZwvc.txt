 [   ] We're going to get this thing moving, get out here on the road, and see what this Augmented Reality really looks like. Huh? What do you say? [   ] Augmented Reality is a great feature. It actually takes a live street view and puts it in the cluster display and if you've got a navigational route in there, you will see a big set of arrows that tell you - This is the time to turn right now. Let's set up our NAV here. [Computer Voice] Guidance will start now. [   ] It's beautiful. I'm looking at exactly what I'm looking at in front of me, right here. I mean, the colors are vivid, the grass is green as it can get the water is blue as it can get. I love how when you get closer to where you've got to make your decision. These blue arrows get bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger. It's like, right here! Right here! Right here! Can't get lost in this vehicle. [   ] [Computer Voice] In four hundred feet. [Computer Voice] Turn left. The arrows get bigger and bigger, bigger as they come to you. and it's like her voice gets louder too, At the same time, - We also have what we call navigation rendering. And these are audio props that tell you when to turn. And the closer you get, the louder it gets. [Computer Voice] In three hundred feet, make a U-turn [Computer Voice] if possible, at Fisher Brothers Road. Wow! So it's a U-turn - it not only shows you the arrow - it curves the arrow - so that you're clear - you have to make a U-turn. I miss turns all the time. Not in this Baby I won't! Hey, got a nice little geese crossing right here. Yeah, you guys take it easy. Take your time. Just chillin in a Cadillac. [   ]
