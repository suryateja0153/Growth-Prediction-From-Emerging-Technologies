 Dear Fellow Scholars, this is Two Minute Papers with Károly Zsolnai-Fehér. In this series, we talk about amazing research papers. However, when a paper is published, also, a talk often has to be given at a conference. And this paper is about the talk itself, or more precisely, how to enhance your presentation with dynamic graphics. Now, these effects can be added to music videos and documentary movies, however, they take a long time and cost a fortune. But not these ones, because this paper proposes a simple framework in which the presenter stands before a kinect camera and an AR mirror monitor, and can trigger these cool little graphical elements with simple gestures. A key part of the paper is the description of a user interface where we can design these mappings. This skeleton represents the presenter who is tracked by the kinect camera, and as you see here, we can define interactions between these elements and the presenter, such as grabbing this umbrella, pull up a chart, and more. As you see with the examples here, using such a system leads to more immersive storytelling, and note that again, this is an early implementation of this really cool idea. A few more papers down the line, I can imagine rotatable and deformable 3D models and photorealistic rendering entering the scene…well, sign me up for that. If you have any creative ideas as to how this could be used or improved, make sure to leave a comment. In the meantime, we are also now available on Instagram, so if you wish to see cool little snippets of our latest episodes, including this one, make sure to check us out there. Thanks for watching and for your generous support, and I'll see you next time!
