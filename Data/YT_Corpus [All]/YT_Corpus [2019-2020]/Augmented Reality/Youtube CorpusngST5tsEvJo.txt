 we were eight years old when the wall came down effectively and then as you evolved as a student and as a resident here what gave me the idea of making this virtual reality I thought like the Berlin wall is one thing in which it's not there anymore and with augmented reality you can actually show things which are not there so I thought this is the perfect way of showing the past and generations came along after you now people were for 13 14 17 years old are they as fascinated by it a you were at that age they're very fascinated because like now they can actually really experience this part of history which you cannot see anymore and be in it and really see how the wall was built up they can have a narrator's explaining the whole history of the wall so it's a fascinating way of beaming somebody back in the past so you have to actually scan the floor right huh I know there we are there we are Wow that's what it looks like then now drop that down slowly and there we are that's where it was yeah you can see where the metal pieces are they mark where the wall was standing and now put a backseater again what about older people who have seen this now do they come to you and talk about their own experiences absolutely like it's a trigger for them telling their life stories and and it's very valuable because like they have so much to tell so many valuable stories and touching stories so now we're doing something with the people who wished to be able to do it then we can just go through the wall now we on the bonus trip oh yeah yeah we've come out the other side now from the virtual reality to reality and here you can see one of the guard towers think about your country and all that it's been two in a hundred and twenty years we went to World War 1 World War two the end of World War two the division of this city and this country and now we're facing a kind of unknown future again because there's so much turmoil about immigrants coming to Germany and what's going to happen to the essential kind of quality of the German experience I think like one thing I learned in school was that history something with that's repeating especially like after certain generations people forgets what war was what's suffering means and it's very important like to remind the people like beam them back and tell them what what the reason why why the wall was there and why we should be happy so I think this is a beneficial thing to remember people to remind people not to do the same arrows again hey NBC News viewers thanks for checking out our YouTube channel subscribe by clicking on that button down here and click on any of the videos over here to watch the latest interviews show highlights and digital exclusives thanks for watching
