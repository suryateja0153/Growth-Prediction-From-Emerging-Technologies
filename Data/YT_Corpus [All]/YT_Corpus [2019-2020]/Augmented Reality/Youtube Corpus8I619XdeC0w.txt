 This summer we launched a whole new expansion to the Kennedy Center campus called the REACH. As part of the reimagining of the center and the space we thought it would be really fun to offer families a whole new way to experience the center as well. Along with our education artist-in-residence and renowned children's author Mo Willems, we teamed up with Zappar to make an augmented reality tour via a free-to-download scanning app. We wanted to give families and kids a new way of exploring, interacting, and learning about the different aspects of the Kennedy Center and the REACH through spatial storytelling guided by none other than Mo's infamous pigeon. So this is all about entertaining and engaging active learning through doing, with digital discovery. The results have been fantastic and we've gotten great feedback from visitors of all ages. We're so happy to have decided to go down this path and develop this augmented reality app with Zappar and we know that visitors are going to continue to enjoy it for years to come. "Wow there's so much cool stuff about this place. Let's go check out something new!"
