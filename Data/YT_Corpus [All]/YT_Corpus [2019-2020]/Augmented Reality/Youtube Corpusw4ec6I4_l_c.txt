 in today's video we're going to build  a simple ar game using reality composer i'm going to open up the reality  composer app create a new project   because we're building a game on top of the  floor we're going to choose the horizontal   plane as the anchor and if you're not familiar  with the software and how to navigate it you can   check out my first video which i'll link up  on the top right and also in the description and now i'm going to import the 3d models that  we need so first i'm going to get the cans in that looks great the cans are ready  next i'm going to import the toy and finally i'm going to bring in the tennis ball we want to add physics to these  objects so that it would behave   realistically when colliding with other  objects so for that i'm going to select   each object so first the tennis ball  go to the inspector tab and click on   participates under the physics section i'm  also going to set the motion type to dynamic   and i can choose different materials to simulate  different behaviours also collision shapes and now we can start adding in the behaviours so  behaviours is essentially animations or movements   or actions in the scene for example you could  use preset behaviours like tap and flip which   flips an object when you click on it and you  can also start proximity and juggle so when the   object is close to the with the camera is close  to the object the object will jiggle we're just   going to create a custom scene the first behavior  we're going to create we'll call it ball throw   and this will be the behavior of throwing the ball  when you tap on it and each behavior comes with a   trigger and an action sequence a trigger is what  starts the behavior and an action sequence is the   set of actions that happens after the trigger is  triggered so there are various kinds of triggers   you can choose and because we want to throw the  ball when we touch it we're going to click the tap   trigger for this action and the affected objects  would be the ball because that is what we want to   detect the tap on and for the action sequence  we want to add a force when we tap on the ball   so for what for that we're going to choose add  force which applies an impulse force to the object   and we're going to choose the angle by dragging  in draw now when i tap on the ball that's great   so the second behavior we're going to add now  is that of the obstacle moving around the cats   so for that i'm going to create again a  custom behavior here we want to trigger   the enemy movement right when the steam starts so  we're going to choose scene start as the trigger   and for the action we're going to choose  orbit so the orbit action creates an orbit   for the object to move around with respect to  a center so we're going to click orbit and the   affected object would be the toy we're going  to choose this can as the center of the orbit   click done and now let's again test this out  as you can see it's rotating around but it   only goes through one revolution and it's not  facing towards the direction it's moving at   so we're going to fix that by going to the  orbit action and clicking align to path   and also clicking this icon so that the  action would loop forever so now we've got the   fundamental actions of the game set we need to add  one more thing which is the game ending behavior   and for the game ending behavior we want  the game to end when the ball hits the toy   so as the trigger we're going to choose  collide as a trigger so the collide trigger   detects when two objects collides with each  other so i'm going to click on collide and the   affected object would be the ball. For 'collides  with' we're going to choose the toy so when the   game ends first what we want to do is create a  pop-up text showing the user that the game ended   then after a while we want to bring up a reset  button so we need to bring in a text object that looks great now i'm also going to create the  reset button for which we'll just use a sphere and i'm going to add another  text and change the text to reset   i'm also going to add in a different color  for the reset button i'm going to go to   the inspector and choose material color i'm  going to choose red and we only want these   game over objects to appear at the end of  the game not at the beginning of the game   so what we need to do is add another  behavior we're going to name it scene start   and then the scene start behavior we want  to hide all these game ending objects when   the scene starts so we're going to click the  trigger as scene start and the action as hide   so as the affected objects i'm going  to click on the sphere the text   both of the text and click done so now let's go  back to the game ending behavior so first thing   i'm going to do is click on the show action and  choose the game over text as the affected object   and then i want to wait for a while  i'm going to click the wait action   so this first shows the game over  text then waits for one second   and after this the next action i want to add is  that of bringing up the reset game button so here   i'm going to click show again and this time i'm  going to select two objects which is the sphere   and the reset game tags i also forgot one  thing we also need to hide the game over text   before bringing up the reset game button  so i'm going to click another hide action right after the wait let's test this out  and see if this works so the game is playing   if i hit the toy button you can  see the game over text popped   and next the reset game and the  final thing we need to do now   is to create the game reset behavior for  that we're going to create a new behavior   and over here all we want to do is reset  the game when the users taps on the reset   budget which is a sphere so for that we're  going to use the tab trigger and choose the   sphere as the affected object for the action  sequence there's no default reset game button   but we're going to choose the change scene action  and select the current scene as the affected   object and what happens here is that when the  user taps on the sphere button the change scene   action would trigger the same scenes to start  again which is essentially like restarting the   game with this initial settings now if i tap  on the ball and it hits the toy like that game   over and reset game now if i click the reset game  button you can see the ball resets its position and that's it hope you enjoyed it  and for more tutorials like this   do subscribe to my channel and next week i've got  something special planned for you see you then
