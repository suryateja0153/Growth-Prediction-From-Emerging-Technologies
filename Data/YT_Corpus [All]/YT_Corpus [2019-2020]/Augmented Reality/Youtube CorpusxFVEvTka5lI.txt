 Augmented reality on the web I'm here at Cafe Chez Vous and I want to talk to you about something that can be a really interesting area to explore, you might be familiar with augmented reality on native apps on mobile devices and there have been a lot of articles written about those lately including with Google Maps but there is an API for developing augmented reality in web pages called the WebXR API and I think this is could be a really interesting area for you to explore and could be an important part of web development in the future the API right now isn't stable it's undergoing some changes but it's really interesting I just worked on a plugin that implements a Google Codelab where it uses that API and it's interesting in that you can use your phone's camera and you can see your room but then you can click and place an object in the room at the Google Chrome Dev Summit they were talking about an application of this where if you were browsing for something on an e-commerce site like a chair you couldn't use your phone and see your room, tap, and then the chair appears in your room, there are a lot of applications for this that you can imagine but I think this is going to be a really interesting part to work, part of our industry to work in and could be really good to explore this especially when the WebXR API becomes a little bit more stable let's take a look at an example here's an example of augmented reality and WordPress this is a WordPress plugin that implements google Codelab let's start this by clicking the link and you can see it's using the phone's camera to show in this case the table in front of us and I'm moving this around, you see what's called a reticle that anchor that gives us a place that we can place a virtual object on a surface in this case the table, you can see on clicking that anchor, the reticle, the teacup appears only in the phone but this has several applications one they mentioned at the Chrome Dev Summit is e-commerce and you can look at for example sofa like they mentioned and how it might look in your house before you buy it but this is an interesting Codelab that Google developed and I think it's a really interesting thing to explore and could become an important new direction in web development, and it helps web development achieve parity with native apps and stay relevant and compete with all of native apps and what they can offer it'll be interesting to see as this WebXR API develops and I think it's a really exciting area to work in.
