 hey guys Andru Edwards here and in this video I'm gonna give you a look at one of the coolest products that I saw at CES 2020 it's got artificial intelligence features built in powered by an ARM based processor by the way this video is sponsored by arm find ARM based chips powering AI and devices like smartphones autonomous cars wearables basically if you see a device or an application that incorporates artificial intelligence there's a good chance that it's powered by an ARM based processor if you'd like to learn more about arm be sure to hit the link down in the description below but now let's get to the product every year at CES companies try to showcase why smart glasses are going to be the next big fit well this year was no different one product that stood out of the crowd though was unreal these are the N real light makes reality glasses and right off the bat what sets them apart from other products on the market is the price mixed reality for 499 dollars now these aren't out just yet but unreal says they'll go on sale early here in 2020 and here's how they work rather than doing all the processing in the headset itself which is what makes a lot of mixed reality headsets look almost like a full-on helmets and real light uses your smart phone to do the processing instead now it'll only work with mid to high-end Android devices that launch with iPhone support still being kind of up in the air we're in the end real light glasses actually feels natural since they offload processing to your phone they're both lightweight and comfortable and this also allows the glasses to be foldable like any other typical pair of prescription glasses or sunglasses and this means they are very portable as well and as for how they work I have to say I was impressed imagine your smartphone homescreen or any app that you might open blown up super huge right in front of your eyes then imagine having the ability to manipulate everything you're seeing here in your real world using the smart phone that's in your hand as you look through the glasses you can open any app including video streaming apps like Netflix or YouTube or Disney Plus and you get basically the equivalent to your mind of a 100 screen right in front of your eyes anywhere you go by the way so you'd be sitting on a plane on a train on your couch or laying in bed if you're wearing the and real light glasses you have the same experience available to you no matter where you are now as I mentioned any Android app can be brought into mixed reality but what's even cooler are the dedicated makes reality apps that developers are making for the and real light and I'll give you examples the most fun one for me was a zombie attack game she put the glasses on you launched the game and instantly inside your field of view and again it's mixed reality so you can still see your real environment and things are just added into it so in the room I was hanging out in all of a sudden there was a pack of zombies that were slowly coming towards me now I had my phone in my hand and what I needed to do was flick on my phone to throw explosives and blunt objects at the zombies and I had to turn and look all around me to make sure I was getting them all because if you're focused over here on your left there may be zombies coming at you from the right that you need to turn and pay attention to as well the glasses do have speakers built-in as well so you can hear either side what's going on which gives you cues as to where you need to turn but again super fun and a unique gaming experience if you're not gonna get on a typical smartphone game or even a game you play on a computer or any other screen this is the power of mixed reality this is why people have been so excited about seeing this come down the pike for such a long time and this is why I'm excited that it's finally here or almost here with the N real light now everyone I talked to at CES who was able to demo the unreal lights seemed to be as impressed as I was including those who wear prescription glasses thanks to the magnetic inserts that you can get that snap right in to the headset this is a product that absolutely shows the power and magic of arm technology and again the N real light will be available early here in 2020 and they'll cost four hundred and ninety nine dollars when they go on sale so there you have it guys that was your early look at the end real light mix reality glasses let me know what you think is this something that you'd be interested in picking up it's a price point a little too high for you does it sound about right and what kinds of mixed reality experiences would you be excited to try let me know down in the comments below and I will meet you there for further
