 NASA's new augmented reality software for drones brings the sky to life with data. This innovative application uses computer-generated graphics to show airspace activity over real-world environments. It displays key flight information to commercially available headsets to provide users better situational awareness of the surrounding area. Fed by real-time data from NASA's air traffic management system for drones, the software features an interactive gestural interface and gaze-tracking capability. Tested during hundreds of live and simulated flights, it allows the user to identify aircraft that can't be easily spotted with the naked eye. Making it possible to visualize the spatial relationship of multiple flight paths, alongside objects and structures in the real world. It displays flight information such as identifiers, positions, flight geographies, and current states, as well as updates for emergency flights and special operation areas. Developed at the Airspace Operations Laboratory at NASA's Ames Research Center, this augmented reality software will help drone operators, managers, and public safety officers successfully navigate the evolving airspace of the future.
