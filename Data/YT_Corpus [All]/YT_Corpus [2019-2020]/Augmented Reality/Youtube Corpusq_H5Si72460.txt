 virtual reality and augmented reality are two sister technologies that are one of the pillars of the i.t of the future their main characteristic is their ability to immerse their user in a new environment virtual reality refers to any technology that immerses its user in a fully computer-generated environment creating a multi-sensory experience the environment can be a reproduction of the reality or purely imaginary in fact content of this type allows interaction with a purely virtual world augmented reality on the other hand consists of adding digital content to a real environment it offers the user live interaction possibilities and is generally based on a 3d environment in recent years these technologies have accelerated thanks to more affordable and more performant technologies driven in particular by the development of the video game industry edf's r d always places the user at the center of the design of new applications with these technologies therefore those technologies are integrated in the user environment safely intuitively and close to the real use case they are used in particular for preparing maintenance sites designing new installations and training within nuclear power plants these technologies provide access to protected environments that are difficult to access such as a virtual tour of reactor buildings on the customer side it's used in particular as a sales tool to simulate commercial offers such as the installation of photovoltaic panels or energy diagnostics combined with other digital technologies virtual and augmented reality opens up a wide range of possibilities we can speed up the production process for digital models and develop augmented reality applications it makes the models capable of understanding the environment around us finding our location and identifying objects these technologies offer an interface to access spatialized data in information systems for example related to the life cycle of a building or to data measured by sensors in the environment it's a way of painting the world with data of freeing ourselves from physical limits in order to build a sustainable future together [Music] you
