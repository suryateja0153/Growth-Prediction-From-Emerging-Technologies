 Hi everyone this is Brad awesome update and flipgrid if you go in and select to scan a QR code you have a QR code automatically the video will play an augmented reality so wherever it is if it's on a screen it'll play on the screen if it's on a poster I'll play on a poster and if it's on a table to play on the table wherever you have it so pretty coldness will work with all videos that have been created in the past any questions let me know thanks for watching
