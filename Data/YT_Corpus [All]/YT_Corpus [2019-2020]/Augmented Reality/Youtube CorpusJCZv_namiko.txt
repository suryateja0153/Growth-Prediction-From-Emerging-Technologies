 Allison Hirth, Reporting: SANDBOXES AREN'T JUST FOR KIDS ANYMORE. Melissa Currie, Asst. Professor, Landscape Architecture: We are teaching our students how to manipulate land form. Allison Hirth: BUT THEY'RE STILL FUN AND EDUCATIONAL EVEN FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS LIKE JUSTIN PALACIOS. Justin Palacios, Graduate Student: I love being here at Tech and being able to use this, you know, great facility. Allison Hirth: THIS ISN'T AN ORDINARY SANDBOX. IT'S AN AUGMENTED REALITY OR AR SANDBOX. ASSISTANT PROFESSOR MELISSA CURRIE DIDN'T INVENT THE TECHNOLOGY, BUT SHE'S THE ONE WHO BROUGHT IT TO TEXAS TECH'S LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTURE DEPARTMENT. Melissa Currie: I wanted to use this tool to help them visualize what contours look like, what topography looks like, how we change topography when we build things, what happens when we add water to a site, to further demonstrate in a more hands-on way how they can design in three dimensions. Allison Hirth: CURRIE TEACHES SITE ENGINEERING. SHE SAYS IT'S THOSE STUDENTS WHO USE THE SANDBOX MOST OFTEN, ALTHOUGH IT'S IN THE AG PAVILION AVAILABLE FOR ANYONE TO USE. AND HERE'S HOW IT WORKS: THERE'S A CAMERA, A COMPUTER AND A PROJECTOR. THE CAMERA SCANS THE SAND AND THE COMPUTER CREATES A REAL-TIME TOPOGRAPHY MAP. THEN THE PROJECTOR, MOUNTED ABOVE THE SANDBOX, PROJECTS THAT MAP ONTO THE SAND'S SURFACE. Melissa Currie: So, as you dig out a trench, the contours change to represent that trench. If you build up a mound, or build a flat spot, those contours will change accordingly. Allison Hirth: THE TECHNOLOGY AIDS STUDENTS IN BETTER UNDERSTANDING DIFFICULT TOPICS LIKE GRADIENT DRAINAGE. Melissa Currie: There's a lot of moving parts in trying to explain that and for students to try to graphically depict it on a plan, and the sandbox really helps because they can actually see those contours on that particular land form. Justin Palacios: It's hard to see that when you are drawing it out and are doing it on the computer so being able to come in here and use this sandbox has really helped me be able to understand the way the ground works and how water sheds are used and the topography lines. Melissa Currie: I think that that's one of the best uses of the tool is to help students flip that switch and, 'Oh, I get it. It makes sense.' Especially when you see the map and then you take that away and they see it actually on the form-- that 'ah ha' moment really happens and I love that. Allison Hirth: AND SINCE THE SANDBOX IS SO EASY TO USE, IT'S A GREAT TOOL FOR OUTREACH TOO. CURRIE HOPES IT'S AN ADDITION TO HER DEPARTMENT THAT'S VALUED FOR YEARS TO COME. FOR TEXAS TECH TODAY, I'M ALLISON HIRTH.
