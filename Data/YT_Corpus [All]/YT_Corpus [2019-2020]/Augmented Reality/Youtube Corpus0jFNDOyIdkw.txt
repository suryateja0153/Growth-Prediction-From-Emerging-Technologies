 hello this work is about augmented reality for television specifically it is about I think what a mandatory Rd is for all of them I deliver a plan to television of manager who can be a lot of things for example you can immerse fear was into an interactive storytelling space but the neighborhoods fantasy watch the break out of the confines of the teaser as well as the green game aspect of the peaceful world as far as of the televised show the action in extent the living room to create a sense of actually being fair in this context it is important to ask what AR TV is to understand the potential of AR for television as a sustained girl in this area on solid foundation we make the contributions in this work first we conduct a survey on augmented reality for television in order to understand past efforts critical ideas and approaches the examiners perspectives augmented the next reality from which we extract key characteristics or AR TV and identify areas of investigation from EDX related to air TV such as ambient media or interactive television we then introduce a conceptual framework called the augmented reality television continuum which is a two dimensional representation space for concerts devices systems and applications of material television inspired for the one dimensional reality virtuality continuum of mirroring casino from 1994 we are some dimension of medical TV from augmented virtuality TV a complementary concept with recovered loyal organs of the brain all matter is composed of four steps in step 1 we start from the perspectives and definitions of Joan Rivers of method and mixed reality systems examine current classifications and overview research and technical changes for the field this tab enables us to provide an asset question.what our foundations for AR TV instead we perform a targeted literature survey of previous work implemented augmented reality on television to understand what has already been achieved in AR TV having established the foundations and understood the state of the art we proceed to identify the relevant connections between AR TV and other areas of investigation forty years such as multimedia ultimate reality is ambient media for interactive television this tab enables us to understand what makes AR TV a specific kind of television experience in step 4 wadn't of our key components for AR TV which we build into our new concept of frame on the augmented reality television team in our paper we present the chronological examination of perspectives on augmented and mixed reality from which we identify key concepts implications for AR TV and connected errors of scientific investigation from TV X and EMS for example in 2016 or another Summa characterized of materiality as an in form of meaning by adopting this perspective augmented reality systems are implementers of a specific kind of ambit media which characteristics from both the real and the virtual world the implications for AR TV is that augmented television is a new medium for new digital media experience and the connected TV acts and dialects area is ambient medium please see the paper for more details our exploration has revealed many key characteristics of their TV for instance we saw other reality virtuality convenient introduced by miracle Akishino in 1994 represents the most accepted go-to source for the final AR and to distinguish materiality therefore we adopt the reality of a child to continue as the basis for our conceptualization of augmented reality TV however while the continuum of member micachina can be successfully employed to characterize thinking of mixture written view and what job it's one dimensional design is insufficient for out of the pose instead we need to consider the specifics of the television watching experience for a physical device that is placed in a physical leading role in our work we recognize the fact that each of these two and it is world and TV can be independently of mandala while the optin is perspective we propose and introduce a two dimensional set of framework augmented reality parish horizontal axis film from a completely real through completely virtual environment is actually Milgram in kushina's reality but reality continue that applies to the living room environment or the world the particle axis going from completely physical to the big TV device to fully virtual talvez content is our adaptation of near provocation is convenient for television together these two were several access Clarke choice the various ways in which a television experience can be augmented in terms of the world the televised content on both instances of varying content can carry flexibly flow between the living room and the teaser for the living room and the TV said can independently flow across a respectable team walk from real departure we call the space the augmented reality television continue to demonstrate the TV Department sceptre framework we enumerate the vapor barriers types of air to be generated from the mixture of the two axes for example the conventional world and TV represents the compassionate TV viewing experience were neither the TV not the rooms are amended the corresponding point is the bottom that of all acceptance face another example is the conventional world conventional to be bought with on to be a plantation in this category contextual augmentations are shown on the TV screen examples include call for a TV audience silhouettes teletext and picture-in-picture in this case foundation is perceived to be off the TV screen for instance on the world accounted in front port next to the TV sir lieutenant ations meanwhile handheld devices help out the displays or be the projection base technology in the conventional world virtual world typical degree or speeds going to be is now needed because content is presented either in the virtual TV frame or without a TV frame or together examples include TV projected on the world and what a storyteller appears to be sitting in a living room in the newer space and other cases where the living ruins of meta director this often requires specialist and officer faces present in the living room for meaningful alignment of the computer-generated graphics the worst experience of mended world but watch a conventional TV screen the world can be augmented and so can be the TV set are the bindings of on TV or off TV a foundation the view of augmentation of each component world and TV positions implementations of this degree at various locations in the AR TV continued yet another category is achieved when the world is amended or the physical TV is virtual like industries the virtual world national TV connect in examples the augmented virtuality of the reality virtual the continuum of mirror additional a virtual world is amended by basically said as a use case imagine watching your favorite TV show as a live video feed of your physical to the screen while wearing the virtual reality headset but still being physically present in the same room with friends watching the same is up to the screen finally the physical to discern this replaced by one or more larger screens this includes the scenario what about you to be is allowed to watch a lot of conventional himself in order to recreate a real TV viewing experience in a virtual stakes please refer to our paper for more discussion and examples in our world we found that ard we can be many things and that prior work has implemented in various ways from on TV augmentations to often content visualized here of 93 and enabled handheld devices health Mountain displays world and room size projections and Holograms all shown from the various perspectives and key properties of the examined we can include out of materiality TV reveals itself as a specific vital experience emotion media service and gateway or teleport Santa while the specific implementation may vary what is important is fun is to have a rigorous basis to structure future research and developments to be consistent in all terminology and to communicate our understanding both planted reality television precisely by relating to problem frameworks power continuum is an attempt toward such a system a patient where it's more work that lies ahead such as understanding better the difference between cognitive and mixed reality TV further exploration of augmented virtuality television and connecting your framework to other projects such as XR access for people with disabilities we thank our sponsors for making thank you
