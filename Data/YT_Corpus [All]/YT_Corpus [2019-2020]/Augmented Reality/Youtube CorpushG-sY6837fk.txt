 The representation of real-looking human characters in mixed reality applications is not only some means of fancy high-tech games. Processing information for us humans is more natural when we can interact with another human, should that one consist of flesh and bone or just bits. There are many situations where the most convenient way of asking for advice or getting that piece of advice is some verbal and non-verbal interaction that we are used to from the moment of our birth. Let’s take for example the problem of indoor navigation. Finding a room in a business center where we’ve never been before could be challenging. Door plates and arrows on the wall or lines on the floor can be helpful. Welcome to the Department of Automation and Applied Informatics! Nevertheless, following another human – either virtual or real – is an instinctive behavior. Thanks to this kind of naturality, reaching our destination becomes quick and easy. Just select the destination, room, or person, and a virtual assistant comes to accompany you, shows you the way, and keeps up a conversation with you. An accompanying virtual human can give the impression that we are not alone along with the sense of safety and security. This naturalness allows us to apply this solution in other areas like industrial facilities, logistics depots. Or to some extent, in the field of training employees. The results of our research on virtual and mixed reality are used as building blocks for different kinds of applications. Ergonomists are working constantly to find how to adopt new technologies, as we know that anyone’s best performance can be called forth if we can use the serving technology in the most natural way.
