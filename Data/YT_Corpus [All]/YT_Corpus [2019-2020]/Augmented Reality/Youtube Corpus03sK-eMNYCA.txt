 the united states air force's ability to fly fight  and win in future conflicts comes down to training   luke air force base trains more fighter pilots for  the u.s and allied air operations than any other   air base in the world at luke air force base  the 56 fighter wing's job is to make sure that   every hour our students spend flying results in  them being that much closer to being ready for war   our training is successful because we work  constantly to replicate an environment as   close as possible to real-world mission situations  we execute our best tactics in the air then come   back and spend hours debriefing we reviewed the  game tape to see what happened what mistakes were   made and how we can do better next time this  is where the core of our learning experience   happens in the debrief after the flying is done  but current debrief methods force us to translate   the three-dimensional flying environment into a  two-dimensional medium whether it's a whiteboard   computer screen or a laminated map we've invested  heavily in new tools and capabilities to execute   tomorrow's missions in the air but when it  comes to tools used to analyze and learn from   these missions we have not kept up with the same  pace of innovation it's time for that to change   in partnership with arizona state university's  luminosity lab we have developed next-gen debrief   a concept that brings cutting-edge tools to  the important work that happens after the   flying is done next-gen debrief uses augmented  reality to project a three-dimensional scene   inside the debriefing room allowing pilots to  view scenarios from any angle utilizing the   same data that is already collected by aircraft  instrumentation we can give mission participants a   radically new perspective the scene can be shared  between multiple participants in the same room   or even across multiple locations  or bases for a distributed debrief   next-gen debrief changes the game for our  training but the possibilities for this innovative   environment does not stop here the same augmented  reality technology being used for next-gen debrief   could transform and accelerate how we plan  for and even how we execute air force missions   flying time and advanced combat aircraft is very  expensive next-gen debrief is an important step   we can take today to make sure that we get  the most out of every hour spent in the air and
