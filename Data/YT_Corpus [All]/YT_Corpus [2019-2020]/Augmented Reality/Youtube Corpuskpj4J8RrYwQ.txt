 my name is Momo I am artist and educator and a researcher and we have a studio together and my name is a cleaver man I'm also an artist and educator and we're interested in using technology as code and electronics but to create artistic work we're doing a residency here at the Google arts and culture lab our goal was to create an app that allows you to capture elements in the world and then paint with them in space we've been exploring a our augmented reality and in particular using a device like using a phone or a tablet and moving it in space and so you take a photograph in the photograph lives in that location you move back and the photograph sort of hovering in space we're really excited about augmented reality because he opens up a way for artists to tell stories especially weird cuts is a tool that allows you to take photographs to basically cut up the world it's a different pieces users can download the app and capture elements in the world and put them in space in completely new and unexpected ways so it's great to be here at Google and for us that's right [Music]
