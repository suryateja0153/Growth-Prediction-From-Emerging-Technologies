 I'm the difficult one that in my own computer because demos so I'm Ally I have a software engineering instructor so I teach other people how to code and today I'm going to be talking about augmented reality in JavaScript so a little bit of what we're going to be talking about so we're going to talk about what augmented reality is and then we're going to play with a ton of different demos after that we will talk about the different types of augmented reality this there are out there look at some of my code I wrote snapchats filters in 47 lines of JavaScript so we'll be talking about that and then we're going to talk about the future what augmented reality will look like in a couple years so to define augmented reality you're taking the real world and then you're adding something to it you may have heard a virtual reality and that's creating a whole entire new world in 3d I think I've rented reality is really powerful because you can take the real world and then add something to it and that's really powerful it can be for any sense but the one that you see most often at least for now is visual so you'll have the real world and have some visual element added to it so I am talking about augmented reality not because it's something that I do in my day job every day but because I like art and code and I have a blog and so one of my blog posts about two years ago was about how to build augmented reality apps in JavaScript and it turns out that a lot of people thought that I would be interested in giving talks about it which I am but I am NOT somebody again who writes augmented reality apps all day so I at that point didn't feel like I was an expert at it and that is actually the reason why I'm talking about it I was so intimidated by this idea of augmented reality I thought that you would have to know all this math and all this wild code in order to implement it and then I did more research and it turns out you can just do it in JavaScript and it's basically dressed Dom manipulation is my whole entire application I think that's really really at the time I was seeing a lot of apps coming out that we're using Python or C++ and they were just command line scripts that you could run and add filters to your face based off of that and that's cool but you have to be a programmer probably to run those applications you have to download them you have to have Python running and if you build something for the web anybody can use it just by going to a URL mobile apps are cool as well but again you have to download something and the development is a little bit higher barrier to entry so javascript makes development accessible and it also makes applications accessible and that's why I wanted to use it to build an augmented reality app so there are so many different applications for augmented reality already art which is one that's really interesting to me and I think augmented reality is going to be a really huge forefront there there is gaming as well you may have seen something like Pokemon go we'll talk about that a little bit and then businesses are starting to use it as well so it can be a pretty powerful thing for marketing or just trying out elements as well there and then there's also more - so we'll talk about some of that so one of the most common questions that I get asked about augmented reality is one of them will we use augmented reality everyday and I know for the average person in the audience maybe you don't use the augmented reality everyday but for a different demographic mostly teenage and girls and young woman it is something that they're using every day and my demographic is and so I want to talk about that and how powerful it already is there's going to be even more of a future for it but it's already massive so let's look at some demos so the first two are snapchat and Instagram Instagram is so culturally dominant right now not just the app itself but the world around it like I go to events and they have Instagram installations so that you take pictures of it and market the event for them it's a huge piece of it and then also people buying ads on Instagram so that one is absolutely massive they have the stories you can put on filters on your face there and then snapchat who they pretty much just knocked off to do it so snapchat allows you to take images and put them on top of your face and alter your appearance that way those are kind of the original ones a fun part of this talk is that you get to see my face a lot which is especially fun because I'm super jet-lagged but that's fine so one of note that you may have seen recently especially on social media is called face out and what it does is it takes your face and does some machine learning on it and then spits it out in different ways so the one on the bad side the woman one is a tweaked version of my face so I don't even know what they changed about it but they made it way prettier and it's super impressive and then the other side is the male version of my face apparently so I'm glad that that didn't turn out that way for me there's also face tune which is a visual editing software for your phone and you can essentially take what people made careers off of airbrushing people back in the day and you can do it in a couple swipes which is really powerful but also kind of terrifying you can try on makeup so sephora's website allows you to try on all sorts of different makeup on their website so I don't own blue lipstick but I was wearing some earlier today IKEA allows you to take furniture on their app and try it out in your own living room so you can see what a piece of furniture would look like dimension wise in your own home using this augmented reality application Tesla they're using augmented reality for manufacturing so they're using it to test out their cars before putting them out into wild they're also experimenting it for it for the dashboard on your computer trying to have different panels on there using augmented reality as well this is one of my favorite AR applications from 2010 so it was a while ago Zack Lieberman is an incredible artist and hopefully this will load Oh No let me try this it looks like I got disconnected No there we go okay well I guess that is not working sorry about that um so also museums museums are doing really really cool things with augmented reality so both for extending the artwork in their museums but also for displaying their content in different ways for example walking tours it used to be that you had like headsets and would type in numbers at different pieces of art and they would tell you about it now using augmented reality you can just walk to different places and based off of your location you'll hear different information about the artwork so that's really really incredible as well the Louvre also made it so that you could project their artwork no matter where you were in the world so in Los Angeles they had a warehouse and they converted it into the Louvre by doing projections there so that's really cool as well Pokemon go you may have played this I didn't really but my mom was really into it even though she didn't know Pokemon so that was really fun you could capture these little animals that were out in your world and that game was huge for a while and there are other games like it as well now welcoming rock climbing is one of my big hobbies and people are using augmented reality to create climbing routes and climbing competitions which used to be static you used to have a root cellar and you put put tape up and that's how it usually is now as well but they're making it so that you could have routes using augmented reality instead which allows for much quicker and dynamic route setting so that's really cool as well and then it even goes beyond that so they're using augmented reality for some medical purposes as well so in order to increase contrast for some people who have visual impairments so you can see the different lighting that may help some people see certain settings better so it goes beyond this artistic and marketing world as well so there are a couple of different types of augmented reality the first one was marker based so marker based augmented reality was the very first type and you would have something that was almost like a QR code or this hero marker here and you would project something based on top of that so that was pretty limited at that time but a lot of augmented reality is still based off of Merkers so something in reality that you're adding something to usually your face but there are other things as well that you may add augmented reality now on top of marker less augmented reality is similar but just no marker so you're adding something to the world without an item that you're adding it on top of so something like Pokemon go or something that's location-based would be marker less augmented reality there's projection based augmented reality so something like that climbing about where you're actually projecting something out into the real world using augmented reality superimposition based where you have something that's being added so this is a combination usually with marker marker less so something like IKEA where you're projecting the couches into the real world would be super imposition based so I want to talk about the ways that you can build augmented reality apps now so one way that you can is through something called a frame and a rjs on top of it the really cool thing about it is that you can build augmented reality apps without even using javascript you can just rate essentially HTML code and have augmented reality apps built out you have to use a marker like the hero marker that I showed you before so it's a little bit limited in that respect those fancy is like the face based I'm going to do reality but you can build something like that where it projects a cube on top of the hero marker and ten lines of HTML that's the only hot code you have to write it's pretty powerful and then I have been using tracking j/s so tracking jeaious is a computer vision library for JavaScript and what were allows you to do is detect things in the real world and then you can use the coordinates of that thing in the real world and build on top of it so I did face recognition but they also have color based recognition or parts of your face or your hands or something along those lines and it's pretty lightweight it's not a massive massive library by means and it's super accessible so they've got great documentation and it's not impossible to write by any means you don't have to do a ton of the math yourself and so we're going to go ahead and look at my app in my code so I'm gonna switch over now so hopefully this works on stage but it's giving me a flower crown and you can see that and it does for anybody that is on the projection I can switch it over to bunny ears as well and it gets my face there and this whole application was 47 lines of JavaScript so I'll show you that code now so starting off with the HTML it's pretty basic the most difficult part of this whole project was actually stacking a canvas on top of a video element that turned out to be a little bit tricky but the fact that the CSS was the hardest part says a lot I think so again I have a video element and which is how my videos track taken from my webcam and then I have a canvas on top of that the canvas is where the actual filters are projected on top of so I have those two elements there and then my JavaScript so at the beginning it's just a bunch of grabbing things from the Dom that I'm going to be you interacting with and then I'm creating a new tracker for the faces on the screen and then I'm grabbing the flower crown and the button I'm taking of the image so the image it's a going to be an image object so that I have all the information about it that's gonna store my actual crown itself and then as the bunny face as well and then I have the X Y width and height so I have to scale those in order to make them fit better I have ability to change pictures and then I have the ability to change to the photo parent and the bunny ears as well these coordinates here are just scaling for the images I found two random PNG x' on the internet that were the flower crown and that bunny face and so I had to edit them a little bit in order to be the proper size and so this is just scaling them so there are x and y coordinates and their width and height so that by default they fit on somebody's head pretty well that was again the most time for this because I was just tweaking that but again not a huge amount of code here and then some more tracking code so the first one is set initial scale this is how big the box around your face is so behind-the-scenes tracking j/s is making a box around where your faces and so this is saying that it's going to be the initial scale is going to be 4 if it's ten instead that it's a lot bigger and the crown goes way outside of my head if it's one that it's a smaller crown so that's essentially what it's doing there the step size is how often it's going to track to see faces on a screen so this one is two and so it's a pretty fast it checks for new faces pretty frequently on that video but you could speed it up so that it tracks even faster it's a little bit less performant and that way or I could slow it down so it's only looking for faces every couple seconds or so and then the last one is how picky the model is so there is a model going on behind the scenes so that it's doing all the stats of whether something's a face or not it's a binary classifier I'll talk about the algorithm a little bit later and this is just picking how picky that model is so if I had turned this even further down so less than 0.1 then it's going to get all these false positives and thinks that things think things that are not faces our faces so I built this code in my instructors lounge which has whiteboard walls and so there were pictures on the walls everywhere and at first before I set this edge density it kept thinking that all the drawings behind me were faces and they were not so then if I make it way more picky than it won't see my face in some lighting like this or backstage or something along those lines so that's just something to play with to decide how picky you want the model to be I'm making it track the actual video element on that page so that's how I set that up and then here's the actual tracking so it's an event listens for the tracking event when that happens it's going to clear my canvas that I already have there I'm gonna make it blink then for every face that's in that event data it is going to draw an image on it so that's all that I had to do most of this isn't even code that's related to tracking Jes and I have this fully working AR app I think I reformatted it so it's 51 lines of code but it's normally 47 Oh the three comments that's why I didn't even code golf this if I had codes often anybody use code golf so code above is when you write code that's as few letters as possible in order to like pass some code challenges I have fun doing that but I didn't code golf this so I did full of variable names and multiple things on lines and all that so I could have made it less than 47 lines of code if I really wanted it to but not a huge amount of code for a pretty cool app so the algorithm so tracking j/s uses the viola jones facial detection algorithm facial detection of the facial recognition are two different things so facial detection is face knock face facial routes recognition is whose face is it and so this uses facial detection so it's just a binary classifier this is a face this is not a face well it looks for is that people's eyes region are further back so it's darker than the rest of your face and then the nose and forehead region and cheekbones are lighter because therefore closer to you and so it's looking for that essentially it sends up the pixel values in any rectangle and uses that pixel value of dark and lightness in order to check to see if something is a face or not and then yeah so that's the viola Jones algorithm right there it's used by a lot of facial detection software not just tracking Jay s so that is tracking Jay s and it has again a lot of other classifiers as well so it has ones for different colors it has things for your eyes or your nose or something along those lines if you wanted to make your filters even better I tried to add the dog filter at some point but that got too difficult and like the nose and eye gaps was too hard to implement so I definitely would recommend using those pickier models if you were trying to do even more complicated facial filters there are also a lot of other libraries out there as well for doing this other JavaScript libraries and the reason I didn't go with them is just because the documentation was worse and so that's a big call to action for open-source maintainer to make sure that your documentation is good but what comes next so i've sigma augmented reality is going to be huge in the future for a lot of different purposes i think that the artistic applications are really powerful in Washington DC where I used to live there's this art museum called the art tech house and they've had tons of augmented reality exhibits there and so definitely a lot going on in that world and then as far as the code goes I think that it's going to become more and more accessible so Mozilla is coming out with mixed reality EP eyes that are built straight into the browser so you don't need to download another library or anything like that you can build augmented reality apps and virtual reality apps straight with this browser API in addition there's also the face step detection API that one's implemented in certain versions of Chrome and that detects whether something of the face are not already just in JavaScript and just in the browser itself so again you don't have to download anything else it's really incredible how fast this is evolving and how much is already getting built into the browser and it's even going to go further I think in mobile applications as well the thing with websites is that you're really limited by webcams and webcams aren't necessarily the the best harness or of information in the world and so there's definitely going to be more with mobile apps than anything else in addition the marketing concept context is going to be really interesting as well trying on clothes trying furniture trying all different sorts of things go right into your browser so that's all from so these are more resources as well so if you're interested in reading up about any more of the heavy math side or anything like that I've got all of these linked my slides are online Alex Patel /ar - JavaScript they will be up online as long as history goes essentially unless I you know delete github or something for some reason so they are online you can look through all these resources on getting started with augmented reality there's the viola Jones paper right there based off of that mathematical algorithm that I was talking about that tracking j/s uses for facial detection there's also the tracking j/s implementation of the viola Jones algorithm my article on using tracking j/s to make the snapchat filters a awesome code newbie episode if you saw Sirhan doing fan line heroes earlier she has another podcast and it's a really really awesome episode about getting started with augmented reality zap lieberman who is my favorite augmented reality artist I have his Instagram link there and then also some of the libraries that you can use as well and keep in touch if you want to reach out I'll be at this event tonight and then tomorrow as well but you can also find me online if you want to talk more about augmented reality and thank you all so much you
