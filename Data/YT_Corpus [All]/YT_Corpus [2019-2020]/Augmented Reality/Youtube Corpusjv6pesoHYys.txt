 using the latest tools inside of Adobe AIR oh I created for immersive augmented reality riddles where you explore an AR landscape while learning about your brain welcome to part two of this four-part tutorial series where I break down my key components to my brain spacious in this tutorial I will show you how I model assets with Adobe dimension and how I animated them with triggers in arrow let's get started let's start off in Adobe dimension so up at the top left corner I'm going to go ahead and click on create new this is our main viewer and the three most important keys note is the right mouse button lets you orbit around some right clicking and dragging the middle mouse button lets you pan and then to select stuff in here it's a left-click and drag take a look up here we got our basic shapes and we have models as well as if you keep scrolling we have textures and materials so almost everything that we're gonna be doing is going to be using this panel we're gonna start off with the cylinder so I just click it here and to orbit around again I'm using my right mouse button and we have a nice little cylinder what I'm first gonna do is go to the cylinders radius and turn it down a lot so that we have a nice thin tree next we're gonna go to the number of sides and since I want a low poly kind of look I'm reducing the number of sides of the tree trunk to make it look more low-poly there we go alright cool I'm happy with that let's make the tree part the bushes so you're gonna use a sphere and we're gonna drag it up on here these are called manipulators you can drag along these arrows to lock it onto a certain axis when you're moving yeah we can do ctrl Z to undo and then this is to rotate it along that axis and then this one's the magnet tool it kind of just sticks to a side all right so enough of that let's go ahead and modify the sphere so I'm gonna go up to the radius and turn it up lovely then I'm gonna go to the number of sides and reduce it so that we can really see all the blockiness of our tree asset here something like that looks fun to me cool and I'm gonna actually copy this sphere a couple of times so we'll do control-c control-v to paste it and then I'll be resizing the radius ctrl-c ctrl-v pasting i'm moving it over here and increase that radius ctrl-c ctrl-v I'm gonna move it if you want to move it you can drag you know these arrows as well great ctrl-c ctrl-v to paste I'm gonna push one to the back here and shrink down the radius okay so you have a nice little tree asset modeled here in adobe dimension and that was all using the basic shapes if we scroll down here we have the ability to get to the materials and if you don't want to scroll down you can use these buttons to filter out just the models or just the materials and we have Adobe standard materials as well as some substance materials so what I might want to do is color the trunk with some wood textures so I'll go to the list whatever material here and just left-click and drag it right on to our model next I'm going to apply a metal material to the bushes so they got this nice green one and I love how reflective it is I love the paint material in there I can just drag this on to different parts of the spheres and we're essentially texturing our model of this low poly tree things to note you can modify the exact quality of a texture over here we have our base colors you could upload your own texture if you had one or you can go to a solid color if you wanted and just use that to kind of color code your artwork or we can just use the image but it's really cool that you have these options okay but I'm happy with this tree and I want to use it in augmented reality so I want to show you just how easy it is to get this out of here first select all of your model and you know that it's selected because you see these blue lines form around it and then we go up to the top right corner and there's this little upload button click on it it has the option to save a JPEG PNG or these ones you can export a selected model or you can export selected for arrow that's what we want to do so I'm going to click on export selected for arrow it takes a second to process gives you a little information about how it might take a few minutes but since our model is so small it's very quick it's already ready so we can click on export and I like to save it into my creative cloud library under Adobe arrow and I have a folder called brain and I'm gonna put this under my experience to tutorial and I'm gonna call this low poly tree underscore 2 and save it and right off the bat it's exporting out and now we're done we've made an asset that will work really nicely in Adobe Aero and that's what we'll jump into now we have lots of cool stuff going on in this experience but I want to talk about these trees we got to get these in here so I click on the edit button in the top left corner and then the bottom left corner we get the plus sign I'm gonna go to Creative Cloud I'm gonna go to arrow I'm gonna go to my brain experiences where are they here and we'll go to xp2 and then here are my trees so I'm gonna try this low poly tree and hit open it takes a second to low but we can tap to place it and now we have our object in here and a couple navigation techniques you tap it and drag with one finger to place it you can scale it up and down with a pinching of the screen gesture you can also use two fingers to rotate on your screen to rotate an object and if you need to lift it up to a higher peak like let's say I need to bring it up use three fingers on the screen you drag upwards or downwards that's how you can move it up and down notice what happens is we have a sequence of events we have this brain inspiration and then we have instruction that appears and then we have some assets appear these are using what's called a weight trigger I'm going to show you how we can add our very own so let's say with this tree asset we wanted it to appear and do something at a certain time well we need to add what's called a behavior so tap on the behaviors button here and we're gonna create what's called a trigger and right now I'm gonna make it work at the start so on the start I want an action to happen now these are a bunch of the triggers that exist in this version of adobe arrow right now they're awesome we're going to add a hide trigger and if you hit the play button here you can see what that trigger is going to do and below you get some information so the subject is what object is going to be triggered and the duration is how long medic trigger is gonna take and you have some ways of interpolating it and you can hit check marks so now at the start the animation it's going to hide and then I want it to wait so we click on the actions and I go to the weight tag near the bottom and I want this to wait about three seconds and hit the check mark all right so it's gonna hide it's gonna wait for three seconds and then after three seconds and the actions I want it to show and you can tap that play button to see what its gonna do that duration is pretty interesting so if I increase this a little bit here and hit the play button you can see how it can show slowly which will do for now and I'll hit the check mark so now if I hit the preview watch what happens boom it hides we wait for about three seconds and then it slowly shows and this is how we can create really nice timing to our motion graphics inside of Adobe Arrow next thing I want to draw your attention to is the ability to aim things inside of Adobe Arrow so take a look at the text that says find the riddle notice how no matter where I move my device this text is always aiming at the screen I could be over here and it rotates to follow an aim at me if I go over here it aims at me so how do we do this what we're gonna do now is use this image to create an aim trigger so when I hit preview by itself notice how by default when I move my camera around it doesn't aim at us so makes it really hard to read from an angle like this so to add an aim we go to the behaviors tag with the object selected and we create a trigger I want this to aim right at the start and then the action we wanted to do is the aim which is near the middle here the subject is what object is going to be doing the aiming and the aim target is where it's going to aim at the camera is quite literally this device right now the one that we're looking through so I want it to aim at us and I'll show you what it looks like with with Billboard only turned off and then what we'll show you the other way in a second so take a look on a hit preview boom now as I rotate my device notice how the object always aims at us so it makes it really easy to read text when it's always aiming at us now if we want it to pivot on an axis we go back to that behavior we go back to the aim and turn on billboard only and when we hit preview now it aims at us but it's never gonna tilt upwards so if I go above it it stays kind of locked down which can be a nice effect as well thank you so much for watching part 2 of 4 on the making of these immersive AR riddles Adobe Aero is pretty awesome right well we're only halfway through because in part 3 I'm gonna show you how to import audio and how to create proximity triggers with sound looking forward to having you in the next one see there you
