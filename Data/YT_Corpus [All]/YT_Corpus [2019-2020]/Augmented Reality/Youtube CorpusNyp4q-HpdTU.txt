 In today's world where online learning now is  a pretty big thing, with the AR Pro interactive   app I can just pull the phone out of my pocket and  learn. Hi, I'm Tony. I'm going to take you through   how I drive a golf ball. Today, if I look at a  video to try and assist myself on my golf swing,   it's really not the same as having the real person  there, and the way the application works is we can   work directly with those professionals, capture  all the moves in our likeness in a 3D format   and place them directly with the individuals so  that you can exactly how that athlete performs   and improve your game. Having the ability to  put myself side-by-side with a professional   athlete is pretty cool. You can analyze the  moves that you're learning in real-time,   share the move with friends, and then receive  feedback. It just promotes the learning   experience. It goes much further than athletics. There's going to be ongoing videos that'll come   from the professionals just to go through new  learnings, new teaching, new advice. And that   will constantly be refreshed. Verizon's 5G is  going to allow us to bring those 3D renderings,   holographic assets, so that we can actually learn  better. That's what it really comes down to.
