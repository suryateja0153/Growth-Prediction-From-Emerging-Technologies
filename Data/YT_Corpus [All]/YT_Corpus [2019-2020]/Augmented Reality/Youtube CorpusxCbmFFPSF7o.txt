 [Music] opportunities for careers in welding are on the rise and the demand for more skilled welders from companies is increasing as a new generation of welders take the reins and you're tasked with training or recruiting them you need a teaching tool that's efficient and effective one that engages the students and fully immerses them in the welding experience traditional classrooms don't offer the necessary hands-on experience Welding labs hinder immediate feedback materials are costly and jumping right into working with all the arcs and sparks can be intimidating there is a better way with the Augmented arc from Miller the Augmented arc is the industry's most realistic welding simulation it uses augmented reality a simulation even more elevated than virtual reality to enhance with one sees and here's students perform work on 3d objects and see them overlaid with computer-generated images for a true hands-on experience the specially designed helmet is lightweight and features a large viewing area so students can be fully engaged in their work it's camera and sensor sent video and positioning data to the system computer the computer processes the data creates a realistic image and information based on the students actions and sends it to a heads-up display and speakers inside the helmet the images students see also appear on the augmented arc welding machine the augmented arc output can also be streamed to a secondary monitor or projector for further student and instructor interaction the system also records videos for instructors and students to replay so they can review progress and evaluate performance from basic skills to the most advanced scenarios students practice various joint types in all types of positions including processes like MIG flux-cored stick and TIG welding a tick foot pedal is even available to control amperage during the simulation using the augmented Ark from Miller is just like real welding complete with metal work pieces weld arcs and weld beats then it's happening right there in the classroom and with the free user-friendly instructor software package teachers can customize curriculum develop assignments run reports and monitor each student's performance remotely the Augmented arc is simply an immersive learning experience engage in train those interested in welding in less time and less cost and totally immerse your students in hands-on as real as it can get welding training so they can become the best welders they can be with the Augmented are the industry's most realistic welding simulation solution
