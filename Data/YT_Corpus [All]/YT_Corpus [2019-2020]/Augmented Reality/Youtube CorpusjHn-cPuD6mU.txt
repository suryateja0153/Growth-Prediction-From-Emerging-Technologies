 [Music] how about we start adding some movement and life to our augmented reality creations i've built this scene and i've added a space shuttle very front of it and what i want to do is i want to make that shuttle take off when i tap on it so to make this work first of all tap on the object to select it once and then in the top corner you're going to press the behaviors button now from here you want to add a new behavior so when you tap on that button you'll notice there are a few preset options and one of them says tap and add force that means when i tap on my object a force will be applied and it will move in whatever direction that force is moving there are lots of different options here which opens up lots of creative possibilities for your own objects and animations in reality composer when you add a behavior to an object for the first time you might turn on dynamic physics for that object so tap on update and then the object will behave as it should do in the real world i've now got a couple of panels at the bottom of my screen and from here i can choose the amount of force i apply to my rocket so i can make it go higher or lower and i can also check what object is actually applying to so if i choose a different object i could add that force to any object on my scene or multiple objects but for this i just want the rocket well i'm happy that my force and my tapping target are both on the space shuttle i'm then going to press the ar button and i'm going to press the play button at this stage it will place the object in the real world and i can move around but when i tap on that rocket it's going to go flying off into space well not quite it kind of bounces and then falls down on mine but perhaps you can adjust your own force to make it a little bit better the possibilities for animations and forces in reality composer are huge hey thanks for watching that video now if you enjoyed that and you want to find some more quick tips for your ipad or to use in your classroom do me a favor and press the subscribe button down below that will really help me out and it will help you keep up to date with all the latest tips and tricks on my youtube channel
