 Well hello ladies and gentlemen today I'm coming to you from beautiful Santa Barbara I'm bringing you the world's a our augmented reality gaming system okay what I have today is the world's they are augmented reality gaming bow-bow edition it says up here there were two of these at Walmart two different there's two different systems I should say this is the bose system the other one I think was maybe like a toy or laser gun or something I can't remember really what it was but I knew they had like 20 of these there and they keep marking the price down I think it started this thing started out probably kind of expensive but it's finally it went from like 350 all the way down to a dollar 50 and I thought there's like 20 of these sitting here they're dollar 50 apiece now might not be a lot of fun but for a dollar 50 it's probably worth the risk so I paid my dollar 50 and I've got this here today and I'm gonna test it out do a little review on it see if it's any fun Hey for a dollar 50 you can't be that this might be a great birthday or Christmas present for somebody for some kid might be interesting it might not be who knows but we're gonna find out here in just a minute so hang on to your hat we're gonna unbox this world's AR augmented reality gaming system drone edition and see how much fun it is okay first things first let's check out the back cover of this box here all right it says getting started it says open the battery cover install to triple-a batteries not included well of course we knew they weren't included shoot people would have been buying this for a dollar fiftieth plus to triple-a batteries were included maybe download the free world's AR beau app from the App Store or Google Play attached smartphone not included of course turn on Bluetooth on your smart phone settings open the world's AR beau app on your smartphone on the beau active bluetooth pairing by pulling and holding on the bowstring until the pairing is complete and number seven it says half whoo there are some screens it shows I guess different things you might be shooting at and then it shows that the bow itself and some different features on the bow all right so I'm gonna rip this baby open and give her a test and right off the bat I have to say that just holding this bow it actually feels like it's kind of good quality it's kind of heavy so it's got the bow string there it actually feels like it's a fairly well so it's kind of heavy okay and now Tony will load the batteries into the I don't know about you folks but I find the magnetic feature of a screwdriver almost hinders more than it helps okay and there it goes found it in the App Store see how easy this is open well I better get that before they take it off the market you 2.5 rating that's not good and there is the app opened and I'm gonna hit the start button it says tutorial Bo it says how to use it's shown us to put the batteries in which we've done that this is just to put the phone there and the slot there on the bow so I'm gonna do that real quick so we see right here you have a few different missions you can choose from the dragon one kind of interests me since I like Game of Thrones and then the walkers obviously would interest a lot of people because of the walking dead right now being so hot and I think I'm going to choose the walkers and we'll hit start and go to it's like level one and there's a little thing up there in the corner to show you where they're at so it's a radar okay I see one coming there I'm gonna try shoot at him okay kidding again I got double kill so I made it past the first round I only had two zombies to kill all right let's go to the next round and see what it's like all right it says shoot at the oil tank all right Oh looks like we got a big ol can of oil down there so I guess I gotta shoot at that thing fair wait till some zombies get around it I think the idea is to blow those zombies up so oh my god killed all the zombies in the RIC in the right and then near area okay we got one other one to kill here I'm gonna try shooting in the head Oh looks like I got him in the head once bounced off he's still coming Oh got him he is dead alright I have to tell you this is kind of fun a lot funner than I thought it would be now kids go back to the menu and we'll try the dragon try to drag in a game okay dragon defense start press the button to switch skills okay and there's a button here on the front I didn't see it until I started messing with this and that's the button it told me to press that button to switch skills so you're playing as the looks like a some kind of that elf or something and see if that's switches over to something else okay oh there's a dragon amps will be killing it I guess okay okay I got the dragon okay oh I'm standing like on a moat or on top of that standing on top of something here okay I'm trying to shoot sister faggins to find a dragon someone coming up behind me that stinks okay here he is they try a couple times now Oh gotta take him down yeah okay this time we'll play the hunters mission we're out here in a field I see oh I see a elk or something over there I'm not sure what that is yeah we're gonna hunt it okay I got him and it was a victory so right here I'm playing the zombie version of the game and they call these walkers and I think that's pretty Kooks I'd like to walk you dead so you're being attacked by zombies and you're shooting them with your bow and arrow I think it's kind of like Daryl off The Walking Dead a little bit but I think this part of the game was really fun I've played it a little bit and I think it's pretty enjoyable and I've played some of the other games on here and they're not quite as fun I'll show you a little demos of those but this was this was the funnest part and this is something that I will be playing in my own you know my free time like a regular video game because I think it is pretty cool it's nice it's kind of a fun action to you know have this bow and arrow in your hand and actually be pulling back and shoot with these zombies there's something kind of satisfying about it it's kind of neat and you know blowing things up shooting zombies in the head you know I love it but I'm a big fan of The Walking Dead and some of the Dawn of the Dead movies and zombie movies in general so this was kind of a highlight for me so I'm very glad I bought this AR bow if not for anything else but specifically for this part of the game the zombie part of the game so you can see here I'm Dom bees coming at me and I'm shooting them you know and they're just acting crazy and trying to eat my brains but you can shoot some barrels or you can shoot these guys in the head and kill them and you know save the day and just keep moving on to levels it looks like there's quite a few levels on here so pretty cool game alright so now we're in a part of the game where you're playing is like a like a fairy or something and you got like this glowing bow you're like an archer and elf or something and you're shooting your way across this landscape your bow when you shoot obviously you can see that it's sort of like a spider-man web or something that magically pulls you to you know from one beacon to the next and there are also Tigers that you have to kill on this although I'm not really sure how the Tigers get to you because you're always a little bit higher than they are but the Tigers do do seem to post some kind of threat I didn't play this part of the game that long because it wasn't that fun to me but anyway I just want you guys to see it a little bit just to kind of get a gist of what this world looks like might be fun if I played some more levels of it but to me this just wasn't as interesting as like maybe the zombies or you'll see here in a minute I'm going to show you the it's like a king like a kingdom it's like a little bit maybe of all times type of game that's on here that's pretty cool and this right here is the like medieval times part of the game and this was a really fun game I think and if you get good at shooting this arrow it would be really really it would be super super fun because you're shooting these guys that are trying to attack this castle so as they come through you know you're trying to mow them down and I've noticed that you kind of have to get all these guys with headshots they're coming through kind of quick so you really got a you know take aim and it's not that easy because it's like your arrows are sort of ineffective if you just hit right in the armor I think you kind of got to do next shots on headshots and there's a few guys that run fast and I don't think they have any arm roll and you can kill those guys pretty easy if you can get them you know you have to get if you get your arrow ahead of them but I found this part of the game very enjoyable I thought this was really pretty awesome too so this part of the game of the zombie part of the game are definitely my favorite parts of the game so I definitely think people you know should check it out at least for you know two sections of this game because they were pretty cool and this was one of them and this right here is a part of the game that I totally don't understand you're in this kind of I don't know this room this dog's being suspended over this thing that keeps going back and forth and you're supposed to shoot that little red target that's above the dog and I play this and once you shoot that target the dog lands safely and then the game doesn't go anywhere so I think this must be a glitch or something so I just wanted to see this little level anyway so that you could you know get an idea right now I was just shooting arrows at random around the room to see if something different would happen but there I had to save the dog and then the game just stops and you're just stuck here in limbo so for the final game that I'm going to play here this is the Dragon game so there's a dragon that's attacking a castle and you're standing on like a little tower or a turret and you're defending this castle from dragons and you're playing the part of like an elf or something and you're gonna see here the elf has like several different arrows you can choose from and I think you have to play this for a while and like collect these arrows somehow maybe by winning so many rounds and there's a little button on the front of the bow itself that allows you to switch between the arrows and then you see there's a dragon I'm getting ready to shoot and you just keep shooting these dragons as they keep trying to attack the castle there may be other things that attack the castle at some point if you play this game longer I'm not really sure exactly what else there is this game might also be cool outside because you know it is you know the real world I'm in a dark bedroom playing this right now so anyway just all-in-all I felt like this AR augmented reality game system arrow or bow and arrow it was pretty awesome for an hour 50 shoot yeah I'll play it and I suggest you know you know if you find one of these you know grab it and you know give it a try you know like I said great Christmas
