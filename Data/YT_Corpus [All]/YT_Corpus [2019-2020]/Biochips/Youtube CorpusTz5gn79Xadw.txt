 the Arkansas house legislation that would regulate microchipping employees in Arkansas moves one step closer to becoming law the proposal cleared its first hurdle by passing out of a House committee krk fours Jesse Knorr live at the Capitol with the debate tonight Jesse yeah hey Ashley and Bob representative Stephen Meeks is working to get ahead of this technology he told his colleagues earlier today that the practice of microchipping employees is only happening in the u.s. in Wisconsin but when the technology comes to Arkansas Meeks wants to make sure employees are protected his bill would allow them to opt out of getting microchipped without the threat of being fired one of Meeks constituents spoke against the bill I think small businesses that are not incorporated they don't have that corporate protection from from liability or accountability as which maybe call it I think they should be allowed to make any kind of dumb rule they want to impose it on their employees as a condition of employment some of Meeks colleagues there were also critical of the bill one representative Mary Bentley saying her constituents and she herself are in an uproar about this but when it came time to vote on the bill it did pass with Meeks promising to clean up some of the language there in the Senate version of it when it heads over to that committee now if it does pass the full House and Senate it would become the first law to regulate microchipping in the country live at the State Capitol I'm Jessie - Norah
