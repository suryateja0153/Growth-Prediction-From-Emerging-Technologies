 [Music] hi welcome to this body this body is the end of our understanding about how to fabricate biochip using MEMS based technology when I say MEMS it is micro electromechanical systems right in previous modules what we have seen how can we fabricate this chip in this module let us see how can we use this chip and how can we place this chip in a mechanical casing hmm and that mechanical casing is we have fabricated that thing airing of this thing using 3d printing since three bending is also part of these particular lectures or course I'm not going to tell more about your bending in this particular module but we'll discuss more about how exactly 3d building works what are the kind of 3d printers and then we will actually see how can we operate little bit there in the laboratory so if you see the slide what we have seen there is a heater and over the heater there is an insulator or that there is an electrode over electrode there isn't position sensors on that is the insulator on that there is a cold pad over goal person su-8 pillars and we are making a circular conductive on the back side there is a diaphragm this diaphragm is using bulk micromachining finally you have this chip once you have this shape then you have to place this chip in this particular 3d printed module I'll show you the block diagram of this module in many of this particular mechanical casing in my next lecture now right now let us understand how can we use this chip to understand the change in the tissue properties so this chip is placed here all right and there are press-fit context what is it press fit context the advantage of press with context over shouldering and wire bonding is that you can easily load and unload the chip into the mechanical casing then what you see here is a micro manipulator now this section the representation is such that we are using PC actuator but you can use micro manipulator micro manipulator many few later this will press the chip with micron prison now when I say pressing the chip that is it will move in x y and z x y and z in micron micrometer range with with micrometer range precision okay so what we how we will take advantage of this thing now if you see this particular section is like a funnel is like a funnel so I'll place the chip there's a potato chip in the bottom right and through this funnel through this funnel like this and all right and this is our chip through this funnel we lower the tissue we load the tissue so let me just draw different colors so that you can understand what exactly I mean you see you have a funnel there's a tip at the end of the funnel this tip is the one that we have fabricated all right and you are loading a tissue who are lowering the tissue such that tissue the bottom of the tissue will contact the chip the bottom of the tissue will contact the zip this is your let's say if it is breast cancer is a breast tissue from breast cancer patient so from breast cancer patient now what you will do what you will do if I place the tissue in the this particular funnel what is my idea my idea is that if I press the tissue if you press the tissue what is on the chip this is a chip what is that on the chip the chip is having a having a please the resistive sensors right so if I apply force to this tissue this force will be transmitted transmitted on a chip which has piezo resistive sensors and based on the elasticity of the tissue based on the elasticity of tissue based on the elasticity of the tissue the amount of force applied an amount of force measured will be different right if I have few million internal force how much force is actually transmitted to the chip or to the piezo sensor will depend on the elasticity of the tissue correct second so how we will apply force and apply force to the tissue using indenter this guy is called indenter hmm it's like this and is connected to the piece of pc actuator is a piezo actuator this is actuator indenter is actuator this is AI indenter and at the tip of the indenter and the tip of the indenter if I have so right now we are pressing the tissue with the help of indenter that is one thing right now at the tip of the indenter if I have thermal sensors or thermistor thermistor thermistor is used to measure the temperature okay now my ship is indicated with what is indicated with micro heater so if I apply at the bottom of the tissue let's say 37 degree centigrade I can see what is the temperature at the top of the tissue with help of thermistor right so I said T 2 this is T 1 if T 1 is 37 degrees centigrade what is the temperature of the T 2 so if I apply or heat the tissue from the bottom what is the temperature at the top of the tissue if I want to measure or if I measure temperature T 2 and T 1 what I can find I can find thermal conductivity thermal conductivity ok third thing if I attach a electrode at the bottom of the indenter electrode okay what is that on on the chip there is a su 8 pillars with a gold pad so if I apply voltage here this were potential difference between two points so point one for applying a voltage is here o point two is electrode then apply if I apply a voltage so this this is the indenter right if I apply voltage here we won I cross across the tissue and the chip to complicate it let me draw it easy let me just rub it down the unnecessary things so it becomes a little bit easier to understand okay if I apply a voltage between the point P 1 and point P 2 that is P 1 is on the chip here P 1 and P 2 is somewhere on the indenter alright in then that has what Oh point P 2 that is your electrode tip as for P 1 which again is a contact to the gold pad so if there is a voltage and if there is a tissue in between dish you would have certain resistance right it would have resistance so now if the tissue has a resistance if I have applying voltage then what will I find I will find different I'll find the change in current depending on what is the resistance of the tissue right so what we understand that we can measure with this technique with this technique we can measure the mechanical property mechanical property electrical property and thermal property of a tissue electrical property mechanical property and thermal thermal property of a tissue when I say mechanical mechanical what I mean I mean elasticity or you can say stiffness if I say electrical what does I mean I mean resistance if I say thermal I see thermal conductivity so I can understand the mechanical property that is elasticity or stiffness electrical properties as resistance and thermal property like thermal conductivity from a single tissue trauma tissue obtained from or obtained by biopsy obtained using biopsy right so this chip can help me to understand three different properties of the tissue now if the tissue is from several stages let's say benign ve ni y n benign or it is ductal carcinoma in situ or it is invasive ductal carcinoma so let's say it is dr. Carson lobular carcinoma in situ Noble er carcinoma in situ lobular is cancer occurs in lobes ductal is dr. cancer are occurring in ducts hmm and invasive lobular carcinoma so if I have tissue from several stages of the cancer I can understand the change the elasticity resistances thermal conductivity and correlate that with my gold standard and Goldson that is the biomarkers that are available or that people use in the pathology lab so unco pathologist will give us the understanding of what whether the biomarkers are present and for with that study if we correlate our electrical mechanical and thermal property can we get can we add these modalities onto the existing modalities and can tell okay the tissue is from this particular stage of the cancer does the electrical thermal and mechanical property of a tissue we can measure with the help of this bio chip and if you want to if we are able to measure this and correlate with the gold standard then we are helping to reduce false positive and false negative signals you got it so the whole exercise of understanding the chip design chip fabrication is to understand electrical mechanical and thermal properties of tissue so it's very interesting right that by learning or by fabricating a biochip using a manned space technology we can understand electrical mechanical and thermal properties of tissue now whether this thing works or not so as part of research work which is published in IEEE Tripoli transactions on biomedical engineering which I have given it to you right over here right we found that when you understand the mechanical properties when you understand the electrical properties and when you understand the thermal properties of normal tissues and invasive ductal carcinoma then there is a change in this three these three parameters these are the SEM images SEM sense for scanning electron microscopy scanning electron microscopy SEM images of scanning electron microscopy you can also use Fe SEM which is filled emission scanning letter microscopy field emission scanning electron scope microscopy so is called F E is e mhm if you read or understand what's the difference between say SEM and what difference between FES em now in terms of the morphology in terms of the topography what you can see you can see that the normal tissues seems to be smoother compared to the carcinoma tissues right so what does it mean that means that if the topography is so rough the resistance would be different compared to the normal tissue the if the resistance is different the thermal conductivity should be different compared to the normal tissue right so that what it means you can clearly see that there is a delineation between ID C's are normal you want to take on resistivity the same thing thermal conductivity is the same thing right so you need to understand that this thing we can use it for measuring all three properties okay now this is the blue nerd diagram that I was talking about little while ago and you can see here there is this is made out of 3d printing and we use object printing object printer like I said I will discuss about their pending in the in some other class you can see that there is a there are alignment columns then there is a bottom part a spring is there microchip is there a middle part is there press fit contact pins are that top part is there and the bird packing is there right when you when you this is a blown-up diagram when you indicate all the things together you can find out this particular casing and this casing is with a biochip that is right over here that we learn right at the process flow do you know other modules and then these are the connectors that you can connect out and you can understand different properties of tissue so this is an example as I was talking you can see an indenter an indenter is a taste with thermistor and electrode as a tip so the electrodes is used for applying the voltage between the top part of the applying voltage across the tissue and the thermistor is used to understand the the change in temperature at the top surface when you heat the bottom surface right we discussed this thing you can again connect this thing to LCD to understand the different in properties once you learn of data you can also have the understanding where this tissue falls in which particular region or this from which particular stage now the study was done using the dead tissues that means that issue is taken out is there is a freezed in a tissue bank and as you can see the paraffin is used to store the tissue when we had to remove the paraffin you had to do the paraffin ization that is done using chemical called xylene okay so paraffin is tissue deeper a finished tissue you can see the the image here photograph but you can see breast it should be paraffin eyes this one is a breast tissue which is paraffin embedded and once you once you have the tissue you can place the tissue in this particular funnel right this say this whole thing is placed right over here and the indenter is pressing in the tissue this we have discussed in the previous slide alright so this is how the electrical thermal mechanical phenotyping of breast cancer we have seen and one more thing that is interesting is that this system cannot only help us to understand the change in the breast cancer tissue but we can use this system for any tissue little cancer or any cancer related to tissue based cancer any tissue based cancer that's alright dumb to use whether it is oral cancer whether this prostate cancer even you want to understand the stiffness of the gray matter then also we can use the similar in a structure what is the change in the stiffness of the gray matter if a person has Alzheimer a person is normal you can see the changes are stiffness because stiffness is one of the properties of tissue that many people have used to understand the disease progression right so this is the last slide for this particular module and what we have seen is that a chip that is using a mime space technology can be a chip fabricated can be used for understanding different tissue properties and for tissue related cancers like Auto cancer breast cancer here we have take an example of a breast cancer but same thing goes for the oral cancer you can place a tissue on the chip and you can understand the change in the tissue properties now so what does we we saw we saw that we just had only ah oxidized silicon wafer and from oxidized silicon wafer that we were using as a substrate right all in fact silicon wafer that we are using a substrate we have grown oxide on this we have deposited a heater F competitor heater then we had an insulator interdigital electrodes wizards to censor insulator gold pad su-8 pillar make it conductive on the backside have a diaphragm so you have all three sensors indicated onto this chip when you slice the chip when you slice this chip what will happen that you will have individual chips as I am showing it to you right here yesterday also via last lecture I don't know when I recorded over yesterday so the point is this is the chip that we obtained at the end of the process and this chip is what we are using for understanding the change in the tissue properties all right guys in next module we'll discuss how can we just understand the change in the tissue properties which is mechanical properties if I don't want to have this complicated structure a complicated sensor because it requires several masks how can I design something which is just for mechanical understand it again yeah it depends if you are designing a pizza resist American deliver there are about seven masks process so depends and nothing was really the mask design I'm talking about the application point of view if you understand only these two stiffness of a cell or you want to understand only stiffness of a tissue why to go for electrical sensors and thermal sensors right so we'll see in the next module how can you design a piece of the still micro cantilever that can be used to understand the change in the stiffness of the tissue again same thing when I say tissue it can be oral cancer can be best concert can be pursued cancers can be another digitizer cancer but the focus will be on how can we fabricate we will see the process flow and we will also see what kind of mechanical properties we can you know measure with the help of piezo resistive sensor all right so till then you take care I'll see you in the next one bye
