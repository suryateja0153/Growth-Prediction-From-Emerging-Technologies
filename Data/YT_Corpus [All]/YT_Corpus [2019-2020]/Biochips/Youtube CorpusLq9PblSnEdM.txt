 in molecular biology biochips are essentially miniaturized laboratories that can perform hundreds of thousands of simultaneous biochemical reactions biochips enable researchers to quickly screen large numbers of biological analytes for a variety of purposes from disease diagnosis to detection of bioterrorism agents digital microfluidic bio chips have become one of the most promising technologies in many biomedical fields in a digital microfluidic bio chip a group of adjacent cells in the microfluidic array can be configured to work as storage functional operations as well as for transporting fluid droplets dynamically topic history the development started with early work on the underlying sensor technology one of the first portable chemistry based sensors was the glass pH electrode invented in 1922 by Hughes in subsequent years for example a k+ sensor was produced by incorporating valano myosin into a thin membrane in 1953 Watson and Crick announced their discovery of the now-familiar double helix structure of DNA molecules and set the stage for genetics research that continues to the present day the development of sequencing techniques in 1977 by Gilbert and Sanger working separately enabled researchers to directly read the genetic codes that provide instructions for protein synthesis this research showed how hybridization of complementary single oligonucleotides strands could be used as a basis for DNA sensing to additional developments enabled the technology used in modern DNA based first in 1983 Kary Mullis invented the polymerase chain reaction PCR technique a method for amplifying DNA concentrations this discovery made possible the detection of extremely small quantities of DNA in samples secondly in 1986 hood and co-workers devised a method to label DNA molecules with fluorescent tags instead of radio labels thus enabling hybridization experiments to be observed optically figure 1 shows the makeup of a typical bio chip platform the actual sensing component or chip is just one piece of a complete analysis system transduction must be done to translate the actual sensing event DNA binding oxidation-reduction etc into a format underst and herbal by a computer voltage light intensity mass etc which then enables additional analysis and processing to produce a final human readable output the multiple technologies needed to make a successful bio chip from sensing chemistry to microarray - signal processing require a true multidisciplinary approach making the barrier to entry steep one of the first commercial bio chips was introduced by Affymetrix their janette chip products contain thousands of individual DNA sensors for use in sensing defects or single nucleotide polymorphisms snps in genes such as p53 a tumor suppressor and brca1 and brca2 related to breast cancer the chips are produced using micro lithography techniques traditionally used to fabricate integrated circuits see below topic microarray fabrication the microarray the dense two-dimensional grid of biosensors is the critical component of a biochip platform typically the sensors are deposited on a flat substrate which may either be passive eg silicon or glass or active the latter consisting of integrated electronics or micro mechanical devices that perform or assist signal transduction surface chemistry is used to covalently bind the sensor molecules to the substrate medium the fabrication of micro arrays is non-trivial and is a major economic and technological hurdle that may ultimately decide the success of future bio chip platforms the primary manufacturing challenge is the process of placing each sensor at a specific position typically on a Cartesian grid on the substrate various means exist to achieve the placement but typically robotic micro / petting or micro printing systems are used to place tiny spots of sensor material on the chip surface because each sensor is unique only a few spots can be placed at a time the low throughput nature of this process results in high manufacturing costs Fodor and colleagues developed a unique fabrication process later used by Affymetrix in which a series of micro little graffiti EPS is used to combinatorially synthesize hundreds of thousands of unique single stranded DNA sensors on a substrate one nucleotide at a time one lithography step is needed per base type thus a total of four steps is required per nucleotide level although this technique is very powerful in that many sensors can be created simultaneously it is currently only feasible for creating short DNA strands 15 to twenty-five nucleotides reliability and cost factors limit the number of photo lithography steps that can be done furthermore light directed combinatorial synthesis techniques are not currently possible for proteins or other sensing molecules as noted above most microarrays consist of a Cartesian grid of sensors this approach is used chiefly to map or encode the coordinate of each sensor to its function sensors in these arrays typically use a universal signaling technique eg fluorescence thus making coordinates their only identifying feature these arrays must be made using a serial process ie requiring multiple sequential steps to ensure that each sensor is placed at the correct position random fabrication in which the sensors are placed at arbitrary positions on the chip is an alternative to the serial method the tedious and expensive positioning process is not required enabling the use of parallelized self-assembly techniques in this approach large batches of identical sensors can be produced sensors from each batch are then combined and assembled into an array Anan coordinate based encoding scheme must be used to identify each sensor as the figure shows such a design was first demonstrated and later commercialized by Illumina using functionalized beads placed randomly in the wells of an etched fiber-optic cable each bead was uniquely encoded with a fluorescent signature however this encoding scheme is limited in the number of unique dye combinations that can be used and successfully differentiated topic protein biochip array and other micro array technologies micro arrays are not limited to DNA analysis protein microarrays antibody microarray chemical compound microarray can also be produced using bio chips Rand X Laboratories limited launched evidence the first protein bio chip array technology analyzer in 2003 in protein bio chip array technology the bio chip replaces the Eliza played or cuvette as the reaction platform the bio chip is used to simultaneously analyze a panel of related tests in a single sample producing a patient profile the patient profile can be used in disease screening diagnosis monitoring disease progression or monitoring treatment performing multiple analyses simultaneously described as multiplexing allows a significant reduction in processing time and the amount of patient sample required bio chip array technology is a novel application of a familiar methodology using sandwich competitive and antibody capture immunoassays the difference from conventional immunoassays is that the capture ligands are covalently attached to the surface of the bio chip in an ordered array rather than in solution in Sandwich Irsay's an enzyme labeled antibody is used in competitive assays an enzyme labeled antigen is used on antibody antigen binding a chemiluminescence reaction produces light detection is by a charge-coupled device CCD camera the CCD camera is a sensitive and high resolution sensor able to accurately detect and quantify very low levels of light the test regions are located using a grid pattern then the chemiluminescent signals are analyzed by imaging software - rapidly and simultaneously quantified the individual analytes biochips are also used in the field of micro physio matauri eg in skin on a chip applications for details about other array technologies
