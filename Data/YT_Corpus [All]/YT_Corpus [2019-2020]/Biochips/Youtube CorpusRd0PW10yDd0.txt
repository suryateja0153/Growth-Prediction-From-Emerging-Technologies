 Well, the paper we want to talk about today, is about 3D simulation of and intravasation tumor cell  through endothelial barrier (or cells)  they performed it in microfluidic device the paper is for 2012  among the authors who might be important to mention is Professor Roger Kamm   the main goal of the paper was to develop a 3D microfluidic device  to model tumor microenvironment so they could observe Intravasation through endothelial barrier cells and simultaneously the could integrate live imaging and find the correlation with endothelial permeability  why? since one of the hypotheses exists in this regard is that impairment of the endothelial cells would cause the tumor cells intravasation to occur and they wanted to build an invitro model to do imaging and test whether these impairments would really influence the intravasation or not? this is the microfluidic device they considered in their study the part in green deliver endothelial cells and then there is a media channel and the red channel has the tumor cells which are breast cancer cells the middle channel also contains the ECM and collagen is placed as an interconnection media between tumor cells and endothelial cells and  if we see this 3D representation there are trapezoidal posts along the media channels and the gel in the middle is the culture media in which we can observe the cells behavior In their device, they saw that the endothelial cells filled the empty space between these posts and make a lumen shape cell barrier which is a 3D monolayer from endothelial cells which is attacked by the tumor cells from this side so they are in contact they also proposed an method method to calculate permeability of the endothelial cells which was done with fluorescence conjugated dextran experiment with different molar masses (Da)  and they saw that the permeability of endothelial cells which were seeded in the microchannel (e.i. were cultured) was lower for higher molar masses which means that the endothelial barrier permeability was dependent upon the size (or mass) of the molecules passing the barrier.  in which I go back the right one figure A is the real image of one micro post in which it has endothelial cell and ECM. And the right one is the picture of the simulation in Matlab. As depicted there is a good correlation between both the results so the proposed model was in good correlation with experiment  e.i. it was validated in order to see whether macrophages which are in contact with endothelial cells would have any effect on intravasation or not the incorporated macrophages in the model and as you see here they saw that when the macrophages exist there in the microenvironment cancer cells are gathered in the basal side of endothelial cells which is toward the ECM e.i. inside the ECM However, when macorphases are seeded they come toward the lumen (i.e. inside the vein)  these are the pictures of a tumor cell intravasating the endothelial (shown in green) from this wall of the endothelial monolayer which is formed here and we see that as time goes on this tumor cell comes into play we have the macrophage here and in the end, this tumor cell evades from the endothelial layer (e.i. intravasation occurs)  they also compared the intravasation rate tumor cell in the absence of macrophages and the case of having macrophage in the environment and they saw that the number of cells evaded from endothelial cell is higher and based on the model they proposed which used fluorescence dextran they realized that the permeability em of the endothelial in the presence of macrophages is increased which could be the reason for the passage of tumor cell from endothelial cells and also they considered the effect of using two different endothelial cell in which the red one which is MVEC represents the Microvascular Endothelial Cell (MVEC) while the other one is Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cell  (HUVEC) as it is depicted the results were close to each other (and they didn't have a meaningful difference) Thus in two different endothelial cells a similar result was observed then instead of using macrophages they decided to use biochemical factors which was the TNF-alpha or tumor necrosis factor alpha in which they saw that they observed that the intravasation rate in the TNF-alpha case was even higher than the macrophage case e.i. higher number of cells evaded They also change the concentration (dosage) of TNF-alpha and with increase in the TNF-alpha the tumor cell intravasation had increased dramatically then they choose another tumor cell  and they observed its intravasation number and passage through online imaging they wanted to show that high-resolution imaging could help us to observe the intravasation for example, this is for the t=0 (initial time) and t=10 hrs that after 10 hrs how many of the tumor cells passed and was able to intravasate  They did the same with TNF-alpha e.i. they also incorporated the TNF-alpha and saw that the same trend happened for this type of tumor cells which was fibrosarcoma tumor cells. and to see the effect of antibody blocking on intravasation, they used two anti-blocking factors; which were IgG antibody and Anti TNF-alpha. And they saw that when the TNF-alpha was used intravasation is reduced dramatically and also dose the permeability. Furthermore, besides macrophages, they observed the effect of permeability in the presence of tumor cell, epithelial and they saw that presence of any other various cells in contact with the endothelial cells would cause increase in the intravasation rate in which the higher occurred for macrophages case and at last dynamic of the tumor cells were investigated as you can see here the way the tumor cell evaded is depicted  In addition to the fact that they could introduce a time scale based on imaging for tumor and endothelial cells interactions  they also measure the cell velocities and saw that the cell velocity the cell velocity when the TNF-alpha exists in comparison to the absence of TNF do not have a dramatic change which may show that the reduced time of tumor cell intravasation was not due to the influence of cell velocity  but was due to permeability of endothelial cells and to make the story short, in a few sentences, the importance of this study was that a device was introduced which was capable of providing a medium for high-resolution imaging the amount of utilized reagents and cells were decreased Also, this device could be used for personalized medicine, drug screening and furthermore, they explore the cell time scales measured the intravasation and correlated it to permeability of endothelial cells End of Subtitle for now
