 [Music] hi welcome to this module and actually this model is a short model on a very important process in micro fabrication called itching right so we will see why it is important and what kind of etching methods are there now why we are learning this is a part of this course because of anyone to develop an electronic system that - for certain diagnosis of a disease in in some of the systems we are using a micro engineering technology and when we talk about microns in technology along with few processes like thermal reoperation eb me operation you have wet etching you have dry etching you have photolithography you have a beam lithography you also have the chemical vapour deposition techniques like CVD lpcvd pecvd MOCVD right apcvd so a lot of techniques are involved and one of those techniques is wet etching and when you talk about wet etching we will see why it is important and if I talk about dry etching why it is important so this module is on of edgy itching the etching theme materials in the case of micro fabrication so if you see the slide we will be talking about itching process the first process is let us see aging is a part of pattern transfer process after lithography right which removes material selectively here I have given you an example of a basic patterning process so if you see we start with the wafer right we start with the wafer then we deposit a film now how it can deposit the film now you should be you should know what are the methods for depositing this particular film there are two methods one is PVD second one is CVD right and in PVD we have thermally operation we have EB my operation we have sputtering right in CVD we have lpcvd we have MOCVD we have PECVD we have apcvd now once the film is deposited by any of the technique right you can also use spin coating you can also use spin coater for spin coating the film on the wafer so using any one technique if we deposit a film on the wafer and if I want to pattern the film but in the film what is a bug and a patterning I want I want to pattern the film so that finally I only have this particular structure that is at certain point film is there in certain area the film is not there right so how can i H the film in this area alright so for that we have to first deposit a film on a wafer we will perform a photolithography how can you go from photography by first using photoresist right and then doing lithography afterward after doing that you can see that if we do the lithography what you see here is photoresist is not saving the area which we want to etch and the remaining area there is a photoresist is not covering the area where we want to etch so now if I dip this wafer if I dip this wafer in a chemical what kind of chemical I can use based on the film that we need to etch right suppose if the film is silicon dioxide then what chemical I can use I can use buffer hydrofluoric acid right so different chemicals are there for different films so when we deepen when we performed in Zagreb and dip the wafer to etch it you will see that the film will get edge from the area which is not protected by photoresist and the area which was protected v photoresist the film is still intact after that we had to strip of the photoresist and stripping of the photoresist is done using acetone we already remember right streaming of registering acetone right finally when you step off the photoresist right like here you can obtain your film this is the wet etching technique okay or you can see a dry etching technique so I'll tell you in detail what advantaging and dieting but before that let us take an example so you understand in detail the figure of merits for this one are edge rate selectivity directional anisotropy directionality anisotropy defect cost and environmental safety these are some of the figure of merits so if I take an example let us take an example where we want to fabricate going to fabricate Oh pressure sensor navigate a pressure sensor right which will look like one that I am crying right now so all right and then on this you want to have Pisa register so now what what is the little things that so I would just maybe the registers like this right so what are the areas first area is silicon dioxide which is right over here these also silicon dioxide right here is silicon dioxide this is silicon this is chrome gold or inter ditch the electrodes made using chrome gold this one is our piece your register okay this is what I want this is what I want using photolithography photo lithography and etching and etching okay so to obtain this particular device right what are the steps and how edging is important that is our today's module okay so now what do you see you see a silicon wafer right you see a silicon so we will start with a wafer and we say that we are starting with a wafer all right this is my silicon wafer the next step is I have to grow silicon dioxide or deposit silicon dioxide right so if I deposit silicon dioxide using thermal oxidation sio2 sio2 right and this is my silicon next step is I will deposit or metal on this lick on dioxide right I will deposit a metal on the silicon dioxide so that I can obtain my chrome gold interdigitated electrode right so I deposit chrome gold this is my gold right and then remaining things are silicon dioxide silicon silicon dioxide right next step in the next step I have to spin coat photoresist I have to spin coat photoresist hmm so let us use blue color to show our photoresist alright and let us use this pattern so what is this one this is my positive photoresist hmm then what else I have I have silicon dioxide here also I have silicon dioxide right this is silicon and then what do I have here I have chrome gold right this one is chrome gold right what's the next step next step is we had to use a mask we have to use a mask so I will draw quickly wafer oxide right oxide then we have chrome gold right chrome gold then we have photoresist which is positive photoresist and we have spin coated this positive photoresist and cure it at 90 degree okay this is spin coated photoresist and we have done soft bake at 90 degree for 1 minute on this we have to use a mask right so let us use a mask and mask see saw said I had to only protect the inter digitated I went to pattern inter digitated electrode so our masks would be my mask would look like this it's a bright field mask field is bright pattern is dark it's a bright field mask right so this is my pride field mask right what's the next step next step is we will expose it we will expose it with UV light UV light right after the exposing what we will do for the next step next step is to dip this wafer the wafer in photoresist stripper or photoresist stripping solution hmm so all in in another terms it is also called photoresist developer not stupid let's use this corrector it is not called stripper stripper is when photoresist will be stripped off we are using photoresist developer developer right so when you dip this wafer in a photoresist developer what you will have you will have you will have oxidized silicon wafer on that there is a chrome gold on that you have photoresist but this time photoresist is develop 1 1 2 3 4 & 5 right this is my positive photoresist alright now I will perform Hardwick Hardwick is the net 120 degree centigrade for 1 minute on hot plate when I go for hard-baked what is the next step next step is I will dip this wafer I will dip this wafer in chrome gold etchant first what your top layer top layer is cold bottom layer is chrome so first I will dip oh well first I will etch the gold from the wafer and then I will rinse the wafer with DI water then I will place the wafer in a chrome acient right and to latch chrome it will etch chrome and gold only in the area which is exposed to the chemicals the area which is protected by the photoresist will not be etched hmm this itching of chrome gold using a chemicals is called wet etching is called wet etching because we are dipping the wafer in a agent in a chemical now if I do that what will I have if I itch the chrome and gold using wet etch and what will I have I will have korone gold I'll have chrome gold in this area right so you see here the chrome gold we can fabricate or we can pattern using photolithography and wet etching all right what's the next step next step is we have to pattern feature register so to pattern fizzle register let us see we'll take again we'd start from the chrome gold and then we will continue so we have oxidized silicon wafer right and on oxide silicon wafer we have chrome gold in the pattern way which is called inter digitated electrodes which is called inter digitated electrodes hmm so let us see we have chrome cold like this right this is my inter digitated electrodes all right let's you know this is silicon and the end and then the to what I'm in top part of the silicon is silicon dioxide hmm on this on this what I want I want appeaser resistor so what I will do I will spin coat I will spin coat P dot P SS what is this material this material that I am spin coating is PE D or T let me write it down because this top part of the screen we have little bit problem so I just write it down again right this is my piece a resistor film purpose your resistive film and this is nothing but PE d-o-t P SS this is my conducting polymer which acts as a pressure is this tube material the next step next step here is I have oxidized silicon wafer because I have oxide in the bottom part oxide on the top part with inter digitated electrodes on top of it right and then on that we have P dot PSS which will act as a piezo resistive material and we need to pattern this material right we have to pattern at this material so this is my piece registered op is resistive material right there is a chrome ball inside on this what we will do we will deposit or will spin coat that will spin coat positive photoresist this is my positive photoresist right remaining you know interdigital electrode p dot p SS silicon dioxide see the conductor in silicon after spin coating positive photoresist the next step is to use mask right we do we have to go for soft pick of course soft make positive or diseased you know and a degree 1 minute hot plate and then on this I will load a mask so I will just delete this one for now and let us show a mask right so how should the mask look like if you go back you want freezer register only in this area right so we had to protect for the visual register material only in this area for that we have to have a mask which will protect my piece resistive material in the area of my on the on the desired area that will help me to get the PISA industry a pure register right it's not a help me wrap is a resistive you had been get or pattern please a register this is my bright field right field mask okay now you understand this thing why I have used virtual mask because I have here positive photoresist now what is a characteristics of positive or resist that the area which is not exposed by UV light will get stronger the area which is not exposed by UV light will get stronger so now you can see that the area that is in black shade will not get exposed in the area which is in white shade will get exposed right so after this the next step would be that I have to go for after this I to remove the mask and then do a hard baked Harbach it is donate hard baked okay Harvick is H a Rd be a ke Hardwick Hardwick is done it 120 degree centigrade one minute on hot plate easy right so now next step is after Hardwick or next step is we have to dip this wafer we will dip this wafer in photoresist developer photoresist developer when I do that what will I have I will I will get let me draw it little bit here okay like this my silicon dioxide layer is intact on that my chrome gold layer is also intact or chrome gold pattern introducer electrodes right on that my pizza resistor material is still intact hmm please register material is still intact but my photoresist layer will be pattern now so I will have a photoresist only in this area right so this is my photoresist what's the next step next step is next step is that I will I will dip this wafer I'll dip dip this effort in we missed the stair actually the we have used hard-baked before photoresist developing that's not a correct statement so let us understand what what I mean after positive photoresist you have to do soft bake then in to expose the wafer with UV light of course I'm loading the mask once that is done you have to develop the wafer and after developing the wafer you have to go for Hardwicke okay you don't have to do hard baking before you develop the wafer okay so that you can do only when you are using su-8 material su-8 material in case of positive and negative photoresist you had to go for soft baked soft baked after you spin coat it after soft bake the next step is load loading of masks and UV exposure next step is photoresist developer next step is hard bake next step is etching all right this is in case of positive and negative photoresist right so what we have to do after the UV exposure step we have to load the mask we after photo resist exposure step we have to develop the wafer order of the photoresist and then after photo this is develop it will look like this particular pattern followed by which we had to do Harbach at 120 degree centigrade for 1 minute on hot plate followed by followed by etching P dot P SS followed by etting PRPs again you see itching is very important when you HP dot P SS what will happen what will happen you will have a wafer oxide because the etching chemical or material will not affect oxide or it will not affect the chrome gold inter digitated electrodes okay so that's why we don't worry in this case and we don't have to go for the liftoff technique I have explained you liftoff this is my visa registered pattern this is chrome gold inter digitated electrodes silicon dioxide silicon silicon dioxide right so again we have used a hmm so where are we now VR we have done IDE and we have patterned e for the vigil instrument again next step is we have to do this bulk etting of silicon bulk etting hmm let me go for the one more slide where I can show you the next step where we are to create a diaphragm right so what we have we have oxidized silicon wafer alright unoxidized Ilocano effort we have chrome gold on Chrome gold we have P dot P SS right this what we have now we have to etch the silicon wafer from backside from the backside so what we will do for that we will spin coat photoresist we will spin coat positive photoresist right then we will do a performs of big process a step after soft week we load a mask load of mass such that my photoresist will protect the area of my interest and the remaining area will be etched after I expose this wafer with UV light and develop it in the photoresist developer right this is my Paul B this is my bright field mask right after this what's the next step next step is peer to expose the wafer expose the a foreign UV light right after exposing the wafer next step is where to unload the mask and perform the perform inv where we are to dip this wafer in photoresist developer dip this over in photoresist developer if I dip the wafer in a photoresist developer what will happen what will happen I'll have photoresist in this two area and this area is exposed now for further process so now what can I do I had to go for Harvick right photoresist developer then Harvick after that I will deposit this wafer in so I not deposit edge silicon dioxide by dipping the wafer in buffer hydrofluoric acid all right so when I dip the wafer in buffer hydrofluoric acid what will happen what will happen I will have I'll have silicon dioxide only here hmm I have silicon dioxide only in this particular region right why because other area was protected by positive photoresist so now when I'm eating silicon again we have to use process called a etting of silicon dioxide that we have used which can imagine we have used wet etching and the con chemicals that we used is buffer hydrofluoric acid okay after this we had to strip off the positive photoresist if I step off the photo positive photoresist I'll have this pattern now I will depose I will dip this wafer in either tmh or Koh these are both chemicals and that's why it is a wet etching Koh and tmh has some kind of pros and cons if you want to know these are the pros and cons tmh gives us is a smooth wall smooth wall when we H Koh gives us a rough wall when we asked tmh is lower koh is faster faster I think slower I think then tmh can be done at room temperature or 25 degree centigrade qh is done it or carried out at 80 degree centigrade all right so these are advantage disorders TMS is also neurotoxic TM h e is neurotoxic this is for the research literature survey okay but but both things are used TMS nqh for wet etching when we dip this wafer in TM h NQ h what we will get will get a diaphragm [Music] like this and this angle is ft 4.7 degree 54 0.7 degree right so what we got we got this pattern understood so this is the beauty of wet etching we are using wet etching to etch the silicon wafer on which there there is a bezel register and interdigital electrodes and matching from the backside by removing silicon dioxide and dipping therefore invert agent which are Koh and tmh alternatively we can also go for dry etching we can also use dry etching okay we will talk about that in a few slides let us continue this particular module and here if you see the how there are several things that we had to understand the first is edge rate rate of removal of the desired material how fast we can edge okay so if I retching silicon dioxide what is a etch rate chrome gold what is a etch rate that's what I mean by caching rate or rate of removal of the result material for example you have D as a thickness and then you can see that after time T Delta D will be etched from the wafer so before etching after dancing H rate can be given by D minus Delta D 1 D minus this is total thickness - the leftover thickness right divided by the time taken which can we can write as Delta D so Delta D D minus D 1 can be delta T and Delta D by T is your H rate okay now second is very important thing which is the etch rate profiles or etching profiles first is if we keep the wafer in the etchant for more time then it is required then you have over edging if you keep the wafer less for less time then the etch rate then the time required to add some material you will have under etching and if the time is perfect then we'll have intended h right over h under h intended h alright so let me move to the next merit next made it is h selectivity very important suppose I have a resist and there is silicon dioxide and silicon right the etchant for silicon dioxide should not affect my silicon if my agent of silicon dioxide that is my buffer hydrofluoric acid will etch the silicon then I will not be able to use this particular agent and that's why selectivity is very important so let selectivity is defined as the ratio of the vertical etch rate which is here right of the material you want to etch to the material you don't want to H so that this is the material we don't want to ice right silicon you want to etch the akanda oxide right so ratio of the vertical etch rate this is a vertical etch rate of the material you want where there is silicon tax when two edge to the material you don't want to H which is silicon you don't advanced so it should be extremely high right so selectivity is a relative measure and selectivity can be defined as selectivity of so in this case if you talk about silicon dioxide what is a resist material you can also understand that another way of doing it that what is the etching rate of the resist material because you see there not only the silicon that we need to protect but also the photoresist should not get etched right if the photoresist get etched then the silicon dioxide from the area below the photoresist also starts I think so selectivity here we will use tooth selectivity first one is selectivity of sio2 versus resist material and second will be selectivity of SiO 2 versus silicon wafer so first one is given the ratio of our SiO 2 by our edges and second one is our SiO 2 by our silicon selective selectivity comes through chemical reaction between different combination of layers for each process we want to have higher selectivity right as is possible okay let's go to next one eating figure of merits first one directionality versus anisotropy we need to control horizontal and vertical etch rates in order to get desired profile right first thing very important so second one is mostly for any bio chip fabrication like my crater diaphragms in the digital electrodes we need diaphragm break shape which is not isotropic right wet etching provides isotropic etching so we can get this kind of itching which is isotropic etching all right we're sorry it will have this kind of a thing where the undercut is there and then it will start etching from the material which is below the mask material must layer below the mask layer this material is also getting it this is what we don't want in lot of applications in the micro engineering domain dry etching provides ns topic itching combination of physical and chemical etching mostly used in bio G fabrication for example this one is a dry etching technique and it is better because it provides us in a stopper getting anisotropic is defined as one - our lateral - our vertical how much the later latching work ratio of retro Qing to vertical edging now if you take this particular example then you can very easily see that the photoresist is on blue color green color is silicon dioxide and the orange color is of silicon here if the NSLP is zero then we will have the undercut which you can see here in a 3d representation but if the NS top is one then we have a perfect itching of the desired area so this is the importance of the on etching figures of merits further if I want to have edge goals then typically any etching process requires this few points the first is it should be highly selective second point is anisotropy that is approximately one third one is high edge rates and it's difficult to get all three together because it can be like an ideal situation and there is a trade-off between all these interdependent parameters so when you use the etching classification in particular then the etching classification is like this you have a Qing hmm then in that I think you have isotropic etching and as tropical father you have physical etching you have chemical etching right and then you also can divide it in this particular format where you have dry etching and wet etching okay what I think is the chemicals that will see dry thing is where you can use sputtering you can use plasma and searching and you can use reactive ion etching or deep reactive ion etching alright so we have a Qing classification so like from the isotropic point of view we have isotropic anisotropic from the physical and chemical point of view we have physical etching versus chemical etching from the dry etching versus vetting point of view we have editing where we have used certain chemicals to s the material well the dry etching we have further at the implication as spot on H or it is a plasma enhances or it is a RIE or DRI like I said RIE sense for reactive ion etching DRI stands for deep reactive and etching alright so if you see the wet etching in this particular slide what you see is it's a simplest form of itching and we get isotropic etching where the thing uses an etchant solution such as acid that chemically attacks the underlying film while leaving the photoresist intact we have seen in the earlier slide right where I was teaching you or showing you how we can fabricate a piece of resistive material or PISA resistive sensor then we have used deep wet etching to HD Pisa resistive material to actually conducts and to as the chrome cold now here for example to a silicon dioxide about for HF is used also known as BOE buffered oxide h hf does not it silicon or resist that's why it is higher selectivity so that is the importance of HF or b hf in case of a qing the silicon dioxide because it is highly selective it will not edge the silicon further when you see the chemical reaction this is how the chemical reaction occurs when you dip the wafer oxidized click on wafer in hf then SiO 2 plus 6 hf gives us H 2 SI f 6 + 2 h2o and this guy is water-soluble and that's how you get the silicon dioxide out from the etchant now using the etchant now h s the HF is consumed during reaction ammonium fluoride as buffer agent to maintain HF conservation is you and the chemical reaction is nh4+ f users and it's 3 plus HF you can see this particular video let us first see this thing first is budget matching provides excellent selectivity poor directionality that is isotropic and moderate edge rates so the question now lies in front of us is how we can get a higher anisotropy right because the there is a limitation of ferreting and that is d as it is isotropic so if I want to go for higher and as tropica teen what can be the next step let us first see the isotropic etching in this video and then go to the next slide [Music] you okay now since you have seen the wedding right let us see the dry etching variance and I like to go into deep in this particular lectures because this is how we are using it to fabricate a device this is not a detail about how exactly the etching occurs this you should know that okay there are two different types of etching and you should have the idea that what is is used for or how it is used okay so without getting into deep chemistry let us see how the dry etching works so if you see the slide what you find is then we talk about sputter it's exactly like sputter deposition with inverse polarity we can get the spot rate so negative as no if our instead of target when you want to deposit the material you have to have negative for a retainer bias on the target and positive on the wafer but we want to etch it you can reverse the polarity or inverse a polarity sputtering is totally physical process atching is because of bombardment of ions but everything has low selectivity that is a disadvantage because the mechanical way of etching it will etch the material below it highly anisotropic etching rate can be increased by increasing the argon ion concentration right and now let us see this video of spot rate okay so let us further see the driving variance and the second variant is the plasma edge so if you see the slide the plasma etching where the enhanced version of the discuss part itching for better selectivity and highlighting rate modifications are like edy active hands into the plasma so if you add the reactor hands like argon plus CF 4 then you can SD the desired material higher-ed state can be achieved by increasing pressure but increasing pressure will result in less mean free path you know what is mean free path is a collision between two atoms in the in the case of vacuum higher the vacuum larger the mean free path and less the collision better the film okay so me list me bless me entry path which is affect the directionality so your mental part should be extremely high hence there is a trade-off between higher hr8 n NS a trophy okay so that is the trade-off that you need to understand that either you want higher etch rate or you want isotropic or anisotropic etching plasma etching is combination of physical and chemical etching by chasing the pressure and DC bias we can completely remove the physical physical etching component however that is etching can be considered as chemical etching or wet etching plasma etching like chemical wet etch has excellent selectivity poor directionality and moderate edge rates this is the second type of etching the first half of etching we have seen is the sputter edging then we are talking about plasma etching let us see one more kind of etching and that is called D so RI or DRI but before we go that yeah you see here that it's edging trade-off is if there are material is highly selective then you have to which one you to see a go for and if your material is a low selectivity which one you have to go for so Heinen anisotropy then you can have low selectivity but if you have low NS repiy you can have a higher selectivity and that's why we said it's a trade-off so we're touching plasma etching chemical etching zone you can have no any anisotropy and high selectivity but if you want to have a high NS rapid and sputtering and physical etching zone is a better way to go for now in a dry etching variance let us see the third one which is our reactive and etching in reactive ion etching special case of plasma etching and and ends plasma etching it's it's also if it's a special casing of plasma etching and it's plasma etching where every time RIE processes customized is unique to film being etched resist material and etch stop layer so either you want to etch the resist material or the film or the silicon the the this RIE has a customized process now many a time we can able to understand actual each process and mathematical models to predict edges exist sidewall pacification passivation increases NS property by protecting sidewalls so what happens is once you send the etching yes then it will etch it and then you use another chemical to smooth the sidewalls okay so first you etch and that this would have smooth the sidewalls this process keeps on repeating so sidewall pacification can increase n SRP by protecting sidewalls and hence results in vertical isotropic ns topic edging so in this case you will have a perfectly fine vertical ns tropic edging and side wall pacification is one of the two key steps of deep react to anything like I said first it will etch then it will protect then it will etch again it will smoothen so this keeps on you know going on and the deep layer to an etching the Bosch process developed by german company robert bosch in 1994 bosch is so this is also caused the boss kind of itching and deep reactive and anything illustration is shown in this particular video now the main idea of Bri process is that the etching of silicon can be used can be done using silica is F 6 and isotropic etch and generation of polymers for side 1 passivation can also be done using the DRI based on the required edge profile and material used some iterations can be provided so if you see the DMD DRI in this particular video also in the next video you will understand how it is done let me play the video for you okay let me play one more video where you will see that details about how the etching is done and that will be the end of the DRI process so in principle what I wanted to show it to you is what kind of watching mechanisms are there in basically that is vetting and writing writing your scene sputter plasma and now you are looking at the DRI so let me play the video and otherwise in case the package down you can operate the Machine normally the first thing to come next to the screen we have to chase next the first thing to check in the gas room the gas phase is like the cynical box the ceiling or box is responsible of neutralizing the exhaust gases from this dias so by burning them it makes them harmless the thing that we have to check is that all the lights are green and temperature it's within parameters as well as the levels of the water nitrogen and oxygen once we check that everything it's and the working conditions as you can see the gases in this side of the room using the gases that are the C for F P so we have to check if it's in use the oxygen under him if once you're right here you noted that any of the taxes that they are not in use please contact us we'll use your staff to turn them on once you are inside the with a bration operating the mission back in the Hestia zone the first thing that we will do is check the sts hour and then we'll record the conductivity of the water and the temperatures on the and sts there HC like three values we will go to the computer to record the other different values that we have to record the ones that you need are going to be high vacuum pressure the cabin pressure the four line pressure and load knock pressure if you have any problem finding any of the values in the springs you only have to go on top of them to see what are the values the first thing that we have to those change the operator more in the software of the STS you know that without we go to edit the Pareto mode and we change from monitor to development first change and then we're not being password with a better price and we changed now to development mode where we can operate the machine now the first thing to know it's to load the desired design refer to the role of Chandler whether that going to the first window and pressing very one peepers then we have to wait for the load lock chamber to which unrestrained pressure once the treasure chamber is under atmospheric pressure we can't open it we will charge the desired wafer into the internal chamber as you will see like usually the wafers have a flat and loading to ourselves will have a small line once we have the proper load in close the Nova chamber when we go to the transfer window I will press now that Lola chambers gonna be patent under running conditions and it's gonna also scan to see we're on the way first place when software has mapped in the machine it's proceeding to load the wafer into the chamber once the wafer is loaded into the chamber we have a flashlight here in the machine to check that the wafer has been check inside the machine [Music] Oh to play with in this case with an user or to click you face press select the first person otherwise you will go straight to help into processing the please press select while the machine is selecting the process compress the recipe button to modify the values of in our face in that second example and also I'm gonna show you how to perform in the makeup test you should do that like probably at the far end of your day to check that there's no major lake of Killian coming from the proving side of the paper in order to wrap you press enable don't touch anything else and just say once we save the recipe and the recipe has been selected we all we need to press process here we have the preservation and we also have [Music] we'll see how that the wafer it's gonna be a little tender once the wafers in the load load lock chamber then icing for those to president wait until the Chandler's and pressure chamber its back into atmosphere pressure so we we grab the wafer that we just process [Music] in once we've done that then I think you know is to logout from so okay so what you understand you are you understood I hope you understood that why I think is so important in the case of microfabrication in particular this device fabrication technology and the next lecture I want to show it to you what kind of electronic systems are there that we call electronic modules you can design so as to interface with the sensor and that's how your electronic system can be can come into realization phase so you are looking at the fabrication where you are developing some sensors and chip but what to do with those chips you had to integrate those chip with some kind of electronic model for further processing we also say it has a signal conditioning circuits okay so till then you see this video once again and if you have any question feel free to ask me through forum write my TAS or me I will be we will be able to answer your queries to best of our abilities till then you take care and I'll see in the next class
