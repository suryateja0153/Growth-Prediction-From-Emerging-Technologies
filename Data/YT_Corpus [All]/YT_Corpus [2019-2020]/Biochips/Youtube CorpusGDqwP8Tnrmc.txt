 with the country obviously focused on trying to mitigate the impact of the Cova nineteen coronavirus while waiting for enough tests there's also a rush to come up with a vaccine that can be used to help our bodies fight against it experts testified before Congress say not to expect a vaccine to be on the market for at least a year to maybe year and a half and that several companies have vaccines under development to work against coronavirus one of those companies is based here in Houston John price is a co-chair president CEO of graphics Incorporated has said that this company has completed the the process of trying to get that vaccine ready now to take the next step so what would you say this is happening in that process now how soon are we ready to go with this in terms of the next phase so the next phase we're ready tomorrow yeah okay and that next phase is the testing the small animal testing to make sure that the vaccine is effective and safe and so while we do our own internal studies for that and prove it up with the 14 vaccines we've made every time that you go to another vaccine you do external testing and so that takes time and money roughly four weeks but we're ready to go to submit to testing now and the government pretty much is in charge of the testing process over the next what eight months with an ace absolutely the first the first phase you would look at is the small animal testing the mice testing if you will and that's four weeks and and that's 100% in the hands of the government because you don't want the company that does the testing to be the same company that makes the vaccine so that that's the first stage and then you go into human clinical trials that process going forward now how soon how early in this process is gieux and your company actually start working on trying to come up with a vaccine for this particular virus so that's what that's interesting because I came back from Vietnam in January and I was reading the newspapers there we were doing some development for vaccines themselves I saw that there was this crisis occurring in China we hadn't yet called it Wuhan came back to our laboratory in Denver and and said could we have a vaccine for this and my business partner dr. starter said we're already working on that we tend to be ppreciate so we think ahead we we have a world map that says here's what the crises might be and so what we do is think about what will happen what do you need next so we were working on it and it takes us four weeks to make a vaccine your company was set up almost for this reason was it not or one of the things that this company does is make vaccines we make novel vaccines for threats we like to think of threat vaccines you've heard of swine flu of course but but we started making a swine flu vaccine several years ago we have we have everything from Ebola to to avian flu and so what we do is we create our own stockpile of vaccines then I hate to say put in the refrigerator but we prepare them so that if a crisis breaks out we have something that we're prepared to introduce into a government testing so was dr. Falchi correct I heard him talking to Congress saying about the phases of this development and there'd be about a year or so how soon in your estimation and your if you're optimistic about the process of your vaccine how soon would it possibly be if everything goes well and possibly be ready to go ahead and give to people who need it so I'm not going to contradict dr. pouchy because the the standard is 12 to 18 months from now okay what I would tell you is if you gave me an unlimited checkbook and unlimited time and and regulations that were appropriate for safety reasons probably the late fall probably first quarter of next year and this whole process is set up so once some as a vaccine available it is available to do what in terms of how it fights coronavirus well all vaccines do the same thing all vaccines simply make your body aware of this antigen that's in in the community and and a vaccines job is to get your body to create an automatic immune response so when you see the real thing your body goes now seeing that don't have to make you sick right and that's really all the vaccine does it where's your body to see something that's going to be in in their future and it Ward's it off because your body just says no I think I read somewhere that your company said something about being a provide and distribute this vaccine for free there's an interesting way I've had that question a lot so break it down this way the average cost of a vaccine is let's say $10 or bellison let's say we can make it for $1 a dose and and and and and so the question is what you want to be able to do is produce a vaccine of certain vaccines that belong to the community not your company all right so I could give you a better example which is let's assume we made an AIDS vaccine how much should I sell the AIDS vaccine for all right the answer is we have a responsibility as vaccine manufacturers to protect the world so when I say giveaway we essentially say cover our cost whatever that is when you cover our cost we can distribute that and then you choose who your distribution channel is if you don't choose to go with the w-h-o or HHS you might do it individually as a company well yeah that's a really interesting and welcome philosophy I really appreciate that thank you for coming in thank you good luck on this process going forward obviously a lot of people are depending and hoping that you can do this a lot of other people are in the pipe layer all working as well correct thank you good luck thank you very much I appreciate I will do that thank you just ahead
