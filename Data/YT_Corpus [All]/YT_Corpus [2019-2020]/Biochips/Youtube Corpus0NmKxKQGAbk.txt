 [Music] hi welcome to this particular module in a last module what we have seen we have seen the statistics about oral cancer and breast cancer right and in this module let us see the screening techniques so when I talk about oral cancer what are these screening techniques that are used to determine the cancer so if you see the slide what you see here is the imaging techniques and there are different end kind of imaging techniques first is autofluorescence second is optical Correns tomography or Oct next one is micro endoscopy narrowband imaging molecular based fluorescence imaging alright so these are the techniques that are used to screen based on imaging the challenges are that requires a specialized specialist to handle device and diagnosis low sensitivity or specificity difficult in imaging different sites not feasible for screening and surveillance of large volume high-risk population and finally it's a high cost now if you you see here oral cancer or a pre cancer region which is right over this region all right and it's kind of difficult to identify again if I talk about nanotechnology for bioimaging a biomarker detection for a cancer which was published in Journal of nano biotechnology recently then you can see that there are several techniques that are compared here and the pros and cons of each of those were mentioned in the article if we start from Oct then the nano contrast agents are biocompatible and provide approximately 150 increased contrast level there is an advantage however the disadvantage the limitation is the penetration depths are still limited and operating procedures are complicated if you talk about MRI then the the advantages they no contrast agents have prolong blood circulation half life and enhance selectivity next we relaxed CBT while the cons are the cost of MRI devices are high right so this is the MRI if you talk about acoustic imaging in that case nano sensors could effectively provide large photo acoustic signals in micrometastases such as lymph node disease however the real-time imaging is hard to realize when talk about surface plasmon resonance scattering then golden or particles could resonate scattered visible near infrared light due to their surface plasmon oscillations while the stability of target near a particle is difficult to control when we talk about surface and ends Raman spectroscopy the advantage here is that the use of nano rods with large aspect ratios can provide near infrared region plasma wavelengths and high index sensitivity but the limitation is in the types of non nano materials with SCRs effect are limited and probes are not easy to operate when you talk about nano based ultra sensitive biomarker detection the advantage is the sensitivity can enhance for detection of biomarkers with low concentration in tissue while the disadvantage single organs America cannot provide reliable diagnosis we talk about diffusion reflection imaging the use of GN ours is a promising method for scanning of malignant or encourage the essence but the disadvantage is that the diffusion reflection based imaging resolution is limited while when you talk about qts imaging we see that the quantum dots have high fluorescent density low nonspecific binding good disability against photo bleaching but the dissident is a cytotoxicity and mardik ability of quantum dots in vivo need to be improved so there are several techniques for auto cancer imaging but can we come up with an alternative method where we can quickly do Auto cancer imaging and which has more advantages and less of limitations and it is faster in terms of diagnosis but anyway this is just an information but when we talk about non Diagnostics for oral cancer sorry nano diagnosis for cancer then we have nano scale cantilevers which is elastic beam used to attach the cantilever linked molecules will actually see how we can fabricate micro piezo resistor micro cantilever in this particular lecture series we have cantilever array sensors with an ultra sensitive mat detection technology we have nano pores which are small holes as enable DNA passage once and at a time one strand at time and that is really interesting that's making DNA sequencing highly efficient we also have nanotubes these are carbon rods that can detect affected genes and also localize the location where contem does these glows very brightly in ultraviolet light they attached to proteins associated with cancer cells thus localizing tumors so interesting right and finally we have two more techniques Caban is called nano electromechanical systems like we have MEMS micro electromechanical systems we have names nano electromechanical systems alright so nano me electronic systems where convert the biochemical to electrical signal we will see a microwave MEMS based micro electromechanical systems based please urologist you please you resistive micro can t until ever all right please resist you might have and anyway so we will see in the slide somewhere how to fabricate those so in the finally multiplied similarity we're sensing large numbers of different biomolecules simultaneously we have several techniques right so what can we alternative technique what can be alternate technique that is our question now when you talk about examination procedures for breast cancers but women suffering from breast cancer then now you see one is all our adult women of all ages are encouraged to perform self breast self-exams breast self-exams i'm sorry at least once a month at least one seven i told you right for the abnormality in the breast then mammography this is every year for forty to fifty four and every two years 55 in about right so this is what is advised to go for mammography there are different techniques I like I told you one is MRI where you can see the suspected region there is a mammography and then there is a breast biopsy if there is suspected region I can see here right then the the patient is asked for for the biopsy but the tissue is taken out with the help of a biopsy needle and once the tissue is out then they go for different biomarkers like I said H any p63 a seminal estrogen prostration all right and when does hei Barbara as well and when all three biomarkers are absent is called triple negative breast cancer okay so once we discuss about this let us see what are the tools that we can fabricate that we can fabricate to understand the change in the tissue properties and to understand those chips or sensors you need to thoroughly listen to the earlier lectures where I taught lithography in detail mass gainer in detail which is used for fabricating masculine in a UV exposure right and you would understand the bulk micromachining and surface micromachining lectures right so this these those are my previous lectures which I finished and you would just go through those lectures once again to make sure that you understand when I say let us do soft lithography let us do hard lithography let us do soft making hard making exposure for photoresist coating positive photoresist negative photoresist brightful Masdar fill mask RIE DRI write different thermal evaporation you should immediately get idea that what we are talking about still I will show you the process flow so it becomes easier for you when we are looking at the chip design now if you see the original diagnosis of cancer greatly improves the odds of successful treatment many people is for especially in developing countries like access to facilities to detect disease and there's use demand of portable cancer diagnosis tool so when you say that how about oh we develop a chip we develop a chip right that can make that hair a micro heater that has or that is indicated with this is a micro heater okay micro heater this is a biochip MEMS based bio chip indicated with a micro heater indicated with p0 resistive sensors pzo resistive sensors and Electrical fences all right let us understand this process this process where we can develop or fabricate a MEMS based bio chip indicated with these three sensors one is we call Micro heater second is PC resistances and third one is electrical sensors and then we will see why we are developing such a system or such a such a bio chip and how it can measure the change in the tissue properties okay so I'll I'll just open a new slide all right and I'll start teaching you how to fabricate a micro heater followed by PC resistive sensors and followed by electrical sensors okay guys so let us see here alright so this everything this bio chip is made up made or fabricated on is fabricated on a silicon silicon is a substrate so the first step is I take a silicon substrate next step is to grow silicon dioxide correct because we cannot deposit from metal directly on silicon you know that so first is silicon next is grow silicon dioxide this we can grow silicon dioxide using thermal oxidation right thermal oxidation next step we are to what is the process what I am teaching you I am teaching you how to fabricate a micro heater alright so on this this becomes an oxidizer leak on ship right we will deposit a metal this is metal now since it is a heater we prefer microbe and I see are right this is silicon this is sio2 this is sio2 right next step next step is to spin coat photoresist right I had to I explained you this thing in it ah graph is it becomes leader I hope it becomes little bit easier for you to understand the process flow that I am drawing here this is positive photoresist this is my matter right this is my positive photoresist so I'll just use dots to represent it all right after positive photoresist what's the next step next step is pre-baked pre-baking at ninety degree centigrade for one minute on hot plate right when you do that after that next step is UV exposure right but we do you exposure what we have to do we have to load a mask load a mask such that will protect certain area and will etch the unwanted areas correct so we load a mask such that we are protecting the area and we want to add the remaining area that is unexposed now since it's a positive photoresist is a positive photoresist what did I taught you last time that if any use positive photoresist the unexposed region becomes stronger so this one is your mask if I exposed with UV UV light right what will happen the unexposed region will become stronger so if that is the case after that what is my next step my next step will be unloading the mask and what kind of mask this is this is a brightfield mask brightfield mask after exposure I had to go for photoresist developer I will dip the wafer in photoresist developer what will happen the unexposed region would be stronger and the exposed region would be weaker so silicon dioxide correct and then we have Micro and then we have photoresist as you can see the unexposed region is still there right after developing in photoresist developer and the expose region which is this region one two three four five and six exposed region got develop you got edged hmm after this next step is post baked post pig is done it 120 degree centigrade one minute on hot plate next step is after the next step is to dip the wafer or dip the afer dip in nichrome agent nichrome h or let's h the microbe what will happen if I dip this wafer in nichrome H and the photoresist that is here which protects the nichrome below it will keep protecting nichrome below it and the negra which is directly exposed will get edge so what will I have I'll have a wafer I'll have a wafer silicon dioxide is there silicon dioxide right nichrome but this is not correct because when you are etching it deny climate change what you will have you will have this structure right one two three four five let us draw it again right and this is your my chrome and over that what you will have over that you will have a photoresist right so this is your photoresist as you see the nichrome which was not protected by photoresist which was not protected by photoresist got edged hmm so this region what edge right in the neck Rome in this region courgettes this is my chrome and I CR then we have photoresist then we have sio2 we have silicon we have sio2 correct so after this what's the next step next step is that I will I will dip this wafer I will dip the Zephyr in acetone when I dip this wafer in acetone then the photoresist will get stripped off photoresist getting stripped off will give me will give me a wafer let me draw it again Isao to silicon sio2 and this is my micro what I am getting I have fabricated a micro heater I have fabricated a micro heater so if we quickly go once again through this slide what we see we took a silicon wafer right then we have grown silicon dioxide we have deposited metal using thermally operation then we have spin coat photoresist on it followed by a pre-baked right pre-baked is right over here and followed by a loading of brightful mask exposing with UV photoresist developing followed by a foetus is developing then what we have done we are done post wake right after post pic we have h the nichrome in a nichrome h end and once we do that then a nichrome will get h from the region which is not protected by photoresist and after that we are etching or stripping of the photoresist by dipping the wafer in acetone to get our micro heater to get our micro it so how this MEK rater looks like let us see that and then we will continue in the next module these are the micro meters which are fabricated on an oxidized silicon wafer and as you can see the each micro heater is the this one and talking about this one by this one is 1.5 by 1.5 millimeter and the width and the spacing is 100 micron by hundred micron so width when I talk is a coil width okay like this rate coil is going and then it goes here let's say it goes here like this this this is the spacing when I say if this is a coin this is the width and this is the spacing all right this is the width this is spacing width is hundred microns spacing is hundred micrometers 100 microns by hundred microns this is what is a what we have advocated micro heater and I have already told you how the fabrication of micro heater what is the process flow for that so in the next in the next lecture or module I'll teach you how to fabricate a piece of resistive sensors over micro heater because our idea is to have a micro heater or idea is to have a visual resistor and sensors or micro meter and on that we have to have electrical sensors right so this is these are stakes mystics okay so just please go through this particular lecture once again and I'll catch you in the next module where we will discuss more about how to fabricate the piezo resistances the ultimate idea is to once a biochip is ready how can you place the tissue and understand the change in the tissue property so this is all about understand anything into your body but we should require a sensor and that's what we are learning in this particular modules alright till then you take care I'll see you in the next class bye
