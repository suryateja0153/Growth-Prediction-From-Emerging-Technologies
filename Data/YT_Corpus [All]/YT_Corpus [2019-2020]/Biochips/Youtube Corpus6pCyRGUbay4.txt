next one which will be how to listen when god is speaking a guide for modern day catholics this is available at ewtnrc.com a religious catalog and it is item 1833 so i'll be starting next but right now we are continuing to study the holy eucharist using another book i wrote called the eucharist a bible study for catholics and that's also still available at ewtnrc.com where it is item number t1375 and today we are starting on page 99 where we are taking a look at the issues of the this last chapter which is the heavenly prototype for celebrating the mass we'll explain more of that as we go through i'd like us to start off with hebrews the letter to the hebrews chapter 8 beginning with verse 1 to 2. remember up to this point especially in chapter 7 6-7 hebrews is trying to show from scripture the old testament that jesus has a priesthood that is superior to the levites that is the priesthood of melchizedek then at this point in chapter 8 they begin a new argument and that will be to show how the sanctuary where jesus is a high priest is superior to the sanctuary in jerusalem so we begin in verse chapter 8 verse 1 to 2 where it says as a summary statement of the previous couple chapters now the main point in what we are saying is this we have such a high priest one who is seated at the right hand of the throne of the majesty in the heavens a minister in the sanctuary and the true tent that the lord and not any mortal has set up so first of all our high priest is seated at the right hand of the father this verse of being at the right hand of the fathers of god's majesty in heaven the true temple is seen as a fulfillment of psalm 110 verse 1 where it says the lord says to my lord sit at my right hand until i make your enemies your footstool now why highlight psalm 110 remember the messianic prophecy that you are a priest according to the order of melchizedek that prophecy is also in psalm 110 verse 4. but in psalm 110 verse 1 it also says that the messiah would be seated at the right hand of the majesty in heaven uh the the throne of majesty so he is in heaven now in judaism of the time of christ it was the levitical high priest so a high priest who came from the tribe of levi the clan of cohen which are the descendants of aaron the high priest and brother of moses that this levitical high priest was the only person in all of israel who could actually enter inside the holy of holies in the temple so there was the outer court for all israel it was another court for women then the outer court for all the israelite men then there was the holy place where the priests could go on a daily basis and that's when they offered sacrifices at the altar of incense and the altar of sacrifice but then there's another room at the back it was a cubic shaped room at the back of the temple building and in there was the ark of the covenant and two wooden cherubim who were covered with gold okay that's what was inside there now at the time of our lord as a matter of fact after the time of the babylonian exile the ark of the covenant was not in the holy of holies anymore it had gotten lost and its location is identified in the second book of maccabees as being hidden by the priest jeremiah remember jeremiah is a prophet and jeremiah was a priest he was both just like ezekiel ezekiel was a priest and a prophet and a number of other prophets were priests probably nahum probably habakkuk and a few others so the priest prophet jeremiah hid the ark of the covenant according to second maccabees on mount nebo which is now in the kingdom of jordan so of it's never been found not even by indiana jones he doesn't know where it is really and go don't go looking around in the warehouses in washington that's just in the movie all right now um so that the time of christ the holy of holies was empty but that's where the ark of the covenant was supposed to be and only the high priest could go there and he could go there only once a year on the feast of yom kippur and not only could he go into the holy of holies on that one day but when he was in there he was the only person in all of israel who was permitted to actually say the name of the lord nobody else could yet suppose he said i believed six times during the prayers but that was the only day he could say it the only ceremony in which he could say it and then he wasn't allowed to say it again and anybody else who spoke it could be executed for blasphemy it was a very serious thing that was their way of making sure that nobody took the name of the lord their god in vain they were very serious about that second commandment so the high priest as i said could go into the holy of holies once a year on the day of atonement now at this point we see a series of principles being stated about this priesthood and the sanctuary first first principle in hebrews chapter 8 verse 3 for every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices hence it is necessary for this priest also to have something to offer this is very important principle because it makes it clear that a priest is not merely a minister of the word you can have people that preach a matter of fact in the synagogues the rabbis did not have to be priests at all in fact most of the rabbis of the pharisee party were not from a priestly family they could be but most were not they were mostly from the tribe of judah not the tribal levi and what distinguishes the rabbi is that he is a minister of the word of god very important ministry don't want to underestimate that and to be able to explain the word of god is extremely important but it's not the same as a priest what distinguishes a priest from a rabbi is that the priest also offers sacrifices and this is one of the reasons that we catholics identify our priests as priests we do minister the word we can preach the word we proclaim the word of god and we should we have a moral obligation to preach the word of god but our main distinctive task is to offer sacrifice that's what priests do and it's very important for understanding what we do at mass second principle is stated in verse 4 chapter 8 verse 4 of hebrews now if he that is jesus were on earth he would not be a priest at all since there are priests who offer gifts according to the law so if he were still on earth then he would not be a priest because christ came from the tribe of judah no one from the tribe of judah was allowed to offer sacrifice in the temple they could bring a sacrifice and give it to a priest and the priest would do the offering but the members of the tribe of judah could not offer sacrifices in the temple it was absolutely forbidden and be blasphemous or sacrilegious at least but um he um so he's not that kind of priest that's very important third principle even though jesus could not offer a sacrifice if he was still on earth hebrews 8 verse 5 goes on to state the third principle that they that is the levitical priests offer worship in a sanctuary that is a sketch and shadow of the heavenly one for moses when he was about to erect the tent was warned see that you make everything according to the pattern that was shown you on the mountain now what is this about that this is going back to exodus 25 beginning um with verse 1 where it says the lord said to moses tell the israelites to take for me an offering from all whose hearts prompt and to give you shall receive the offering for me this is the offering that you shall receive from them gold silver and bronze blue and purple and crimson yarns and fine linen goats hair tanned rams skins fine leather acacia wood oil for the lamps spices for the anointing oil and the freight and for fragrant incense onyx stones and gems to be set in the f wood and for the breastpiece and have them make me a sanctuary so that i may dwell among them in accordance with all that i show you concerning the pattern of the tabernacle and it's all its furniture so shall you make it now the people are supposed to bring their most precious objects and raw materials gold silver precious stones and excellent materials for weaving yarns of diff of different colors and of course leathers to be the top to prevent from um you know rain from coming in so this is what what they're told to do and then in verse four that moses is to build it according to what he sees and he has a vision of heaven and what he sees in heaven is the original the prototype and what he is told to build on earth is a miniature model of what he saw in heaven so think about that next time you read the book of revelation because the book of revelation is a vision that occurs in heaven when he's there and that this vision on of heaven in the book of revelation shows the real sanctuary and it has an altar of incense and it has the lamb seated on the right hand of god the father this is portrayed there the picture in the book of revelation is of the heavenly temple but the temple that was built on earth was a model of that heavenly prototype what does that indicate that the temple in jerusalem as beautiful as it was even the romans admired the building tremendously and they looked up when the general titus conquered jerusalem in 70 a.d he gave his soldiers an order not to destroy the temple he wanted to use it for a roman temple a pagan temple but they burned it anyway so that's what's going on there and this brings out that the temple in heaven to which jesus has ascended is superior to the temple on earth the one on earth is a small model the one in heaven is the prototype the original and that's where jesus is and that is why in verse 6 it says but jesus has now obtained a more excellent ministry and to that degree he is the mediator of a better covenant which has been enacted through better promises so this is laying out the last principle that we have to deal with that here in verse six it's a better priesthood it's more excellent than the old covenant and it's more excellent promises than were given in the old testament that's the basic issue here and this is something that we then have to understand so what we'll do we'll take a little break now and we'll take a look at how hebrews continues to explain why they're claiming that jesus is a better priest with a better covenant and a better sanctuary with better promises and that fulfilled the old and bring on the news so please stay with us [Music] [Music] okay so we're starting off with that principle um in uh here in hebrews uh six that jesus begins a more excellent covenant and he's a priest who mediates it better and it's better promises what's his evidence well in hebrews 8 verse 7 and following he quotes a prophecy from jeremiah 31 verses 31 to 34. he says as a again as a statement of principle in chapter 8 verse 7 for if that first covenant had been faultless there would have been no occasion for a second so if the first covenant at mount sinai was so perfect it would need a second covenant but then he quotes jeremiah after that and this is where it says in jeremiah 31 verse 34 and quoted here for he does find fault with them when he says the days are surely coming says the lord when i will make a new covenant with the house of judah it will not be like the covenant that i made with their ancestors when i took them by the hand to bring them out of egypt a covenant that they broke though i was their husband says the lord but this is the covenant i will make with the house of israel after those days it says the lord i will put my law within them and i will write it on their hearts and i will be their god and they shall be my people no longer shall they teach one another say to each other know the lord for they shall all know me from the least of them to the greatest says the lord for i'll forgive their iniquity and remember their sin no more so notice how that opens up for the days will come says the lord when i will establish a new covenant with the house of israel in the house of judah that's what you see in romans 8 verse 8 that i will and that means that the old covenant is done and that a new one has to begin when jeremiah wrote that what was going on um you know why why did jeremiah you know present this promise of a new covenant well for exactly what hebrews 8 13 said that he that the new covenant christ treats the first covenant as obsolete okay that it was it wasn't faultless and there had to be a second one and the reason was this the israelites broke the covenant by their disobedience this is what jeremiah is talking about jeremiah had begun to prophesy in 627 bc and his first prophecies about a reform of israel were effective under king josiah but when king josiah was killed in battle 18 years later in 609 then he led to another set of problems and his sons were fools and we see that in 598 one group of exiles was taken from jerusalem to babylon and the new king zedekiah one of the sons of josiah the new king was a big fool he kept going from the pro-babylonian party to the pro-egyptian party they were divided up into parties he kept switching sides because he wanted to be a nice guy that compromises with everybody and it ended up with when when he finally went with the bat the pro-egyptian party and the egyptians could not help as jeremiah had warned and as the priest prophet ezekiel had also warned at that point both jeremiah and ezekiel said that you broke the covenant it's over you people are worshiping other gods you've been doing it for centuries you won't stop your sins and when the babylonians did attack and the lord said look set your slaves free set all the slaves free and then i'll protect you so they did and then the babylonians left yay what did they do they put the slaves back into slavery that's it you're done your word means nothing typical of political things and so this is what uh happened to them that's why the covenant got broken now the breakability of the covenant is built into it because we see that what is underlying this a principle underlying all this is that the covenant that the lord made at mount sinai is a conditional covenant it is a conditional covenant god will keep his side on the condition that you do your part that's the way the covenant was set up at mount sinai if you read exodus chapter 19 verse 5 and 6 when the lord offers them the covenants before they make the covenant that's when he first offers it to him in exodus 19 verse 5 it says now therefore if you obey my voice and keep my covenant you shall be my treasured possession out of all the peoples indeed the whole earth is mine but you shall be for me a priestly kingdom and a holy nation these are the words that you shall speak to the israelites so if you hear my voice and obey me and do the covenant well i'll i'll do all the stuff for you and moses goes back up the mountain tells the lord yeah they're willing so he gets the ten commandments and the other laws and he comes down and reads it to them in exodus 24 and in exodus 24 twice it says the people respond to reading the law they say to the lord all that the lord has said we will do and obey so they promise to do and obey it that's when moses and only then moses killed 12 bulls one bull from each tribe of israel and and takes the blood and sprinkles it on the altar half of it on the altar he pours and half he sprinkles on the people and he says in exodus 24 verse 8 behold the blood of the covenant which the lord has made with you concerning all these words so that's this you agreed i agree and this is the blood of the covenant we have this oath throughout their 40 years in the wilderness they were very disobedient finally at the end of the 40 years they're on the doorstep of entering the promised land and in deuteronomy chapter 4 verse 1 and 2 moses said so now israel give heed to the statutes and ordinances that i'm teaching you to observe so that you may live to enter and occupy the land that the lord the god of your ancestors has given you you must neither add anything to what i command you nor take away anything from it but keep the commandments of the lord your god with which i am charging you so this again is stating the condition of obedience then again in chapter 7 of deuteronomy beginning with verse 9 moses again says to the people know therefore that the lord your god is god the faithful god who maintains covenant loyalty with those who love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations and who repays in their own person those who reject him that's the condition if you obey he'll keep the covenant for a thousand generations if you reject him he will reject you as a matter of fact he says he does not delay but repays in their own person those who reject him that's the conditions again in chapter 8 of deuteronomy you shall remember the lord your god for it is he who gives you the power to get wealth so that he may confirm his covenant that he swore to your ancestors as he is doing today if you forget the lord your god and follow other gods to serve and worship them i solemnly warn you today that you shall surely perish like the nations that the lord is destroying before you so shall you perish because you would not obey the voice of the lord your god it's a conditional covenant you have to obey this is repeated a number of other places in deuteronomy 29 verses 9 to 29 deuteronomy 31 verses 16 to 21 leviticus 26 old chapter all of that repeats the conditional nature but they didn't keep the conditions that's why the king was taken into exile in 598 bc and then his uncle zedekiah continued this and in 587 not only was he blinded his first of all he had to watch his own sons get killed last thing he saw because then they they blinded him and then they destroyed jerusalem and the temple everything was destroyed and they all went off into exile in babylon it was a conditional covenant and jeremiah the priest prophet and ezekiel the priest prophet both stated this happened because you broke the covenant the covenant is done but the lord will give you a new covenant next week we'll take a look at the promise by both priest prophets ezekiel and jeremiah on the promise of a new covenant that jesus fulfills so stay with us for that now it is time for the hard sayings of jesus we had got a question in this saying i know that jesus doesn't really want us to hate our family and our own life as he says in luke 14 26 how can we get to the point in our lives where we love jesus more than our earthly family okay a couple things um we let's just take a look at luke 14. we'll just do 25 and 26 where it says now large crowds were traveling with jesus and he turned and said to them whoever comes to me and does not hate father and mother wife and children brothers and sisters yes even life itself cannot be my disciple whoever does not carry the cross and follow me cannot be my disciple so that is one of his principles for that that's necessary it's a condition for us being a disciple i want to make a couple distinct this is in part an issue of the um words a lot of people have trouble with why i say hate um in the old testament only a few places use the word hate sana in order to mean detest like psalm 139 where it says do i not hate those that hate you o lord and do i not loathe those that rise up against you i hate them with the perfect hatred i count to my enemies and he wants the lord to wipe him out so he detest that's not but most often far more often what we see is that the word hate is used in the old testament as meaning um love somebody else less get a classic example in genesis 29 verse 30. so jacob went into rachel also and he loved rachel more than leah and served his father-in-law for another seven years when the law when the lord saw that leah was hated he opened up a womb now here's the point with that that it says in first first jacob loved rachel more than leah leah was apparently cross-eyed and you know the the name leah means cow uh it's not the it's not a hebrew word for cow it's and uh a canadian word for cow while rachel means you e-w-e um uh this is something that uh is possible uh you know that i don't know who names their daughter cow but sheep is a little bit better but anyway um he didn't like her as well she wasn't as pretty and he just didn't fall in love with leah like he did with um rachel but the lord said oh see he doesn't like her as much so he hates her see how they use the words and it shows up in proverbs 13 he who spares the rod hates his son but who loves him is diligent to discipline them so and it's not hate you know a lot of people don't discipline their children not because they really detest them they want their children to be their friends and that's a mistake they're your child my father used to say make your own friends i'm your father you know and that there's wisdom in that later on as adults we became friends but as little children you know that is my buddy you know it was i made my own friends and you know if you don't like your son you won't discipline them it's a sign of lack of love that's the sense that to if you don't love one then you hate the elder uh that's what our lord is saying when it comes to our families of course we cherish them we serve them we care for them but we also have to be alert to this sometimes family members will try to live out their lives through the lives of the children and where they didn't have their dream come true they want their child to do it so when i was one years old i got a train electric train set i couldn't play with it it was my dad's dream and there were photographs of him playing with it he never had one so he played with mine and that was him living out his dream uh with my i thought i enjoy i was glad that he i always in all the pictures i'm happy that he's playing with it didn't bother me but because i couldn't but it's that's just a little example of how parents sometimes try to live through their children that's wrong the role of parents is to help their children find out what the lord god is asking of them and we as children or as parents have to make a determination i'm not here in order to live out my parents dreams i'm put on this earth to serve the lord with my whole heart mind and soul and my main task in life is to get to heaven and to do that i should seek the vocation god wants me to have whether my parents like it or not and in that way we still can love our parents to be sure but we love christ more and we follow the vocation he gives us to the best of our ability in fact that'll be some of what we talk about when we get to the next book after we finish this study on the eucharist how do we know god's will oh how do we discern that but that would be the way that we say i'm going to serve god honor my mother and father but my main job is to serve god and if it comes if they if any adult puts it in the way of a child that if you love me you'll do this and not do what god asks you then they are being wrong they are not being good parents in fact they may be bad parents finally helping the kid to listen to god and find the vocation that the lord has for them is the greatest help that a parent can give a child as they help them get towards heaven all right let's take a break come back we have some callers and some email questions so please stay with us [Music] do [Music] all right we have a caller online michael where are you calling from from michigan great great what part of michigan um i'm outside detroit okay i draw my alma maters university of detroit is where i graduated yeah i went there i need to tell you i was taught at my high school and at the university of detroit by you jesuits okay thank you thank you what can we do for you today i am ill at home although nowhere near as ill or sick as i i believe our lord became due to his push on the cross and i wonder sometimes if i'm doing enough because i can say the rosary and divine mercy i must stay at home i can't drive so i might do smaller amount of things than other people but if that is what the lord is asking for me i'm very happy with that yeah i'd like your opinion on that sure here's one of the things michael because it would be um possible uh to maybe use your isolation not to be so isolated would it be possible for you to work with folks at your parish to start a prayer group on line or on you know like on youtube or um to use um one of the other social media or telephone the old-fashioned way and to have people that you can also call so that while your prayer you know is something that i think that's a great thing but you can also look to get other folks involved in your prayer and in that way you would also be inspiring other people homebound or not right now with the covert problems a lot more people stuck at home who aren't even sick but they need something else we need to do a lot of prayer there's a lot of tension still in the country that would be a good thing also another thing that i've heard from plenty of homebound people is that they do things like make rosaries and scapulars and help get them out to people say in prison or other places where there's need these would be a few things that i would recommend to you so that you could then also get involved with other people some people can um you know again visiting these days it's not so easy and uh for a variety of reasons with the covet um but to find some other ways to be creative and that you do your prayer and maybe you know various abstaining things again watch mind your health i don't know your health conditions so mind that with your doctor but also go ahead and check this check out the possibility of doing this with some other folks okay that'd be my suggestion let's uh now go over to something we've got a youtube viewer sends a question says dear father mitch is it possible that there are people who are unable to just understand the scriptures and understand um and unable to receive god's grace i know of an atheist friend who says that he has tried but he's just unable to freddie well freddie you know here's one of the things first the ability to understand everything in the scripture is not necessary for salvation it's not it is a wonderful wonderful aid but think about people who have various learning dis uh disabilities and they cannot you know um understand because of those learning disabilities they can't understand the scriptures they're not excluded from salvation and with your friend i don't know what is his difficulty but my own sense would be for him to examine his own conscience what is it that makes it so difficult to understand the scriptures what is the the itch that you don't know how to scratch i would ask him to to in search in his own heart for what that is anybody can do that anybody can and whether he understands the scriptures or not he can and needs to understand the love of god for him that his act of faith is a faith in god's love whether he understands scripture or not and this would be and you might be able to help him freddie you might be able to help him out with that to know what is it that's bothering you and be there to be his friend and support him in investigating this so that would be my my own suggestion we're going to have another caller hello william hi father mitch happy event thank you where are you calling from i'm calling from lake charles louisiana oh you all have gotten it pretty hard this year haven't you yes i'm so sorry you know i i like that area i passed through there regularly and i know your bishop he's a good man um yeah so what what can uh we do for you today i have a question about the lord's prayer and i'd like to know if it's okay to say or pray for the last two petitions and do not lead us into temptation but deliver us from the evil one amen uh-huh well uh so let us so you want to say do not lead us instead of just lead us not right what's the difference oh i don't think there is a difference no yeah you know you're all you're doing is uh uh do you know any greek no i don't you know because what you're doing is just trying to come up with a translation of your own here you know that would be do not lead us into temptation would be a legitimate translation um in english it's not the the one thing that would be different is when you pray with other people that they won't say the words that you say and you won't say the words that they say and the our father has a communal quality to it that's why we say our father we're praying this together it's lead us not so if you're gonna be able to do that um you know it'd be very important to um uh you know to to if you're gonna pray with other people um use the same words they do or else somebody's going to get tripped up it'd be sort of like dancing with the lady and you start doing a fox trot well she's still doing the walls going to step on her feet so i wouldn't change that too much just leave it so you can pray with other folks okay all right and then we have an email from xavier and this says father mitch you mentioned that catholics have a foundation for the eucharist and communion in the old testament with the passover prefiguring it do protestants also look to the old testament for foundation for their communion services or not and why well see xavier you're talking about 45 000 different groups and they don't have a united view on the eucharist in fact it's very important to keep in mind that what divided the first protestants from each other luther from zwingli then calvin separating himself from luther and swingling both them not liking him and then a variety of other people what divided them in that great history of the eucharistic doctrine by darwil stone is that they could not agree on what the eucharist meant so for some protestants and i would imagine this would be more true for people like high church anglicans and high church episcopalians they would see that link with the passover but those who are what they call low church those who don't celebrate the eucharist and are not very liturgical they tend not to see a link with the eucharist so it depends with the passover sorry they tend not to so or a minimal one but it really varies with which protestant you're talking to and then uh from rose you have a question uh hello father mitch my question refers to one of the ten commandments keeping the sabbath holy why do we celebrate the sabbath on sunday are we changing the commandment thank you father from rose well we've changed the day not the commandment what's happened is that the sabbath is now understood not as the last day of creation remember in the old testament it's the end of the creation but as we're going through in today's program we're talking about this new covenant in christ and by that new covenant he establishes a new uh relationship so the old covenant was abrogated they broke it uh in the old testament but christ starts a new one and so we celebrate the day of the new creation that is the day of his rising from the dead christ rose from the dead on sunday and we see in throughout the new testament john has his revelation on a sunday the lord's day in first corinthians 16 that they come together on sunday pentecost was on a sunday easter was a sunday jesus meets the apostles on a series of sundays after easter and that becomes the day that we celebrate that we are a new creation in christ exactly as second corinthians chapter five describes and it's the sabbath of the new creation that we celebrate on sunday the day of christ's resurrection all right lord bless you all and keep you and give you a wonderful advent season the father the son and the holy spirit amen and again we ask you to keep us in between your gas bill electric bill and cable bill we'll be able to pay our bills and keep bringing these programs to you thank you [Music] you
