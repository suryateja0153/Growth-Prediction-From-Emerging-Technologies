 [Music] hi welcome to this module in this model what we will see we will see how can we deposit a gold pad over the PISA resistor material so if you see the slide until the last module what we have seen how can we deposit visit resistor material on inter digitated electrodes which are fabricated on a silicon dioxide insulator below which there is a micro heater so let me teach you today how can we have this gold pan on the piezo resistor material but before that if you have a piezo resistive material so I'll draw it here the wafer right with a pistol resistive material and the heater and then introduce electrodes love you should also know quickly when you want to draw it is the con dioxide it's always good to repeat whenever we draw the process flow so it it becomes kind of repetitive way of training your brain okay if you understand the [Music] artificial intelligence and machine learning you will see that the iterations number of time the system is trained the better the accuracy and then when you go for testing you will understand that your system shows a way better accuracy if you have the samples which you contain it for a long time so my point is whenever I am drawing a schematic I always try to speak but you should also try to understand and speak along with the slides it becomes easier and you are training your brain faster okay so this is a nichrome is a heater silicon dioxide with what which which technique PECVD so the conductor will be technique thermal oxidation silicon wafer is that and then this is my chrome using PVD and then we have pattern using photolithography over that you have inter digitated electrodes right like this which is made up of chrome gold right made up of chrome gold there is design here like this and then over this what you have you have piece of resistive material P there is two but now next step is we have to deposit a gold pad on this piece of the disturb article but if I deposit gold pair dad Cleon the visitors - material it will be shorted so what will I do I will first deposit or grow silicon dioxide on this piece of resistive material so in fact let me change the color so that it becomes little bit easier I'll have a silicon dioxide layer on the PISA resistive material the silicon dioxide is deposited using PECVD right because I want to have an insulating layer have an insulating layer between the goal pad and the PISA resistive material what is this material p0 resistive material what is this Chrome gold chrome world is pattern in which design what is the design of the chrome cold inter digitated electrodes okay easy now pecvd so pecvd so that means we have silicon dioxide now what we have to do we have to open the silicon dioxide or we have to open the contact which is this region and this region and we had to protect the remaining region right for that what can I do I had to do a lithography so I will go for a little graph a technique in which in which we will spin coat positive photoresist and after spin coating positive photoresist we will go for soft wake 90 degree one minute hot plate right on that we will load the mask now what I want to do and to open only this region and he meaning region I want to protect my silicon dioxide so if I want to open this region and even in region if I want to protect it then I had to go for a dark field mask I took over a dark field mask this is my dark field mask hmm after that film ask I will expose the wafer with UV light and expose the wafer with UV light okay after this what will happen that when I dip this wafer in of photoresist developer if I dip this wafer in a photoresist developer the photoresist so I'll just show it right down here the photoresist will be there in all the region except the contact area because the unexposed region in case of the positive photoresist will be stronger right so I will have photoresist in this area now what is my goal my goal is to remove silicon dioxide from the contact of the inter digitated electrodes and heater electrodes or heater context right so in the next step after this would be to to do the hard bit hard bake let's see if even if I miss it is assumed that whenever you use photoresist you have to do soft bake you have to do hard make okay however I'll try not to miss so don't worry so after this we perform hard baking and after her baking our next step would be to dip the wafer in buffer hydrofluoric acid buffer hydrofluoric acid if I dip the wafer in buffer hydrofluoric acid then what will happen I'll have silicon dioxide protected only in the region which is protected by photoresist I'll have silicon dioxide left only in the region which was protected by my positive photoresist okay next step is next step is we have to strip off the photoresist so what will I do I will then dip the wafer in acetone so once I dip the wafer in acetone what will happen my positive photoresist will will strip off I'm a positive photoresist is strip off now or this I want gold pad over this I want to do a pattern a gold ped so what will I do I'll just remove this things so I hope that until here it's easy for you that we have deposited a silicon dioxide using PECVD and then we have pattern it such that we can get silicon dioxide on all the region except the contact region the next step is to deposit gold pad only in this region all right and contacts in this region context in this region because it will improve the thickness of the contact layer and if the thickness of the contact layer increases or it the thickness is more the better if you understand what are the ohmic contact and rectifying contact you even understand why the thickness of the metal is important or is related to the contact now over this because you want a gold pad we will deposit gold using PVD physical body position when I say cold it is assumed that there is a thin layer of chrome below gold right after this the next step would be that I will deposit ah photoresist which is my positive photoresist and then over the photoresist after positive photoresist Pincott I not deposit I'll spin coat the photoresist and after spin coating photoresist I'll go for soft lithography this is correct word no it's not correct but it's not soft lithography it is soft bake right after spin coating my positive photoresist I'll go for soft bake and when I go for soft big I will then follow with loading the mask and my mask is such that it will protect because it's a positive photoresist I want to have a bright field mask which will protect the region in the way I'm showing you right now so the region which is dark here right because there is a positive photoresist this region will not expose the wafer with UV so if I use UV here for exposing the wafer you can see that the dark area will not be exposed and the gold below the dark area will be protected so if I use UV light to expose the wafer and then I perform a photoresist developer then what will I have I'll have I will have my photoresist only only in this area this area and this this is my positive photoresist right after that had to go for hard big hard big R big is done it 121 minute hot plate after that next step is you have to dip the wafer in chrome H and followed by gold agent chrome agent followed by gold etchant when you do that what will have when you dip the wafer in a chrome H and followed by gold legend what you will have is this pattern right and then the next step is to strip off the photoresist so I will dip the wafer in acetone when I dip the wafer in acetone my positive photoresist will be stripped off will be stripped off thus I have a gold pad on interdigitated electrode which has a Pisa resistive material got it easy it's very easy right so when I have this then I will get my this design without su-8 pillars these four dots that you can see are su-8 pillars over gold pad right so if I follow this schematic what we have seen we are taken a silicon wafer this is oxidized silicon substrate this is a nichrome we have an insulator we open the contact of the insulator and fabricate interdigital electrodes over that we have busy resistive material then we have insulator we open the contact like this context this one right eight of those this one this one and then we deposit a gold and pattern it so we are on step number seven right now the next time in the next module what I will teach I'll teach how can you fabricate the su-8 pillars which are right over here and followed by how can you make those pillars conductive when you do that you had to go for one most process one more process where you have to create a diaphragm and that will be the end of how to design a biochip MEMS based scholarship which will consist of and a microliter interdigital electrodes piezoresistive material electrical sensors right and and then you'll see why we have taken so much pain to understand this particular design and how can we use this design to understand the change in the tissue property as cancer progresses right then you go through this lecture and I'll see you in the next module
