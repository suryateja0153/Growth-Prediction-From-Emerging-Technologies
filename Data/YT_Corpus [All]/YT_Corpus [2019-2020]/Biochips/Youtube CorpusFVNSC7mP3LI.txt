 this is a list of planets that appear in the Vorkosigan saga a series of science fiction novels and short stories by lois mcmaster bujold topic acelin predominantly agricultural planet connected to the Hagin hub which is its only route to the rest of the galaxy never seen first hand in the saga topic athos a planet with an exclusively male population with is somewhat isolated and remote within the wormhole Nexus the homeworld of dr. Ethan okert in the novel ethan of athos the population is maintained by obtaining over from human ovarian cultures bought and brought by the founders combining them with the father's semen and incubating the resulting fetus in the ubiquitous uterine replicator which appears throughout the stories naturally only male babies are born the old culture started to die out and the new batch was bought long distance the receipt of a fake shipment sends ethan off-planet to find what happened to the proper shipment and into the center of a plot involving Barry Aaron and Selig and and agents most of the men form permanent or semi-permanent relationships to help in raising children whose birth must be approved by local committees some men variously become confirmed bachelors monks of a sort the planet is named for the Mount Athos in Greece which is home to monasteries where no women are allowed topic barrier a planet with a feudal military culture home world of protagonist Miles Vorkosigan it is an earth-like planet with a 26.7 hour a day but it's native vegetation is inedible and sometimes dangerous for humans and earth descended life terraforming is necessary for settlement indeed the settlers dislike of the vegetation is shown in the choice of names bloody puff weed and razor grass being among them it has two major continents as well as islands in its oceans since there are areas of Arctic like climate as well as temperate zones with winter snow it has to be assumed that there are also polar oceans and/or land masses under ice caps geographical diversity is similar to the earth with flat Plains high mountains swamps and river valleys size population barrier itself has a very small population relative to many other planets in the universe the exact number is not mentioned in the novels but there are known to be 60 districts each with a count in charge and some districts at least have populations measured in the millions thus a total planetary population of 60 to 120 million seems likely in addition barrier and casualties during the setting and an occupation are described as being about 5 million which would be disastrous in a population of 50 million or less compared to Paraguay's losses during the Paraguayan war compare this to Old Earth with a population in the billions the original settlement of Bury are comprised about 50,000 people languages for languages are spoken in Bury are English French Russian and Greek all heavily dialect alized Greek speakers are somewhat disparaged as Greek II Hicks by the rest of the population and they are reputed to be very conservative economy barriers planetary economy is mostly based upon agriculture though the role of Industry has grown since the selig and an invasion the Periyar and Empire draws most of its revenue from trade passing through the wormholes in Comair in space barriers economy is weak by the standards of many other planets the currency of the planet is the we are an imperial mark which is worth about 1/4 of a Bedan dollar regarded as the hardest currency in the nexus government Berea is the main planet of the barrier an empire an empire with hereditary succession its governmental system is largely unwritten and is largely based on Earth's it is led by an emperor with supreme and absolute power there is also a legislative body known as the Council of counts which largely controls the barrier an empires finances and is somewhat parallel to the traditional British House of Lords each member of the 60-man Council of counts controls a district or a large sized slice of the planet for instance count Vorkosigan controls the Vorkosigan district there is also a council of ministers which controls the executive functions of the government and other formal and informal advisors to the Emperor history not much is known at this time about barrier in history but it appears that some time after the first colonists arrived the wormhole that allowed him contact with the rest of the galaxy closed isolating them on barrier during the time of isolation wars were frequent with the vol fighting among themselves until Emperor dorka that--just united barrier under his rule these centuries of warfare made barrier and culture very militaristic as did the invasion from set agenda that occurred about 20 years after the end of the time of isolation the occupation period continued for around 20 more years costing about 5 million barrier and lives after the set of Ganon's were defeated barrier was determined not to allow this to happen again and conquered coma the planet that controlled the only wormhole that allowed access to barrier the co Marin's had accepted bribes from the setting and ins to allow their invasion fleets to pass through the wormhole this gave bury are a very militaristic reputation in the rest of the civilized galaxy not unlike Prussia or pre-1945 Japan culture there are four major ethnic groups on beary are descended from Russian French English and Greek forebears presumably to be found among the original colonists the Greeks are an explicit minority on back and it appears that Russian is the predominate culture based on the number of barrier and cultural aspects that mirror or I derived from Russian culture an example would be the prevalence of Baba Yaga in barrier in folklore however it appears that English serves as the predominant language with the three others forming minority tongues in the novel Brothers in Arms Miles Vorkosigan is described as switching from his nasal bed an accent which he affects in order to play the part of the mercenary admiral naismith to the guttural barrier an accent when he reports into the barrier an embassy in London on earth indicating that the primary languages of beta colony and barrier are the same barrier in writing is described in the novel Cordelia's honor as consisting of curlicues but he's apparently latin-based rather than Cyrillic like Russian in a civil campaign Myles shows a kateri invoice west on a saddle emblem combing the letters B and K around the letter V symbolizing the union of the names verb era and Vorkosigan in the marriage of miles grandfather prata to Aliyev or bearer berry our own culture is feudal dominated by a military caste known as the war headed by an emperor and 60 counts each governing a district on Berea the title of count is derived from accountant since the original counts were tax gatherers counts in their Liege subjects have reciprocal duties and obligations to each other members of the vol class have the syllable bore prepended to the original surname the original surnames were mostly Russian the result is somewhat similar to the use of Vaughn for the junker class in Prussia in the 19th century the entire set up is not unlike early Meiji era Japan particularly since Berea was isolated from the rest of the known galaxy for many centuries and devolved into a quasi medieval level of Technology modernization is proceeding rapidly at the time of the Vorkosigan saga but at the price of a great deal of culture shock while the cities are modern much of rural barrier is still not too different from conditions in the time of isolation bury errands have many customs inherited from the time of isolation in which Society was agrarian and semi-feudal berry our encounter cosas filty from the residents of their districts and their personal bodyguards known as arms Minh the oath of the resident is necessarily less formal and personal than that of an Arms Minh and may consist simply of signing a document thanks to enlightened legislation pushed through by count Vorkosigan residents can easily switch their oaths to another district causing counts to compete with each other to improve the living conditions of residents the oath of an Arms Minh or other vassal is necessarily more formal and direct it is taken in the same manner as was practiced in Europe during feudalism with the hands placed between those of the individual administering the oath the firstborn son in a family inherits any titles and family wealth upon the death of his father no matter how many older sisters he has the eldest son is also the legal guardian of his brothers children in the event of the brother's death a fact which complicates the life of Eckhart Aaron Voss Wesen after the death of her husband Etienne on coma Etienne had no living brothers so the guardianship went to his cousin Vasily the nearest male relative of the same generation the eldest son is typically given the first name of the paternal grandfather and the first name of the maternal grandfather as a middle name however in the case of Miles Vorkosigan his paternal grandfather Cotter Pierre Vorkosigan refused to permit this due to Miles Vorkosigan extreme POV barrier and culture deformity the answer was to name miles after his maternal grandfather miles Naismith the second son however also gains a name this is the middle name of the maternal grandfather followed by the middle name of the paternal grandfather thus the individual brought up as a clone of miles and thus effectively miles identical twin brother would have a name according to miles you do have a name you are mark Pierre Vorkosigan sorry about the Pierre grandfather always hated it thus it can be inferred that this innate grandfather's full name was miles mark Naismith Barry Aaron's will sacrifice an item in a small fire to memorialize a dead person the item may be a lock of hair a memento or an item specially made the most important time for this is at a funeral where the eldest son is expected to light the fire for his father but bury errands may burn an offering for anyone at any time as an act of remembrance or a personal catharsis at a funeral close friends and other family members will add their own items to the pyre Miles Vorkosigan sacrifices have included an illuminated copy of his graduation certificate from the military academy for his dead grandfather general Plata a lock of his hair for a baby killed in the backcountry whose murder he investigated and an offering to one of the victims of the coma and Massacre for which his father is blamed he also burns offerings for and talks to Constantine both re his childhood bodyguard and surrogate father some bury our own families especially the old war arranged marriages for their children using a go-between known as a barber these are old women and at the highest levels they are professionals who guard their reputations Eckert Aaron Voss Westlands first marriage was arranged this way although she had the right to refuse ed en after at Ian's death she is shocked and elated to receive a proposal which she at first imagines to come from Miles Vorkosigan traditionally after the death of her husband a woman would not entertain suitors for a year she would signal this by wearing black apart from allowing her to recover from being widowed this was designed to ensure that any child born after the husband's death would be clearly his and not that of any other man significant locations on bury are vorb our Sultana the capital of Berea and the entire Imperium a good deal of the story takes place here each count maintains a residence in the city and this is also where the Emperor generally resides the Emperor's official palace in the city of war bar Sultana the building's architecture is very new in some part yet old in others this is because as one Emperor succeeded the previous new rooms and wings were built it features a main ballroom stables Imperial quarters a large courtyard style garden and a system of secret underground tunnels the underground tunnels act as an escape route if the building comes under attack Vorkosigan house

better air filtration systems and secure water and food supplies m/sec is the branch of the Imperial military primarily concerned with the security of the Emperor and the Imperium mostly m/sec consists of analysts and cupboard operatives however since m/sec is the Emperor's last resort they can requisition whatever forces they need the caravan Surrey is near the centre of the old part of or Bar Sultana and this area used to be a bit of poverty but during the timeline of the series has undergone some but not much renovation Vorkosigan district the district that the counts Vorkosigan administer as all districts on Barry are is named after the family surname there are a few cities and a great multitude of towns and villages in the district which is largely agricultural and rural a notable feature of the district is the Dendera mountain range which was used as a bolt hole by plotter Vorkosigan and a company of soldiers against the invading sarig and ins during voir darienne's pretender ship Cordelia Naismith hid in the mountains with Gregor to evade capture and assassination miles named the Dendera free mercenary fleet after the mountain range Haase da is the capital of Vorkosigan district and contains the administrative offices of the counts govern as well as higher educational and medical facilities it became district capital after Selig and ins destroyed former

worst posting in the entire empire during the long winter night the permanent staff suffer from boredom relieved only by alcohol in the summer when trainees arrived the permanent staff scrambled to keep the raw recruits alive in an environment consisting of sudden violent storms and tundra bogs that can swallow vehicles whole instant Miles Vorkosigan was posted to the island as weather officer

most complicated life-form outside the domes is a genetically modified peat moss there is also a large orbital mirror which increases amount of sunlight actually hitting the planet the terraforming program and the orbital mirror are major plot points in the book coma coma has strategic importance because it's local space contains the single known wormhole into barrier the heart of the barrier

barrier enforces pored through the wormhole to invade coma for three main reasons one the Barons wanted to be able to control their own wormhole entrance so coma could not again let enemy forces into barrier in space point to the barrier ins understood that coma and trade would be very helpful in regaining revenue for the barrier in Imperium also this would allow barrier to contend with other powerful Galactic markets such as that of beta colony or the Hagen hub point three the war of barrier wanted revenge on coma for allowing the powerful said again an invasion forced through two barrier
