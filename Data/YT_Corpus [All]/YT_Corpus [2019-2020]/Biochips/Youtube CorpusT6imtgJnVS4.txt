healthier safer homes the program's target is older houses they can be beautiful but often contain lead-based paint which can pose a real health risk for children tonight we're taking a look at what the city is doing to address the issue this project is a very underutilized program lead-based paint is invisible it's not something that gets a lot of attention in a household the city of San Antonio's green and Healthy Homes initiative helps owners and landlords of residential properties create a safe environment for families the program helps remove lead-based paint from homes the household components that can test positive are usually test positive for lead based paint include exterior in interior walls window sills floors kitchen cabinets and even this soil outside the home Jennifer Buxton with the neighborhood and Housing Services Department says the city received a grant from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development for 4.6 million dollars to help remove lead-based paint from homes buckston says since the program started in 2000 1,600 homes have been remediated the new three-year grant will allow the city to help 230 more they will scrape and paint or remove and replace things such as windows there are many requirements to qualify for the program for example the house must have been built prior to 1978 that's the year federal government began restricting the use of lead in household paint another requirement there must be a child in the home under the age of six if household qualifies then we send a consultant out and they actually test the surfaces for lead-based paint once that occurs then we can send out a contractor in the contractors that are state qualified state certified abate or remediate that lead-based paint Buxton says while they have been helping about 70 homes a year they want to reach more people one of the things that's difficult about this program is getting families in and getting them tested they sometimes don't know that they have a problem or a child that's been affected by lead-based paint exposure to lead can be especially harmful to young children the CDC says some possible health effects include damage to the brain and nervous system slowed growth and development learning and behavior problems plus hearing and speech problems these health effects can cause lower IQ and impact a child's ability to focus buckston believes the city's program is making a big difference it helps children get healthier outcomes whether that be their physical health and not have health issues down the road it can also impact their their educational outcomes Jennifer Buxton says one of the areas they are targeting include neighborhoods around the San Antonio Independent School District they are accepting

we went to Santa Monica and there was sunshine yeah yeah but something's brewing over there that's going to come this way true Tiffany we are going to see rain chances slowly increase as we head into the new year but don't worry rain will hold off through New Year's Eve so that's the good news for us but let's go ahead and talk about today the weather today was absolutely beautiful I mean we saw tons of blue skies and we were able to see a high temperature near 64 degrees but our morning low was quite chilly was 34 this morning and with clear skies out there right now temperatures are gonna fall to near raising as well tomorrow morning we're already at 49 degrees in San Antonio it's 50 at JB s say Randolph 36 up at Bernie stage 41 in Bulverde and again temperatures tonight under clear skies and calm winds are really gonna fall into the upper 30s potentially right near about 35 in San Antonio in the potential for a light freeze up in the higher elevations like nearly on Springs timber wood Park or even up toward Bernie so keep that in mind we've got another freeze you know we've had such nice weather over the last couple of days that you may not have had to turn on the heat or the air conditioner I would suggest turning on the heat this evening let's take a look at satellite it's clear over San Antonio but you look down south toward Corpus Christi and Laredo you can see that the clouds have already started to increase and as we go into tomorrow the first part will be sunny but the second part of the day will be completely cloudy and on top of that we're also going to see our chance for rain by Wednesday but this is midnight on January first as we ring in the New Year you can see no rain in sight but then as we go into the day New Year's Day we'll start to see some areas of scattered light rain around San Antonio don't expect a goalie washer we are going to see maybe about 1/10 of an inch to a quarter of an inch of rain in some places but most places will only see a few hundredths of an inch of rainfall so taking a listen say Tuesday's planner not Friday's planner Tuesday's planner we're going to start off cold tomorrow at 35 degrees and will slowly start to see those clouds increase will be cloudy in the afternoon 59 degrees with winds from the southeast at 5 to 10 miles per hour and then for New Year's Eve itself as we ring in the New Year temperatures will fall tomorrow to near 50 degrees by midnight under cloudy skies pretty nice weather just make sure to take that jacket if you're going to view those fireworks outside taking a final look at the forecast again cool day tomorrow with those clouds increasing then just downright chilly on Wednesday temperatures will stay in the 40s with that area of light rain and then will become windy on Friday and clear out so Tiffany the week it's gonna look good we won't have snow like you did at Bear Lake but we will have cold weather - sunny weather in a flash I'll take it thanks Sarah

the attacker killed two people the suspect has been identified as Keith cannon he had a history of violent crimes including a 2009 conviction for misdemeanor deadly conduct my understanding is more of

can actually ease physical pain researchers say recent studies found that people experiencing pain benefited instantly from altruistic acts for instance one study found those who volunteered to give blood after an earthquake experienced less pain than non volunteers another study found that volunteers helping children of migrant workers experience less pain and cold temperatures than non volunteers researchers believed this is because of regions of the brain that react to painful stimulation they say those areas seem to be deactivated during altruistic acts New Year's Eve can be a fun time for friends and family but it can be stressful for our four-legged friends in this week's adulting hacks RJ marques tells us about a few tips to keep pets safe during the holiday before you light your fireworks for New Year's Eve think about how to protect your pets here's some advice from animal care services first pets don't like loud noises the Pops and booms from fireworks can scare them or cause them to run off so keep them in a secure or quiet area inside your home if possible second try to provide some toys to occupy your pet while you're out if your pet is crate trained make sure they can curl up inside if they get scared leave fresh food and water inside and a treat or two wouldn't hurt either you can also talk to your vet about ways to calm your pets nerves third never leave pets unattended outside even in a fenced yard or on a tether pets can overreact when they're scared dogs could easily dig a hole under the fence to escape the noise fourth protect your pets from pranksters by bringing them inside there have been many cases where fireworks have been directly shot at pets last ACS reminds owners to have pets microchipped animals roaming around the neighborhood
