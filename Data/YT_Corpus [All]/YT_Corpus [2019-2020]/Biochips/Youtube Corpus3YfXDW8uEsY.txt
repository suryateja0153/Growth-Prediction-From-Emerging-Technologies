 my name is max Crispin I'm professor of glycobiology at the University of Southampton our great quality is the study of sugars attached to proteins and lipids and this is specialising in understanding how sugars connection contributes to the structure of biological molecules and therefore their their function so I we're funded to work on vaccine development because of these modifications they care on pathogens such as viruses my team has been spread over these different areas but a large part of activity has been on developing antiviral vaccines or at least supporting those efforts driven by some major consortium international consortium we got in contacts with a group in University of Texas Austin we've provided to us manufactured native-like material from the latest strain and they also provided the genetic material for us to also begin to manufacture this material in Southampton and it was that collaboration that led us together with all our workflows that already running to be able to rapidly analyze the carbohydrate modifications of this of the latest crane of us and we've maintained a skeleton crew of about three people we've been coming in and dedicated to work on the cream rice now this has been a interesting balance between how do you maintain social distancing while also maintaining lab safety the guys in the lab who works incredibly hard it's breakneck speed frankly I haven't I've rarely seen this level of determination and drive and I guess it's always stimulated by this sort of global global interest running a lab like this has had some big implications in terms of their day-to-day activities and I think there's been a deep understanding within the within the team are just harrowing portents all the supports mechanisms are in running department so we're very excited about our ability to support the Scylla logical testing activities to continue to sport the vaccine community and we're being sense near immunogen's from partners all over the world to compare the carbohydrate signatures of their Matteo compared them to compare scimitar we've just been studying but also the environment at Southampton has been tremendous that we've been the labs been located in Southampton now for just over two years and within that time we've been able to get the lab running incredibly efficiently and it's been a really tremendously supportive environment not only academically highly collaborative we benefit so much from my colleagues supporting us in areas where we we have less expertise and very grateful for that that environment that's made all this work possible [Music]
