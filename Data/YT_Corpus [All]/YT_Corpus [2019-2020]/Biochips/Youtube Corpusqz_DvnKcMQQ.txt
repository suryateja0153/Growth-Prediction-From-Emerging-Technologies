 here's a live look at the nation's capitol tonight we told you about the coronavirus hearings on Capitol Hill today and you may have heard about speaker Pelosi's three billion dollar proposal for another round of stimulus money but there's another story flying around on the Internet today people are claiming Congress introduced a bill requiring you to get a kovat 19 vaccine when it becomes available you asked us to verify is it true here's our Jason Puckett a few of you sent us this post it claims Congress introduced bill HR 66 66 which gives a hundred billion to schools churches and medical buildings with a catch to receive the money they have to agree to quote only allow people in their facilities that have the köppen 19 vaccinations are tested and tracked to start HR 66 66 is a real bill Congress gov that it was introduced to the House of Representatives on May 1st so far there have been no actions on it so it is real but we're verifying does HR 66 66 require people to get vaccinated for Kovan 19 our main source is the bill itself HR 66 66 is only five pages long if passed it would let the Secretary of Health and Human Services award grants to help with Kovan 19 testing eligible groups include health centers school health clinics nonprofits high schools and more the bill would set aside a hundred billion dollars for this purpose so there's a nugget of truth in this claim HR 66 66 would have a hundred billion to help these groups but the link to vaccines is seemingly made up there's not a single mention of vaccines in the text Pury the only requirements in the bill are that groups use the money for training hiring or purchasing medical equipment that means we can verify the claim that HR 66 66 would require people get vaccinated against kovin 19 is false if you've got other claims for us to look into send us an email with your verify i'm jason puckett
