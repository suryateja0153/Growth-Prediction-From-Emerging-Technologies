 [Music] hi welcome to this module and in this module we will be looking at another way of understanding the deceiver body that is using the electrical modality arena until now what we are looking at the tissue properties where one a bio chip that can help us to understand the electrical mechanical and thermal property then we have seen a pisser edges to make up and deliver that can help us to understand the elasticity of the tissue now let us see another sensor that we can develop to understand the resistance or impedance of the tissue right and then we will also see a flexible sensor which can understand the electrical and mechanical property of tissue so this is this will be the complete lecture for us to understand so let us see the slide in the slide what we have seen is the the what we can see is the Posadas is 2 micro cantilever 1 with silicon nitride and one without silicon either this is without and this is wit silicon nitride okay so if I use this piece resist cantilever to indent the tissue to indent that issue what will I find I will find the elasticity of the tissue and you see the elasticity parameter right over here I don't worry about the resistance now we will see how can we measure resistance at some later stage of this module but you can see here that if I consider eight different patients and epithelial region in a normal so a single single patient we have done for eight different patient I am showing it only for a single patient a single patient tissue the tissue from a single patient using biopsy so it's a biopsy tissue on which we are indenting the piezo disease to micro cantilever in this way and we are indenting at eight different places within a given roi within the given region of interest we are indenting tissues at eight different places and we saw that if you if this is the tissue for example is a tissue and this is a region of interest this is a region of interest and will indent in this region at a different places to get the tissue property out so when we do that we can see that for epithelial region in a normal patient right the tissue taken from a normal patient the elasticity is less when we take a tissue from a stromal region it is more compared to stromal an epithelial for a normal elasticity is less compared to stromal but if I compare invasive ductal carcinoma this is invasive ductal carcinoma so this is a cancer tissue from the cancer region and what we see here is that the elasticity in appetit religion compared to the epital region of a normal patient is extremely less is actually around 15 kilo Pascal or 10 kilo Pascal where you can see that elasticity will lose for apathy religion in case of normal is around 40 kilo Pascal even we talk about the stromal region you can see that the stromal region here is about 20 kilo Pascal where here is around 80 kilo Pascal thus what we see that there is a change in the elasticity of the tissue or the stiffness of the tissue in case of cancer patient come back to normal patient and thus using a pathologist you can deliver we can understand whether a tissue is from a normal patient or is from the cancerous patient based on the elasticity value right those our exercise of understanding or fabricating or understanding the process flow for designing the pizzle resistive microphone deliver helps us to measure the tissue property in particular elasticity or you can say stiffness right so that was the idea of making you understand the importance of Pisa resistive micro cantilever now let us quick see what we have seen we have seen biochip that can help us to understand electrical properties mechanical properties and thermal properties of a tissue right electrical properties mechanical properties and thermal operator issue then we have seen a pisser registry method and deliver that can help us to understand the mechanical property of tissue mechanical property of dish right so mechanical properties are elasticity or you can say stiffness right elasticity or stiffness now let us see a different sensor that can help us to understand the electrical property of tissue alright so if you see the slide here you see is a four is a four inch or inch oxidized silicon wafer on which there are several sensors around 30 30 sensors and each sensor has an interdigitated elector it's each sensor has inter digitated electrodes okay and over the interdigital detectors we have a we have a su eight boundary so what does that mean let me show it to you what does I mean I mean that there is a su eight well and in that su 8 well so actually this is a oxidized silicon wafer let me draw it a little bit bigger diagram so you get you guys get it the cross-section oxidize silicon wafer so we will have oxide will have oxide here right on the oxide what we have we have inter digitated electrodes and or that we have we have su8 so what is this this will become like a well this is su8 this is silicon dioxide silicon dioxide silicon right this is su 8 well this is what is shown here that micro sensors with inter digitated electrodes inside su 8 where the schematic or a schematic representation of this device is shown here where there is a passivation layer because it's a silicon that's why we are using silicon dioxide is a passivation layer there are inter digitated electrodes which you can see the actual photograph right over here and then our chip consists of those inter digitated electrodes now what we will be doing will be measuring the impedance or the resistance of the tissue we measuring the resistance or electrical property of the tissue when you place the tissue on the inter digitated electrodes now if you see here each electrode has 10 micron spacing and the width is also 10 micron width and spacing is then measure on what I mean by width and spacing is like you see this kind of lines right like inter digitated so like this lines are there right this kind of lines are there here one two three right so the width width is ten microns and the spacing is also ten micron width and spacing is ten micron in this particular case right that's what we mean by interdigital electrodes with ten microns spacing so now let's see if I place a tissue on this inter digitated electrode this is what is shown here in this schematic that we are placing a breast tissue on inter digitated electrode what will happen when you place the best tissue on the inter digitated Elector there will be change in the impedance or resistance of the device right because right now inter digitated electrodes are not touching each other and these are metal lines so your resistance should be in finite because they are not touching right when you place a tissue on this because of the resistance of the tissue what you will find you will find that the tissue from the tissue from cancerous region would have a different resistance a tissue from cancerous region would have a different resistance compared to the tissue from normal regions so a normal tissue or benign tissue will have a different resistance compared to a tissue taken from ductal carcinoma in situ or invasive ductal carcinoma so now it's a easy way of understanding the electrical property of tissue just by placing tissue on the glass slide containing a su-8 well and inside the su-8 well there is an inter digitated electrodes such that the electrodes are on the oxidized silicon wafer and on this side there is a suet well what's the point of making su it well the point of making su it well is when you load the tissue you have to keep the tissue in a saline solution so that it doesn't deteriorate so when you load PBS if you do not have the su 8 well the BBS will be spelled out or from the tissue region so if you see here the low if I place the tissue right over here right right over here if I lower the solution the solution will be contained this is like let's say PBS force or Vaseline the solution will be contained in the su-8 well if I don't have the su-8 well my solution will be out right so let us now see how can we fabricate the inter digitated electrodes on oxidized silicon wafer all right so let us quickly see it's very easy just to mask process is a to mask process now you should know because we are fabricating sua inter digitated electrodes interdigital electrodes in su-8 well inside su-8 well hmm so what we will do we'll take a oxidize ceiling or we take a silicon wafer hate silicon and we'll clean the silicon wafer then we will grow oxide on both the sides oxide okay now after this next step is next step is we will spin code is correct we'll spin coater photoresist is correct or not what we want we want we want inter digitated electrodes inter digitated electrodes inside inside su-8 well right inside su-8 well this is what we want okay so this is our su 8 su 8 this is sio2 this is silicon this is sio2 all right this is what we want so now we have oxidized silicon wafer this inter digitated electrodes these are inter digitated electrodes this ids are made out of what ids are made out of metal so we can say chrome gold chrome gold so on the silicon dioxide what we will deposit will deposit a metal Filipa Zita metal how by using PVD physical vapor deposition either a beam or thermal on this we will do lithography so we will spin code positive photoresist right will spin code positive photoresist then we will do soft bake at 90 degree centigrade one minute on hot plate after that we will load our mask her mask will have the pattern that we want for inter digitated elector now this is a bright field mask field is bright pattern is dark right field mask and right field mask right over this what we will do we will expose after this we will expose the wafer or photoresist with UV after exposure next step would be PR developer right PR developer when we develop in photoresist developer what we will see will see metal and then photoresist only in the area only in the area which was not exposed in UV light because it is a positive photoresist right so unexposed area will get stronger after this after this step next step is hard-baked 121 minute hot plate next step after this the next step would be h in chrome gold so what you will have you will have oxidized silicon wafer Ochs a silicon wafer with inter digitated electrodes but there is what there is a photoresist the photoresist so next step would be to dip this wafer in acetone acetone will strip off the photoresist right a stone will strip out over resist so here if you see the photoresist to be is protecting the metal which is below it and the matter which is exposed will get edged in chrome gold etchant followed by which we have to strip off the photoresist so we are dipping the wafer in acetone when we dip the wafer in acetone what you will have is inter digitated electrodes what we'll have is interdit electrodes so this is our mask one mass one right but what we want we want interdigital actor to be in su-8 well so let us see how can we do that inter digitated electrodes in su-8 well so in the last slide what we had is oxidized silicon wafer and on oxidized silicon wafer we had inter digitated electrodes right we had interdigital electrodes now this is chrome gold this is silicon dioxide this is silicon and this is silicon dioxide now what we want we want su8 so we will spin code will spin code su8 which is a polymer tensor negative photoresist it behaves as a negative photoresist so we will spin code su-8 after spin coating su-8 you know what you have to do do soft baked soft baked is done at 65 degree centigrade for how much minute depends on the thickness of the su-8 if I thought the thickness of the su8 hmm after that what's the next step next step is I will lower the mask right and the mask what I want I want to protect su-8 in certain region and hs8 from the unwanted region right right so here the unexposed region would be weaker an expo region would be weaker right so I want to have a mask such that my unexposed regions becomes weaker hmm so I'll have a mask like this and is this correct no right what do you do we have to open the region over the in traditional electrodes and over the contact area right over the contact area right so now this is my mask - this is su8 these are introducer electrodes this one is silicon dioxide I have silicon wafer what is the bottom there silicon dioxide on that what we will do we will expose the wafer will expose the wafer with UV right with UV after that next step after exposure for su-8 would be to Harbach not too developed okay first to Harbach Harbach is done it 95 degree centigrade again the the time depends on the thickness of su-8 time depends on thickness of su8 okay after Harbach I'll go for su-8 developer I'll go for su-8 developer if I go for SEO a developer what will I have I will have oxidized silicon substrate with inter digitated electrodes and su-8 well right I will have oxidized silicon wafer with inter digitated electrodes inside su-8 well easy that becomes your chip and on this chip on this chip what we will do we will place the tissue place the tissue and we will also use a solution so keep the tissue intact that solution is our PBS all right now if I want to measure the resistance I can measure between these two contact hmmm I can measure the electrical property now if you understand in detail what is a different between resistance and impedance you will say that we should measure impedance because there is a parasitic capacitance also there is a double layer capacitance and other parameter that comes into effect so we cannot rely on resistance we should rely on the impedance measurement and thus we will see that when you place different tissues on the inter digitated electrodes or over the in traditional electrodes you will see that the impedance of the tissue changes as cancer progresses thus you can use electrical property which is an impedance as a parameter or some morality to understand the change in the tissue property when the tissue is cancerous or either Chuy's from normal region or the tissue from intermediate region right so the the the change in the tissue a party that is elliptical modality can act is a parameter to understand what is the stage or what is a type of the tissue that we always are income right so now what we have seen we have seen a mechanical way with this elasticity we have seen electrical weight which is impedance we also seen electrical mechanical and thermal way which is a biochip so in the next module what I will teach you is a flexible sensor that is integrated with a pathologist two sensor and a gold electrode but now everything is on flexible material which is our PDMS so till then you concentrate on this particular module if you are any questions feel free to ask us through the forum right and this is just one example where I am asking you to use the sensor and place the tissue on the sensor to measure the change in impedance but you can also use this for understanding the change in the cell property still stiffness of this cell right if you can measure stiffness of tissue why cannot measure the stiffness of cell with a cantilever you can why if you are measuring the resistance of the tissue why can work by the resistance of a cell you can write R U or RV limited with only breast cancer no we can use any tissue related cancer oral cancer prostate cancer right you can use any tissue related cancer to understand the change in the electric right till then you just to look at the module and Al's in the next class
