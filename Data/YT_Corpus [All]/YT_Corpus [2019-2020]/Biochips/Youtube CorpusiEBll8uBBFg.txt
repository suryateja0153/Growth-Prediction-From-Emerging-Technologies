 [Music] we are finally doing the heist today it is about freaking time watch to the end [Music] hello friend and welcome to classic gamer where we add lgbtqia plus visibility and representation and show that even in video games love is love in this video i will be walking you through cyberpunk 2077 so spoilers still watch as v and jackie get together for this crazy height heist for the biochip in your novu's condo so let's press play okay um it is early for me it is about 8 a.m in atlanta georgia so i am still waking up trying to get my bearings together and but we here we are with v and i got him a lot of stuff recently so let's get some music going there we go we got audio and he's looking pretty stylish so i'm pretty pretty happy with this result so far and what we're gonna do is get ready for this heist because like most heists whether you've watched it in movies or you've played it in any kind of other role playing game uh it has its sections right and it's it's gonna be intense you obviously need to have your planning phase you need to have your actual execution of the heist itself and then one of the things that really gets downplayed sometimes but it's as critically important as the escape route right how the heck do you get out now so this heist is also broken down into those three parts we have our planning we kind of execute and then we book it and so i want to be sure going into it that my v is prepared i'm at level seven i wish i was level nine to be honest i wish i'd done a little bit more side gigs to level uh him up so that i have access to these other weapons that i picked up and i'm like holy cow i can't use some of these badass weapons until i'm level nine so maybe i can get to level nine during the heist during the first part of the heist and if so then i'm going to equip them and hopefully uh use them while i make my escape if not cool i'll just have like one reserve so right now what i have is in my weapons i have a handgun and i want to be able to use these here this um dr5 nova looks pretty cool um but i wanna i wanna use this one the liberty because i like um i do like going after my drones and my mechs and all that so i wanna get access to this one so this is the one that i'm gonna hold on to it's got pretty decent electrical damage as well as like 19 to 23 on top of it being 111 0.1 dps 26 32 damage so i'm gonna hold on to this one i'm gonna go back to the apartment we're gonna sleep i'm gonna drop off a lot of stuff and then i think i'm gonna hold on to this one i'm gonna hold on to this submachine gun and then i'm also gonna hold on to the fen rear that i picked up while i was saving the monk so i also gave v some pretty fly outfits and this cogaine no yume titanium bd wreath which looks pretty cool and i think i'm ready to head back and then as far as skill wise let's see where is my skill wise i have a pretty high technical ability i gave him a couple of perks um i'm wondering if i actually should take some of these back um which one says reload time i want to keep that one i'm wondering about increases damages of rifles and machine guns um i can't really take it back because i already purchased it but i i like it because uh v's gonna be more of a submachine gun you know assault weapon handgun type of person i'm gonna i'm gonna i am bumping up body a bit but the more i think about it because of the way this game is cyberpunk i need to pump up intelligence and i need to get more of these um kind of breach protocols and quick hacking i don't have a lot of that so we'll see how it goes in this heist because a lot of these main quests and some side quests are very kind of stealthy and quick hacky and i my v is really not about that he definitely is more john wick shoot him up and so we'll see how this goes so right now i completed a couple of side jobs and and some gigs i didn't join into any of the actual night city pd kind of side events those are smaller i avoided those for now but i did a lot more of the side side job hustles and the gig hustles and that was fun so i built up these street cred let me look at the map real quick so we were a lot in this kind of area of kabuki around the docks i did a couple over here so i kind of worked my way from up top from north side worked my way down and now we're here so we're near the afterlife but i want to make it to the apartment i want to drop stuff off because i want to go into this heist with as little encumbrance as possible and so yeah i do not because when i go into this heist i want to be able to carry back as much as i can but in the meantime i'm gonna stroll it because what i've found is as much as i love the car and my character is all about cars i find so much stuff just by walking around the city um a lot of you know some of it is junk but other times it's like that it's like just a stapler or a knife and it's like whoa okay you know like why not right and i have to get used to doing the scan because i always forget so um can't walk yet uh we need to head to our condo let me look at the map am i going in the right direction yeah so we gotta cross here then go that way and head up the building as i could just go there let's go up there and see what i find [Music] what up kids what up what up says entering little china i know because i have to go back to my apartment um yeah i'm not worried about that life is there any cool stuff around i feel like a tourist every time i do this like i'm taking pictures can i go in there it's locked nope yep i want to drop off a lot of this weapon stuff maybe i don't know if i can drop off some of the clothes maybe disassemble some of the clothes that i don't really need i've already walked through here actually so i probably picked up quite a bit on my stroll to to kabuki docks see some of these boxes i already got that stuff so i'm being very thorough in this game so that i can pick up everything i can all i need all the components as a techie build i want my v to have all the components he needs and uh see there's more stuff i'm telling you like always always double back it because what is in here champagne bucket okay i'm sure i could scrap oh i think i took the perk also that lets me scrap basically lets me disassemble a lot of the junk that i pick up which is cool that way i'm not encumbered um i've i've found that i am one of those players that picks up just about every little thing and so the less encumbrance i have the better oh i'm jay walking there oh why are you crouching there's something going on i think something's going on maybe a shootout somewhere if you're crouching if you were crouching like that all right let's make it up to the apartment let's make it home and then we'll head to the afterlife so we can meet up with jackie jackie and jax who's my boy dex is my boy and jack is my boy come on let's go upstairs these ads are so funny look at that one three mouths one desire really getting close save your corporate career with s certs three thou like do not kill yourself anti-depressant pills jesus el guapo need for steed oh my gosh feeling kumquati today 130 pure overkill oh my goodness seriously so you know somebody designed all that mess so kudos to cd projekt actually kudos to the developers i um i know that they were working super hard to get this game out and there's so much right now there's so much talk right now about like oh hi look at that face um you know revolving sony and cd projekt red and i'll be honest i'm having a blast with this game i've had issues with like the cutscenes and i just had to find new settings i am playing on pc so i know a lot of the issues were in the like playstation 4 console and stuff and and it's it's rough i mean i feel the pain and so um i think i i guess i'm fortunate that i have this this machine that is able to run it and i've had kind of minimal issues with it so i'm still enjoying it i'm gonna power through it right all right let's head home let's drop stuff off we are in casa um yeah close that door please this feels like the apartment of uh in the movie fifth element and it's very kind of sleek small i mean this is a little bit bigger but it feels very um it feels very lilu dallas multi-pass apartment to me okay let's open our stash and let's put stuff in that we don't need let's um transfer this one um we're basically going to transfer all of the ones that we're not carrying we're going to transfer those that we can't use i'm going to hold on to this one though i'm going to hold on to the two the three that i'm i'm using so i have equipped that one that one and that one and i'm gonna hold on to this one so this one i'm gonna leave i'm gonna leave oh my goodness where are they okay i'm gonna leave that one that one and then i'll just come back and disassemble all of this at a different time so for right now i'm gonna hold on to these three which are my ds1 pulsar submachine gun my handgun my lexington and my fender i'm holding on to this one just in case i level up to nine which i'm not sure i'm kind of one-third almost halfway through seven so i don't know if i'll actually level to nine you know what i'm going to go ahead and leave it because i just don't want an extra how much does this way 4.3 yeah i'm just going to leave it i'll come back to it when i'm level 9. so i'm gonna hold on to these three weapons i may even want to leave one of these submachine guns back let's see this one's thermal this one's thermal this one is chemical um let's let's look at my inventory real quick let me um let me unequip this one and maybe what i'll do is i'll equipped i'm gonna equip the katana i need i want a melee one and so maybe what i'll do is equip equip the katana and and keep the fender i'm gonna leave this one behind because if i pick up a new one that's better along the way i'm gonna hold on to it and we're gonna be like super super cool with our weight and we don't have to worry about it i also want to i want to put a silencer on this weapon so i wanna let's see if i can up where is it can i upgrade um i can't upgrade this yet but let's look at our inventory and our backpacks let's see um i think the silencer can only go like on a handgun so let me see if i if i go back to my stash let's go to the stash let's uh let's trans go ahead and transfer and then see out of all of the handguns let's sort let's sort let's see let's sort for dps because i want to be quick about some of this stuff and as far as handguns i'm concerned this one's probably my better one why does that say zero okay this one 73 this one is 93 that's the lexington i had this one's 93 chemical damage this one is thermal yeah all the other ones that i have are sniper rifle sniper rifle sniper rifle assault rifles i want to hold into this submachine gun and then maybe um maybe do like a sniper rifle oh sniper rifle tech thermal damage you got light machine gun i already have the sub the fender so i'm going to hold on to that but i may want to do a pistol and a sniper rifle just as a backup in case so this out of my hand guns the this one is probably between these two that one's a power one this one's chemical headshot damage 15-19 5919 so out of handguns let's go with uh this one so let's transfer that back to me so that way i can have at least one handgun and then i think maybe instead of the assault rifles i will go for the sniper rifle how much does that weigh oh it does weigh quite a bit see that's the thing i want to have very little encumbrance the handgun didn't weigh that much i think what was it 4.3 pounds the sub machine is five these big ones are the heavy ones that's what during the flathead and i was picking up all this stuff that was weighing me down was all these weapons um i'm just gonna hold on to that okay let's look at the other stuff i have that i could also do away with um in our backpack we have melee weapons we have this knife let's see the knife oh shoot the knife actually does decent damage compared to the katana what is the katan what is the katana that is different it adds additional physical damage crit damage and bleed so i'll hold on to that even though from a dps standpoint and overall damage is less it's still doing that extra physical damage so i'm gonna hold on to that and let's see attachments and mods okay so this is where i want to attach hopefully i can attach to um silencer reduces damage so this is the nicer silence to write higher it's a 2.5 damage multiplier when attacking from stealth but see i'm not really a stealthy person but i do need to put this on something maybe i'll save it okay and then i have some of these other blades i need to start crafting like metal plating greens um yeah so i need to start crafting stuff i haven't really been doing that and i have quite a bit of stuff here like um i have the muddy fleets equipped and these are these shoes these are muddy fleets that's the one i equipped um leather ankle boots with composite inserts i could disassemble this one let's do that because i need um these are titanium only on my combat boots i don't need those anymore let's disassemble so i'm going to disassemble a couple of things here because there it the the weight adds up the weight does add up and so i'm gonna get rid of that this is a jacket second conflict biker jacket i'm gonna get rid of that see every all these little weights add oop this is maelstrom old males from field jacket um no no thanks um i'm gonna hold on to this just for funsies abrasion resistant that's me wolf school t-shirt i don't wanna oh i don't wanna mess those up mask um increase max oxygen i don't really need this mask since i have the bd wreath so let's get rid of that about some of these glasses i don't need this one i don't need this one and i don't need that one what about these shirts i don't need nope uh nope nope what's this vase vest oh hold on to these vest this is cobra carbon reinforced racing suit yeah it's okay i'm gonna hold on to some of this stuff what is this frayed scaff combat shirt i like the other shirt i have on to be honest and it's lighter so and it's got more armor so i look pretty fly with that i'm gonna hold on to let's see the tank top uh now let's get rid of it so little by little i'm bringing my my kung-hum prince down i do love these short shorts they're cute but i'm gonna i'm gonna get rid of them because they don't really provide any armor and the militech nano pants already have the the militech neo tack pants i already have a pair on that so i don't need this other pair that's the one i have equipped this is the comfy rocker ahmed wait i don't need that one these are beads no mess pants just for nostalgia worn maelstrom writing pants don't need those and these are the money feet that i have equipped this is nomad boots so yeah i want to hold on to just a few other things for nostalgia's sake but i think i brought down the encumbrance quite a bit we have some we have some bombs we're holding on to and some food oh we have a ton of food that some of this is not really this is not really encumbrance a lot of the weight of this is zero so which is good but i picked up all kinds of food and junk so i think i'm as light as i possibly can and i think i feel pretty good about that so i'm gonna go ahead and save this game on top of this one yeah i think i'm good with that how are we doing how are we doing anything else in my closet no what's over here there's something down there oh that those are the icons for the shops so may i think melee the fighting and then the gun shop over there i'm like why is that up there okay so now we go towards the afterlife let's get this started we're going to um we have it tracked right yep so let's go to what time is it it is 6 46 p.m i don't want to go to sleep i want to go ahead and make it to the afterlife so let's go back down and we'll stroll it again we will not take the car because you never know you never know what kind of stuff you can find along the way and i even though i am saving all my encumbrance for the actual heist itself and picking up all kinds of stuff you never know you never know oh hey hi hi what's up what's up yeah you gonna call me what's up they also have like fighters back here sometimes that are pretty pretty hot um oh hey what's up what's up gotta get used to scanning i'm gonna scan quite a bit when i get to the heist it's gonna be a scan fest let's go to the entrance oh this is going to be exciting i can't wait i know i'm like just kind of waking up and stuff but says wilson leave now you'll break my wilson wilson is always calling out to be um from his gun shop i may have to roll for his identity as well so if you're new to my channel what i love doing with the npcs and some of the playable characters on my games is i'll roll for rewriting characters identities whether their gender their gender identity their sexual orientation i completely change it and in this game regina who is one of our fixers i completely redid regina where regina is now reg and let's see reg is male panromantic pansexual and jackie is trans intergender he him questioning his sexuality and so yeah so i will and also my rules are evolving right now as i'm getting a lot more feedback from other other places and people in reddit and whatnot so i think once i have it it's probably going to take me another little bit before i have it final final but i've posted the updated rules already and so if there are any changes i will update them on the video description below and what i'm going to do is i will be posting also my the characters identities in the video description so i haven't done that just yet for this one but i have rolled for let's get some of that because that stuff doesn't really weigh that much i've rolled for jackie i've rolled for victor t-bug dexter reggie reg regina and judy so i will i'll be putting them on the video description after this and we see who else we will roll for today uh we need to be going this way following the crowd we gotta get to the afterlife club get used to oh there's something back there uh guitar pick and copy i think all right so looted guitar pick and remove the guitar pick because i have the perk and i'll show you guys as a techie build the technical ability that does that is here scrapper junk items are automatically disassembled so this just makes it easier to just get rid of some of that stuff as soon as you pick it up and you don't have to worry anymore about whether it's encumbrance or you have to do that later people just dropping money man what the heck i'll take it i'll take it you see why it helps to walk around and explore because you never know what you find you find money on the ground like that's mine then shoo and i have to make this scanning just to have it but i have to pretend like i'm some sort of tourist and just taking pictures everyone's like oh don't mind me don't buy me i'm just i'm just taking pictures of town i feel like maybe i'm google maps i'm just google maps just google maps i'm just google mapping this whole place anything over there no looks like i've covered it's always good to backtrack it oh there's something on the ground bro man people are just dropping food everywhere i'll pick it up i'll pick it up can we cross no it says no can't cross yet we have to obey the laws otherwise we'll be jaywalking oh my god this light is too long can we make it yeah let's do it let's just excuse me excuse me i don't i don't have time to waste it with you guys all right i try to be a good citizen but you know you look so sad child where's your mother where's your mama at go tell your mama there's something there's something on the other side of the street i have to go for it and hopefully i don't get run over look both ways look both ways there's something here what is in here oh a hazmat suit someone was working i'll take it oh hi excuse me excuse me don't run me over please okay yo it's a hazmat suit let's check it out let's check out the hazmat suit it is here let's see how much armor it has um it's just because employee safety is number one priority right blue blue blue blue blue it's just a hazmat suit that's it's equipment see oh okay cool um let's unequip it i i'm not about that oh you saw a little bit of my nakedness there let's go ahead and disassemble it because we don't want any weight like i said let's see what else is around then i forget anything oh what happened did i pass the um afterlife i got too excited with um walking that i went right past it that's all right i'm just sightseeing it's a little it's okay to sightsee a little bit you know no here this is the afterlife i have to look i have to remember to like scan things like this uh just just practicing you know just practicing my uh my cyberware practicing my cyberware like this it helps distract enemies i gotta remember that yeah okay cool so i think that's the afterlife there and we definitely don't want to start anything with anyone's cars so oh jackie what up jack uh hey about time holmes

you want us to get inside a room you can't get into it trust me when i say whatever hitch you think of t is salted already this is where the flathead comes in you'll have to get him in the ventilation shafts guide him to the dweller and force the dweller to take a break flathead will stay there jacked into the dweller but thanks to that i'll be able to roll out your red carpet into the penthouse okay anything else the exit strategy that's most important uh what's trans what transports transport to don't yeah premium cap company in all night city nada mile desean don't ever work with anyone

sweetheart blah blah blah blah blah who cares about the conversation well here we are lapis lazuli head to your room i'm pretty snazzy too bad we ain't staying tonight nice choice bug didn't pick it for snazz offers quickies access to the dweller yeah i remember now you fire up the flathead and find the shaft entrance sounds simple enough simplicity sometimes toughest to master aurelius aristotle who is it this time yours truly that one's mine where's the shaft put up your scanner look around scan for an entry point for the flathead i think it's there good jack how's the flathead looking all set i want to continue i need to get used to scanning a lot smart room terminal what says door systems are operational charge at a hundred we have a tv contract little gunks what just gonna stand there and look at it gonna have to switch to manual control wait for the flap to breach the system says the tick control is sharp from jackie gonna link to your keuroshi's to surveillance all right jackie uh why is it gotta be me surveillance cover the whole hotel um surveillance cover the whole hotel um even the bedrooms and the suites oh guests don't care you'd be surprised what people are willing to give up to feel secure lucky for us your noble is an exception penthouse is dark no hotel security and why is it going to be me why do i gotta do this slide in unlike someone i haven't run up my tab with vic got last gen firmware low flow just do it brother ain't got all day okay fine fine jackie jeez give me hand it over jack here goes all right let's pop it okay patching you through to in-cam view might get a little disoriented but you know uh whoa okay so we're going from one to the other wait for t buck to link you to ctc tv okay gotta okay there's get him to the next event oh we need to scan i think we need to scan for the vent enter the shaft use flat head to open the ventilation grate so use flat head okay let flat head do its thing all right flat head is like little spider-man running command wait for flat head to finish all right flat flat is cute let's do this little thing okay flat heads in patching you into the next cam now okay now we're here so scan for a weight into the vents um let's this is the shaft brake we want consult with t buck what now housekeeping is in my way got a distractor home let's see what's on this subnet all right on it the scan for hackable devices let's this is got a terranium panel and we have i think what we need to do is mess with the cooling unit um and we have the smart room tv and we have another television set here so i think out of we got a hollow view projector so what we really need to be doing is hacking into this is the terranium temp control geranium's got a temp and air quality controller premium stick the flat head on it so lower the temperature let's do that wait for the little cute little thingy to um do its thing oh go spidey go spidey go spidey go go spidey go spidey go all right it's cute it's doing this thing it uh let's see if we distract uh housekeeping needs to move oh cat something's up with the tank a bug it worked shh you didn't see nothing yeah it's like oh christ you got an idea how much of these things uh keep moving no time to okay enter the and yeah enter the event using flathead let's enter the shaft go go poopoo it's so cute it's so cute just entering through everything i want a little flat head now um okay so we are in in the vents and let's see scan for a way into the vents how about that there's a there's a grate there i guess that's it right i need to be practicing scanning okay use the flat head to open the ventilation great enter the shaft go go wait for flathead to finish running commands okay flat heads doing their thing okay okay okay dwellers just beyond the door flathead can jimmy the lock okay use flathead to enter the dweller's room so i need to be scanning a few things so i need to be scanning the door there is this cctv port there's all kinds of stuff in here i think there's the shaft grate there is there's a tv there's somebody that's security there's oh there's there's our flathead okay so we need to have flathead open the door and and then let's open the door go poopoo all right she's gonna tell people it looks like he's having trouble crap got another way let me think got another cam other side of the door but it's disabled want me to enable yeah look around for a ct ctv port that one right there so yeah we need a uh jack jack and flat head so we can zoom in and zoom out cool so let's jack in flathead connect to cctv using flathead all right we're doing that says connect between two available cameras press left or right now toggle over to the other cam so to toggle to the other cam switch can be used this one all right dwellers inside just as planned still weird the hotel's only got one runner decent dweller is good as a dozen ranking rank um what now let me neutralize him um yeah what what now t-bug what do we do now neutralize him use the flat head to jack into him i'll flash freeze him with a daemon old lingo donut okay dweller won't realize something's up gotta jack straight into his chair he won't know what hit him could have could drive a tank through here and he wouldn't feel a breeze dead to the world that one okay you'll have to get the flat head in there first right so scan for a path for the platinum flat head um it looks like this is the chair that's the netrunner's chair that we have to hack into that's the door we have to get through and then this i think it's the great shaft may link both rooms looks like let's figure it out now toggle over to the other cam so we'll toggle back to this one all right good might find our way in send the flat head over there then toggle over to the second cam there let's go and toggle over to the second cam okay so here comes poopoo there we go flathead into the chair v jack in okay let's check in send the flat head go check in back ahead and jack it in all right flat head do your thing just whoop got him love those demons flathead stays right to keep an eye on the dweller yeah punching into konpeki's main net you go ahead and log out okay so we are in the system um that's how it's done yeah that's how you're feeling fine a little dizzy that's all could you use a tequila shot bug you're going on are you doing on time you there bug yeah yeah i'm here so listen ice is thicker than i thought piercing it'll take a couple hours a couple hours uh can't do any faster i want my brain to burst into flames just sit down and enjoy your snazzy sweet thanks i will you take it easy okay rest up a bit okay we are oh we are level up man i could have brought that weapon oh but we had to leave everything on in the car dang it um i am leveled up so let me take a look i do want to go ahead and capitalize this to bring my intelligence up in case i need to do any kind of hacking on cameras and any of that stuff so i am going to boost intelligence a little bit more than anything else right now although i probably should have put it in body to even it out maybe if i get to level nine um i will pump up body and let's see what kind of perks i can get let's see here turret i need level nine see but see almost in increases breach time for breach protocol i'm tempted to take that but i want to mess up i want to mess up cams a little bit more disables all cameras in the network for six minutes i like this mass vulnerability because i'm not really stealthy i need to basically bypass a lot of these things by messing with the camera so i'm gonna uh reduces physical resistance what about quick hacking allows ramp to recover during combat forget me not eliminate target affected by a quick hack instead of covers quick hex steal 10 more damage reveals an enemy netrunner when they're attempting to hack you now hackers manual unlocks crafting specs for uncommon i really need that but for later for right now i think i'm gonna go with this one and then that way we're maxed out with our ability to mess with the cameras and i think we're good and it just basically says sit but what else is in the room right i guess you're telling us to sit thanks i will be you take it easy okay rest up a bit okay let's uh let's chill for a bit a few hours later what do you think why did he give it all up um who gave water your noble

two are connected in a way i can't make heads or tails to me and hoovick who's the other we know who the other is come on we know who the other is we know who the others is johnny johnny johnny a terrorist real talk of the town back in the day johnny anyway that's not what's important right now um first time i ever seen you scared uh doubt you can top terrorists in my brain it's kind of true talk to me talk to you well without you can talk terrorists in my head think you can top that terrorist in the head give it what what what is it vic tell me the biochar it's basically a bomb fused lit already you don't have much time left much uh life few weeks tops thanks really silver hands contract is overriding your consciousness gradually taking over your body until one day you'll just be gone dang you look really like you care about me vic vic it's important you get all this uh but you'll you'll fix me up right right vic you you got this you're like mister if i could i would be believe me

short tell me the deets don't omit a thing not one detail okay okay there was is a a construct a psyche on the chip that of johnny silverhand okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay so uh you jacked it in your chip slot nothing happened right until you died bullet in the head from dexter the shan sanaba but how could how do you come back from something like that low caliber you looked out not least thanks to another poor decision by mr deshawn what do you mean the nanites off the chip started fixing the damage then they took your hand and coaxed you off the path towards the light what you don't just die and then rise from the grave so am i some frankenstein great yeah i'm frankenstein you're dr victor and i'm your monster this is great perfect your body's only a body you can modify it replace it with chrome hell get a new one altogether your mind though that's a whole another story so i need a psychiatrist from the biochips perspective your brain cells are a tumor that needs to be scooped out while your body's an empty shell to hold a construct oh crap so johnny's trying to eat me from the inside out so this freaking terrorist wants to wipe me yeah and take my place take my body right it's not willful on his part it's automatic inevitable and neither of you can stop it uh sure so what am i supposed to do can't we just remove the chip it's that chart from those tv can we
