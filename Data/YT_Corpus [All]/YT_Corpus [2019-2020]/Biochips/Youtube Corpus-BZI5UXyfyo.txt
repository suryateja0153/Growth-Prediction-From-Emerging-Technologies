 AS WE NAVIGATE UNCHARTED TERRITORY WITH COVID-19, THERE'S A LOT OF TALK ABOUT A POSSIBLE VACCINE, WHEN IT WOULD BE AVAILABLE, AND HOW IT OFFERS HOPE AS MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS TREAT THIS NEW VIRUS. CAROLEE MCGRATH SAT DOWN WITH DR. PETER FRIEDMANN OF BAY STATE HEALTH TO LEARN MORE ABOUT A POTENTIAL VACCINE, THE TIME IT TAKES TO DEVELOP IT, AND HOW VACCINES HAVE CHANGED AND SAVED LIVES.  IF YOU LISTEN TO DR. FAUCI, THE BEST ESTIMATE IS IT WILL TAKE ABOUT A YEAR TO A YEAR AND A HALF. BASED ON HOW QUICKLY THINGS ARE MOVING, I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE CLOSER TO A YEAR.  WHAT TYPICALLY IS THAT TIME FRAME? BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE LIKE WOW, A YEAR AND A HALF, THAT SEEMS SO FAR OUT. TALK ABOUT THE PROCESS OF CREATING A VACCINE.  IT'S A VERY COMPLEX PROCESS TO CREATE A VACCINE. FIRST YOU HAVE TO IDENTIFY THE PROTEIN ON THE PATHOGEN, IN THIS CASE A VIRUS, THAT YOU WANT YOUR BODY TO CREATE ANTIBODIES TO. AND YOU NEED TO IDENTIFY A PROTEIN THAT IS NOT SIMILAR TO A HUMAN PROTEIN BECAUSE THEN YOU WOULD CREATE AN AUTO IMMUNE SITUATION IF YOU VACCINATED PEOPLE, SO YOU NEED SOMETHING THAT'S DIFFERENT ENOUGH. FORTUNATELY IN THE CASE OF WHAT'S NOW CALLED SARS COV2 WHICH IS THIS VIRUS, IT IS AN RNA VIRUS WHICH IS DIFFERENT IN MANY RESPECTS FROM HUMAN CELLS. SO YOU'LL BE ABLE TO FIND PROTEINS. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE LEARNED FROM THE SARS EPIDEMIC, WHICH IS A COUSIN, THE VIRUS IS A COUSIN OF THE CURRENT VIRUS, IS THERE ARE THESE LITTLE SPIKES THAT COME OUT, IF YOU'VE SEEN PICTURES OF IT, IT'S WHY THEY CALL IT CORONAVIRUS. CORONA MEANS CROWN, IT'S LIKE THE POINTS ON TOP OF A CROWN, THEY CALL THOSE THE SPIKE PROTEINS. AND THOSE PROTEINS, WE DID FIND DURING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE VACCINE FOR SARS THAT THOSE DO CREATE IMMUNE RESPONSE, AND SO THE CURRENT VACCINE THAT'S BEING TESTED IS ACTUALLY COMING OUT OF THE COMPANY IN NORWOOD, MASS CALLED MODERNA, WORKING WITH N. I.H., DOES TARGET THOSE SPIKE PROTEINS. BUT EVEN SO, YOU HAVE TO ESTABLISH THAT THE VACCINE IS SAFE. AND IT HAS TO BE EXTRAORDINARILY SAFE. YOU THINK ABOUT IT, IF LET'S SAY IT HAD BAD EFFECTS LIKE .1% OF PEOPLE, A VERY SMALL NUMBER OF PEOPLE, IF YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE A VACCINE TO HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE OR EVEN IN THIS CASE MAYBE BILLIONS OF PEOPLE, EVEN IF IT HAS THAT SMALL OF ADVERSE EFFECTS, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD EXPERIENCE BAD EFFECTS. SO YOU RAE WANT SOMETHING THAT'S EXTREMELY SAFE, AND THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE ESTABLISHING NOW. THEY ARE ACTUALLY STARTING FOR THE MODERNA VACCINE THE PHASE ONE STUDIES, THEY'RE STARTING IN SEATTLE. THEY'RE GOING TO START WITH I THINK 45 PATIENTS, AT LEAST THIS IS WHAT I'VE HEARD, AND THEY WILL GIVE THEM THE PROTOTYPE VACCINE TO SEE IF IT'S SAFE, IF ANYBODY GETS BAD EFFECTS, AND IF THEY DEVELOP ANTIBODIES TO IT. AFTER THAT, THEN IT'S A QUESTION OF LARGER SCALE HUMAN TESTING TO SEE THAT A LOT OF FOLKS DEVELOP IMMUNE RESPONSE AND THAT IT'S, AGAIN, THAT IT'S NOT PRODUCING A LOT OF ADVERSE EFFECTS. THAT CAN TAKE MONTHS TO DO A TRIAL LIKE THAT. AND THEN YOU HAVE TO PRODUCE THE VACCINE, IN QUANTITIES. SO THEY PRODUCE A SMALL AMOUNT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THESE TRIALS, BUT YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO PRODUCE ENOUGH TO DO WIDESPREAD VACCINATION. IT USED TO BE A LOT OF IT HAD TO BE SORT OF GROWN IN CULTURE AND THAT TOOK A VERY LONG TIME TO DO. THIS PARTICULAR VACCINE, BECAUSE IT'S USING RECOMBINANT TECHNOLOGY, MAY BE ABLE TO BE PRODUCED MORE QUICKLY. THEN THERE'S DISTRIBUTION AND ALL THE OTHER THINGS THAT GO IN TO GETTING IT OUT TO THE PEOPLE WHO NEED IT. SO THAT'S WHERE YOU GET THE IDEA OF THIS TAKING A YEAR. AND LET ME JUST SAY, IF IT HAPPENS IN A YEAR, THAT WILL BE A WORLD RECORD. IT REALLY, IT TYPICALLY TAKES MANY YEARS FOR A VACCINE TO MAKE IT TO MARKET.  THERE WAS SOME DISCUSSION -- I'M SORRY, GO AHEAD.  AND EVEN THEN WE DON'T KNOW IF IT'S GOING TO BE EFFECTIVE LONG-TERM. ONE OF THE THINGS WE SEE WITH INFLUENZA VACCINE IS EVERY YEAR, RIGHT, YOU HAVE TO GET YOUR FLU SHOT, BECAUSE DIFFERENT PROTEINS THAT ARE PRESENT, THE VIRUS MUTATES, IT CHANGES FROM YEAR TO YEAR. SOME OF THAT IS IT CHANGING ITS GENETICS, BUT SOME OF IT IS ALSO NATURAL SELECTION. WE CREATE VACCINES THAT HAVE ANTIBODIES THAT KILL OFF CERTAIN OF THE INFLUENZA VIRUSES, BUT THEN THE ONES THAT SURVIVE, THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT PROP PROPAGATE. SO THERE'S A LOT THAT GOES INTO IT AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT SO CHALLENGING.  YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE FLU VACCINE. HOW EFFECTIVE DO YOU THINK THIS VACCINE WILL BE WHEN IT IS WIDELY DISTRIBUTED?  WELL, THAT IT WHAT WE DON'T KNOW. THAT'S I THINK THE SEVERAL BILLION DOLLAR QUESTION. CERTAINLY A HUGE QUESTION FOR THIS COMPANY HERE IN MASSACHUSETTS, AND WOULD BE A HUGE BOON TO OUR BIOTECH INDUSTRY. AND OF COURSE A HUGE BOON TO OUR PATIENTS AND HEALTH CARE WORKERS. I THINK HEALTH CARE WORKERS PROBABLY WOULD BE THE FIRST FOLKS WHO WOULD BE VACCINATED IF WE HAD A VACCINE. YOU KNOW, IT'S CHALLENGING BECAUSE CORONAVIRUS IS KNOWN TO MUTATE QUITE READILY. FOR EXAMPLE, A LOT OF THE COMMON COLD VIRUSES ARE RELATED TO THAT, AND AS YOU KNOW WE DON'T GET A YEARLY SHOT TO PREVENT THE COMMON COLD BECAUSE IT'S SO CHALLENGING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE RIGHT PROTEINS ARE BECAUSE IT TRANSFORMS SO QUICKLY. SO MANY OF US ARE HOPEFUL, BUT I CERTAINLY DON'T THINK WE'RE THERE YET, AND IT WOULD BE PURE SPECULATION TO REALLY GIVE YOU A CLEAR ANSWER TO THE QUESTION YOU POSED.  SOME PEOPLE HAVE TALKED A LITTLE ABOUT POSSIBLY FAST TRACKING THE VACCINE IN TERMS OF THOSE HEALTH CARE WORKERS THAT YOU HAD MENTIONED, PERHAPS MAKING IT AVAILABLE TO THEM FIRST, WHICH I KNOW WOULD BE AN F.D.A. SORT OF DECISION. IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU FORESEE HAPPENING?  I DON'T. WE DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT ITS SAFETY AND YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO RISK, PARTICULARLY IN THE MIDST OF A PANDEMIC, YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO RISK THE HEALTH OF YOUR WORK FORCE. WE ALSO DON'T KNOW HOW EFFECTIVE IT IS, SO APARTMENT OF THE CONCERN WOULD BE IF PEOPLE GOT THE VACCINE, MAYBE THEY WOULD BE LESS STRINGENT ABOUT USING PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT, MAYBE TAKE SOME, YOU KNOW, STOP TAKING SOME OF THE PRECAUTIONS. AND SINCE WE DON'T KNOW HOW EFFECTIVE THE VACCINE IS, THAT COULD HAVE HARMFUL CONSEQUENCES. SO I DON'T SEE THAT HAPPENING, BUT THESE ARE UNPRECEDENTED TIMES, YOU JUST DON'T KNOW.  WHEN YOU LOOK AT HISTORY OF VACCINES IN THE COUNTRY, AND I LOOKED BACK AT POLIO, FOR EXAMPLE, AND HOW IT JUST WAS A GAME CHANGER IN THOSE TIMES. HOW IMPORTANT IS IT FOR PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THE WORK THAT GOES INTO THESE VACCINES AND WHAT THEY REALLY MEAN TO PUBLIC HEALTH?  VACCINATION IS ONE OF THE TREMENDOUS SUCCESSES OF 20TH CENTURY PUBLIC HEALTH. I'D SAY 19TH AND 20TH CENTURY PUBLIC HEALTH. WHEN YOU THINK OF DISEASES LIKE SMALLPOX OR POLIO THAT WE NOW DON'T REALLY WORRY ABOUT, BUT IN THE 50'S, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE WORRIED ABOUT POLIO, 40'S AND 50'S, IT WAS A HUGE PROBLEM. SMALLPOX WAS A MAJOR KILLER WORLDWIDE FOR CENTURIES, AND NOW IT REALLY ONLY EXISTS IN A LABORATORY, IN A COUPLE OF LABORATORIES AROUND THE WORLD. SO IT HAS REALLY BEEN A TREMENDOUS SUCCESS IN THE REALM OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND MEDICINE. AND I HOPE THAT TECHNOLOGY WILL WORK FOR THIS VIRUS. IT HASN'T WORKED AS WELL FOR SOME CONDITIONS. YOU KNOW, WE STILL DON'T HAVE, FOR EXAMPLE, A VACCINE FOR MALARIA WHICH IS A HUGE CAUSE OF MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY WORLDWIDE, AS AN EXAMPLE. SO I'M CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC AND HOPEFUL, BUT I THINK WE STILL HAVE TO KEEP DOING THE THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING, AND I WANT TO EMPHASIZE TO YOUR AUDIENCE THE IMPORTANCE OF TRADITIONAL EP DEEM -- SO CAREFUL HAND WASHING AND SOCIAL DISTANCING REALLY IS IMPORTANT.
