Sanjaya for inviting me to interact with you and share the technique how this reverse phase protein arrays are useful in the array platforms and also I would like to highlight how this RTP a platform is different from the routine protein array platforms many people have been using for quite a bit of time so my lecture I don't have any hands-on training session to give you to perform the experiments but all the necessary steps you are doing same in this but exactly the sample two antibodies reverse that's it that's why it is called as reverse phase protein arrays so I'll try to stress where it is different from the routine array or array routine protein arrays and what are the steps to be taken care to perform the arrays and how to do data analysis and also I will try to show some of our studies we have performed in the past how we use this technique and try to address the biologically relevant question in terms of clinical samples as well as in the biomarker validation as well so all in all I would like to tell you that by end of my lecture so you should feel that it is imaginary how much you can imagine to use this technique into your lab research that's what I would like to say so just imagine that how I can use this technique into my signs are your PhD work or maybe your postdoctoral work or maybe any biological question to be asked by to be addressed with help of clinicians or with the help of researchers in the lab okay so essentially here if you look at it here is a central dogma of molecular biology okay so DNA to RNA RNA to protein we all know that so all the essential functions to be done to be carried out by stored its information in the form of DNA in the form of genes but those genes alone cannot do anything but it is the functions are the molecular functions of a cell are to be done by the products of the genes that's why so if you look at the correlation between the gene to protein it's very poor if you look at the gene gene to RNA the correlation is only 60% that means 40 percent of genome information is already missing in the transcriptome level when you look at the correlation between transcriptome - proteome level again the correlation is very very poor it is only 40 percent so ultimately if you look back protein the genome genome the correlation is not more than 30 percent on average and also I should emphasize here the proteomics has been evolved and advanced much more in this recent past to address many biologically relevant questions which are unanswerable by any of the genomics approach or transcriptomics approaches nevertheless and also it is important to mention here that mass spectrometer will tell about the abundance of the proteins ok but advance mass spectrometry definitely tells us tells you about the activation status of the proteins in terms of either phosphorylation or the post translational modifications such as isolation glycosylation and so on so that's where it is very very important to look at the protein function really sometimes protein may express but it may keep quiet it says like a silent mutation in the gene it may keep quiet nothing to do so ultimately if it is a functional protein then only it reflects in the DC state if you look at here any illness or disease of genes integrated at the protein level that what the protein functional level so that is one of the reason you should perform the functional proteomics rather than the differential proteomics if you look at any proteomics books available in the library or maybe in the internet see that proteomics is broadly divided into different areas like a differential proteomics and the structural proteomics and also the functional proteomics so differential proteomics always tells about the upregulation down regulation so what gene is also up regulated down regulated we have to see whether it is up regulation mean it is really influencing the disease or not so that's where the functional proteomics came into picture and it gained the importance to work on this area further there are many different approaches one can do functional proteomics so particularly ms based approaches and interaction proteomics on protein micro arrays so here already you can see that we are moving towards the theme of our course work here so in this case look at as sanjeev are highlighted in the morning so the basically how the concept has been evolved how the protein micro arrays are evolved in the research field so from the least concept has been evolved from DNA microarrays provide a valuable platform for high-throughput analysis of thousands of proteins simultaneously ok we all know that the traditional biochemistry labs I did not have the nice cartoon to show here every time people used to clone one gene make a vector express it and wait what it happens what what it will do the self that way they use to analyze one protein by one protein thus traditional biochemistry labs now the ones omics has been evolved the thousands of proteins functions can be analyzed in a simultaneous manner so that definitely or certainly can be done using this array platforms so particularly I wanted to emphasize on the protein microarray this protein micro arrays are also broadly classified into three different types analytical micro arrays the functional micro arrays and reverse phase micro arrays so based on the principle involved in this protein or a technology so this classification has been nominated as a 2d so particularly I don't want to emphasize on all of them today I will maybe in the next lectures I see in the program see they will cover all these analytical micro arrays and functional micro arrays that's the reason I would like to concentrate only on the reverse phase protein array and also all of you have done Western blots in the lab so to do one Western blot a case you need a minimum 20 micro gram protein and of course you have to measure about the housekeeping gene you need another 40 micro gram protein another 20 micrograms so total all in all 40 micro gram protein is required to measure whether the protein is up or down compared to one of the other samples this case 40 micro gram protein is a lot on today when the all proteomics platforms of evolved into such an advanced stage so to avoid that definitely the technique what we are going to speak about today reverse phase protein arrays or the alternative to Western blotting technique so microarray development if you look at it relatively very end technology widely adopted by many researchers for many different applications and mainly this is used for gene discoveries but our clever proteomic community has been adopted to protein analysis as well so when I started protein microarray projects I thought only array means it's a DNA array I didn't know that protein array was something like that was there at all so then I understood that in fact this array name is more exploited by the proteomics people and the genomics people that's what I always claimed in any of the open platforms in indeed so nevertheless if you look at this picture this nice cartoon here there are different types of arrays in the first cartel can see the same slide with a barcode and one glass light printed with protein express libraries and if you can add the protein which is already pre labeled to the glass like if those proteins printed on the glass side how the interact and partners in the lysate they will attract and immobilize them when you wash out so other proteins will get washed away and those bound to that remain on the glass slide and we can visualize them then you can see that so particular protein X which is labeled bound to the protein Y and the glass slide that means they are interacting with each other then you can proceed to see that whether this interaction has any physiologically relevance in a DC state or non disease State or not the second way of approach is that again the glass light so we all talks about glass light story so glass like printed with the antibody or of course antigen also can coat it in this case antibody and then add the lysate which is a pool of all the proteins which are expressed by the orpheum then those antigen and agents which are specific to antibody captured by the capture antibody of course this protein is not labeled here that's why we need a detection antibody so the detection antibody is can be anybody related antibody or any choice of your interest so then you can detect the bike this protein which is immobilized which is captured by the captured antibody by looking at the signal here so this signaling methods I will explain you what are the different methods can be used and here that this is a real approach what we are going to talk next half an hour of 45 minutes so here the lie sets can be printed so today morning since you I explained that he is also printing a protein but it is a externally expressed pure protein in a each spot but in this case we are going to print as such protein lysate take a cell lysate when you scrape them in a cell culture lab and lyse them and spin down the supernatant contains a pool of proteins that sample directly are going to spot here after spotting then you add a primary antibody then primary antibody binds to the specific protein of interest protein in the spot and then the secondary antibody will detect the signal so it is same essentially can call it as a dot or micro Western blotting approach here okay so then the last sample here we can make the peptides can small peptides or engineered protein like mornings and you explained can spot them here and we can also take a complex mixture of proteins already pre labeled add that mixture into the slide so those proteins which have affinity towards these peptides are engineered proteins will bind so more or less these two slides these two cartoons explain a similar approach but there is a little different here here you see that true printed protein the full-length protein is spotted here is only peptide is spotted here the difference is here you can also use this approach for epitope mapping so you can make a fragmentation of the peptides so those peptides can be printed separately and you can map on the which domain of the complete protein is binding to the binding partner see maybe it's a hundred amino acids you chopped down into four different parts 25 25 25 so the interacting partner the bait prey protein may bind to the peptide between 51 to 75 so how can we map that so this is approach can be used to map the really binding domain are the interacting domains between the two proteins so you can see that this is a forward array where antibody is spotted and the protein a is captured by the antibody from the pool of lysate and the secondary antibody specific to protein a is used for the detection so this is coupled to enzyme linked secondary antibody if you look at here have a glass-like which is coated with a nitrocellulose membrane and is a pool of lice it along with your protein of interest here we have a 2 G proteins so in a single spot it contains a protein of interest along with other proteins then you had a primary antibody against protein EA so it will bind to the protein EA in the mixture then use a secondary antibody directly again next to the primary and bhadiya who used so you can see that this red Y is now detecting the protein e here in this case red Y is capturing the protein E that's the difference between forward and reverse array so once you have the primary antibody bound to the protein e after several washings you can use the detection antibody which is nothing but a secondary antibody labeled with specific visualization method then you can detect it so this can be miniaturized into high-throughput array by spotting many different number of samples so this is basically the reverse phase protein array this concept has been developed by these two great scientists Petra Cohen and Lance Liotta from us MD Anderson and they started to optimize this technique or they started to establish this technique at 1990 finally it came into the light in 2001 after proof of concept and so on further it is progressing now in 2015 people announced that this can go really into the clinic towards the personalized medicine now how I will try to convince you that how it can be used in the personalized medicine and then obviously it requires lot of technically which are technical challenges so this cartoon explains the spotting of the samples it's a single lysate spot that means if you have thousand samples so thousand samples will have thousand spots here individual spot belongs to one sample remember that not one protein that's where always we think that one spot will contain one protein that is a forward approach in Reverse approach one spot will you contain thousands of proteins from one sample so once we spot it then we have a primary antibody to detect and then visualization after that array use this kind of data then we have to proceed for data analysis so advantage here is that in one spot requires only low volume of sample we spot only one nano liter think about from one nano liter you can quantify one in Western blot you need 20 microgram that means is 20,000 nanograms so no sorry a 1 to 8 nano gram protein let's say 10 nano gram is required so if you want 20,000 / so you can quantify 2,000 proteins from 20 micro gram protein sample in this reverse phase protein array approach so the total protein you will spot depending on the intensity or the protein of interest between 1 to 8 nano gram of total protein once you spot the array slide looks like here then of course to print such a high density array you need a sophisticated machine you cannot simply spot with pipette and this machine is really useful nowadays meant for reverse phase protein arrays which can print 50 replicate slides per run with 2,000 samples per slide and also why I am highlighting about this instrument I am NOT from definitely company thing is that when you spring the first like the same quantity should be printed on the last slide so duration will be 3 hours in the first slide if the one spot contains one nanogram a tenebra the last slide also should have 8 nano gram protein so this machine has been decided designed in such a way that it will give a uniform printing of the slides and also from one corner to other corner it should spot in a precisely the same amount of protein by maintaining the humidity and XYZ parameters inside the machine so this machine capacity is very good as on today and main thing requirement as well as serious limitation in reverse phase protein arrays is the good quality antibodies I am sure many of us might have used Santacruz antibodies when we do western blood we see 10 different bands which belongs to our target of protein interest we don't know those antibodies are very very limited and we cannot use them for reverse phase protein array approach that's where this reverse phase protein array is difficult to perform in protein laboratories so how there is a way and also there are multiple detection methods are available alkaline phosphate detection HRP detection chemiluminescence and also infrared imaging as well as site labeling and all so in our approach in our lab previously we used infrared labelled secondary antibodies to visualize the primary antibody signals why so IR signals always have a high dynamic range okay compared to chemiluminescence method or any alkaline phosphorus method like a chromogenic substrate so linearity means if the protein concentration is too high they will signal will get saturated very quickly once the signal is saturated you cannot get a proper quantification and proper quantifiable differences between control and experimental samples so that's the reason to avoid that to have a broad range of detection range so we used infrared imaging less infrared even infrared label secondary dice so then here I would like to highlight how the array looks like once you print you can see that glass light coated with nitrocellulose the Spotted lie sets which can be recombinant proteins or the total protein lysates there is a detection antibody and near-infrared dye labeled secondary antibody it's the same simple western blotting approach explaining 2+2 standard student ok advantage single spot diameter is 300 micrometer that's why you can accommodate more number of samples on slide then you can perform the array and then you get the signals like this here is a complete workflow I will walk through this complete workflow and next one over each step-by-step first is a tissues our cell lines what kind of samples can be analyzed what are the different types of methods to apply for sample preparation and then how to choose antibody what are the different steps to be taken care while selecting the antibodies for RPMs on how to avoid later on issues then spotting pattern spotting methods signal detection methods how different methods are advantages one on the other for detection z' and finally data analysis and what kind of data we see and i will show one or two examples how we generated the data how they are useful in literature [Music] so as you are aware that protease can be printed in a different manner on the chip and those could be used for many interesting applications we have discussed that you can print the cDNA and do the in vitro transcription translation to make the protein on the chip or what could do a laborious way of expressing and purifying the proteins of interest or you can have recommend antibodies to be printed or even you can have the reverse phase protein arrays where you can take the tissue layers or cell line states where you can probe with the specific antibodies and proteins of interest in addition to just having the purified protein or empty bodies printed or even having cDNA to make chips like the cell free expression based arrays one could also try to probe directly a specific target of interest in reverse phase protein arrays as we have discussed today we dr. donation money so I hope today you have learned about reverse phase protein arrays the basic workflows and how the oil looks once it printed on the chip and the advantages of using our PPA this talk will be continued in the next lecture we dr. Ramani will talk to us the entire workflow of reverse phase protein arrays in some more detail thank you [Music] you [Music]
