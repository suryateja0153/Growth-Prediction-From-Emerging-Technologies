 [Music] think of the possibilities what would you do if you could detect the previously undetectable the smcx pro is a fast and robust single molecule counting technology with unprecedented sensitivity that allows the detection of low abundance biomarkers in complex biological matrices the technology captures and differentiates the true sample landscape to reveal data that was once lost in the background with greater sensitivity accuracy precision and reproducibility smc technology allows scientists to accelerate their drug discovery and development program by revealing previously undetectable clinically relevant biomarkers how does single molecule counting technology work let's take a closer look sample containing the analyte is captured onto beads coated with biomarker specific antibody beads are washed to remove non-specific matrix proteins and a specific fluorescently conjugated detection antibody added the antibody binds to the captured analyte to generate an immunocomplex after washing to remove unbound proteins and non-specific material the complex is disassociated the beads are magnetically separated and the final eluit is transferred into the final reading plate inside the smcx pro single molecule counting takes place within a small interrogation space illuminated by a laser within each well the laser scans through the free-floating analyte suspension fluorescently labeled detection antibody that passes through the interrogation space is excited by the laser and emits photons these photons are detected by a low noise avalanche photodiode and digitally counted as single molecule events interrogation of the sample within a small confocal window coupled with a digital counting of individual fluorescently labeled detection antibodies enables low background and a high peak signal resulting in a broad dynamic range the signal is analyzed with easy-to-use data analysis software that converts the data signal into response units and the software algorithms compute the biomarker concentration our kids support various research areas or take advantage of our expertise in custom assay development with the smcx pro single molecule counting system analyze biomarker concentrations at femtomolar levels and accelerate your research to the next level visit us at www.merckmillipor.com smcx pro to download a copy of the smcx pro brochure and to learn more you
