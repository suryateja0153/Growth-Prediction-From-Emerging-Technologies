 [Music] in this course we are emphasizing the need for high-throughput approaches for studying proteins and proteome for such kind of studies protein microarrays have become a very robust platform here see there are different ways of making protein arrays it starting from printing antibodies or purified proteins or even tissue lysates or cell lysate or even just simply printing the cDNA and make the proteins on the chip using nappa technology or nucleic acid programmable protein arrays talked about with dr. George Lee where so there are many ways of printing the features on the arrays and you can have different type of content which could be printed on the chips however finally what actually makes you difference is how good your printing is how reproducible your chips are from one to other batch there is no variability and the spot features are really defined really circular and you are not seeing any diffusion from each of their features so printing technology plays a very important role in whole of the microarray experiments and fishing in the case of protein microarrays when we have different type of components to be printed on the ship it becomes much more crucial so we have invited dr. siruni son Avila from Aerojet who's going to talk about non-contact inkjet bio printing which is one of the fastest printing technologies at Aerojet her prime contributions have been in designing and optimizing projects performing assay transfer studies and leading advanced technical training sessions for microarray users worldwide in today's talk to person one is going to talk mainly about what are the key considerations for doing good printing for micro results especially the bio printing versus microarray I hope you will enjoy this lecture [Music] good afternoon welcoming all the new people coming in I'll take some time for you to settle down today I'm going to talk about rage at solutions you probably all have worked or done some work with micro ring designing an array experiment printing arrays can anybody tell me how many maximum features have you been able to print on a slide anybody who's worked on arrays okay so they are used to the hue Pro 20,000 features that's good to know because we spent about it was myself working with the team at CDI who spent two three years developing the hue pro array and finally I'm so pleased to see that it's in India and it was developed with our technologies we do know that there are issues in our technologies today and we are lacking in some of the critical highly sensitive methodologies where thousands of interactions can be processed in one simultaneous manner but it has to be cost effective it has to use less of your precious sample because that's the most important thing you're trying to conserve save samples and get as many accurate runs out of it as possible and that is why we've got inkjet bio printing we are from Scotland ed Indra that's where I live but I was was born in Mumbai so I still love this cotton in terms of the collaborations we have done with institutes in India and a key goal for me to Strine see what requirements proteomics in IIT has or any other academic institutions to try and fill that gap so it's a complete bio printing solution which means that there are R&D systems that you can have in your lab and then there are once you've developed that assay once you have a larger library to screen then there are same technology can be scalable so it goes to a higher level of a system so not necessary that you have to start with a high throughput platform you can start with the same technology with an rnd scale and then go upwards what are the key things that we are doing is there agent Vance services these are collaborative approaches with yourselves as your scientists and our company scientists to develop the assay on the platform so we've done a lot of Eliza Tech's transfers so right as you probably have all done Eliza's & hué pros you know that Eliza is quite time-consuming it requires a lot of sample you can hardly do whew Eliza's before you get few errors etc so what we do is we are doing assay transfer projects from Eliza to inkjet and then we obviously provide consultation and other gaskets consumables printed slides so we sell the hew Pro slides because we developed it simple why are you it's a complete solutions provider it's the fastest printing technology in the world so if you had to compare this with any other method of screening of printing or a ring it wouldn't give you the kind of efficiency that you would get in just 20 minutes of finishing your assay and spending the rest of the day actually doing analysis part which is crucial for your for your project rather than sitting three days and just pipetting things like I said we have global presence but specially in India we've got lab India Instruments I'm not sure if how many I think you've some some of you might know the company it's a large distributor in India and they are helping us with a lot of academics institutions to try and get projects together to make sure the students are able to get the samples and analyze and print them and a particular facility these are some of the key institutions and companies that we've worked with as you can see there is a nice spread of academic institutions like the Sanger Institute United States Medical Research Institute Roslin Institute where the dahle was developed Griffith University Monash University so Reproductive Health Science so these are we do work with a lot of academics because there are so many different assays and projects that different applications but instead of investing in five six different platforms the key idea is to have one platform every department Chemical Engineering proteomics genome makes like and they all can come and use it and it is using a piezo electric technology so the printing is asked quick is this to be very honest with you it's 0.2 m/s this is something that I like to circulate across you guys this is a liquid sample handler and it is able to handle biological samples in terms of 12 multiples of 12 or multiples of 36 so depending on how many samples you have in a 384 well source plate it aspirates the sample upwards and it attaches itself to the printhead this way so it makes a nice little attachment and what happens is afterwards you don't need these fins at all this is the biggest difference most of the technologies use spins they take your sample rip in it they take the sample and they pin it whereas for us we don't need these pins because they are brittle they break they get clogged and there is a lot of replacing maintenance all that is involved so what we've done is we bypassed that so half of the printing or the 100% of the printing happens with this printhead so imagine it's like an HP color printer in your house now imagine the color printer is printing all your biological samples on the fly without touching the slides or contaminating with the slides so you are reducing the error rate you're reducing the samples that actually go and get picked up and get deposited because everything is happening with the printhead I just show this across to you why not to try not to touch the pins because they're a little sensitive to breaking so you can see that the jet spider is something that is in-house patented and developed it can simultaneously aspirate a set of 12 samples together and print them simultaneously so you imagine it's not just one one to two it goes 1212 in 20 think it's 20 m/s then goes back picks up another 12 goes back prints it again 20 m/s so the way we calculate the the fastness of the efficiency of it is 640 features per second so it's quick 640 features per second is super quick so sometimes you don't even know whether your sample is printed or it's it's ongoing because it's that quick when it moves so this is just to show you this is your 384-well plate this is your jet spider attach to the printhead and it it just dips itself and it picks up as little as 1.3 microliters enough to print 75 flights yes so imagine people struggling with 30 micro liter sample 20 microns for the whole year we only need 1.3 microliters as a minimum to be able to screen an array of 75 slides which is enough to give you more than enough results so how much sample are you saving so let's think about it that way again this is the printhead this is the jet spider and this is the sauce plate what happens in the sample gets aspirated upwards goes inside the printer and it just prints that's the printing so this is the connection between the printhead and the jet spider and it prints this is a bit too technical it shows you how much volume of a sample you can get in your capillaries of the printhead because it's an industrial printhead it's extremely robust and anti corrosive so you can even get to the level of understanding how much volume you of sample you need for the whole year to be able to print let's say 100 slides or process 96 Eliza's in less than a week so you can can we can help you calculate this again I'll move through the video because I'll be able to show you offline this is taken from one of the studies we did very similar customer to Hugh proxy di very similar customer but we helped him to do 65,000 features in one slide so this was high throughput printing style but you see the morphology and you see the assay results that you get is highly reproducible so your one slide will be able to do the same job as your slide number thousand and this is what people have obviously this is coming from Eppendorf and we all know happened off this is the results they got with their contacts pinspot oh well it took them maybe a week to do this or maybe two weeks to do this this is the work we did with a reject not only for hue Pro not only for this customer but for many of them and we do this work it is highly precise false so you don't see any merging you don't see any dirt or missing data or anything of that sort again sensitive versatile reproducible multiplex because we support a lot of Eliza tech transfers this technology is highly efficient to transfer any immunoassay into inkjet because any immunity that you're doing has certain limitations that all get transferred into positives so that most of your research is focused on getting the actual analysis the actual data high-throughput screening this is something that we support in terms of whether it's antibody discovery host-pathogen interaction biomarker discovery epitope mapping hybridomas screening there's a lot of discussion on nappa arrays hybridomas so we do that we've helped a lot of people today that you can see in this symposium as well to develop projects around hybridoma screening where you have your license they get printed off on one layer so different lights get printed off on different slides then you have your target antibody of interest that gets printed on top of each other so you can imagine there is a spot and then there is another spot on top and because of that binding of one spot to another spot it's called a spot on spot acid so it's a spot on spot type of printing where you can make sure the entire Intel or the screaming is done while it's getting printed antibody validation which we've all done small molecule libraries scanning again this is for drug targeting therapeutic antibody screening and gene expression profiling now you are going to think what samples can orig it handle all samples can be printed so we go from nucleic acids so genomics lab can be used you've got cell lysis you've got serum of plasma that can be spotted small molecules Optimas hybridoma supernatant carbohydrates nanoparticles and polymers also and of course we do cell tissue microing as well so the more things you can imagine outside the box what can this platform support the more answers you will get yes we can do it so it's quite flexible in terms of what your project is and what samples you have and then humm how can we transfer those samples onto inkjet style of printing obviously again I'm saying this is not restricted to slides so again I'll let you pass this one I can pass this on myself but so this is this is the pleats and the slides that we can do so imagine doing one entire iliza in one well and doing 96 Eliza's in one plate at one time and doing 100 such plates so 96 my maths is very bad that's why I'm a biologic person but if you count this if you calculate this yourself you will be able to understand how many Eliza's you can do and how much time you can save to actually analyze the data points to get your data right because it's going to be highly accurate so I'll show you this is the plate that I'm circulating across in this plate there is one well your entire one eliezer can happen in one well instead of 196 well Eliza plate for one reaction that one plate that one plate can all get concise into just one small tiny win so you can see that we can not only print all the wells but on two plates on two biochips majority of the work I'll tell you is on slides to be very honest but I don't know how many of you have had any experience with spr imaging spr technology but this is something that again is used for drug targeting and we are able to print onto the spr prisms as well so there are companies that require spr i as one of the key methods to get your drug target but we can we can reduce the process by helping them with the spr prism printing it's very simple its speed its precision and its consistency there is a reason why yesterday you all could do work on your breweries because there is a reason every array is accurate because it's printed with an inkjet technology so bio printing versus micro ring there are very key differences why people say oh by micro ring is outdated it's it's now everyone's moved to Gen X generation techniques whereas here you're we are giving you a complete understanding on traditional micro ring and what bio printing with our agent do we have an inline optical quality control camera where we do the QC for you you don't have to have a separate QC step we will do the QC for you and if we see that your important antibody is missing the coolest thing about the software is it remembers which slide your antibody is missing you go back and print it so at the end of the run you've not wasted your antibody you are able to get a full set of data from that one printing because it remembered that it is if it is missed somewhere because maybe you missed putting the sample or it was a bit sticky and it couldn't get aspirated many of these techniques this software which is called the iris the iris as the I can remember recognized which okay slide number thousand has my body five missing so what am I going to do I'm not gonna have thousand slices all the antibodies missing it's a waste of my experiment so what it does it is remembers that one antibody twelve is missing it will go back and print antibody twelve to all the thousand slides in case you've forgotten to put the antibody or it has missed so it will make sure that all the data you get is a complete set of data and not just missing contents which sometimes we do see with other arraying technologies that you see missing missing content so here we are again bypassing that missing content again go I mean this is this is a very easy table I would say using the pens not using the pins slow printing sample concentration is very critical here we have we can print on four degrees so we actually convert the whole machine goes inside a big fridge so the fridge is like this stall probably yeah it's probably the stall and it is this wide so what happens is the machine goes inside a printer and this is how the Hublot arrays are actually made in Baltimore so when I went there for the setup the whole Lab is converted into a four degree fridge so what happens is the entire arrays that are spotted on the slide they are extremely sensitive and functional so they can be used and sold and a lot of people can make sure that the technique is quite standard again higher setup and maintenance that is again something which is bypassed because we don't require any extra fancy readers or fancy equipment or hidden consumables it's very simple the whole system works on liquid hydraulics all you need to do is prepare a glycerol buffer in your lab which you get a recipe you prepare and rest or buffer that buffer goes into the system and that's really it that's all you need to make this work trust me that's all you need so people say oh you need this scanner to go with it you need a reader to go we don't need that it is compatible with lots of scanners which today you have in many labs so it reduces a lot of hidden work that goes into making an assay so for me it is what do I need to make the system work I need a glycerol buffer which I can prepare in my lab in five liters four liters that goes inside the system and that makes the system run and then slides which we all can buy from a lot of suppliers here so what really you need is just the running time again this is something that people have asked me in the past is so I use the only ones or are there other people so I thought I'll show it to you to see to make you see the difference and what is the edging effect here they're all non-contact so nobody uses pins we're all using this printhead mechanism but there are there are large differences in how we can handle each and every sample I'm gonna go back so you can see that the number of plates we can do the number of samples that can get handled are quite high and the deposition rate is the fastest which is why we are the fastest in the world so if there are asses they need to be done in a time line and you have to report results in a week and you're not getting success with pipette eliza's what are you going to do you're going to quickly run to an arranger printer print your samples as many slides as you want and process those asses instruments so this is again like I was seeing it's not just it's not just for companies it's not just for research or high throughput scientists it is for R&D work as well I would say 50% of the people I've worked with personally to develop assays including the hew Pro guys they're they're all institutions we work with Johns Hopkins II work with Sanger we worked with Monash University we worked with Griffith so there are lots of institutes that require these platforms more than the companies I would say so this is our entry level system which is called the marathon Argos it does not have that camera features that will remember and reprint this all these are the systems that are they have the camera feature which will remember and recognize rip in the spot this is how the machine looks it's it's got glass panels so it's quite easy to see what you're doing you can actually see the spots getting printed this is the space here these are the two bottles I'm showing you where you can prepare your own glycerol buffer and you can and that's all is needed so you have your glycerol buffer in the system you put your slides you have your 3/8 for sample plate here you have your slides printing here and that's it so it's quite easy it's really quite easy I started doing this technology when I was I think this is ages ago but to be very honest I was 22 when I started this and it was easy for me to grasp it it was easy for me to understand what the platform it's not really high high level high tech it's not that bad so for students who are using these platforms it needs to be quite easy for you guys to do things it shouldn't be that advanced it has to be easy it has to be user friendly and it has to be fast this is something that we've developed it's an in-house servicing where we work in partnership with you you tell us about your projects we assign a scientist who can understand what kind of projects you're working on whether it's analyzer based methods it's an immunoassay whether it's something else whether you're developing a chemical product whether you have some chemical samples anything you'd speak to us we will develop a protocol for you with our experience and the knowledge that we have shared with lots of industries to have a very easy cost-effective method to transfer this into inkjet so we will print the samples for you it takes a week because it's very quick so it comes let's say on Monday we do the printing on Tuesday we give you the report analysis so we'll take a week by the time it gets shipped which is shorter time than many people here locally in India can also give you back as custom printed arrays and correct me if I'm wrong but I have been told that the sort of time lead to get the arrays back after printing is about two to three weeks depend on how busy they are or you know depending on how many projects they have so because it's fast we are able to do a lot of printing for a lot of students quickly so you know in a day we can finish off a lot of projects so you don't have to wait for your results or your reports so manufacturing services customary printing again custom panels are available custom antibody panels are available that we we can pick and choose for you you must have from yesterday's you Pro you have you know the hue Pro content it's got customer is you've got custom panels so what we can do is we can pick and choose different antibody panels that you want for your assay and we can print them however in whichever fashion you like that is with a region advanced so different ways that we collaborate with students and researchers especially is we have a basic proof of concept like a pilot study where you understand what are the requirements of an assay transfer and then you outsource them the other few options are these so there are institutions where funding is extremely critical and this is why these are the approaches we can take so we've supported Indian Institutes so IISc Bangalore for the UK I are and Geeta projects for the grant for the system where they feel that all the departments can make use of this we've supported walking with bio Khan in India in Bangalore sorry to get their immunoassays developed on the platform there are few other institutes in Pune as well as in Bangalore where the grant funding has been done so we are providing complete grant support so if you do need or you have something which you feel will require the system or will require the services and then there is a scope for a grant then we can give you all the grant support for justifying why the technology is required very simple workflow so you'll have an initial discussion with somebody like myself in India and we'll go to our head scientists or the team of scientists in UK have a collaborative discussion and what you want to develop it actually what is your acid what is your criteria what do you want to achieve out of it and then we will develop a printing protocol a printing support mechanism which at the end of the day will give you guarantee that yes I can come to them six months down the line for a next project and they'll be able to do the similar job for me so I think this is something that is a crux of the Rieger technology it's a software that is able to make you design the entire array so this is your command center this works in conjunction with the with the technology so when you're trying to print samples first you need to design your arrays you need to design your asses and this is done with the help of a command center software so let me just take a second here and show you a video so this is how the technology really works how the printing is done you can see this is the platform you got a tray of 25 slides and that's how it moves each time it moves it prints 12 samples on one slide second slide third slide fourth light till 25 slides in an on the fly motion this is how it's picking up its sample this is getting into the source plate where your biological sample is it aspirates once the aspiration is done it transfers the sample into your industry printhead which is like your color printhead so now there is no need of these pins there is no need to use these pins now it's all in the part of the printhead so your sample is here and then wait for a minute this comes forward and off it goes and each time it is doing 12 samples at a time across 25 slides that's your first redone moves again 12 samples at a time secondary done moves again to else AM 'pls thought redone it's gonna be less than 2 minutes for me to finish my current samples across hundreds lines so this is the quick motion this is how quickly it moves as a printer once it's finished doing it it obviously has a standby mode where it is able to wash itself so many people must be concerned how do you do the contamination is it contaminated if you're picking up another sample does it know it has its own individual wash cycles so it does washing automate it so whole thing is automated so it not only does the washing after every time it picks up a snoo set of 12 it washes internally and once the washing is complete it makes sure that the samples are getting back and your new set of samples is going back in let me show you another video this is how we have used a variety of different platforms or surfaces this is the one that times you so this video will give you a little bit of a timing this is in fast motion but within a minute you can have your entire panel of antibodies quickly printed and you see how this is moving this is how the aspiration takes place your sample goes inside the printhead then this is where it checks out this is your software that I'm going to tell you about these are your plates where you can design what plate you want this is the washing step this is a test slide this will show you how many slides or how many spots are actually there look at how tiny the spots are look how many spots we can fit on a slide again temperature like I told you we can print from four degrees to 35 degrees and humidity is again really high from 80 percent we worked with customers in 80% humidity or 40% you this is the washing cycle this is what the washing happens and once the washing happens which is the bit which takes some time because it's very critical to wash your one set of twelve samples to avoid any contamination we want to make sure these are some of the spots we've printed with label-free technique and I think I believe they are not printed on our slide they're printed on a completely different surface so you have a slide you have a multiplex slide you can even do go as big as a plate so we each Eliza can happen on a plate you've got chips if you're anybody is doing micro fluidics work or any of the lateral flow techniques they can all be transferred [Music] so as I mention in the beginning the success of microarray based experiment also lies in how the producible our printing technologies are how good our arrays have been made and there is no variability or very little variability from one batch of printing to the other other batch of printing imagine when you are preparing the slides for doing microarray experiments you are printing in hundreds of slides you know large number of slight at the same time and if there is not a variation to start with from slide number one to slide them 100 then your intent biological experiments and reproducibility will be compromised so it's very important to pay good attention to the quality control sheets which are required to make good arrays and of course you know as you proceed to perform the experiments there has to be various QC checks to ensure that the quality is good for your printing and what slides you're going to use I hope in this lecture you have learnt about inkjet printing and its benefits you're also taught about different kind of substrates which are used for this printing and advantage of this technology over other technologies in the next lecture Kocher Salone will continue and talk to you about how exactly this technology works and how it can be used for many microarray based applications thank you [Music]
