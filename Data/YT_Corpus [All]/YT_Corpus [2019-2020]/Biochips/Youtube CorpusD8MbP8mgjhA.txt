 thank you for chipping in to another cyberpunk 2077 law update this time focusing on trauma team international the trauma team is considered one of the most powerful among sri corporations operating in night city a bonded and licensed paramedical franchise of an HQ in los angeles trauma team international offers its services throughout US Canada and even parts of Europe including the UK [Music] the trauma team is composed of paramedical techies and combat paramedics who will go to any lengths to deliver their clients from harm those wealthy enough to afford a trauma team medical plan receive a biochip implant as demonstrated when V is contracted to save Sandra Dorsett when the chip recognizes a medical problem any client system it immediately informs the trauma team who rapidly set how to extract the patient within 7 minutes or expect a refund although a refund might not be particularly useful if you are already dead Mike pon Smith revealed that B trauma team was invented because when he was writing cyberpunk had no way to get a cleric or healer style of character on the scene fast enough to save a dying player p84 was created because a paramedic friend of us was always complaining about idiotic drivers locking his ambulance when on a call and he used to say it would be easier to use evac choppers Mike draws upon real-life examples of the trauma team if you get sick on vacation certain organizations will chop her in rescue you and take you to a high-end hospital some will even provide paramilitary protection to go with E transport one organisation Mike refers to is med jet which claims that if you are hospitalized 150 miles or more from home med jet will arrange air medical transport all the way back to your hospital of choice in your home country trauma teams are typically composed of five members a driver a senior met a key and assistant and two security officers and use heavily armed AV for aircraft as transport they are also sometimes supported by mobile tanker trucks and ground refueling stations standard onboard weapons include twin autocannons 34 houses the most sophisticated rather vacation and life-support technology available in night city including a mobiles cryotank which can lower the body temperature of the patient to approximately 24 degrees Fahrenheit the optimum temperature to prevent hemorrhaging shock and brain swelling it has been implied that V might be able to hitch a ride in a navy for birds will not be able to drive on in cyberpunk 2077 [Music] hey give us a lift out of here during the years leading up to 2020 the trauma team could be summoned by dialling 9 1 1 in addition those who have an insurance package would be trauma team can opt to carry eight Deadman transmitter which will activate an automatically signal a trauma team the moment the patient's brain wave patterns falls into a coma state there is usually around eight dozen trauma teams on call at any time and night City after receiving an alert the nearest rahmatan unit goes airborne their sophisticated tracking equipment homing in on the last-known location of the patient if a firefighter still ongoing the trauma team often secured the area using a beast twin autocannon the mayor techs load the patient on board shunting their life-support to the onboard heart-lung machines plugging them into on board by Aman's and chilling their body down in the refrigerated tank for stabilization rapid surgeries performed on the spot for the most critical wounds while the trauma team medic uses a combination of electroshock drugs and manual resuscitation to get the patient on line typically the process takes four minutes from start to finish the trauma team can administer several medical treatments including adaptive nanos symbiosis Wes silicon carbonate nanotech begins to fill in the missing bone while pseudo flesh nanos fill in the missing meets other nanos release blood plasm antibiotics and stimulation packages similar to regenerators which promote realmeter grow and replace the repair bonders the patient is immersed they by firm gel made up of a DNA neutral protoplasm similar to stem cells were wounded areas are doped with gene packs to stimulate growth with the blank protoplasm changing over to replace the missing and damaged cells Mike pon Smith has revealed that in cyberpunk red the trauma team also received triage and medical procedure charts to enhance gameplay related to the trauma team and potentially good material for a sidequest is the life line act of 1994 the life line act allows a potential source of spare parts to carry a donor card in their wallet only donor carded bodies can be turned into a donor santa where a bounty is paid a bounty is based on the parts involved and the body condition at the time Brazil that many firefights and with frenzy diluting of bodies for donor cards followed by another firefight over disputed claims and ending another frenzy of looting in cyberpunk 2020 the best coverage one could purchase was V trauma team gold insurance policy offering a three to five minute response time owners also have a court law with ammo and feel used on their behalf no in a minute jacking into biome on Sandridge or set NC 5704 42 got a winner she will be if we can get her to a hospital she's trauma team Platinum too as far as I am aware there was no platinum insurance policy available prior to the events of e4 corporate war this may change June cyberpunk read or might be specific to 2077 as he platinum monikers now widely adopted when offering premium level products something's jamming the bio menthe signal talk to me tea bug biome on clean from old beer in three minutes another interesting observation from the gamers of a scavenger gang can block Sandra Dorset spy him on signal to be trauma team using a virus not only does this indicate a significant weakness a new trauma teams modus operandi that is Sandra survives she is probably jus a cornucopia of compensation during the fourth corporate war V trauma team remained neutral there is a common misconception that because a player might have a platinum membership every trauma team are guaranteed to save and regardless of his circumstances that is not always the case if it is not within the interest of each former team to become involved on a corporation level sometimes they simply do what is best for business however my pond sniff did reveal in one game he had a fixer take a bad hit so B hit B TT card patrol my team showed up spring the area with bullets to secure the fixer however one of the casualties from this fire popped his card resulting any second a beer arriving and me trauma team fretting both sides in order to extract their patients it is not uncommon vats solos media's and verse from other professions to moonlight as a trauma team while waiting for a big score this might explain why dr. Victor vector had be trauma team symbol on his attire when V visited him for some cyberware upgrades yes right here for those that cannot afford trauma team services they can use city Med in not-for-profit which offers medical services to those who can't afford it they function thanks to donations and received quite support from several corporations who realize having a base level of care available to be destitute can help prevent a pandemic something which can harm even their bottom line trauma teams often utilize medic gear combat medical armor utilizing the latest in computer medical and armor technology medic gear by bodyweight systems is designed to assist medics everywhere incorporated into be structures a hybrid medic wear computer sensors and software or added VAT allow it to function as a drug analyzer and e-text scanner giving the user the ability to see just what cyber where the patient has a spray skin apply is mounted on the right wrist any dermal stapler is also available if the trauma tee needs some serious firepower to back them up they also have access to VT b0 lifeline assisted combat personal armor this was a collaboration between military and trauma team international the Lifeline is designed to walk through fire water chemicals bullets or whatever else is necessary to save a life of a client's so you might want to think twice before aggravating them finally driving around Knight city is a very special trauma team AV for its random times it will track down broken TT cards and come to rescue you however when the doors slide open several bozos dressed as doctors will pile out steal your cyberware and simply leave you with a sign that reads kick me Knight city is always full of surprises hey samurai are you interested in more cyberpunk 2077 content then be sure to hit that subscribe button thank you for chipping in [Music]
