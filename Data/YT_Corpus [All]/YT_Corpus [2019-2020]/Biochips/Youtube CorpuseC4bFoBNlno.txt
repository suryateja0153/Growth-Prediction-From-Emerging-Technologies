 okay so i think i'd be lying to you guys if  i said that this city is not beautiful what's   going on peeps welcome back it's your boy unreal  royale and this is cyberpunk 2077. all right so   i gotta go meet up with a few people because  uh first and foremost i have to go meet up   with jackie but i think that i might go on ahead  and skip the main missions here a bit now the one   problem i have is this watch this right so let's  just say i want to punch somebody's lights out bam   it's like they don't even fall like nothing ends  up happening right they just end up running away   so i would say the overall mechanics for this  game are a little you know wonky per se because   it doesn't really seem to you know make sense like  an enemy wise right i feel like i feel like just   jumping in front of this car oh god whoa you saw  that he almost knocked me out watch this it was   good shoddy you want to dance yeah like nothing  happens she just ends up dropping and running   away right so that that's what i'm saying though  right all right so uh i think there are a bunch   of gang members on the corner there which i don't  want to initiate or end up getting myself into so   i want to go on ahead and explore the city a bit  look at this this is like the slums right here dog   this reminds me of like new york back like in the  early 2000's when it was just garbage everywhere   all right so um i have to call uh militech the  militech agent and i have to do my thing let me   go on ahead and see something real quick so let me  uh where's my journal real quick shards messages   not really interested in any of that i'm level  three by the way so i'm gonna have to up up my uh   my status is there all right so where wow the  city's huge i mean just just to get a scope   of this look at this this metropolis is huge and  i'm only like you know in this part of town which   really isn't much all right so we have a few side  jobs um you know what i'm about to do i'm about to   i'm about to go take up the side job  i'm about to go take up the side job   to see what it is that i have to do that's  going to get me on by all right so by the   way if you guys are new smash that subscribe  button give this video a big fat thumbs up   and um also i i want to get your thoughts on the  criticisms of this game if you guys believe that   yo if you guys you know what i'm about to draw the  smoke what up you want to talk no oh wait a minute   y'all better not yo i swear to go wait hold up  hold up hold up hold up hold up i swear to god   all right i i i have no idea why  i just took that where's my uh   where's my gun there it is right there that's  that's my beauty there we go all right yay oh you   so damn damn damn damn damn i have to shoot her  in the head yeah this is gang warfare right here   wow i want i want all the smoke that's  exactly why i came i want all the smoke   all right there we go hold on let me let me end  this person's existence nice little head shot   this is why i'm here i'm here to  steal from them oh there's one more   where's last person i'm about to end your life  yay yay oh there's a pedestrian here hold on let   me shoot him in the penis real quick yay oh he's  still alive hold on damn it damn it no no damn   come on come on come there we go how many  headshots can these people take all right so it's   best if i just steal whatever it is that i want to  steal from these people and just get my ass out of   here um i'm gonna borrow this corpse here for uh  scientific research purposes wink wink nudge nudge   that's pretty dope you're able to do that i i  just love it all right let me just drop this   body off real quick let me just read my message  um all right no answer better meaning business   okay whatever um i think that was jackie if  i'm not mistaken whatever all right let me   go up here real quick damn these people are  already oh crap is there someone behind us   i think there's someone tracking me  which i have to be very careful about   by the way this game is very long from what i've  been uh seeing and hearing so but it does have a   lot of like i would say problems to it that it  needs to be fixed and addressed which i mean   the game just launched so it is what it is but  you know i think people expected more from what   they had or what they got oh did you just see  that i was about to jump is that where the map   is guiding me like this map is like yo homie just  jump oh damn all right i'm gonna i can't believe   i'm about to pull this off let me see if i could  try something real quick i know this is going to   be a bad idea oh god oh wow it actually worked  i can't believe it it actually freaking worked i i just skidded down the side of this bridge all  right whatever i mean hey to each its own right   i'm not really liking this too much this seems  a little fishy to me i don't know what i'm doing   around these parts of town i'm not supposed to  be out here you feel me i feel like a lone ranger i mean for for what it's worth um the game seems  very explorable oh someone's calling me regina   cyber psycho attack all confirmed a cyber psycho  attack where thing is nobody's gonna show cause   militech shut it right down oh crap this cops here  ask me psycho's got to be one of theirs my eddies   are on lieutenant all right i'm not supposed to  be here doing this so let me just come over here   so make very very sure you keep how the hell am i  supposed to is there like an alleyway i'm supposed   to go to is this it oh wait did they really block  this off i think they did oh wait a minute y'all   y'all really blocked this off so i i can't even  get down there if i wanted to wow the cops really   blocked this off all you freaking [ __ ] bro that  sucks like i can't even all right you know what   i'ma have to jack this dude for his ride homie  sorry buster all right let me let me take control   let me take control yo get the freak out the  car yo i ain't playing would you get out the car   get out the car yo she's not even afraid you know  what i'm about to do it i don't even care yeah all   right get out the car get out the freaking car  oh damn it the cops are gonna be after me dude   there we go holy [ __ ] all right time for me oh  time for me to skedaddle time for me to skedaddle   yeah this is uh this is definitely something that  i i did not wait all right let me just go ahead   and turn this off all right perfect so i have no  idea where it is i'm gonna be going i have no idea   where this is going to be taking me but so as long  as i can avoid the cops by all means then i think   i'm good all right uh find the cyber psycho okay  i have no idea where this cyber cycle is at so   unless i'm supposed to be looking on this  map so obviously i i can't go down there   uh is this where the cyber psycho is at all  right the pickup meet up with jackie all right   that's that's the destination then that is the  oh crap there's cops like there's cops posted up   everywhere dude let me go ahead and turn this i  will also say this game reminds me so much of uh   of like saints row but at the same time i don't  know like i just feel like i feel like this game   could have improved so much more you feel me but  that's just me if you guys have not checked out   my cyberpunk playlist then you guys can go on  ahead and check that out got some cool stuff on   there oh thank god those cops didn't really spot  me my driving skills are terrible in this game   oh wait a minute did the cops spot me i hope not  because that that is definitely not what i want   to do i i do not want to get myself involved  oh can i can i break there we go i do not want   to get myself involved in something that i'm  not ready for especially when all i have is   a pistol you feel me but let's just take a second  to like admire this like fictional city it's just   beautiful right like you know they they really did  a great job with like bringing to life this world   this unknown oh this is bad oh my vehicle  or should i say the former woman's vehicle   all right is this where i'm supposed to meet  him up there i
