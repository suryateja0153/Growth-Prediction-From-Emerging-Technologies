 [Music] hi welcome to this module here what we are discussing in the last lecture we have seen a biochip MEMS base map that we can use to understand the tissue property or learn the changes the dish property what are the changes electrical changes thermal changes mechanical changes three changes right so when you talk about thermal changes you need to fabricate a micro heater and for that we have seen in the last module how to fabricate the micro heater using MEMS based process right so if you see on the slide this is what we have seen yesterday several micro heaters that you can fabricate on the oxidize silicon wafer now today if you see over the heater there is an inter digitated electrodes right and over in traditional detectors that is pure resistive material so we will see today how can we fabricate intelligence re inter digitated electrodes on the micro heater and then or interdigital electrodes piece of registry sensing material which are shown in the four squares here and this one okay so i'll show you in terms of process flow so we should start drama wafer and if our is oxidized silicon wafer and on oxidase Nagar inferred you have a micro heater right so you have nichrome you have sio2 you have silicon you have sio2 this is your micro heater over oxidized silicon substrate the next step here would be to deposit or to grow a silicon dioxide or an insulating layer an insulating layer on the micro heater so the the dotted version is the silicon dioxide insulator can be silicon lighted as well right but we are growing silicon dioxide this is your nichrome this is your silicon dioxide this is silicon dioxide and this is your silicon now we have to understand if I go to the backs the previous slide there is a contact here and here which is this one sorry if because this is a chip here and here these are the contacts which are this context okay so I have to keep it open for accessing the heater right at the end when the bio chip is ready so for that I have to remove or H the silicon dioxide from the contact region to do that the next step would be after this the next step would be to spin coat photoresist this is my positive photoresist after spin coating photoresist I'll go for soft bake at 90 degree centigrade for 1 minute on hot plate next step is to lower the mask to load the mask so I would have my nichrome I will have photoresist and a mask photoresist silicon dioxide or micro heater and this is my mask I'll use a dark film asked this is a positive photoresist silicon dioxide nichrome heater silicon dioxide silicon dioxide silicon gnarrk field mask right so what we have done we have used a dark field mask we have use a positive photoresist and then we will expose this mask with UV light what will happen since it is a positive photoresist the unexposed region will be stronger and the exposed region would be weaker correct so in this case the exposed region is this - so after this if I continue then what will I do I will develop the wafer I'll use photoresist developer to develop the photoresist I can say lapping refer or developing photoresist and then I will get silicon dioxide my heater silicon dioxide and photoresist in this area right photoresist is shown by the wavy design so I have now photoresist silicon dioxide micrometer silicon dioxide silicon silicon dioxide correct after that I will dip this wafer in bubber buffer hydrofluoric acid but just dripping the wafer in buffer hydrofluoric acid before that we have to do post big right soft soft big I will say Harbach so before hydrofluoric acid will go for harvick hard-baked you know the temperature 120 degree centigrade one minute on hot plate right after that after this step I'll go for b hf b hf s buffer hydrofluoric acid when we do b hf when we place this referring b hf what will happen the silicon dioxide over the contact will get edged the silicon dioxide over the contact region will get H like this now you can see the contact correct after this the next step would be after be HF the next step would be to strip off the photoresist strip of the photoresist that can be done by placing the wafer in acetone that you can done by placing the wafer in acetone so if I place the wafer dip the wafer in acetone then what will I have I'll have my context of the micrometer opened and remaining area of the micrometer covered by silicon dioxide right easy so this is what we get once we process once we do the micro fabrication process that is we have a micro heater we grow a silicon dioxide now how will grow silicon dioxide there are many techniques right we will go for plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition or that's why we are depositing silicon dioxide using chemical technique and the advantage is that now we can go for a lower temperature compared to lpcvd so why we can use PECVD and what's the importance we'll talk during this fabrication plus but right now just understand that we have deposited a silicon dioxide layer over nichrome which is a micro heater using PECVD and then we perform photolithography which is you have to spin coat the photoresist here we have use positive photoresist then go for a soft bake which is a 90 degree 1 minute hot plate and then we load the mask the mask is a dark film mass because we are to open the contact area right then we expose the mask or expose the wafer with UV and the unwanted or unprotected area or you can say this is a dark film mask so the unexposed area will be stronger and the exposed area would be weaker because we are using positive photoresist when we do that what will get you will get the photoresist over all the area on the sub on the heater except on the context then what we can do then we can do a Hardwick Hardwick he's done it 120 degree centigrade for one minute or hot plate followed by VHF edging they'll see the contacts are etching and then finally we strip off the photoresist with help of acetone to get the heater over we silicon dioxide is there and the context they are accessible because there is no silicon dioxide on the contact of the heater right so this is an accept now over this we have to develop the inter digitated electrodes so if you go back if you see the slide I'll show you this one right so now what we have done on this heater you have silicon dioxide all the way you have silicon dioxide except on the contact region right only in the contact area only in the contact area you don't have silicon dioxide all right so after this we need to need to go for fabricating inter digitated electrodes all right so that we can we can have peace or resistive material patterned on this inter digitated electrodes so let us see the next step fabricating inter digitated electrode on micro heater in between the reason insulating layer okay so we'll start with this wafer and let's see what you have so when I do stripping of photoresist in acetone what will I have I'll have this particular wafer right so if I want to fabricate an inter digital electrode let us take the wafer there is a oxide there is a micro heater and there is an insulating layer right which is your silicon dioxide on the micro heater except except on the contact area then the next step would be the next step would be to deposit metal on the micro heater and this metal is our chrome gold the reason of using Chrome before we deposit gold for is for improving the edition this is my silicon dioxide this is my micro heater this is again silicon dioxide this is silicon and silicon dioxide cool now next step would be on this you have to spin coat photoresist so I'll spin coat photoresist on this all right this is my positive photoresist you let it down positive photoresist alright then I will go for soft baked soft baked is done at ninety degree centigrade for one minute on hot plate okay after that what's the next step the next step is that we will go for loading the mask right so I have to load the mask this is oxide silicon oxide and then we have heater and then we have silicon dioxide right on that what we have on that we have chrome gold right on chrome gold what we have on chrome goal we have a photoresist on photoresist will have a mask okay and this mask is a bright film asked to form inter digitated electrodes and also sorry and also to protect the metal on the contact of micro heater so this is a frightful mask this is to protect the metal on the contact of the micrometer which is right over here and here as well as stood to form the inter digitated electrodes this is my rightful mask this is photoresist positive this is chrome gold then silicon dioxide right then like Chrome then silicon dioxide then silicon finally silicon dioxide after this what is the next step all of you know right UV exposure UV exposure when we expose the UV and develop the wafer what will happen the area that is unexposed will become stronger since it is a positive photoresist and the area which is exposed will become weaker right so if I after this if I dip the wafer if I dip the wafer in PR developer then what will happen I will see my photoresist my photoresist in this area correct then after PR developer we will go for Chrome n gold a right if I'd so if I go for chrome and gold etchings after PR developer is it correct step no right because before that we have to go for hard baked hard baked 121 minute or plate after this you can go for chrome watching right so when you go for chrome watching what you will have you will have right chrome and gold will be saved or protected where there is a photoresist where there was no photoresist the chrome and gold got edged after this what is the next step next step is as he tone stripping or acetone strip acetone strip is or acid using acetone we can strip the between acetone we can strip the photoresist so if I dip the wafer this wafer into an acetone then my photoresist will get stripped off and what will I have I'll have oxidized silicon wafer with a hitter and inter digitated electrodes you got it so I will repeat the step first you have wafer with micro heater and on that you are protecting this licken dioxide in all the regions except the contact region then you are depositing chrome gold how can I deposit chrome gold using one of the technique pecvd sorry PVD physical vapor deposition either you can use thermal evaporation or you can use EB me operation or you can use sputtering we have chrome gold and then on chrome volt we spin coat positive photoresist then we do soft bake for ninety degree centigrade one minute on hot plate followed by loading of mask right and then exposing our mask was brightful mask right and we are protecting the region where we want to fabricate the interdigital electrodes and also the contact over the micro heater and then we are exposing the wafer with the help of a pause with the help of bright film mask followed by a peer develop followed by Hardwick at 120 degree centigrade followed by chrome gold etchings because peer will be developed in the area that was exposed and unexposed region will be hard then once you do chrome watching you will see that chrome and gold are edge the region which are not protected by photoresist and then we go for acetone strip or for stripping the photoresist and that will give us an inter digitated electrodes over a micro heater and in between there is a in so there is an insulating layer this is a fabrication and he's the actual SEM image of the of the introduced electrodes over silicon dioxide over micro heater you can clearly see a micro heater below interdigital electrodes and in between there is a sandwich layer of silicon dioxide silicon dioxide being a transparent material you can see the micrometer through the silicon dioxide all right so in the next module what we will see we will see how can we deposit a piece of resistive material on this interdigital electrode to fabricate beaser resistive sensor so I hope in this module you learn quickly how to deposit an insulating layer on micro heater how to open the contact and then how to fabricate an integer digital digital electrodes over the insulator over micro heater just go through it once again and I'll see you in the next class where we'll do more of this particular step to fabricate a chip that is that can that has an integrated heater and integrated piezo resistive sensors and an integrated electrical sensors till then you take care I'll see you next class
