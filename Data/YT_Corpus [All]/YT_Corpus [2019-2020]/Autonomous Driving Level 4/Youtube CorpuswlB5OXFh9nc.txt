 I'm at the Society of Automotive Engineers World Congress in Detroit and this is a gathering of people who up until now have literally been in charge of the nuts and bolts that go into your vehicle and increasingly they're in charge of the self-driving cars of the future so at this event you've got technical trainings you've got components vendors you've got people who make tools who make it easier for automotive engineers to do their jobs you've got the latest version of the SAE s autonomous car driving demo which we have covered previously there's an engineering competition for kids called jet toy where they're building these little toy cars that are powered by balloons and it's a way for them to learn about engineering basics there's also a bagel wall there are many overlapping technical innovations that need to happen in order for self-driving cars to become a reality but the one unifying benefit across all of them is the vision of a future with zero motor vehicle deaths so last year in America 37,000 people were killed on our roadways globally 1.3 million last year Americans sat for 97 hours in traffic we're not there yet but we're working on it I'm here with Ed Straub he's a head of the automated Vehicle Safety consortium which is a new initiative under sae you guys are working on safety measures and safety protocols for level 4 and level 5 autonomous vehicles aren't you guys a little ahead of the curve on that what we're seeing are an increase in the number of pilot projects and demonstration projects around the country we see that now we saw an opportunity for these companies with wealth of safety and testing experience to get together and come up with best practices common practices and share that with the public the SAE set the standards for autonomous vehicles on a scale of level zero to level five level zero having no autonomous capabilities and level 5 being the autonomous utopia where the car can completely drive itself without any human interaction depending on who you ask we're somewhere around the level of level 2 or level 2 plus as eras daguan who's the head of a das and ad for mobile I said today you added a term l2 plus today and I've seen that term used before but it's not always used with the same definition what are your thoughts about what the automotive industry including the supply base companies like mobile I can do to bring some clarity to that anything that is lower than level 3 assumes that the driver is liable for what's going on in the vehicle it's very simple level 3 and above introduces different types of autonomy level 3 is conditional autonomy when we talk about level fours and level 5 which is the Utopia level 4 is is full autonomy meaning that the vehicle kids could stop is liable for what's going on and could and could handle with exceptions all the way to reaching a safe State autonomous vehicles are mostly in a testing phase they're in controlled environments they're not ready for the mass market and at the same time you have a lot of consumer vehicles now and a lot of options for what's called a das or driver assistance and that's something that's more ubiquitous and that technology is helping us get towards a more autonomous future for a company like mobile I that's able to collect data from all over the planet about how people get around there's a feedback loop between autonomous driving technology and driver assistance technology and those two interactions will feed into each other to create their RSS model which is a mathematical formula for how autonomous vehicles should behave in the real world Darris is based on pure formula right but based on a pure interpretation with kinematic clear kinematic parameters of what each agent should be assuming when he's negotiating and it's there's it's not open for interpretation or for gestures or for a nice smile that's not the point that's exactly what which we wanted to take out a big way or the opposite of a smile yes there's another conversation here that's not just about the technology but whether or not the public will trust it and that's an area where there's a lot of work being done in terms of surveys of the public education and the sae has a big role in that how is mobilize thinking about validating the technology to the point where you're you're comfortable with saying okay we now trust and you should trust this technology so we are in multiple channels of discussion with standardization bodies with SAE 4 in particular in China we have a lot of traction and with regulatory bodies we do believe that through the regulator acceptance a regulator education the trust will trickle down to society the regulator is the gatekeeper and is usually tougher much tougher than the society my key takeaway is that while autonomous vehicles are still a number of years off we still have a very active ecosystem as evidenced here at this event the next big step for the industry is going to be to get the price of these autonomous vehicle capabilities and these driver assistance capabilities low enough so that massive scale can be achieved you know people are walking around saying the car that you will buy this month may be the last car that you own I'm not so sure about that but increasingly we're seeing cars with these features that are working towards a fully autonomous future you [Music]
