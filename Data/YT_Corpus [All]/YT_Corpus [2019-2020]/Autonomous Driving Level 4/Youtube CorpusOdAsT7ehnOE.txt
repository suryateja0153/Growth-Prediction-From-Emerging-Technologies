 [A fantastic intro!!] [That's a bonus mark] Elon Musk announced Tesla's new fsd full driving computer Which will power Tesla's vehicles specs of this new computer include processing input from 8 cameras 12 ultrasonic sensors, a front-facing rod radar and GPS and mapping data each chip performs up to 72 trillion operations per second and ability to analyze 2100 frames of video each second. It is a very big step forward as only the software needs to be upgraded This might influence more people to purchase a self-driving vehicle as they don't need to go through the inconvenience of having to upgrade The chip and rather do a quick software update There are five levels of autonomous at level one drivers assistant ensure additional safety and comfort [sweet music is a bonus mark] At level two partly automated driving as possible where drivers can remove hands from wheel for brief periods At Level three highly automated driving allows full control to the car over long distances in certain traffic situations The car requires highly advanced sensors such as laser scanners video cameras radar systems to create 360-degree view of surroundings at level 4 fully automated driving where the car can handle highly complex urban driving situations However, must require a driver at level 5 full automation has been reached and Drivers are not needed as well as a license more importantly tolerating accepting and embracing Self-driving cars will provide a broader access to life and society to all citizens throughout their entire lives The technology includes lidar sensors ultrasonic sensors Cameras and radar sensors. The sensors are located at the front and the rear of the vehicles Cameras and lidar sensors are also commonly found on the roof. without them. The vehicles will be virtually blind Lidar is a key component to many vehicles Lidar works similarly to radar Lidar, however doesn't use radio waves but light waves that reflected by the objects in the surrounding and detected by the lidar sensor in this way a Point cloud is generated by the environment. However Lidar doesn't recognize road signs Cameras, use artificial intelligence to recognize and interpret road signs Cameras are also used to detect obstacles and are needed for lane-keeping Self-driving cars a lot of good things to them but there's a lot of bad Accidents are deemed to happen on the road and in the air no matter what's going on Even with a driver or without one things are going to happen in Arizona. Just last year There was an accident a lady was struck and killed by a self-driving car The guy wasn't paying attention and it was on his phone or looking down onto something and lady was killed This is always gonna happen with people not having to pay attention to the roads if someone's driving for you AI can make accidents, it's possible and people say that maybe it's unethical for self-driving cars to be out on the streets in today's era But I believe that it's not I believe that it's a big step for us to move on From the past and go on to bigger things Look at airplanes. airplanes autopilot now But back then so many accidents occurred for them to fix the big problems. This video shows a car back into a car It's a little mistake little error that will fix a lot of big things in the future Maybe put self-driving cars all out on the road in the future
