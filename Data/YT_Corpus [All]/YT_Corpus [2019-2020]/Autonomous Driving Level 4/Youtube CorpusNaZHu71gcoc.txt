 [Music] welcome to Frankfort welcome to set F on air in the city the Frankfurt Motor Show is currently going on and once again one of the trending topics is autonomous mobility a topic we would like to learn more about with an illegal welcome on earth hi Daniel honored what is your job at San F I'm a product owner for feature development for self-driving cars and my main focus is level four level five autonomy software development so the perfect expert frost so let's talk about autonomous ability in our setting all right let's go I know there are many different scenarios related to autonomous driving can you briefly explain us how does that F see the future of mobility in this regard I mean if you're talking about self-driving technology you're talking about a very big variety of different technology working together in the system in a very complex system from our perspective self-driving technology will help to support our daily life so for example if you look on Frankfurt you have a very high demand on mobility the Eagle People Mover where we are the system supplier with our exactly what's this product portfolio which the we support the executives opposition same with the freight delivery and freight earning so I think all tournament systems will change the way how we see mobility and logistics in the future and reshaping and usually things are a little bit more complicated down on the screen then up here in the air can you describe us briefly the challenges in developing automatic driving functions basically we're here right over downtown Frankfort and it's a very cloudy place if you look outside of the window I think the biggest challenge in urban driving is that you have like a very limited space and very limited time in order to make a decision and we have to make the system safe because this is like the overall standard where as we set up for our products we need to make the product safe and therefore the biggest challenge is to make it safe under all conditions because rain traffic snow everything you are in a encountering every day in the traffic we need to have naturalism when do you see will we have you and I are old and self-driving car in our garage I see self-driving technology will first come to market and part of the movers in the commercial industry and people moving industry as soon as we can decrease the costs of the systems I see that it's quite realistic that you will have also some driving technology in the past Carson yeah you describe the beginning you are responsible for the function development of autonomous driving can you explain us a little bit what is your team working on currently basically to split it up the sir that claim is see thinking act we are responsible for software development of the pink component the decision making of this whole system and currently were developing 11 for double platinum e4m areas like my purpose I know thank you very much so these exciting insights and now let's enjoy the view thank you very much
