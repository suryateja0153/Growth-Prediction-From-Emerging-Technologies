 there you go and nice and mortars is here with nice and intelligent mobility and we have this electric car by listen so the future is electric my friends you are into batteries or you invest in any battery technology we have an energy ice cream oh sure right we have here that is they're giving house for my script and here they have some cars we're doing so basically this ball always works and nobody says course no matter what you do you're in that little kid in the video game support so maybe that's the way that says only problem Oh Mattox all right thank you here we have miss eviscerate with some really cool engines take a look at this monsters those are the new 48 bold motor generators and I assume that this is one of their dozen say but it looks like maybe like an inverter or the generator for for the signalling and this is the engine is here where you have a tire because the generation and the integrated search generator that is G does the engine for a whole system in a trouble system so the torque look at the torque with OTA is G mo da bulls eyes she has bring us brought to talk to her to a big performance improvement from almost 80 or 120 to 180 it looks a little confusing by this only if you see that the bottom one is Sakura 120 115 and the top one is hunger and 80 about that as the performance of this myths of exchanges you can see here this which has a smart space separation that also has innovation in terms of signal processing it doesn't say that uses AI but it's similar to Koya is air power so so it's a similar technology that we've seen thus far and multiple vendors and we have miss seviche electric present at the Consumer Electronics Show your washing deck a TV look at this vehicle very nice car you're watching deca TV here at the for booth Consumer Electronic Show this is DPS which is also here to demonstrate their audio system the HD radio and and sound ace sounds very nice actually from here maybe we won't be able to capture that sound quality with this with the current settings but it really sounds nice and DPS is not left out here with all the different stations that are presented here around the world you guys are washing deck at TV you're gonna start wrapping up here we saw way too many things we are I am basically exhausted walking I think I walk more like 12 miles in two days or more it's been a wonderful experience I really recommend you guys coming to the Consumer Electronic Show 2021 you have definitely have to come hopefully you come home when I do this booth do one of your technologies and you're showcasing something advanced something cool something that revolutionizes the world this continues on to the right direction over there I I really don't know what's going on on that side but I think I think I did my best to cover as much as I could it's only me it's only a dr. Lynn Fernandez here and I'm physically bound by physics but I cannot do more than what I can so well I'm gonna rub up right now and I see something else are reported all right take care thanks for joining go watch it
