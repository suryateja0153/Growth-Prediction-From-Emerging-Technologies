 Hi, my name is Kevin and I'm in charge of  the TractEasy marketing activities at EasyMile. TractEasy is an autonomous tow-tractor for  good transportation and bagage handling. It has been co-developed by EasyMile and TLD. TLD is the world leader in ground support equipment and EasyMile brought its expertise on autonomous technology. TractEasy can be used on two main markets:  on airport, to transport luggages and cargo between planes and terminals or between terminals,  but also on industrial sites and logistics centers to transport any type of goods between buildings. It is suitable for operations from  two shifts per day, five days a week and up to 24/7. The main benefits of automation are:  to reduce operational costs and to increase productivity. But one of our main concern is also  to increase the safety of the operations TractEasy is in operation on the PSA factory in Sochaux, in France. Today, the factory is producing up to two thousand cars per week. Logistic processes of the factory are today operated by Geodis. Geodis is using the TractEasy to transport parts from the warehouse to the assembly line.  It is about a 3km loop where we go through traffic light intersections, roundabout, railway, pedestrian crossing,  a very complex environment for automation. Since the end of 2019, we are providing a fully driverless service. The first autonomous tow-tractor transporting goods on an industrial site.
