 several people have asked how do you check  the tire pressure on your tesla the model s   model x and the model 3 and model y on the  model 3 and model y you have to swipe over   the tire pressure card which is in the corner  above this button you just swipe that over   until you get to the tire pressures and now once  you do get to the tire pressures so on the model   s and model x you'll hold this button  down and you'll scroll down to car status   you'll get it like looking like this it'll  have the dashes on it so in order to get a tire   pressure next thing you need to do is turn the  car on and drive and once you get the car above   18 the car will activate the sensors and then  from there you just need to go short distance there you go and that's how you get  your tire pressure readout on your tesla   we'll catch you on the flipside you
