 self-driving cars whether you trust them or not they are becoming more and more common that's right even our Airport is starting to use one hand cabin arrow explains well guys it's a little different than most self-driving cars sliding doors on the outside a lot about twelve people inside and even though there's no steering wheel in sight they're keeping somebody inside just to be safe so the quicker I can get from point A to point B the better seems like everyone at abia is on the move and that's why the airport is opening doors making it easier to move around autonomous vehicles are the future Mandy McClendon is a public information officer for the airport so right now we're in a phase where we can test the vehicle for about six months see if it's a good option for us and then go from there it gets you to our rental car facility and our ground transportation well it is self driving they still keep an attendant inside to assist passengers with with loading luggage or anything else that they might need it runs from 8:00 till noon before the staff charges it up and then again from 4:00 till 8:00 but some wish it was running more why not I mean listen I guess it's a little bit scary this idea of like computers robots taking over what humans do or it's very innovative and we've got to continue to be looking at the future and determine how we're going to move people along within the communities we was gonna stop from jumping on a car that's just gonna take you you know who cares if somebody's driving it or not getting you from point A to point B it's just another way to keep everyone on the move at abia it's it's another option for passengers and it's reliable of course autonomous thank heaven air KVUE news so right now the airport is looking at this not only for the current route that it's on but also seeing if anywhere else might benefit from the car
