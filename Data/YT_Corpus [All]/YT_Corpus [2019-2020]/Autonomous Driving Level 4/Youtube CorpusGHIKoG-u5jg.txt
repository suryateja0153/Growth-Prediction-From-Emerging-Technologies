 hey guys get on here they're very welcome to the channel I just watched a video of Elon Musk speaking at the world a a conference in Shanghai about just how close Tesla are to achieving full self driving and as a shareholder this gets me super excited here's the clip I'm extremely confident that's level five or essentially complete autonomy will be with what will happen and I think will happen very quickly I think at Tesla with I feel like we're very close to level five before tomorrow me do I think I guess I spy remain confident that we will have the functionality for the basic functionality below five what's one of me I complete this year and I've been following the advances in this base for some time and we were blessed because while there's at least a dozen companies working hard trying to solve the problem of self-driving there's at least four million youtubers working just as hard to solve even bigger problem of who's going to reach level five full autonomy first so there is a great amount of information available on YouTube about this subject now I'll say while I am a self-confessed Tesla fanboy I'm an investor first and foremost and I want to invest in the winner in the race to fully self-driving because I think whoever wins this is going to change the world and ultimately have a gigantic market cap so I've always tried to be the non biased as I can when it comes to researching this stuff and in case you're new to this subject by the way there's essentially five different levels of autonomy the levels range from level zero all the way up to level 5 level zero basically means zero autonomy and the human driver is in full control of the car at all times the level of autonomy then increases with each level all the way up to level five where the car can drive anywhere by itself without the need of a human occupant now when you look at all the different players in the game you essentially realize that there's two different strategies at play here for trying to solve this complex problem you have Tesla, Coma AI, Mobile Eye and a couple of others that are essentially using cameras and deep learning and they are currently at level two and trying to slowly incrementally get to level five the idea behind the strategy stems from the fact that our driving infrastructure is built for vision and as humans we can drive pretty well which is two eyes to perceive the world and a brain to make decisions these companies thus use cameras to see the world and they're developing complex machine learning systems to be able to perceive and react to what they see they're currently at level two autonomy and they're slowly trying to incrementally increase the way up to level four as they're machine learning algorithms improve over time on the other side of the fence then you've order players such as whey mo Cruz and uber who are essentially using cameras with lidar which is essentially laser shooting sensors they are trying to go straight to level four where by they are fully autonomous but within the confines of a geo-fenced area once they get there and they want to scale out geographically now there are a couple of distinguishing factors between these two groups the first one and the obvious one is do we need lidar, yes or no, the second one then is which is a better strategy incrementally going from level two to level five are going straight to level four and then scaling geographically the third factor that distinguishes these groups is data collection now we can argue all day over one and two Tesla's and other companies using just vision are adamant that loiter is not required and that scaling from level two to level four it was the only true way to ever really reach level five autonomy way more and other companies taking a lighter approach argue the officers they feel that lidar is required if we're to ever truly reach full self driving safely one thing we can argue over though is the data collection mechanisms and the level of data these companies have because the NOI mind teza has a crazy advantage in this area they have over 800,000 cars driving around collecting data and in total they have about three billion miles of data collected to put this in context way more only has about thirty million miles collected nobody has ordered on a car company which the integrated self-driving Hardware could possibly take this approach and Tesla are the only company with the required hardware and the software even Google could not afford to do this I mean could you imagine if you actually had to pay for this level of data to be connected it would cost you tens of billions and it would take you in years and years to complete and trust me on this because I've done the calculations and to put some context on this right we know that GM bought cruise automation thousand and sixteen for 500 million and we know from a lawsuit we're way more sued uber for stealing trade secrets that way more spent roughly 1.1 billion on their projects from 2009 to 2015 we also know that Zoox's raised roughly 1 billion to fund their project and is now being bought by Amazon for roughly 1 by a 1 billion so clearly nobody is in a position to spend 10 billion plus on data collection now way more counter this argument by saying that they're running simulation words and while I'm sure this does provide value I just can't imagine that is going to account for all the edge cases all the really really weird situations that happen in real life that are just unpredictable and cannot be predicted by a simulation yes humans are able to perceive these things and react to them in a safe manner I think that this race the self-driving is like a game of chess that's been played out over the last decade each player is making their moves hoping to get a checkmate first I believe though that this game was won very early on when Tesla made the strategic decision to equip all their cars with full self-driving hardware and over-the-air updates in this moved Heslin kicked off the strategy that was much more effective than all the other companies and because they're actually a car company they could actually do this they have an insurmountable advantage over all these other companies that are just standalone self-driving companies I honestly don't believe that these other companies realize the strategic advantage that Tesla had early on and they just went about executing their original strategy by the time they realized that their original strategy wasn't gonna win it was already too late too many moves had been made too much time had been lost too much money had been raised and too much money had been spent the winning player had made too much ground to ever be caught most executives in the auto industry are still betting against Tesla they don't think Tesla can do what they say it again they all see autonomy arriving slowly in geo-fenced areas using ugly and expensive equipment not fair now consumer cars if they're right and Waymo's R&D makes good sense and all the miles that Tesla has driven won't matter because they won't have been driven using the right equipment and we would have to wait on to 2030 to see autonomy in consumer cars but if as I suspect Tesla can deliver autonomy in the next couple of years reasonably and so inexpensively that it's actually available in consumer cars then holy shit this is a game over and not just for Waymo but also for Nikola and snake oil salesmen Trevor Milton I mean when Teslas semi is fully autonomous and Nikola's isn't then they dont even have a chance and guys this is just one of the reasons one of the many reasons that Tesla is the most valuable or her company in the world because when Wall Street hasn't copped onto it yet us consumer investors see the potential for this company to absolutely change the world guys I hope you enjoyed this video if you did then please give it a thumbs up and if you haven't yet and consider subscribing to the channel also let me know in the comments below if you think Telsa is gonna win the race the full set drive and if not let me know why I'm very curious to hear your thoughts okay so that's it thanks very much for watching have a lovely day and I'll see you in the next video
