 [Music] technology infuses nearly everything these days we have smart refrigerators smartwatches smart glasses it might not seem like we need any more smart stuff but some of these technologies can be really useful and that's especially true when it comes to smart roads really there's a traffic jam of ideas in the pipeline to make infrastructure more intelligent and help roads do everything from repair themselves to save lives here are three emerging technologies that give new meaning to the term street smart first some companies are working on roads that can prevent accidents and help drivers who have been in a crash there are a few ways to do this and some of them are being tested in Colorado one strategy is being tested by a company called integrated roadways in 2018 they announced that Colorado's Department of Transportation had granted them a contract to install smart pavement on a roughly 1 kilometre stretch of highway 285 smart pavement is a system of concrete slabs embedded with digital technology and fiber-optic mesh these fibers detect the position speed and weight of vehicles and once it's installed a computer communicating with the highway will be able to calculate if a car crashed skidded off the road or just pulled aside to take a photo of the landscape if there's been an accident or if a car veered off the highway routers inside the road will be able to alert emergency services to rush to the scene integrated roadways has already piloted this pavement on a section of road in Denver and it's currently collecting information on about 7,500 vehicles per day so if they're new roughly 1 kilometer test goes well this kind of technology could start popping up all over the place it is worth noting though that smart pavement isn't the only way to make a safer road there's also a system called v2x which is short for vehicle to everything it's a short-range wireless technology that allows vehicles to communicate with each other and with objects like stoplights and guardrails if the network of objects senses something like a bunch of vehicles decelerating it can send an audio or visual message to display screens on nearby cars warning drivers to proceed with caution for the system to be effective both the objects and the vehicles need to have v2x capability but some new cars already have this installed and other brands plan to add it to their future models Colorado is also testing out this system and their first stretch of road with this tech is expected to be completed in 2021 according to one consulting firm working with the state's Department of Transportation this tech could make a big impact too they say that if it were implemented throughout Colorado it could lead to more than 85,000 fewer car accidents and 300 fewer deaths over 20 years now traffic is bad but potholes can be a real pain - they're not fun to drive over and the really bad ones can even damage vehicles so in 2010 scientists in the Netherlands tested a potential solution build roads that can almost fix themselves to do this they started with a type of pervious asphalt commonly used in the Netherlands which is made of stones held together with his little human as possible bitumen is a sticky black binder this kind of asphalt is great for various reasons but by itself it still gets cracks and potholes they happen when the bitumen shrinks and detaches from the stones it's holding on to so next the researchers mixed in tiny pieces of steel wool the kind you might use to scour burned hamburger off your pans they took this mixture and used it to pave a section of road then in 2014 after letting it sit for a while they drove an induction machine over it the machine created an oscillating magnetic field which induced an electric current in the conductive steel wool the electricity heated the steel and melted the bitumen between the stones and that repaired the cracks that might have eventually caused potholes the scientists say that running the induction machine over steel filled asphalt every four years can double the lifespan of the road taking it from 8 to 10 to 16 to 20 the Netherlands has already used this technology on a dozen other roads - and according to one of the scientists that's not all this tech can do it may also be possible to send energy through the steel in the pavement so electric vehicles could charge while at a stoplight that technology is in the early stages but car charging roads are already rolling out elsewhere in 2018 the world's first electrified Road for charging cars debuted in Sweden and the way it works is pretty straightforward for this road engineers laid down about 2 kilometers of track in the centre of the road similar to the kind you see on light rail when you drive your electric vehicle on it an arm attached to the bottom of the vehicle reaches down and connects to the track then as you drive the road charges your battery if you switch lanes the arm will disconnect and if you stop the current will - this system is set up so that the electricity itself is on a separate rail about 5 centimeters below the surface and so that it only flows when a car is attached to that section of the road that way people can cross the street without getting electrocuted which is always nice still even if the whole area flooded with water or something the organization behind the project says the current isn't enough to hurt pedestrians now Sweden is thinking of applying this idea to 20,000 kilometres of highways throughout the country but again this method isn't the only way to do this other companies are testing wireless charging roads for example an Israeli company called electri on has successfully created a driving track studded with copper coils that are connected to the electrical grid when an electric vehicle outfitted with copper plates passes over them the interaction between the two electromagnetic fields generates power to charge the vehicle in 2019 the company announced it would install this technology on a public road in Sweden and France and the UK and South Korea are also testing similar tech one of the biggest concerns people have about electric vehicles is that there aren't enough places to charge their batteries but if the roads themselves charged cars that barrier would basically disappear so while smart roads may seem unnecessary at first they could eventually transform the way we drive they could potentially reduce or eliminate the need for gasoline-powered cars and gas stations they could reduce the need for frequent road repairs and they could even save our lives thanks for watching this episode of scishow and special thanks to our patrons on patreon we say it a lot but your support really does mean a lot to us and we couldn't make this show without you if you want to become a patron and learn how to keep scishow going you can go to patreon.com/scishow [Music] you [Music]
