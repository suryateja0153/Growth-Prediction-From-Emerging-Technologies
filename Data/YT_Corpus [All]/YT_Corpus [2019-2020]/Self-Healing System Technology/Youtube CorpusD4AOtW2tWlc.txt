 so thank you very much for very kind introduction so I like to talk about homo cybernetics the era of a human ear integration the let me start with this picture actually it's me it's me I was four years old I was very like a lot less Inca there are miniatures racing cars so you see the technology here and myself human and interface so basically since they I keep doing the same thing in basically audience at the same time I also like superhero like like this so the these two I think very good contrast of who are the user interface and human augmentation and actually the term or concept augmentation is not new so the very beginning of user interface the dagger is angry but elaborate - it's called augmenting augmented research center and his landmark article is called augment human interest a conceptual approach in 1962 and also he leap right to the interview so he of course he's a very famous for in the invasion Mouse but he said that the mouse was just a tiny piece of a much larger project aimed at augmenting human interest and I leave is it this article so this is very very exciting and also he described the human artist artifact interaction relationship like this picture so the interface is just this part ok but much larger part is the integration human at artifact and also the art our real world so that this whole integration is very the important part of the human augmentation ultimate intelligence and let me just want introduce my own research so recent I'm very much interested silent voice so scientists agree without a vibrating ball curveball I just make mouse mass movement and still the computer can understand what you say so this will be I think the new interface of wearable computing so in the public you can you can say something too silly you can say play Alexa present music in public space but I just and then still you can communicate the computer and also it's also important technology for the people with injured vocal cord okay so they we use at the D planning and also using the ultrasonic system so you can see the inside of the mouth can be captured by the ultrasonic probe and the deep immunity can generalize this sound is generated by the computer did neural network so the sound fort is not so perfect but thanks to the Amazon able to twist sale sign boys and computer neural rate of change [Music] it's my correspond okay so the I think the future of the wearable computer like a small pickup here and this can capture your silent voice and maybe you will connect to the conductive iPhone conduction earphone so everything inside so it's a new home factor where computers and the same time I found that they this is not just for other for the neural net is only the lining side but human can also learn so initially he's tried to but he's not so good but then he gradually accustomed to what they how to use mouse using sideways and so this is similar to the why when we capture the ability of like water so the opposite initially we said some when I was baby like I said mama mama or then we compared using the auditory cortex so you can compare the Y utterance and my hearing and then comparative so maybe my father mothers at after us then we gradually captured how to throne us correctly and then the neuron comes in so we can also create different types of a wheel like this human organized organic brain and action erotic loops and they I found very interesting post related work so this is the silversmith and Geoffrey Hinton Chi 95 and probably this is the only paper published by professor Geoffrey Hinton okay so you know the Geoffrey he recently got the Turing award for the invention of the deep learning so this is also the the gesture generation recognition so this is identify by Seguin hi how's it going is a not bad how you know not too bad not too bad little busy these days so what'd you do last night go out yeah so I really like this person she said here it's a not known barber so if this is just a just a recognition system but you don't try to say here but this is the you have a movement and so processed by a neuron Network and this is also connected to the voice inside so it's this whole system is part of you so the it's very not just to say year or like nonverbal communication so this is integration of human and neural networks so well types of using technology and you and user interface and when device is much more intelligent like so the one way of the interactivity or other intelligence like human robot interaction so a is autonomous but other entity like door what so you and the robot can communicate this is human robot interaction but the eyes also sync there're other way of the communication with our intuition so you an area is a part of you okay so AI can extend your ability so this is called human AI integration and also there are a lot of interesting so this book is labeled abilities this is very interesting so this is the people are the OSA has a artists are implanted in a year but he is also a scientist so he tried to several programs that can download to this in a year okay so in so so they then there are auditory sync and change by change a program so essentially he has an API or programming himself and also most impressed simple way so you can embed it RFID chip here I think this is actually my student so they but in recent near future American computer or putting computers at ASU is quite natural and recently you noodling had a breakthrough for the brainless interface so in the future I think T your ability and also neural net ability can be more tightly integrated and also I think it's networking this human is much more interesting and one extreme way or the future vision is actually award with apps ok so you see this is the matrix very famous see so they when 3d asked how can you fry the thing can you slide that thing not yet [Music] [Music] so she down enough let's go [Music] so this is the other alternative the sinking of applications you can download apps ability apps and also I live is it the very famous classical paper by JCR Licklider called man computer symbiosis so as you know the this is a basic serve human company interactions so symbiosis is living together in intimate Association or even cross union of two dissimilar organism is called symbiosis so in this paper but I also found in this article the Grider described there are two examples that are not symbolic the one is mechanically extended man okay and the neighbors natural humanly extended machines but in the Augmented human concept these two extremely interesting tree from human research so maybe mechanical history extending you can see lot of processing devices or exhaust skeleton technologies and they release me and maybe in the computer basically was very hot topic of human I'm just getting started at this point and also humanly extended machines so for example one very interesting research of this is the human brain can enhance the machine learning but I think also the most of the crowdsourcing or machine learning using big human data is essentially humanly extended computer machines so both machine I extended mechanically extend man and human extended machine is opposed to very important direction of the human organization human ear integration so I talked about human area integration which is the different types of intelligent devices and human humans and we think that a CA and AI can we classify the four types so the One Direction self and other so the interaction with self personalized and the interaction with others and the other dimensions visible or imp explicit dimension also invisible or calm ground so this personal expression is like no more intelligent using like explainable AI or a a a as to and invisible or implicit and the environment interaction is essentially Victor's computing with AI so smart and they burn it Osmel city and the visible and other interaction is human robot interaction and finally a self and invisible because the technologies part of you is human augmentation or human area integration so possible research topics of human augmentation and human integration like will be enabling technologies applications and integration design not not interaction design interations how you can integrate technology with you and also this dish turgut SDKs abs or apps for augmentation and networking and human augmentation experimenters so if you networked with the other human with neural network it's a very big application or incest topic and also Asics a social impact is a very important and this is the very famous book by a surcharge drug or profiles of the future and forward this is a few of famous for crux thought that any sufficiently advanced technology I indistinct is distinct from magic is in this book but I also like this phrase the old idea that man invented tools is a misleading hackers it would be more accurate to say that tools invented man ok so you if you invent technology that change human or the invent human so what kind of humans will you invent is a very fundamental research question of human-computer interaction so I it error Homo sapiens to the homo cybernetic us is a very relatable human competitors thank you very much [Applause] I roll for to go WOWY very interesting talk I kind of my question falls into sort of like pieces one is what are you considerations with regards to the consequences of this you know we're we're kind of used to evolving with tools and there's arguments be made that our hands are as systematists as they are because of tool making so we've been evolutionarily shaped by tools this points in an even more radical direction and there may be very very detrimental consequences you know the it's one thing for tools to shape us but we also know that tools are never neutral they're they're both positive and negative effects of - of tools if we look at something like social media we're already seeing quite a few negative effects that just weren't anticipated when we designed them so I think it's something like this we have to really think about what's gonna happen that could be detrimental so my second part is Elon Musk's argument for this is that a AI is just gonna overtake us so we have no choice we need that second cortex and he sees it as a means of connecting your brain into a faster machine that whole thing faster than you and therefore only people that have this cortex will be able to function in the future society so could you comment on some of the downsides of this so first of all I not only talk about invasive technologies so they we not not not simply talk about implanting or connecting so they I think the human can be extended by the AI not just replaced by a eyes so they and also they what kind of extension is very important at that of course I agree with you that the already the iPhone or smartphone already degrees maybe degree you are ability because you you cannot read map without the GPS or you cannot remember the phone numbers machines so the natural ability can be reduced by integrating technology but the still I think is very important because like like like example running shoes running shoes is not designed for people to run barefoot so the combination or integration learning shoes and human can create better performance and then this learning activity itself can create your health make your health so integration design very important because if you have a but integration design you can make create but humans so so it is still an open question but I think I still believe that the augmentation is very important thank you hi ok I think my question was somewhat similar but let me rephrase it so originally I wanted to ask what you know technology can add a lot like like the prosthetics show but what do we lose if we really push these boundaries and then a question is maybe how can we how can we design an ecosystem were you know these changes happen in a in a kind of like safe way or a controlled way or you know whatever it is because like these days you know when you terms of services for example is something that we kind of would get really deep into something's way we cannot escape anymore in a sense that if I need to meet if I need to use that service because it's like just you know it's integrated with all the other people that are collaborate I cannot deny that the terms of services so you know this is just like a low-level example of if we integrate more and more and more how can we do that in a way that you know doesn't force someone to have this integration when they might want that so the one principle of the so this natural extension is called agents agency so who you are very familiar with it may be a musical instrument it's called pop art on your body so this is you can keep agency of the u.s. self under your art form so the S&T even though they are sure integration its intestine can be integrated you can still feel the agency this is safe but if you added technology you that you cannot control properly you are not happy with it so I still I don't have a clear answer but this is one long wait to effect thank you for your talk engine kata Stanford and unremarkable project use the arthur c clarke quote and i think that really makes the point that from the beginning man was shaped by his tools there's a really fascinating example of how fire and cooking actually what is what allowed us to have such big brains because the energy that normally your stomach would take up you could have a smaller GI tract and you have a bigger brain so my question is if this is a trend that's happened from the beginning of time what's different about this now is it the same trend just faster or does it have to be a different way we think about this and interact with this or is this just the progression of what's just happened from the beginning of time i think it's already happening so even the smartphone is augment I think in augmenting tool and also this is the diminishing you may be diminishing your ability so it's both sides it's augmenting and also diminishing so they it's already happening so maybe I could reframe that the way you highlight this do you think we should be thinking about this in a different way or there should be different action or are you just saying hey it's gonna happen in a faster way the only difference now is the speed or is it different in any other way than how tools have affected us in the past also the the type of augmentation can be chained different so the if the neural network can process more complicated situations and also more unnatural natural seamlessly integrative our ability so this is I think the change of a type of augmentation not just be a pledge made from the University of Munich so I wanted to come to the question opt-in opt-out and very often when we see those things this seems to be something we can do or we can choose to do but I think given that sort of if the things work people who have it will have a major advantage other people who don't have it and nothing if you don't see well you will not go without glasses or you will not let your child to go to school without glasses if you know they can have with glass so for me two questions another thing for the community is by publishing this stuff by putting it out open source a lot of the things are we sort of even speeding this up because we give control to everybody and once one person starts the others could not really just sit back everybody else has to push forward so if you do it if you have it I have to do it as well and there is no option for opting out or do you think we can design opting out into this the you know open source of maybe abilities so my concern or my question is if we make things public with publications with open source we increase the number of people who can do it and generally we think this is a good thing but if there are things where some people get real advantages of having us and if these are more people not just one or two the others may be not able to say I don't want to join in maybe this is the gap between the food that can have this technology who it doesn't have or and I think this gap will be not there if we give the technologies but at the same time we don't give the choice because there is no control over the technology there is no entity that controls the technology or at the moment we don't think of it we just think Oh open-source would be a positive way so everybody can do it but then everybody can do it so basically so if the if we can get the augmentation so the this I think D give you a more opportunity more options that can do many things so maybe it can reduce the learning time of the foreign languages so you can learn different language so basically this kind technology will create more options to the people hey uh this is being redone from u-dub I'm really fascinated by the tough theme like combine AI always a human but I always have this concern that once those those technique come out there will always be a particular human growth to try it out and that will so this question is more about social and more about ethics so every time a new technique come out there will be only a group of people who have the access to it and it's not always the rest of among people so when this technique comes out the other part of the human and people might oh my own still remain in the you know like the dough level part so that might increase the difference between different level of the society so do you think there's a solution to it or like maybe not a solution like Chris um yeah so they I hope that this technology can support everybody especially for people with some kind of disabilities so augmentation quite important technology for they support some kind of this these are disabilities and also the but there's might be a economical program so maybe rich people can get more augmentation so so this is beyond the technical program but I personally like my other researcher I want to support with this technology for for everyone should enjoy cool for you look Hector impactful paradigm shift that took place it's almost always the case that you can find precursors to the thoughts and sometimes many versions of the same idea that happened for a long time but but when they do happen often they had very specific enablers so for this vision of human intellect augmentation as you say to some degree it already happened we already medicate travel very differently from what we used to do without technology orientation it was it's not possible but for your current thinking what are the key enabling technologies or infrastructure that you think now would enable or change rapidly of the pace of augmentation pay so one so one difference is the when you learn something new so with this kind all men taken properly you will require a shorter time to learn because this this part can support by augmentation so maybe maybe this one difference [Applause]
