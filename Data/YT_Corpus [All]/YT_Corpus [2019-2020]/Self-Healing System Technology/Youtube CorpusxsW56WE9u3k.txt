 I've got a battery-powered vacuum a battery charger that's not convenient extra space and a whole bunch of other stuff in my shop that needs to be organized so we're gonna organize these clear totes and make a home for this vacuum cleaner my name is Eric Strebel I'm an industrial designer welcome to my channel about product design and making I hope that you like enjoy and become a subscriber did you know that this episode sponsor PCB way offers printed circuit boards with 24 hour Express service and DHL shipping 24 hour production and tech support low minimums and very competitive prices click the link in the description to get your next project started bigger small DC be waking up I'm gonna start by taking some basic measurements of the area and the components that I want to put in this space and kind of lay them out visually then I'm gonna start like I do many other projects by doing a sketch and this is gonna ultimately become my blueprint and my guide for building this storage system this unit is going to be wall mounted so that it is up off the floor in case there's ever a flood and that will hopefully protect my stuff I'm gonna make it out of 3/4 inch MDF and we are going to use a French cleat to hang it on the wall with MDF is cheap and readily available I will purchase a sheet at the local big-box retailer have them make some basic cuts and then load that into my vehicle and back to the shop and finish making the final cuts on the table saw I had the big-box retailer rip the 3/4 inch sheet of MDF to a 38 and 3/4 this is kind of the magic number and you can see that on the plans and so now I'm just cutting the pieces to the right size those are the pieces for the back this is the top part and this is the cleat of one of the cleats I think this is the part that's on the back of the cabinet at the top and later on you'll see me cut the actual cleat that goes on the wall to hang the cabinet this always freaks me out cutting at a 45 degree against the wood against the fence and it's just weird that the blade is not straight up and down it kind of angled towards you it just freaks me out now I'll do some cross cuts these are actually an inside side pieces that will support the plastic containers these pieces are 30 inches tall and so you can see I'm cutting off this excess material that was 38 and 3/4 inches to get it to be the right size and I make three of those cuts this is the other cleat right here and I didn't quite cut it deep enough so I'll make one more pass and this is all the little support pieces that will hold the containers and allow them to slide in and out of the unit then there are two the right size of course already I'm just cutting them down to be the supports all right we've got all the parts cut to make the unit the next thing we're going to do is we're going to put in the little support brackets right here for all the containers and I use these 18 quarts Sterilite containers you can buy them at the Home Depot to have a clear lid they're clear all the way through and I use them for my gear so I can see what's inside of my containers they're about seven dollars a piece and we're going to put eight of them right here I mean why make a shelving unit for four if you can double the capacity for nearly the same amount of money might as well good extra storage is always good these are the three sidewall pieces that support the storage containers and so I am laying out one master and then I will trace off those distances onto the other pieces right so we're gonna have a piece on the right a piece on the left and we're gonna have a Center one that has supports on both sides of it and I use a framing square to measure a cross off of the lines that I transfer from the master and I do that for all the pieces it just has to be relatively close and that way I can only measure once and just transfer everything and make things go faster I'm going to glue and air nail everything together to make things go a little bit faster and the glue will just help with the parts for the time I've also pre rounded over the top edges on these things so that the containers can slide in and out just a little bit easier there's the finished supports that are gonna support without containers my shop is not set up for wood right my desk where I do all of my work and assembly and detailing is much higher and so it doesn't lend itself well to putting things together like this so I have to do it on the floor it's a little bit awkward and I don't really have a lot of space for building stuff like this so it's kind of tucked into the corner and I'm sort of working in place it's also where my tools are so thus kind of the awkward views and the small space but you get the idea I manage everything is air nailed and glued together first we did the side pieces and the top and the bottom now we're working on the French cleat that's gonna hang on the wall and this thing is gonna be supported by this cleat that I'm putting on and I'm gonna use some tapcon screws to mount it to the wall link in the description always good for shop cleanliness I love vacuuming or during a job just to keep the area clean it's just really good work habit and I can't recommend it enough it's not always the most natural thing to do but it certainly helps you want to track it organized this is just about a full sheet of three-quarter inch MDF it's a little bit much for me and it's a little awkward so I'm gonna need a little bit help since I am smarter than the average bear I use multiples Apple boxes to get enough Heights and then I can just drop it right on to the French cleat and make my life a little bit easier it's gonna fall right into place we'll just pull this Apple box out and we are gonna be good to go in place three two one it's time to load up the containers I will put some of the existing containers that I have that have stuff in them already and then some empty ones that I want to have for stuff that I need in this area like for paint supplies and things like that I believe link to the Amazon store below for many of the supplies and tools that I use the Amazon store does not have clear lids for these containers only at the orange big-box retailer do they have this and when you purchase from Amazon you help my channel let's put the vacuum cleaner up there along with the battery charger and I think I'm gonna store my cordless drill up there as well super happy finally a place where all my batteries can be charged and my gear can live and I can easily access it for when I need it while I'm working in the shop so we got this thing built and it turned out really nice super easy to access all of these drawers part of this process is labeling these containers so that you know what's inside of them I don't use them every day but labeling them allows me to quickly see what I have in there and also if I have somebody helping me in the shop or I need to direct somebody to get some supplies I can say oh check the containers and they'll be easily labeled and marked for people to sort of see what's inside of them not just me not just for me I have one of these label makers this is a brother label maker right here and they're pretty simple the battery-powered you can plug them in as well they make these little labels like this so for example this one's going to go right on here this is the paint gun and then I'll mark other things that I have in here as well and like this one this container right here are my sanding supplies and I've lots of sanding blocks in there so let's just print that one out sanding blocks so this will go right here and will tell me what's inside of here I'll probably make some other ones as well but this is how they work it's pretty pretty nice pretty easy and then I can immediately see where this container is from afar and know what's in there super useful for the shop and a great way to stay organized and know where all your supplies are so you can work quickly and efficiently make sure you give the video a thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe if you haven't already done so hey and don't forget to follow me on social
