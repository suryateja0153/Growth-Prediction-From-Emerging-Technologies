 HYFIX Application Procedure HYFIX chemical waterprooofing products are designed to be applied in various formats such as dry-sprinkling under the foundation Slurry and brush application on concrete surfaces and as an admixture for concrete Different functional properties are achieved through HYFIX nano-mineral technology and its specifically enhanced chemical waterproofing formula. Piles are used to enhance the load bearing capacity and integrity of the structure As the brush application on the piles’ concrete surface is not possible Concrete is cast with HYFIX ADMIX in order to protect the piles against water ingress and corrosion HYFIX is applied in slurry consistency onto the pile caps in order to protect the foundation and the rebars against water ingress A drainage system should be employed as a common construction practice 3 by 2 meter grids are marked on the foundation area after the reinforcing bar and formworks are completed. On each of these grids a HYFIX bag is placed Just before the foundation concrete is cast, HYFIX is dry-sprinkled over the rebars Highly concentrated HYFIX active chemicals diffuse into the capillaries, forming insoluble nano minerals in the capillary tracts HYFIX waterproofing system can be applied under any weather condition that is suitable for concrete works Along the retaining wall, for every 30 cm rise of concrete in the foundation slab, HYFIX is dry-sprinkled onto 50 cm wide strips HYFIX is applied as a slurry onto the cold joints at a rate of 3 kg per square meter before the formwork is closed HYFIX nano minerals enhances bonding while sealing the cold joints with its Nano mineral structure Materials such as plastic rod casings Remaining rods or loose sections of the concrete are weak points and hamper the continuity of the HYFIX waterproofing system therefore should be repaired Plastic rod casings are removed with the help of a mechanical drill If there are iron bars protruding from the concrete wall surface The surrounding area is routed out around 5 cm with a hammer drill and cut from as deep as possible All cavities and gaps are cleaned with water and filled with HYFIX EXPAN, a non-shrink grout formulized with HYFIX active chemicals As a preparation for the HYFIX coating system All construction joints, and honeycombed areas should be routed out and reglets must be filled with HYFIX EXPAN Prior to brush application, all surfaces are saturated with water HYFIX is then brush applied onto those surfaces in 2 layers at a rate of 2 kg per square meter First layer is in red color while the second is in grey in order to provide ease of control at field conditions If the first layer dries before the second layer is applied, pre-wet the surface again before the application HYFIX Chemical Waterproofing System is activated with the presence of water; thus water curing is an important part of the waterproofing system Water becomes the catalyst that initiates and enhances the formation of the capillary sealing Nano-Minerals As an admixture, HYFIX ADMIX is used depending on the amount of cement present in the concrete mix. In order to achieve a homogenous mixture HYFIX ADMIX is first mixed with water and then added into the drum of the ready-mix truck In the drum rotate the batch for another 5 minutes to ensure thorough distribution of the active chemicals HYFIX is an inorganic and will not be subject to organic deterioration Therefore HYFIX does not require a protection layer before backfilling HYFIX is a reactive waterproofing system that penetrates deep into the concrete body to actively seal capillaries and hairline cracks for the life of concrete If new cracks appear throughout the life of the concrete; self-healing Dormant HYFIX chemicals will react to produce nano minerals and protect the concrete matrix against corrosion, ASR, Sulphate and chloride attacks Your structure is now safely waterproofed with environmentally friendly HYFIX chemical waterproofing system
