 a multi-agent system mass or self-organized system is a computerized system composed of multiple interacting intelligent agents multi-agent systems can solve problems that are difficult or impossible for an individual agent or a monolithic system to solve intelligence may include methodical procedural approaches algorithmic search or reinforcement learning despite considerable overlap a multi agent system is not always the same as an agent based model ABM the goal of an ABM is to search for explanatory insight into the collective behavior of agents which don't necessarily need to be intelligent obeying simple rules typically in natural systems rather than in solving specific practical or engineering problems the terminology of ABM tends to be used more often in the science and mass in engineering and technology applications where multi-agent systems research may deliver an appropriate approach include online trading Disaster Response and social structure modeling topic concept multi-agent systems consist of agents in their environment typically multi-agent systems research refers to software agents however the agents in a multi agent system could equally well be robots humans or human teams a multi agent system may contain combined human agent teams agents can be divided in two types spanning simple to complex categories include passive agents or agent without goals such as obstacle Apple or key in any simple simulation active agents with simple goals like birds in flocking or wolf sheep in prey-predator model cognitive agents complex calculations agent environment can be divided into virtual discrete continuous agent environments can also be organized according to properties such as accessibility whether it is possible to gather complete information about the environment determinism whether an action causes a definite effect dynamics how many entities influence the environment in the moment discreteness whether the number of possible actions in the environment is finite Episode II City weather agent actions in certain time periods influence other periods and dimensionality where the spatial characteristics are important factors of the environment and the agent considers space in its decision-making agent actions are typically mediated via an appropriate middleware this middleware off is a first-class design abstraction for multi-agent systems providing means to govern resource access and agent coordination topic characteristics the agents in a multi agent system have several important characteristics autonomy agents at least partially independent self-aware autonomous local views no agent has a full global view or the system is too complex for an agent to exploit such knowledge decentralization no agent is designated as controlling or the system is effectively reduced to a monolithic system topic self-organization and self-direction multi-agent systems can manifest self organization as well as self direction and other control paradigms and related complex behaviors even when the individual strategies of all their agents are simple when agents can share knowledge using any agreed language within the constraints of the systems communication protocol the approach may lead to a common improvement example languages our knowledge query manipulation language KQ ml or agent communication language ACL topic system paradigms many mas are implemented in computer simulations stepping the system through discrete time steps the mask components communicate typically using a weighted request matrix eg speed very underscore important min equals 45 miles per hour path length medium underscore importance max equals 60 expected e max equals 40 max wait unimportant contract priority regular and the weighted response matrix eg speed min 50 but only if weather sunny path length 25 for sunny 46 for rainy contract priority regular note ambulance will override this priority and you'll have to wait a challenge response contract scheme is common in mass systems where first er who can question is distributed only the relevant components respond I can at this price finally a contract is set up usually in several short communication steps between sides also considering other components evolving contracts and the restriction sets of the component algorithms another paradigm commonly used with mass is the pheromone where components leave information for other nearby components these pheromones may evaporate concentrate with time that is their values may decrease or increase topic properties marce tend to find the best solution for the problems without intervention there is high similarity here to physical phenomena such as energy minimizing where physical objects tend to reach the lowest energy possible within the physically constrained world for example many of the cars entering a metropolis in the morning will be available for leaving that same metropolis in the evening the systems also tend to prevent propagation of faults self recover and be fault tolerant mainly due to the redundancy of components topic research the study of multi-agent systems is concerned with the development and analysis of sophisticated AI problem-solving and control architectures for both single agent and multiple agent systems research topics include agent oriented software engineering beliefs desires and intentions BDI cooperation and coordination distributed constraint optimization DCO peace organization munication negotiation distributed problem-solving multi-agent learning agent mining scientific communities eg on biological flocking language evolution and economics dependability and fault tolerance robotics multi robot systems missus robotic clusters topic frameworks frameworks have emerged that implement common standards such as the FIP a and OMG ma SIF standards these frameworks eg Jade saved time and aid in the standardization of mass development currently though no standard is actively maintained from fi PA or OMG efforts for further development of software agents in industrial context - carried out in I Tripoli IES Technical Committee on industrial agents topic applications Marrs have not only been applied in academic research but also in industry mass are applied in the real world to graphical applications such as computer games agent systems have been used in films they are used for coordinated defense systems other applications include transportation logistics graphics manufacturing smart grids and GIS it is widely advocated for use in networking and mobile technologies to achieve automatic and dynamic load-balancing high scalability and self-healing networks equals equals see also
