 all new at 5:30 we've got some great weather here in the Carolinas here at the moment but don't forget everybody we are in the middle of hurricane season and the people behind the power grid are already preparing for widespread power outages cross our fingers we won't get that but maybe we will thanks for staying with us everybody I'm bill McGinty and I'm Sarah French Duke Energy officials know high winds will bring down power lines in the coming month but as NBC Charlotte Stuart Pittman shows us this time a new technology will help them turn the lights back on welcome to Duke Energy's distribution Control Center these are like the air traffic controllers of the power grid responsible for more than 2 million customers these technicians manage energy sources and dispatch repair crews whenever an outage occurs that outage is routed here to this facility when that happens the people here respond quickly so too does a new self-healing technology that spots outages automatically and reroute power this technology can actually reduce the number of customers impacted by an outage by as much as 75% and can actually restore power in less than a minute Duke Energy's new technology first came into play last summer during Hurricane Florence more than 80 thousand extended customer outages were avoided using self-healing technologies since then Duke Energy has used a nimble new system to shift resources during this summer's heat wave they say 80 percent of their customers will be serviced by this technology in the next few years with a click of a mouse we can restore power that used to take one to two hours before to restore and we're going to see that technology continue to improve over the next few years in Charlotte steward Pittman NBC Charlotte so as we just heard they can turn the lights back on with a click of the mouse but Duke is quick to point out nothing will replace a good old fashioned line crew
