 I hope that you're enjoying this series about the Tesla Gator infantry fighting vehicle in the last video we took a look at building the frame and the wheels in in this video we're gonna finish building the wire sketch model of this modular Tesla electric hybrid military vehicle my name is Eric Strebel I'm an industrial designer welcome to my channel about product design and making I hope that you like enjoy and become a subscriber did you know that my sponsor PCB way also does prototype board assembly for small volume production this makes PCB way the one-stop destination for board fabrication and assembly head over to PCB way website and click PCB assembly to find out more just follow the link in the description below alright let's get to it before we do that though I'd like to ask that if you are gonna leave a thumbs down in this video you please leave a comment as to why you did so this is gonna help me make better videos in the future and understand why you gave it a thumbs down so I can make better content for you guys thanks alright the first thing we're going to do is we're gonna start out with the things that we know so we want to put in the turret ring and the ingress and egress points of the vehicle these are the things that are set first and we're going to add humans as well and then we're gonna build and design the vehicle around that part of my design philosophy particularly for designing a highly functional vehicle like this I feel like designing around the occupants and the use of this vehicle is paramount and should not be overlooked so designing around the people and we're gonna add them next is what we're gonna do so this is the back hatch entry so if you had troops in the back and use this as a troops transport that's where they would enter and egress I'm gonna add some humans in here the three persons that are going to control this vehicle so the tank commander the driver and the gunner all the other functions are automated and I print out a quick 95th percentile human to the right size and it bend up a very simple copper person and I'm gonna solder on to them and then we're gonna mount them into the vehicle in the places that they would actually live or sit while they were operating this vehicle and that way we don't run any lines or wires through their heads we give them a space to live and function in that's realistic one of the advantages of designing in 3d with wire like this is that you can't cheat whereas you could do that with a sketch and you could just easily draw the line right through the guy's head and nobody would know not so possible here with a wire model like this all right we're gonna start soldering in the body with copper wire if you haven't seen the wire modeling basics video you can see that link up here on the right that will give you some tips about how to make and solder your own wire model I'm using some brass and or wire here to put everything together and it's all based on this sketch that you see right here link to that video in the top right as well that is to my left in real life as I'm building this and you can see my isometric views on the table that's the top view and there's also a side view and I use those as reference to help me build in this body for the vehicle and I'm making changes this is a sketch and I don't differentiate a lot between or at all between sketching in 3d and sketching in 2d for me they are both sketches as a way to improve a design and prove out a design and test things out and I'm always refining things as I'm moving from one process into the next and this is no exception as I'm going along here all this video that you see is recorded in time-lapse I want to give a quick shout out to Panasonic so they've recently hooked me up with gh 5 60 frames a second this camera is pretty sweet so I want to say a big thank you to the McAllen Texas Panasonic factory repair team that I sent my GH 5 in for and they send me a refurbished unit friggin awesome thank you so much I'm always trying to refine the sketch that I did originally for this I have something in mind where I want to keep these rather large flat panels in place I don't want things to get too busy or too detailed and if I don't like something I just cut it out and Irie solder up a new wire piece in its place and that's kind of the nice thing about working like this in 3d is you don't like it you just cut it out or solder it off and bend it up to the way that you like and make the changes as you go along it's very much an organic process and it does take a little bit of time but it really helps you visualize whatever your design is I find it just an amazing tool for vehicles particularly or larger objects where you need to design the inside and the outside of your device at the same time it allows you to visualize that and if you're working on a team they can see that as well and suggest and make changes and you can literally measure off of a model like this to help the rest of your team understand the space that they have and I think the space on the inside of this vehicle is quite important as there are occupants that have to get in there and if you've ever gone into any sort of a military vehicle you know it's quite cramped and I want to make as much space inside there as possible should something like this ever come to fruition wink wink I'm definitely available and you know love to make something like this full-scale if at all possible I think a foam core full-scale model would be a great first step to visualizing something like this it would be cheap and quick and pretty easy to pull off probably could pull that off in a couple months I would think to build something full-sized that you could get into and would really be a good visualization and testing tool for designing a vehicle like this now I'm only gonna build one side and the front of this vehicle and that part of that has to do for with photographic purposes because it's super difficult to photograph an object like this because the wires on the backside will interfere and it's sort of like drawing transparent vehicle and it becomes very confusing so I purposely I'm only building basically one side and the front of the vehicle now this is the point where I'm I'm starting to make it look a little more Gator like I'm adding elements into the front of the vehicle including the eyes and some of the you know reptilian look of a classic alligator and I want to I want to instill that in the vehicle and make sure that that comes across and so I add that in here and I solder up something and ultimately I don't like it so I actually unsolder it and I am move it back in the vehicle it's really nice to the place that I want it to be to give it the character and the look and the feel of the vehicle that I want and so I can achieve that and that sort of dinosaur you know reptile Gator feel and in case you're curious about why this is sort of designed like a gator I love The Swamp People television show and I love all those characters on that show and of course I love the alligators they're so sneaky and so smart and so strong and I think that's just such a great quality to instill in a military vehicle and then pattern it after that and so that's that's really where my inspiration comes from from those those those are amazing alligator hunters that hunt these creatures down in the south of the United States we had never seen that show you gotta check it out so we'll build a little bit of the other side of the vehicle on here so I can have the sort of the two alligator eyes in the front part of this vehicle and then that's all we're gonna build on this side of the vehicle we're gonna add the front here sort of the snout or the mouth and we're gonna have some good approach access here on the vehicle with a nice rake in the front after all this is an infantry fighting vehicle so we need to add the turret the vehicle would function wonderfully as a troop carrier but we're gonna add a couple of weapons on to the top and to do that in this main turret we're gonna add something in the hundred millimeter range that's gonna give it some good punch to help out the troops so to do that I'm gonna lay out a circle based on the isometric view top view and that's gonna be used as a template so I can lay out the basic wire shape of this main turret here uses some weights to hold things down line up all my copper wire get that soldered on to the main turret so that I can rotate it into whatever direction that I want and I build the two separate it's just a little bit easier for you as the viewer to watch what I'm building because the wires they just get to be a little bit too much information so building them separate is the way to go it's also a delicate unit and we want to make it a little bit safer this way I'm trying to replicate some of the scales and the toughness of the tail of the Gator here in the turret by adding some of these little triangle features into the turret it's a little bit tough for you to see but that's what I'm going for here to capture some more of that Gator kind of feel in the turret section you'll also notice that as I'm working I'll remove the temporary supports as the main outer form starts to come together here let me change the camera view a little bit so you can see a little bit better and you can see some of those supports there and so as I start to build up the structure and it becomes a little bit stronger I remove those one by one and again here with the turret I'm not building the thing the 360 I'm really just building one side and this is mainly for photographic purposes again move that camera so you can see a little bit better it's a sketch I don't need to build both sides when we built the foam core model in the next video and we'll build the thing 360 but this is just a representational sketch to help me work out things again it's a sketch so main gun will zoom in here a little bit so you can see some of the fine tail of the copper work of the Rings for this 100 millimeter weapon that would stick off the front of this turret so we've got that now we're gonna have an automated probably 50 millimeter automated machine gun on the top and this is something that would be controlled from inside the vehicle remotely probably by the tank commander or possibly the gunner and it would move independent of the main turret give additional armament to the vehicle let's move here and I'm gonna put a piece of material in the background a white piece of material there so you can see a little bit better about what I'm doing I think when you're designing a military vehicle there's a psychological aspect and keeping this sort of Gator theme here building up the armament making it look mean and evil can be a real psychological advantage to your team so to speak in defeating the enemy and so I think that's important to have that here so we'll add the turret on the top and we're basically done at this point so a quick recap of what this vehicle is this is an electric six wheel drive vehicle with some sort of a hybrid supplemental powerplant to charge up the batteries there'd be poly hot swappable batteries as well to make it easy to upgrade and change this vehicle it just messes really well with the alligator theme the whole sneakiness this thing would be lightning fast and very quiet and it's not meant for long range but it would be great as an attack vehicle and troop carrier look for the foam core mock-up of this very soon I've used this wire modelling sketch technique very successfully to design multiple vehicles throughout my career including this vehicle here for four this is an entry-level luxury four-person vehicle I built this model as part of the design process this is a half scale model of that vehicle I've built them full-size I've built dozens of them full-size for auto shows and exhibits throughout the years at auto shows and they've traveled the globe I hope you enjoyed this video thanks for watching make sure you give the video a thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe if you haven't already done so hey and don't forget to follow me on social media I'm on Facebook sometimes Twitter usually and now Instagram will rock on click here to check out some of the other design and making videos
