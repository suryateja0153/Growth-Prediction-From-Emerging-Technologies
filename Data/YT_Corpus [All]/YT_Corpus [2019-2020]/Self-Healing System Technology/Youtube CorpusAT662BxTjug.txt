 [Music] in the previous lectures we have seen the applications of IOT and a iot in different application domains such as food and agriculture healthcare and so on we are going to continue further and we are going to look at different other applications applications of IOT and a iot in the power sector more specifically in the power plants so just as a recap when we talk about IOT basically it's the integration of information technology with the conventional operation technology in the manufacturing or our sector so I Tod convergence is what characterizes a IOT so here also in the power plant we are going to experience the same thing so let us look at some of the advantages of the eruption of IOT solutions in the power sector so basically when we are talking about IOT once again we are talking about smart devices devices which are sensor equipped actuator equipped and so on and these smart devices have connectivity between them internally and also between each of these internal each of these devices in that internal network to the external world so the basically what happens is the data are collected from these IOT enabled devices in the case of our pants from these power sector hi o T enabled devices and these data are sent for further analysis to improve the productivity to improve the efficiency of operations of the workforce that is working in the power plants and so on so essentially what is going to happen is we can also have remote monitoring and remote control this is very very important remote monitoring is fine but remote control of the different machinery of the different equipments that are working in these power plants so essentially what is happening is from these different smart power devices the sensors that are embedded in them are going to collect different types of data data about their health data data about the temperature the operating condition etcetera of these different machinery and these data are going to be sent through that through this connected system the network to the cloud for further processing different machine learning algorithms artificial intelligence algorithms and so on could be used to analyze the data at the remote end at the cloud so let us look at their different advantages of the use of use of peyote in the power sector so if we are talking about the the benefits the benefits or the features of incorporation or integration of IOT and I IOT in the power sector this is what would happen so we are going to get these different benefits we are going to get the advantage of active participation of n consumers possible and this would be possible because essentially in the power sector we are talking about these different machinery machineries like transformer transformer machineries like different motors etcetera right so different motors etcetera and there could be different other power systems machinery which could be basically connected together so these machinery number one is this connectivity between these different machinery can help in the transmission transmission of energy or electricity which is they are traditionally in all power plants all the traditional power plants have the capability of transmission of energy transmission of energy maybe right from the point of generation through different different grids micro grids and so on to the end consumer devices substations station substations and so on to the homes homes and offices of the end consumers so all of these so all these connectivity helps in the transmission of electricity in a traditional or plant so that is there but in addition with a IOT it is also possible to integrate information technology information and communication technology or IOT so this will basically help in two types of communication happening between these power machinery one communication is the transmission of electricity and the second form of communication is basically the transmission of the information that are collected from these different power machinery in the power plants right so two types of communication are going to happen so the the incorporation of IT ICT and IOT can essentially help the end consumers in the homes and offices to actively participate to actively participate in the entire process so they can not they will not be just the passive recipients of the electricity or the power that is generated but they can also be an active participant active participant in the process thereby many things can be achieved so what are those many things so first of all improved improved or customized improved or customized services can be enjoyed by the consumers the consumer scan on-demand on-demand enjoy different loads of energy that is a possibility like this there are different different possibilities it is also possible through the integration of IT ICT and IOT with the traditional power grid grid to have online demand scheduling so online online demand scheduling means like let us say at your home you have different different appliances so through online online demand scheduling it would be possible to have some of these devices operate autonomously in certain parts of the day and in certain other parts of the day other devices may be operated without any human intervention so the demands consequently in different parts of the day are going to change from the individual customers and holistically as well when you take all the customers together the demand on the micro grids and the power grids holistically that is also going to vary over time throughout the day so online demand scheduling would be possible with the integration of IT IOT and ICT with the teddy PowerGrid other possibilities are to have different features of let us say black out prevention it is possible to have self-healing system that that means that if some part of the system goes down there are other parts of the system that can take over without any human intervention so self-healing we could also have in a smart a IOT enabled power system we could also have you know automated fault detection fall prevention is something over here captured through self-healing and also you know different other things such as let us say voltage stabilization in the form of taking care of voltage dips and surges and their prevention could also be done it is also possible to integrate plug-in electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and their connected systems it is also possible to basically have a self optimized system and so on soul self optimized means like you know if something can be improved over time the operations could be improved based on the data that are collected the data that are collected from the sensors that are integrated integrated to these different power machinery so the analysis of that data over a period period of time can help in the optimization of the processes of the machinery their operations and so on so self optimization that is also possible so so many different benefits exist from the integration of peyote with power system so let us now look at further and try to understand the different drivers of iot in the power plant so what are these drivers we have seen that traditional electrical systems power systems and they are integration connectivity not only to transmit electricity but also to transmit information between these different components in a power plant and also externally from these different components to the outside world this is what basically looks like in an IOT enabled power system so there are different so for this connectivity we need low cost powerful chips Wi-Fi enabled chips cameras sensors different different other sensors accelerometers etcetera these could be used these are like you know end devices acting as drivers then standardization in the form of use of IP 3G 4G 5g technologies and so on standardization of software technology use of artificial intelligence cloud computing etcetera and to have overall integrated application supporting different layers at the very top would these AI and email supported applications or maybe standalone other applications as well and thereafter we have the cloud layer at the bottom of the application layer we have we may have a fog layer we may then have at the very bottom the devices layer in the field layer and so on so all of these different layers are possible so let us look at how the architecture is going to look like in a in a smart grid so in a smart grid which is going to result in through the integration of a iot with the traditional power plant this is what is going to happen so we are going to have kind of a layered architecture typically like a three layer kind of architecture thin layered architecture where at the bottom layer we are going to have this sensing so this is going to be our sensing for perception perception layer this will consist of this layer will consist of different sensors RFID is RF IDs cameras audio devices and many more so the data that are collected from these sensor enabled machinery are going to go through different types of gateways different types of gateways some gateways will take care of the enterprise requirement so enterprise gateway enterprise gateway we can have normal access gateways we can have home gateways for home customers and so on so home gateway so we have all different types of communication so this is basically our gateways so through these gateways the data are going to be sent to the network layer the network layer in the network layer we are going to have different different network technologies such as wireless networks mobile networks satellite networks and any other different type of network that you can think of and finally this data from this layer is going to get to the application layer application layer supporting different applications for smart offices smart homes applications for electric vehicles plug-in electric vehicles plug-in hybrid electric vehicles etcetera applications for smart transmission and so on and in between we can have this cloud and fog implementations so fog implementation can be done closer to this sensing so for implementation can happen over here but you know so cloud basically implementation can be done you know just below the application layer so this is how a an IOT enabled electrical power grid is going to look like and this is our smart grid so these are these different drivers that we talked about and then let us talk about the benefits of the digital power plant a digital power plant can help increase the efficiency so we can have smart grids which can help in automated devices they are automation automation of these devices connectivity between them overall increasing the efficiency reducing the involvement of human resources manpower and so on so overall improvement in efficiency is what can be achieved through these digital power plants reduction in cost can happen because we are talking about reduced human resources so automated devices would be you know deployed and you know you can have reduced you know manpower consequently reduced wages and so on to be to be incorporated and also you know reduced fuel reduced maintenance and so on so these are these different reductions that can happen through the incorporation of digital technology with the power plant the other features would be improving the power the performance of different turbines wind turbines you know remote monitoring so all of these improved performance remote control remote monitoring can be possible and also reduced energy demands so this basically will help the users to learn how to use the energy in real time in an efficient manner so these are these different benefits of digital power plants so architectural II you know so these are the different components of a you know of an IOT enabled power plant so we will have all these different components you know age devices you know then hubs and gateways then we have storage maybe in the form of cloud etcetera then analysis of the data analytics maybe at the cloud and then the corresponding actions you know maybe some kind of a feedback control will have to be sent a feedback signal will have to be sent to the machinery to control to control certain components in the in the desired machine so these are these different components of in the architecture of a smart power plant so iut maturity model has gone through all of these different layers in the in the power sector so you know it starts with monitoring the monitoring is very simple because you know if you have the you know connected sensors actuators it's you know just the same cells you know if you have connected sensors then then this monitoring would be possible for the control you need to take help of the sensor of the actuators and for the control basically you need to send a signal a feedback signal back to the machine or a component in the machine so monitoring control these are all possible to the integration of IOT and optimization over time using or analyzing the data that is received autonomy overall can be achieved autonomy in all respects device level system level application level and so on so all levels of autonomy would be possible so this is this IRT maturity model in terms of the communication network because communication network is the core in a smart grid or a smart power plant so the communication network has different different parts so these are some of these different parts this is the the the well known ones are home area network which is basically IOT devices in the home and for these communication technologies like zigbee 6lowpan are often used and these are these different standards and technologies that we have already discussed in detail in an introductory lecture on IOT so this is something that we have already discussed so home area network after home area network we will have this never neighborhood area network in short it is also known as the nan and so this particular network basically talks about the distribution domain in the networking of the distribution domain so the data that are collected from the smart devices are then sent to the gateways in the neighborhood area network so neighborhood Neriah network basically just concerns the distribution the distribution system so basically these smart devices are going to send the data to the Gateway and that is basically the scope of the neighborhood area network field area network also known as fan this basically concerns you know distribution domain networks as well but here it includes the connectivity of the controllers the regulator's the data collectors etcetera and typically white area wireless technologies such as WiMAX 3G 4G etcetera are used and forward Ethernet is also used and then we have this wide area network the traditional wide area network in the conventional network and communication system so these are these different communication networks that one would encounter in a smart power plant so if we are talking about the smart grid there is power flow that has that is traditional that has been there already so power flow so power flow is there so starting from the generation station through the transmission to the distribution and consumption units the power flows like this power system basically setting up of the transformer then stepping in sorry stepping up of the transformer stepping down of the transformer and sending the data sorry sending the energy through the Gateway this is this power system and the third component is basically this information flow through the wide area network neighborhood area network and the home area network so these are these three different components of a smart grid in a smart power system so information flow or and power system together holistically works to offer to deliver a smart grid so for a IOT implementation in the power plants different technologies such as digital twins such as supply chain management smart pumping then smart boilers smart water monitoring and so on so all of these different types of applications are often used concepts of smart metering building automation are also quite popular smart metering particularly I would like to emphasize this smart metering basically is an important element of smart grid where i io T is used to reduce the operational cost as the operations are remotely managed this basically reduces the chances of energy loss and optimum use of energy so reduction in energy loss is basically achieved through the smart metering concept so smart meters the deployment of smart meters basically has already happened throughout our country in India you know so in different parts of the country smart meters are already in use and particularly in other countries also smart meters are quite widely used building automation smart phones smart offices etcetera so basically you want to monitor the condition of the building remotely you know in a smart building there would be sensors that would be fitted to elevators lighting systems other electronic systems etcetera and they are all going to be connected and monitored through the internet scatter based control supervisory control supervisory data acquisition and supervisory control so scatter based power plants are a reality now so you know scanner software are are used are deployed in order to process the data then the users analyze the data to make different decisions and this decision-making can also be automated different rules could be implemented in order to make the reason making autom automated and the system fully autonomous ei mais advanced metering infrastructure it basically comprises the whole infrastructure smart meters communication networks etcetera smart meters help in the collection of energy you know collection the collection of information about the energy supply water supply etc you know depending on what distribution network we are talking about if we are talking about the traditional you know energy distribution the meters in those so then it is the smart energy meter if we are talking about the water sector water distribution network then we are talking about the smart water meter so irrespective of that Mis and particularly the smart meters are for to the implementation of this particular concept so communication network broadband over power line fixed radio frequency you know these are some of these communication medium that are used for the connectivity of this metering infrastructure smart meter data acquisition system which is basically they the MDAs the MDA is basically helps in gathering of the data from the smart meters and the meter data management system which is the MDM s this MDM s basically helps in analyzing the data that are collected from these smart meters so I IOT in the electricity sector in different parts of the electricity sector not only in the power plants but also in the different parts starting from the generation point till the consumption point IOT implementation can help in making the processes the systems overall smart so efficient power grid system would help in collecting the data through the sensors use the data that are collected from the sensors to manage the resources and then optimize self optimize and take automated decisions for overall improvement of the power system and reduction of power usage the data that are collected from the sensors can help in performing different predictions through the implementation of different statistical techniques machine learning techniques different AI techniques and so on in the water sector IOT could also be used to save water using the data that are collected from the smart sensors that are deployed in the water distribution system i io T sensors can trick can track water pressure water quality etcetera so I have already shown you in a previous lecture one of the deployments of a model water distribution system and how a SCADA based monitoring system can help in getting and the idea about the quantity and also theoretically the quality of the water that is flowing through different junctions of that quarter distribution system so basically you know different different different features such as prediction of water leakage and then optimization of water usage all of these things could be done with the deployment of IOT in the water sector as well in the wind energy sector likewise a IOT deployment can help in improving the efficiency these can also help in remotely controlling the the different you know the wind generating turbines these could be controlled remotely over a network from some control station so both monitoring as well as control could be done in an i I owe to deployed wind energy platform so wind energy solar energy as well IOT based solar energy sector sensors would monitor the performance from the control panel the gathered data will be sent to the cloud server to analyze and this IOT would help to understand the problem of device whether it is the hardware related problem or the network related problem so overall these solar breeds could be managed much more efficiently in an optimized fashion so there are different challenges of implementation of a iot in a power plant there are security issues because now we are not just talking about the operational technology that has been existing the transmission of energy the transmission of electricity but now we are also talking about transmission of information transmission of data that is collected so security of the the data privacy of the individuals so these are all different different issues that will have to be considered through the integration of network and communication with the traditional power supply so low-power devices IOT devices resource-constrained energy constrained battery-powered and so on so all these different features and the challenges that we have discussed previously these will also make the implementation of security issues a challenge so there are scalability issues as well as as well so the number of devices that are connected are going to increase over time so this basically will require an increase in the data bandwidth which is itself a challenge so these are some of these broad classifications of challenges with respect to the security privacy and having low power devices their security in turn and the scalability in terms of increasing the number of IOT connected devices determinism of the network is also important we are talking about integration with cloud but throwing the data out to the cloud and getting it back so all of these basically increases the processing delay by about 200 millisecond or even more and this basically reduces the overall you know this basically reduces the overall efficiency in the decision making process and taking different control actions consequently poor designing with respect to you know implementation of non-standard protocols non-standard authentication mechanisms non-standard security mechanisms etcetera so these are some of these different other existing challenges of IOT implementation in the power plants so we come to the end of this particular lecture we have seen highlights of the benefits and features of implementation of a IOT and IOT in the power sector we have seen that there are many many different types of benefits but the challenges are also huge we have also looked at the overall architecture for the implementation or the deployment of IOT in the power plants and holistically the power sector you know which basically takes care of different different machinery and the supply chain overall from the generating point of the power to the consumption point so taking care of the automation of the whole chain is what is of concern in the IOT deployment in in the in the power sector so these are these different references thank you
