 if you if you take a person and you have them uh close their eyes and mentally rehearse doing bicep curls uh in their mind and they come for one hour a day into a clinic you add the emotional component of stronger harder more intense and they practice that close with their eyes closed never lifting away at the end of two weeks their muscle strength increases by 13.5 percent so that means then when we're truly present and we add an emotional component if you can do it in the present moment and stay present and repeat it over and over again when the brain is in the present moment it will not know the difference between the real life event of contracting your muscles and doing it in your mind and your brain will begin to look like you've been doing it all along and you begin to activate new circuits in your brain and if you repeat it you fire and wire it more circuits begins to create a neurological network a new level of mind so research shows then that people who never played the piano before you can divide them into two categories and you can do a brain scan on one group of people and then set them in front of a piano and teach them one-handed scales and chords and they come for two hours a day and they practice those scales and chords for five days at the end of five days they rescan their brain and lo and behold they grow new circuits on the opposite side of the brain no magic there you learn something new learning is making new synaptic connections you get some instruction you got to get your body involved you get your body involved you're going to have a new experience experience enriches the brain pay attention to what you're doing you've got to pay attention and stay present and repeat it over and over again firing and wiring you're going to assemble new neural architecture you can take another group of people have them close their eyes and mentally rehearse playing those scales and chords for two hours a day for five days scan their brain before and scan their brain after at the end of five days they grow the same amount of circuits in their brain as the people who are physically doing it now what that means is if you take those people and you set them in front of the piano without ever lifting a finger they can play those scales and chords why because they prime their brain for a future behavior so if you truly wanted to change some aspect of yourself then you would have to ask yourself who do i want to be when i open my eyes now the act of answering that question is going to turn on your frontal lobe and the frontal lobe has connections to all other parts of the brain and it's interested in answering that question because it is the creative center so as it begins to scan the landscape of the brain it can only gather information from things you've intellectually learned or things you've experienced in your life and it begins to associate those different memories with the question and when you get enough networks of neurons firing in your brain you see an image or a picture that's intention and then as you begin to live and rehearse who you're going to be you begin to do that exact same thing you begin to install neurological hardware in your brain repeat it it becomes a software program and you begin to behave that way now the brain is primed it's no longer a record of the past it's a map to the future now the person can feel the emotions of their future you're going to see a person move into a different state of being and they are going to have all kinds of biological changes and that begins to change their biology every single day some people do it faster some people do it slower but your muscle will get stronger that's for certain you will make more connections between your brain and that muscle that's for certain and then if you did specific physical exercises while you practiced the mental rehearsal the physical demonstration of contracting those muscles begins to make more connections uh because of the experience so now you're you're hitting it from both ends let me just say that the majority of the thoughts that we think every single day are the same thoughts as we thought yesterday and in fact 90 of them are and the same thoughts leading to the same choices the same choices leading to the same behaviors same behaviors creating the same experiences and the same experiences producing the same feelings and emotions begins to cause our biology to become very similar very same the repetition of that and firing and wiring then creates automatic programs in the brain and body and 95 percent of who we are is a state of unconscious or subconscious programs where we've done something so many times that the body now can actually do it automatically without the conscious mind so then if you truly wanted a change and you understood that your personality creates your personal reality and your personality is made up of how you think how you act and how you feel the present personality who's listening to this call has created the present personal reality called their life that means if they wanted to create a new personal reality a new life they would have to begin to change their personality and have to change themselves and most people then try to create a new personal reality as the same personality it doesn't work if you're sitting in your meditation and you ask yourself the question who do i want to be when i open my eyes what is the greatest expression of myself and you said okay let me remind myself of how i no longer want to think you know the thoughts like whatever it's too hard i'll never change i'll never get what i want let me become so conscious of those unconscious thoughts that i wouldn't let that thought slip by my awareness today unnoticed by me and program my autonomic nervous system specific outcome then if you said how would i want to speak today how do i want to act how do i want to behave and you reminded yourself how you weren't going to act and how you weren't going to behave and you became conscious of those unconscious habits to such a degree you wouldn't go unconscious and behave in the same way that's when you're no longer the program now your consciousness observing the program if you said when does my energy drop when when what do i feel when i feel those typical familiar emotions what are they so let me name them just so i'm so aware of them that my energy drops i can catch myself in that moment and not return back to the same familiar emotions and cause my body to believe it's back in the past and we can't see a new future from the past so that process then is what i call getting beyond the old self and it's a disentangling from the program the word meditation means to become familiar with so as you sit there and become familiar with those states of mind and body you begin to objectify your subjective self now you are becoming so aware of the unconscious programs you won't go unconscious and that's the first step to change and then what if you said what thoughts do i want to fire and wire in my brain what thoughts do i want to put my attention behind and begin to install the new circuitry the new hardware and if i keep my attention on it and i fire and wire those thoughts it's going to begin to become a software program and that's going to be the new voice in my head that's going to be the voice that's telling me a new program that you can that it is possible and then if you said how am i going to act that in my day with my children today in relationships with everybody what does honor look like what does nobility look like what does respect look like what does reverence look like for life how can i be more compassionate and you began to think about how you were going to behave in that day if you did it properly just like those piano players just like those muscle exercisers you would begin to install more neurological hardware in your brain and if you kept doing it it would become the software program and you as i said would behave that way and then bringing on that elevated emotion then and teaching your body what your future feels like before has happened and understanding that the body's so objective that it doesn't know the difference between the real life experience and the experience you create by emotion that means then if the environment signals the gene and the end product of the experience and the environment is an emotion you could signal the gene ahead of the environment if you feel this emotion if you understand that you would assign meaning to it and you wouldn't get up until you felt it now i would say then if you kept practicing this you would begin to neurochemically condition your mind and body into a new state of being and that would begin to become more familiar to you and you would begin to think differently begin to act differently and you would begin to feel differently and that's a new personality and many people who heal in this work when they get on the stage and they say oh we say well where did it go where did the cancer go where did the parkinson's go and they say hey i i think it belongs in the old personality i'm somebody else and so there's a there's a change in biology and chemistry as a result you
