 hello and welcome guys this is Ibrahim Quraishi here and welcome to my Channel today I am going to give you an introduction on the product Kohi city this basically is a product which is for secondary storage as you all know the primary storage is where we run all our critical applications but quite often we forget that we do run a lot of work load on you know storage which is not machine critical so we can say that it is a secondary storage so let's let's dive into this product before then let's discuss a little bit about me I'm a virtualization SME v CP v and v CP 6 in data center virtualization and csa i have been awarded v experts 29 2010 and recently the expert 2020 this year you can follow me on twitter at Abraham Koshy my blog is agile ops co-taught UK and you can also subscribe to my blog so that you get latest post and don't forget to subscribe to my channel and hit the notification wells now that's a sight let's get to the agenda for today about velocity so we are going to find out a little bit about Co ICT who is the founder and then we'll basically dive into the introduction of what the product is Casa T and when I was going through with my research I found obviously a lot of unique things about this product or what the scalability and everything so we are going to dive into the core of the product which is the span filesystem which they call and how they are different as they offer you the best of both for a world meaning of a CD on Prem or we could call the enterprise platform and the cloud platform then we look into the architecture a little bit and then the co ICT difference which basically how they stand out of the market and they unique USB so let's get started shall we so who sed is basically their mission is to redefine secondary storage which I was go Fonda this was fun in 2013 by mahi Thoren and he is the co-founder of Nutanix who basically redefined the virtualization world with hybrid infrastructure which which was basically developed by Nutanix and mijita was the co-founder and the brains behind it and also Mohit was working the lead on the Google file system as well so he is a visionary and obviously an entrepreneur he has for two companies so far atronics and Cohasset II so let's get into the introduction of the product now so the references for all the links and images which I am using is at the end of these slides and it will be on the description of my video as well this is how easily try to explain the secondary storage so enterprise storage is like an iceberg basically this is what they mean and I totally agree with it because obviously we know we know all our critical applications run or need to learn with low latency and they need to have you know the faster storage possible flash right and that's why basically you are play the hyper-converged solution is bringing closed the store is closer to the compute that is basically running on the same server so when we are talking about secondary storage which comes the second part of the iceberg which is always hidden so if you consider your organization you have a lot of stuff which you are running which is maybe mission-critical but obviously you have other stuff which is the bottom of this iceberg which basically shows fragmented and inefficient data yeah so it's it's necessary like backups are necessary you need to have backups for sure right you might have you know file shares and you need you might need to have data which is a requirement to be archived for you know certain years so you need to have that data stored at somewhere and then you have analytics which you want to run and that doesn't need high-speed analytics data can basically sometimes you run it on the weekend and leave it so you don't need a critical system so a critical storage or you know a fast performing storage you can run it on a secondary storage so that's where basically this that's where this market cap is for Kohei City I guess so they basically are trying to and of course I forgot about that event test because you don't want to well you don't need to you I guess if you have all the money in the world you can run your test underground production kit and give them the best performance but obviously quite often more organization try to run their dev and test one you know second secondary storages or obviously not not the super fast flash because obviously is more relevant for some use cases and some use cases it isn't so what how they are doing this they have developed a file system which is called span file system so which basically allows them to give allows them to the unlimited scalability and strict consistent consistent so what that means is any right which we are doing on this file system or a city platform is is a definite right and you do you do not have any inconsistency that is the data is not corrupt will not be corrupted or if you try to read the data you won't get a error or in question inconsistent data also it is multi protocol so you can use this with NFS SMB and Amazon s3 so you can see easily that this is actually span expanding not just from your private storage sorry private data center it's also expanding to the cloud like Amazon and it's supporting s3 next obviously we can discuss the global video so deduplication is happening on every level of the platform which we saw like it can happen on the you know analytical layer it can happen on the looking at this light here on the backups and also on the clock cloud layer so do you so do doop is fundamentally build into this product so obviously it's happening so span tree so basically another great feature which which I saw about this product is the you allowed limitless snapshots and clones so quite often the as VMware virtualization that means we know that snapshots are okay there are you know lifesavers when you are doing changes and all that but if you are doing multiple snaps then you kind of build a chain and DVM and the host gets you know performance issues or the VM gets low because the chain needs to be kept and obviously sometimes you also have some bad experience taking it gets broken or you need to you know consolidate and all that over here they are not using the chain at all so that's why they are eliminating that threat of performance and all that and that's why they can run unlimited snaps and clones which is really cool self-healing basically the system can be configured and when we configure it you can configure it with how you want to self-heal so you can configure it when you have say for example multiple nodes you can see this is how you want to hear it so it's sort of you know you have how we have you know hacci and urs built-in so how balanced is everything I'm obviously I haven't to use this product heavily so far but obviously it's one of their feature with advertise that this this product is sell feeling and then automated tiring so what that means is other that mean you don't need to worry about where to place your virtual machines if you are or or your data for that because it cannot be virtual machine it could be just backup data or filed a fast rate data or analytical data anything so as the data gets hot it basically gets moved on the high attire which is pretty normal for a storage provider really it's been this since a long time from EMC so I guess they are also having that technique so even I heard that they basically also do the same thing for data which is unused if you can configure it you can configure it that if it is unused for like two days move it to you know slow disk and obviously if it is not more used off with that than you you can pretty much move it to cloud as well and then just leave it on clacey or some chips cloud storage which you can get you know and then multi-cloud so yeah the storage is built from the ground level up and it has support for clouds all the cloud platforms it has support for Amazon TCB and then also a zero so they are they are cloud ready and it's not a product which is a traditional product so usually see traditional products we have it in her environment and then what happens is obviously when we are when your organization is going towards cloud you need to choose a different vendor over here this vendor is basically already ahead of the game they have already filled this from ground level up you can start with one node you can while your node is running you can add multiple nodes without impacting the existing node which is really cool okay so next thing I want to discuss is sequential and random IOT's they have been some videos which have been watching around this and they basically have proved that they can expand up to you know a massive amount and they can have massive sequential and random iOS which doesn't impact the performance I think I the video I was saying was eventually that they have tested it on as do so the more nodes we add the performance increases along with it and they have tested it with sequential and randomized and then obviously in today's day and age when you are working it cloud you need to be well aware of multi-tenant and cause so basically multi-tenant with is achieved in Cohasset ii by quality of service and Q as so they basically have it already figured out so we have it for your disposal if you want to use multi-tenancy really another thing is global indexing and search so basically the product gives you a search bar and you can search for any file ok so let's move on to the next topic best of both platforms so as I was saying that this product is designed for on-prem and also cloud which is really amazing because I've seen most of the organizations have already gone out presence in the cloud but quite a few of them are still you know getting trying to get on it and some of their master photo kit and just thinking about it or they will go in the future so yes it is the right product for any one of you which I just said because if you are an enterprise store and for you as a on-prem solution if you want SMB or you know enterprise-ready story this is it I'm going towards cloud its web scale so that's scalable on the cloud software-defined right and then it's a commodity hardware you don't need to buy specific you know customized hardware for this so this is why this is enterprise recommended and it is software-defined and enterprise ready yeah so that's that's why it is best of both platforms I would say looking into a little bit on the architecture here so we have on the top layer obviously the fundamental file system which is running which is a distributed file system which is web-scale file system which they call it the span FS and then you have the access layer which is as I mentioned NFS SMB s3 and obviously you have data product out there and for security and multi-tenancy we as I was talking about you have cause you can add multiple node of these Kohei city without having any downtime so for that you have this application you can set propagation to all the nodes and then all the data which you are adding you don't need to worry the data will be automatically you know spread across and then obviously underneath you are seeing the data storage is basically can be anything it can be cloud storage it can be your hard drives oh it can be your flash SSD drives as well you know so that's quite awesome so you have a product which can deliver all these for you before finishing off this discuss a little bit on makes them stand out from the market also taking the box for the cloud and also quite often now people are thinking about the third thing which is like you know having a hybrid solution and this this basically provides that hybrid solution as well so speaking about the differences on this slide so global space efficiency which means obviously you're saving you know the data by using did you in not only in the cloud but on Prem as well and then as I talked about multi workload and isolation again instant mass storage at any point highly available so as I was saying because they are not using they're using a different method for you know restoring the VMS so how they do it is basically if if you are backing up your VMs and then you want to restore you can instantly in sort quite a lot of VMs in in a single point really at any point the platform hooks up to your virtual platform as a data store and then obviously it's allows you to it allows you to forward them on in the background it does that they are a storage DRS to move the VMS to your primary storage if it is your production environment so see that's how it basically does is hidden from the end-user it doesn't basically show to the user how it is happening so data resilience and again we touched on this a little bit so it's strict consistency that means there's no loss of data and show data integrity so the data integrity is always there what you write is what you get okay and then multi-protocol and universal access so it has you know integration for cloud and Apps integration so it's already designed for the future and that's about it guys see the other references I will have these references on the description as well don't forget to subscribe and hit the notification bell if you have any questions you can reach out to me on Twitter at Abraham Koshy and stay tuned for the next video for the demo of deploying the Kohei CP oh yes thanks bye
