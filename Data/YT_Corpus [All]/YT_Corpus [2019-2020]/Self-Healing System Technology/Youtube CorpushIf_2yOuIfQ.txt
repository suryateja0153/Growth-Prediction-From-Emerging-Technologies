 Hi I'm Dr. Phil Perconti the director of the U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command's Army Research Laboratory I think we should start by telling folks that the Army has a corporate research laboratory its mission is to do disruptive research for the long term we are mostly responsible for thinking about technology beyond 2035 and so what science what research has to be done to affect disruptive war fighting capability in the long term that's the Army Research Laboratory's primary mission so we have a collection of some very talented folks here about 2,600 people as the corporate research laboratory we have some 55% of our research staff are at the PhD level and we're doing fundamental research I define fundamental researches research that is basic and applied but leads to a disruption and that disruption is a way to think about research that changes ideas or leads to new ideas that changes the way people think about scientific paradigms that changes the way people think about war fighting ultimately because our customers are our Soldiers so how do we take the science and the technology that we work on and use it either to change the way people think about science as I said change scientific paradigms or change the way we think about warfare that's the intent of doing disruptive research so new ideas new innovation new science that ultimately leads to changes in the way we fight and we protect our Soldiers and ultimately win our nation's wars that's ARL's fundamental mission secondly where the Army's face to the worldwide academic community we have our Open Campus Initiative and we have our Army Research Office both of which are really the external face to the worldwide academic community and the reason we're so involved with the academic community for the Army's we want to bring the best and brightest in the university systems across the country and internationally to come and work with us and invite them to come and work with us on Army problems to solve our a specific problem it's with encouragement from our staff and collaboration and partnership through our staff on our extramural activities that we have these engagements in we vector folks who perhaps ordinarily wouldn't want to think about Army problems into our space these problems are so complex that it requires a multidisciplinary approach and it requires diversity of thought all of that is driven by our ability to work with the external academic community so that's a very important piece of what we do and lastly as the corporate laboratory we are now responsible for bringing together science and technology and warfighting concepts the development of concepts early on which is very very important when you think about new ways of fighting how do the Army of the future is going to look based on technology what you want to do to be successful is have conversations between Soldiers and scientists at the very beginning so that we can both have an understanding of what the technology can do what the future of that technology will look like and then how is that implemented in a war fighting scenario how will that really change what the Army looks like what is it how will it affect the architecture how will it affect the the kit that soldiers bring into the battle fit those conversations we want to have early and so that's the third piece of our mission is to work with the Army Futures Command Futures in Concept Center to bring S&T and concepts requirements together so that's kind of who we are today this is collaborative environment and to collaborate you have to understand where people are coming from what they what they think is important what their language is oftentimes we use the same words depending upon where you're from those words have different meanings so getting together with people and communicating on as many different levels as possible is the intent here so however we can use this to reach a wide audience this is just one having you for that because that's our intent is to make sure that people understand our mission the problems we're trying to solve and I'm here with Meagan Small this morning Meagan why don't you introduce yourself. Yeah absolutely thank you I'm a research chemist in the biotechnology branch of the Sensors and Electron Devices Directorate. What do you do?  Yeah so I'm a part of the living materials program also part of the transformational synthetic biology ERP ERP so that's that's one of our ARL's essential research programs which is one of our top priority programs we do many things across the laboratory we have a wide swath of technology that we have to do research on for the Army because we're into everything it's very important for us to have a set of programs that are focused in our priorities so synthetic biology is becoming one of those areas where there's more and more interest from an Army science perspective but not so much from an army modernization perspective because it's such an emerging area I think most of the folks on the uniform side don't really understand just yet what the implications are for synthetic biology from a warfighting perspective so tell me a little bit so I'm a EE actually my PhD is an electrical computer engineering -- not that I do research anymore -- but when I first got to SEDD, I looked at those schematics those biological schematics it was nothing but confusion in my mind so it took me a little while to understand some of what synthetic biology is but give me a few minutes on synthetic biology we're taking bacterial cells or fungal cells taking biology and we're transforming it to what we want it to do and that's you know I'm on the modeling and simulation side so I'm trying to understand the and control with ultimate goal of control how biological material is interacting with non-biological material so what gets you excited about that yeah so my background actually before I came to ARL is in drug design so I was all into the medical world and when I came here it's really exciting for me to take this skill set that I learned and that type of design toward designing now biomaterials and learning a lot in terms of how biological molecules interact with material and it's really an emerging area like you said there's a lot to learn a lot whether we don't understand I think and so I really want to be a part of that understanding so what do you think some of the most pressing problems are what are the big open research questions in it synthetic biology. Yeah so how do we control biology if it can be controlled as much as we can control it on the timescales that we want on the length scales that we want and drive that toward you know whatever outcome that we want you know those that's the big we have to answer those questions and you its nascent right? So do you think where are we on a time line? If you were to have you to do some technology forecasting for me when do you think we're gonna see first to develop that understanding and then some of the first big applications for synthetic biology? Yeah so in terms of applications we're already kind of seeing the beginnings of them these self-healing types of systems like the bio concrete where you use water to activate a sleeping bacteria and that bacteria secretes the components you need for concrete so that is an easier application so we're kind of already there but in terms of really self-healing where you have the components out in the field and they're assembling into whatever product you want yeah yeah I'd say 2040 and beyond ok so we're a good 30 years you think probably right until it becomes prolific not only commercially but in military applications that's really interesting to me I think the other question that I often have with this is what what are the surprises like so when you started you said you were in drug discovery right what was the big surprise when you came from the drug world into sort of this defense sector that yes that's a good question I think the methods are that what surprised me was the methods are similar you know you're taking these experiments or models but the outcomes are so different you know military outcomes protecting the soldier making him lethal and those types of things it's very different from the drug design world where you know it's smaller scale I guess you could say especially the niche that I'm in so that surprised me a little bit just the scale of things. I understand that manufacturing and scale up of bio where there that company Ginkgo Bioworks is making great progress. Qhat do you think about that? Is that... do you think we're close there to really scaling up? Where we are in terms of scale up it's so hard because it really depends on the application and the system so the type of bacteria for instance modifying one bacteria versus another bacteria you know it could take you a year to figure out how to engineer a particular type of bacterium and just because biology does what it wants to do and that's why the understanding is so important to control it and that's what we're working on but yeah scaling up that's I think that where we are there and in terms of this scale up the hardest part is just how do you get that first piece the engineering ok so now I'm going to put you in if I had a general officer here with me and I swear to say sir we have a real opportunity with synthetic biology these are some of the capabilities that we think we're going to see from synthetic biology in the future and this is what the Army is going to get from all of this investment that we're going to make it synthetic biology and I've got Meagan here to tell you exactly what that is what would you say? I think the biggest thing is that custom materials basically materials on demand you have these all of these components and you know they could self assemble you trigger it a certain way and it will assemble until whatever that you want that's the making side I'm also very interested in the breaking side you know how do we take biology and break down materials and that's that's important for not leaving a trace where we are for instance or in trying to impact our adversary right so the flipside of that is protection right so I think what would you say about synthetic biology from a protective materials point of view yeah so I think that's very interesting because I think the material biological biologically based materials can be extremely protective but they're not thought of that way these materials when they assemble together they're very strong our bone for instance is strong you know these when you assemble these biological materials and that can be a protective you know it's not just a piece of metal or you know something like that which is very heavy these biological polymers can be protective for the Soldier to wear you'd also put them on vehicles you know and what's cool about it is that's not only a protective part because the way this molecules interact with each other but you can custom those molecules to maybe have a heat signature chemical signature or mask those signatures so you know they're very versatile pieces that's very interesting oftentimes I think some people when they hear synthetic biology or living materials we talk about fungus or we talk about genome in some way shape or form or another people think that these things are actually alive yeah can you talk a little bit about that yeah so you know that's kind of something even I go back and forth or the what is truly alive if a cell is in a spore form kind of a sleeping and activated form some people I've talked to argue that's not living but yeah these in my mind living materials is taking biological material and that doesn't have to be a whole cell it could just be the components of it proteins or DNA or whatever and embedding those on to non-biological material not to me it's a living material so does that does that mean that our soldiers have to worry that they're any any coatings or anything we put on our future platforms will have to be care and fed no yeah like these are not like Chia Pets we're gonna grow on that would be cool but no so yeah it depends on the time time you know all cells need to be fed so if you're going to use living cells and they will but if you only want something for a short time it does its job and then it dies and the great thing about biology it's that you know it's just disintegrates you know you don't don't worry about something out there left that you have to go retrieve okay we talked at the intro about concepts and changing the way the army fights in the future what do you think synthetic biology could be applied to so I have a group of soldiers on the battlefield and they have a mission that's part of what's called multi-domain operations where do we think the biggest benefit from synthetic biology would come from initially just just take a shot what do you think about when you think when you're thinking about these problems and you're writing up your research results often we we talk about it in the context of how we're going to contribute to the academic literature or build on a science but I want to want you to think about this from the perspective of how can we help our soldiers and how can we again change the way they think about warfare so so from everything you've learned today where do we think we could put this where do we think we could put this work to help educate inform our concept developers so that they can start to think about how the future army will look and how the future army will organize and eventually the future army will fight yeah so I guess I think of it in terms of so biology is so versatile you I think of a Soldier now and I think of him or her loaded down with a lot of equipment wearing heavy gear and I think of biology and the soldier of the future that they're not loaded down with all that stuff you know they could wear armor that can it's light you know biological cells are not as heavy as other things and the that armor has multiple functions or whatever pieces of equipment can heal themselves so they don't have to worry about carrying extra components those the living materials or synthetic biology can be used to make you know in in terms of microbial fuel cells so you could have a piece of equipment that is generating power that can power other devices that that soldier will carry so I think of it and making the soldier wearing less encumbered by all of the stuff that he or she has to wear so synthetic biology has the potential for that so we talk about synthetic biology like really coming to fruition in 30 or 40 years but there are some newer term applications that people are working on today can can you describe anything you're doing yeah so we are looking at ways that we can take existing materials that and use synthetic biology to repair those materials so while morph our term is the self-assembly and self-healing of the materials the shorter term we can take biological material and use it to fix cracks in whatever material that it is and we are working with WMRD as well as VTD on those types of applications cracks in the blade and and things like that so or cracks in armor yeah so Vehicle Technology Directorate and the Weapons and Materials Research Directorate are two of ARL's business units so we can't underestimate the notion of using synthetic biology to do self-healing self-assembly materials on demand there's a whole gamut of applications that this new science will open up yeah it's funny I when I do talk to the kids stem stuff you know all kids have cell phones and you know they drop they crack the screen I just cracked mine at the airport and I envisioned where you just set it on the heating pad and it the screen will just repair itself you know that's what we're driving towards so and that's definitely it's doable even before 2040 I think we're just beginning to scratch the surface of what applications can make use of this not only commercially but more importantly for the United States are we want to move away from science fiction to real science science reality many thanks to Dr. Meagan Small for joining us for what is a new podcast ARL, What We Learned Today and the
