 hello everyone my name is Yong Chun I'm a fifth year PhD student working with Chris Harrison at Carnegie Mellon University today I'm really excited to be here to present our work on so Zhu which is self powered radio tags for building skill activity sensing as we all know that Internet of Things and smart environments rely on robust sensing approaches that had detect a wide range of user activities you know from opening and closing of a door to operating machines such as stove microwave light and etc however the most common approach relies on battery-powered tags which requires user maintenance right it might be fine for one or two of such battery power sensors in the environment but imagine a room with dozens of these sensors or a building with hundreds if not thousands of these sensors replacing the batteries at the end of the day simply become very impractical in response people have explored battery-free sensing approaches for example we can have sensors that can be plugged in for power we can also have a battery release transfer technique then transfer power wirelessly for example the waste product or we can use backscattered technologies such as RF IDs however these approaches jewelley cost more than $10 each which collectively add up the cost for building scale sensing instrumentation also they have low sensing versatility for example I can only sense electrical appliances or I can only sense things that move or they have limited sensing range for example RFID or back together technologies they in general do not do well if the distance between the reader and the sensor is beyond 15 meters to overcome these limitations of the previous work we set several design goals at the beginning of these projects right first we want our sensor to be low-cost ideally each sensing unit should cost less than $10 also we want our sensing technique to be a long range which means the signal from each activity source should be able to travel long distance without line of sight and we can be detected remotely we also want our sensor to be battery free which significantly lowered the user maintenance cost and finally we want our sensor to be reached sensing meaning that we can not only sense electrical prices but also things that are passive although things that move around or generate other type of signals such as light thermal or vibration in this product we achieved above 4 design goals with solar tanks which convert the energy from the very activity they want to sense into radio frequency broadcast here is one of one of the examples where so - tag is on a blender which provides vibration energy when the blender is being used the solute hack converts the vibration energy with some helpful piezoelectric material into radio frequency broadcasts such frequency broadcasts then travel through walls and floors and can be detected by a centralized antenna that we emission to be in future integrated into a Google home or laksa beyond vibration we also found that human activity also induce any many other energy types for example thermal light and motion so we did a survey on a wide range of activities and found seven common energy types from motion to water flow so we use off-the-shelf energy harvester to convert this energy into electricity I will just go through this energy harvester very quickly so motion from activities such as opening a pill bottle or pruning in the garden can be converted with coils with magnets some power tools and appliances also generate vibration energy which we harvest using piezo electric materials solar and light is another common source which can be used to infer for example opening of a refrigerator door or room of you can see we harvest these type of energy using solar panel many appliances generate thermal energy for example the stove how to look on fireplace or gas engines to harvest this energy Rios healthier junctions there are also electrical appliances which generate electromagnetic radiation to harvest the energy from those appliances we use coils with ceramic force and finally there are flows from gas and flows from water to harvest this energy we use brushless DC motors in connection with the corresponding fans so we know we can harvest energy but how much exactly in practice so we did a study with 50 different activities we found an average energy power of 2.7 million but as you can see here there is a long tail effect which means for some activities that generate very low power output it requires the tag that were later designed to be able to first store the energy and kill bills up enough to then use this energy and for transmission so that is more efficient once we understand our energy budget we also investigated ok what frequency range or attack should be operating at so we did a data collection from 6 different locations and found the energy of the frequency and noise profile like this eventually we selected the frequency range from 35 mega Hertz to 85 mega Hertz as you can see this allows us to steer clear from the environmental noise and also allow us to comply to FCC regulations and more importantly with these frequency signals very good at penetrating common building materials as is shown here which we also verify with a small benchmark study so with all knowledge we gather from the previous investigation we build our social tag just want to remind you guys we want our source attacked will cost less than $1 right these preliminary limits any use of digital components such as Bluetooth or Wi-Fi so instead we design everything with analog components here are the final designs so our solute hack features a rectification stage which means we can harvest both DC and AC electricity it also has an energy storage and management stage specifically by using this high register where you can monitor the voltage on the energy storage capacitor once it goes beyond certain threshold the thyristors shorts itself this allows the energy store to be dumped all the ones to the second stage to the next stage which is this RF oscillation circuit here I want to mention one part which is the Miller capacitance between the collector and the base of the transistor this basically allows us to do a simple frequency modulation which means we can use the receive the frequency to reconstruct the voltage provided by the energy harvester this allows us to do both detecting you know the presence of the activity but also infer the states and this direction and the rate of the an activity so for people who are not a engineer this is basically a miniaturized radio station which converts the energy from activities to radio frequency broadcast so here are some high-level specs of the total tag as I mentioned we are doing frequency modulation each tag has this bandwidth of half megahertz for continuous broadcasting the solu tag consumes power of 2.0 five million watts and for the minimum energy it requires to generation one frequency broadcast is 0.12 minute draw and which we achieve the goal of having our sensor tag less than $1 for bulk production so once the social tech meets signal we also need a way to collect the signal from the environments so here as you can see there are three components of the sold receiver an omnidirectional wideband antenna a software-defined radio and a laptop for computation so because our signal can penetrate through building structures we can hide this receiver out of the user site in this case in a user's basement since our so that I convert the energy from activities we try to sense right detecting the activity simply become detecting presence of the corresponding RF signal internment so we first randomly assign activities to different frequencies so they don't overlap within each activities bandwidth with each half megahertz we look for the souls with hectic by calculating the math to mean difference and then threshold on that signal for activity detection we use this technique to make our sensing pipeline more robust to environment to noise which is more like a wideband signal and also a compensate for the antenna sensitivity difference across different frequencies we also used exponential moving average and a majority voter to make our pipeline more robust to transient noise here you can see a short video of our social tagging action so let me walk through what is going on here on the bottom right we have the receiver deployed in that basement the rest three things are from cameras deployed outside that building in the garden so now someone starts chopping as you can see each chop can generate enough energy for the broadcast and then garden hosts been used and finally someone turn on the mailbox this was fast I will play the video again so first someone start chopping and karna has been used as you can see the frequency shows up at different frequency and then finally turning the flat so we also evaluated so zoo at three different locations in the course of multiple weeks and I would just go through this result very quickly please refer to the paper for more details so the result was very encouraging with of two Falls but two positive rate higher than 99% and extremely low false positive rate so beyond just detecting the presence of activities I also want to demonstrate some rich sensing opportunities which we achieved for example we can strategically place the magnets on a door I saw that sliding door so that we can detect the direction of the become of being closed being open so this basically allows to tell whether the door is being closed or open rather than simply saying someone moved the door we can also detect user grasp or engagement by incorporating user's body into the RC oscillation circuit here as you can see we attach the cover to where user have to grasp so that when the user's body is in come with our sensor by a shift of frequency a little and but based on that we can detect whether the user is currently engaging with the hot glue gun so we can not only detect whether how cool guns are off but whether it's on but nobody's have been using it so you can then send a alert message to facility people to give a check we can also liberate the frequency modulation to build some simple analog sensors here as we can see is a light intensity sensor and similarly we can also detect the water flow rate for a fine grind water usage sensing also if we have multiple receivers in the environment we can also triangulate the location of an activity we did a study pair as you can see there are four antenna deployed at the second floor of the two floor building and then we perform activity beers so zoo at both floors and also outside the building and here are the results so as we can see the result at each tested location so on average we achieved the tracking resolution of four point one meter so this course activity tracking allows for example multiple objects at different locations to share the same frequency for example we can assign all the faucet in the building at the same frequency because they are we cannot physically overlap right we can still use the location as extra one bit of information to disambiguate which is rich this also allows our solar system to be robust to for example neighbors solar system that we can use this location information to ignore signal from others of the systems to help others get quickly hands-on experience with so zoo so we open source this technology with this URL you can find all the source design files we also created a social toolkit which I've been giving away at waste specifically at the demo section so please also come to me at the end of the section if you want to have a soda okay so we were really excited to see what others might create with our sensor so we loaned the device to eight students at CMU and they came back to us with their individual projects with their idea after one week I would just conclude my talk with some of the student projects so first is a smart parking sensor so the sole of the student made this sensor is a solar-powered solar tag so and if you also made this waterproof and dustproof by curing everything inside of a positive reason and 3d printed shell so the student placed the tag on the ground on a parking spot when the car parked about it attenuates the light energy which we can monitor by sensing the shift of the frequency with the sensor we can know whether the spot is taking then we can post the information online visitors so they don't have to travel or all round this campus just to find a parking space there's also a smart recycling being the student cut a hole toward the top of the recycling bin and using a solar-powered a solar-powered soul attack of whenever the recycling bin is for is covered by trash and we can then send a alert message to facility people except them having to check manually every day another student create a smart arm a sizeable door for wheelchair so she put a motion power so that had to the wheelchair and they put the antenna at the door she attenuate the antenna sensitivity so that the antenna only senses the solar tag when the the wheelchair is within 2 meters range with that door and finally there's a smart medication reminder so the student each meant the lead of the pure ball of so they can every motion of opening and closing the lid and generate a unique frequency broadcast then the Google home are like second detect when to remind the patient to take medicine ok that's my talk thank you very much I'm open to questions so we have time for several questions thanks for a very great talk I'm just wondering given that you're not using Bluetooth or Wi-Fi technology what are your thoughts on privacy and security given that even though you may have ways to not be you know to listening in to your own signals you still can listen in to everybody else's signals as well yep this is a great question actually um the security and privacy is definitely one of the loophole these technologists we are not encoding information which means your neighbor or someone with bad intention can just Park in now long enough also they are housed and the monitor what is going on inside the house so one thing I'll say is because the table right - link frequency to the specific act activity it's maintained by the homeowner so even though someone outside your house detects some signal but they don't have that table they don't know what exactly the users doing is at the house but I believe is do so with this technology you still can send someone inside the house or not that's a limitation of the technology I bet in future if we want to improve this technology in future we can add some for example like delay on the analog circuit so instead of like real-time broadcasting signal in real time we can broadcast signal for example with hours of delay or as some random noise so that you can decode the random noise you know the random noise from the receiver but others other people don't know the the random the encoding so there might be some some way to solve the privacy problem yeah thanks for the great talk I have a question about the in your kind of system evaluation you should very impressive accuracy numbers and I myself have used you know some precursor technology like the piezo electric light switches that you can install that harvest energy from your you know you are pushing the button to control an outlet somewhere and the reliability of those is very poor and so I'm wondering if you can comment on and they're out there as commercial products and very very much the low deterministic in their operation if you can comment on some of the challenges that those products are facing that you might also be facing or that you've overcome with a different approach yes this is a great question so we noticed that some of the because it will literally have to connect the solder tag with a harasser right there are wires there right if you don't protect them well right visit exposure of element outdoor you can easily be damaged so one example of how to protect that as I can I show in one of the student project is to pour severity boxing so that eventually everything just one part there's no moving part there everything is so dust and waterproof and we're also counting on for example collaboration with manufacturer of evidence every day goes to incorporate our technology to part of their manufacture process because our technology is super low cost it's low cost enough that it gives the unique opportunity for future you know manufacture of this massive object incorporated technology during the manufacture process so we don't have to add any extreme external that could be another way to make it more robust because right now the because this is the first time we try to build this technology a little bit like research II and prototyping that but the I agree with you the durability could be one of the limitations we've got time for one more quick question hi great talk I just have a short question you talked about signal penetration then what material cannot be penetrated what would be the limitation of deployment so let me repeat Peter question just to make sure I get it right so if there's one material that we cannot penetrate through what would be that material yeah that would be a big sheet of metal but yeah you know with this frequency we found that the wavelength right is very good at penetrating the motor material but still we noticed some for example attenuation if your receiver is next to a big city of matter of touches refrigerator right because the door and literally could be metal so that could be attenuation if the receiver is next to that thank you very much let's take our speaker one more time [Applause]
