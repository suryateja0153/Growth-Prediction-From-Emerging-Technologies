 hi friends welcome to this video in  this video we'll be talking about   why to use kubernetes once  upon a time not too long ago if an application developer has to deploy a new  application he has to contact system engineering   and they have to buy new servers organization  ran application on physical servers there were   no way to define resource boundaries  for applications and physical server   and this causes resource allocation issues  for example if multiple applications run on a   physical server there can be an instance where one  application would take up most of the resources   and as a result the other application would  underperform a solution for this would be to   run each application on a different physical  server but this did not scale as resources   were underutilized and it was expensive for  organization to maintain many physical servers   as a solution virtualization was introduced  it allows you to run multiple virtual machines   on a single physical server cpu virtualization  allows application to be isolated between   virtual machines and provides a level of  security as information of one application   cannot be freely accessed by another application  virtualization allow better utilization of   resources in a physical server and allows  better scalability because an application   can be added or updated easily reduces hardware  cost and much more with virtualization you can   present a set of physical servers as a cluster of  a disposable virtual machines each virtual machine   running all components including its own operating  system on the top of virtualized hardware   containers are similar to vms but they  were have relaxed isolation properties   to share operating system among the applications  therefore containers are considered lightweight   similar to a vm a container has its own file  system cpu memory process space and more   as they have decoupled from underlying  infrastructure they are portable across cloud   and os distributions containers are a good way to  bundle and run your application in a production   environment you need to manage the containers  that run application and ensure that there are   no downtime for example if a container  goes down another container needs to start wouldn't it be easier if this behavior was handled  by a system with docker you have to write scripts   to monitor rebuild fail containers or node or  to create new container to scale out application   that's where kubernetes come to rescue kubernetes  provide you with a framework to run distributed   system it automates and orchestrate failure events  and creation and deletion it has automatic bin   packing you provide kubernetes with a cluster  of nodes that it can use to run containerized   tasks you tell kubernetes how much cpu and  memory each container needs kubernetes can   fit container onto your nodes to make the best  use of your resources self healing kubernetes   restart container that fail replaces containers  kills a container that don't respond to your   user-defined health check and don't advertise  them to clients until they are ready to serve   secret and config management communities let you  store and manage sensitive information such as   password oauth token and ssh keys you can deploy  and update secret and application config without   rebuilding your container images and without  exposing secrets in your stack configuration service delivery and load balancing communities   can expose a container using dns  name or using their own ip address if traffic to a container is high kubernetes  is able to load balance and distribute the   network traffic so that the deployment is stable  automated rollouts and rollbacks you can describe   the desired state for your deployed  containers using kubernetes and it   can change the actual state to the desired  state at a controlled rate for example you   can automate to create new container for your  deployment remove existing containers and adopt   all the rare resources to the new container  storage orchestration kubernetes allow you to   automatically mount the storage system  of your choice such as local storage   public cloud providers and more thank you for  joining us today please like and share this video   subscribe to our youtube channel for regular  updates and join us on slack for interactive chat
