 When we talk about Self-Healing and security, there's a few different things that we can do. You know, think about it like this: We have access to every part of the operating system at the system level. So, one, we can certainly make sure that your virus definitions are the latest level, the services are running. The other thing that we can do is, we can enable what we call protective services so if you have a file or a folder or a registry setting that you need to make sure exists no matter what, we can protect that so that if is you're installing new Java patch or a user installs tries to install something or a system update runs that nothing would overwrite that setting and there's a couple of things that we can do with that. One, we can just prevent it from running and stop it altogether or we can allow it to complete successfully and then very quickly revert it back to its preferred or protected state.
