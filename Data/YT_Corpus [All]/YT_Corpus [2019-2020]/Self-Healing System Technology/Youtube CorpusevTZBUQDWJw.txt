them into the chat box and we will answer them during the Q&A session at the end so at this point I'm going to turn it over to you Scott good afternoon everybody thank you for joining us today we will be talking about a multi-layered soft healing material system and this material was designed to mitigate the damage that results from a puncture from a high-velocity projectile something like a micrometeoroid or orbital debris this material is constructed by sandwiching a reactive liquid monomer formulation between two solid Palmer panels and while we designed this material with space exploration in mind I think that has uses far beyond this initial application so first I want to give you the background on this project and how we came about developing it this is research that I performed well a graduate student at the University of Michigan working under professor Timothy Scott and during this time I was also a NASA space technology research fellow so professor Scott at Michigan challenged me to look at different ways of performing institute polymer formation this is where a liquid monomer is converted into a solid polymer by exposing this liquid to some stimulus now this is a pretty common idea in many commercial applications to give you a few common examples superglue is a liquid while it's kept within its container and after it's squeezed out and released into the environment it reacts with humidity that is natural presidents that is naturally present that triggers a series of reactions that turns it from a liquid into a solid adhesive ultraviolet light can be used to convert liquid into a solid so there are lots of paint films applied as liquid to a material there's a shine ultraviolet light on it that's triggered a series of reactions turns out liquid paint into a solid protective coating professor Scott at Michigan challenged me to convert a liquid into a solid by exposing that liquid oxygen and he challenged me not only to develop different types of chemistry that were capable of this but also to find potential applications for it so what application that I considered was how NASA might use this NASA is interested interested in sending humans back beyond low-earth orbit with suit revisions planned to the moon and to Mars these extended missions we'll rely on the use of these space exploration habitats such as the ones pictured and illustrated here the habitats will give the astronauts a place where they can live work and sleep safely but there are serious concerns about the vulnerability of these habitats in particular what happens if the habitat wall is punctured well say a micrometeoroid hits the hits the habitat punctures a hole through the wall this creates a hole that allows the atmosphere to rush out draining the oxygen from the structure and putting the lives of those inside at risk so NASA was interested in developing materials that if they are punctured they automatically seals that seal themselves up closing that reach and preventing further loss of atmosphere but somewhat impressively nASA has developed some plastics that have this property under certain circumstances one of them is called Serling this is a commercially available polymer some grades are best known for their use commercially as the outer covering of a golf ball there's also a polymer called PBG of a chemical name here shown at the bottom so under certain certain circumstances if these materials are punctured by a high-velocity projectile the hole will seal off with those limitations server it will only work at a lower temperature range PBG will only work at a higher temperature range and there's some gaps in between well it won't necessarily work so I thought I might be able to improve on the system to add another mechanism for healing to reinforce the the natural properties of these two types of plastic so my idea was to incorporate this reactive liquid monomer layer in between two solid polymer layers and these pop solid polymer layers could be materials like sirloin or PBG so now if this were punctured by projectile like a micrometeoroid as the air starts to rush out this reactive liquid monomer will seep into that hole come in contact with the atmosphere rushing out this atmosphere contains oxygen I will then use the oxygen to initiate a polymerization reaction to convert that reactive liquid monomer into a solid polymer plug this will seal that breach and prevent loss of atmosphere so in order to put this idea into practice I had to figure out ways first of how do I turn a liquid into a solid banks was in that liquid oxygen and found I did this in a two-step process one I would use oxygen to generate radicals radicals are very reactive chemical species that are often used to initiate these types of polymerization reactions and then I would be so I would use these radicals made first by this reaction with oxygen and second I would use that to start this additional reaction that would convert the liquid into a solid so for the first first item here to convert oxygen into radicals I use the class of compounds known as trialkyl borings these chemical species in the presence of oxygen will form several types of radicals the actual VV some actual examples of tri alkyl borings two common ones are tributyl boring and tri alpha boring the one that i used in my experiments primarily was tributyl boring for the polymerization reaction I relied on what is known as the style in reaction this is a reaction between a sigh off which is an SH and in Ian this is a double bond containing species it includes things like vinyls vinyl ethers alleles or allele users when these two species chemical species are present in the presence of radicals they will react together to form a style ether linkage if we use monomers that have multiple functional groups so for example here's an here is a a dice I off with its 2008 rile either these materials are combined in the presence of radicals it will live arise and form a solid polymer so initially I did a considerable amount of research at my lab at the University of Michigan and it summarized the main points of what I found out there we found that or relations of a style and an E monomer along with the tribunal boring would be a liquid in the absence of oxygen if over one percent tributyl boring was present in the formulation it was solidified rapidly when exposed to air and we found that by adjusting the types of monomers used and the tributyl boring concentration we get it has occasion happening within seconds of being exposed to the atmosphere so having developed us these reactive formulations we wanted to actually test it to actually put it into a panel and puncture it and see what would happen and we did that work here at the NASA Langley Research Center so we constructed test panels they have this reactive liquid monitor between two solid polymer panels to simulate micrometeoroids puncture we fire bullets at it to do bullet with ballistics testing and we monitor the results using various types of high speed video cameras the actions give you the specifics on the ballistic testing we took a three by three inch panel set that in a test and 11 meters from a rifle we have a luckily were to have a NASA sharpshooter president here at NASA Langley Romans from the rifle fire two to three caliber Full Metal Jacket bullets we use this type of ammunition as attempts to punch a clean hole to raw material and we thought this would best simulate micrometeoroids bump sure we set up high-speed video cameras that would allow us at a to collect data at a hundred thousand frames a second to show what would happen as the bullet approached contacted penetrated through and then passed on the test panel well to show you some of the results of the step thing here is a control experiment that we did this has the two solid polymer panels on the front and back with a liquid formulation in the middle that does not contain tributyl boring so it does not contain the initiator that actually can react with oxygen to start the series of polymerization reactions that would turn the liquid into a solid this will we expect it and it did just remain a liquid one does use this as a point of comparison so as I play the video you'll see the bullet passed through the material and very quickly you see the screen will liquid consuming out this is entirely as we expected because this material is unreactive showing a video that we took afterwards you receive me squeezing the sample and look what just oozes out again this is exactly as we expected because it's liquid it's not capable of they compare that now to the video that we took of us of a sample where we did include 2% tributyl boring so this has the initiator this is capable of reacting with oxygen so the bullet passes through unlike before we don't see much happen afterwards if we look at a video that was collected after that task you see me squeezing the sample around the edges away from the impact site you still see the bubbles move so it's cool a liquid there but at the site of penetration that liquid had turned into a solid and is able to test that with a vacuum line early on and it did completely seal up that hole so that was very exciting this seemed to prove though the basic feasibility of this idea we published as a result in an ACS macro letters published by the American Chemical Society it was selected as an editor's choice article by the ACS meaning if you are interested in reading this this is freely available for downloading for free to everybody the American Chemical Society put out a press release on this really on this research that got a tremendous amount of press there's numerous articles that appeared throughout popular media my advisor was interviewed on Scientific American 60-second science podcast and I was interviewed on Michigan Public Radio many of these articles were quite well well written and explained the research accurately others exaggerated a bit and they seem to suggest that this type of technology is much further along than what it was way that we saw this was this was a very successful first step but we know that there is much more research that needs to be done to get this to the point where it could be used in a commercial product while still a graduate student I had the chance to start working on one of these next steps so one of the limitations of this test is that both the front and the back side of the panel are under atmospheric pressure for the applications that we're interested in you know meaning these base habitats that would be on the moon or on Mars there will always be a pressure differential the outside will be vacuum or near vacuum and the inside will be pressurized so we want to be able to perform the experiments under a pressure differential to do that we went to the NASA Glenn Research Center in Cleveland Ohio and they constructed a pressurized box for me or the sample would sit in the front side of this box this box was then fit sit inside a larger vacuum chamber which is connected to a barrel and a pressure vessel we were able to pump the outer vacuum chamber down to about a tenth of an atmosphere so there was about a ten to one pressure differential this level vacuum is not as low as it would be on obviously on the moon or even on Mars but this is a good simulation at least it's a good first step beyond what we did in our initial testing with this experimental setup we're able to launch a a projectile a steel ball bearing which is propelled by a plastic what is known as a sub Oh down this downward gun barrel at 900 meters a second now we don't want these to bow slamming into our sample so we put at a the device at the end of the barrel installed to catch the scible and would only allow the metal steel ball-bearing to strike z to strike the sample to show you a photo of what the external setup looks like we see the metal pressurized box which should be pressurized to one atmosphere the test panel sits in the front of that and the dotted line shows the projectile path of the steel ball bearing a note to that what this set of also allowed us to monitor this process with high-speed video cameras so the samples were constructed as they were before with a reactive liquid monomer formulation sandwiched between two solid polymer supports now one of the issues that we had anticipated was that under a pressure differential those low viscosity liquid might shoot out through this hole before it has a chance to polymerize so to help mitigate that problem within the liquid we inserted a glass fiber a glass fiber mesh in the hopes that this mesh would help to grab on to liquid long enough to allow it to have time to slimmer eyes and solidify to stay and seal that hole so here's some videos of the data that we collected with this with this experimental process and again this first the first video I will show you is with an unreactive liquid just for point of comparison so they play the video you'll see a cloud of debris and amongst that debris will be the steel ball-bearing that penetrates the sample and very quickly afterwards we see this liquid being ejected quite violently much more violently than before owing to the pressure differentials from the backside of the panel which pressure pressurized and the near vacuum conditions on the outside this is again much more dramatic than the the sample that we tested just at atmospheric pressure so compare this will be formed with these sample formulations that contained 2% regular boring so again this formulation has the initiator in the monomer and this will react in contact with oxygen as I play back this video again you'll see the cloud of debris and steel ball-bearing it'll pass through the sample creating a hole and not a whole lot happens right now if we were to play this video back long enough you would see a small amount of solid material extruded through this hole and I went when I went back and examined the sample the hole did not seal up completely but it was much much smaller than it would have would have been otherwise because of the complexity of the setup we only had a chance to test a limited number of samples but even getting this for this far on our first attempt I thought was very promising so now that was how far I was able to take this project while a graduate student at the University of Michigan I think there's a lot more work that can be done to to improve upon this I think the first question that needs to look at is the best way of packaging the liquid within the primary structure what I did was just to sandwich this liquid within two solids there might be better ways of doing this like including a honeycomb structure along with the liquid or maybe embedding the liquid within capsules or some kind of three-dimensional tube you'll or even like a vascular type Network I think another question I need to be answered is how stable are these reactive liquids for the experiments that I performed I was I would make them up in the morning and the testing throughout the day and that for my purposes I was able to demonstrate the feasibility but I never looked at the long-term stability of these reactive liquids so I never looked at how they would behave a month or a year or two or three years after that and that is that is a real concern that would have to be addressed before this to be used in a commercial product there doesent summarize the summarizes material we have a multi-layered cellular material system with this reactive monomer layer in the middle that is able to react with oxygen to form a solid plug that can seal up a breach on either side of this our plastics that if they are punctured by a high-velocity projectile under certain temperature ranges they too are also able to heal themselves up to seal that breach which could in a space habitat prevent loss of atmosphere our hope is that by including multiple hewing mechanisms within one wall at least one of these under any type of damage event will be able to seal up that hole we felt that just using a single healing mechanism was too risky and it's too hard to account for all types of damage modes but by having multiple types of healing we would account for a wider variety of damage so what we had in up designed this say it was the thought of space exploration in mind we think this technology has applications to go far beyond that I think there's uses throughout aerospace and Aeronautics we also think it could be useful as a liner in a fuel tank you might be useful in radiation shielding we think I might have some thrust real applications for use as a wire insulation material and we furthermore we think it could be utilized in robotics or things like windows so that I listen turn you over to my colleagues all right thank you Scott we received a number of questions during the presentation and will get to them shortly but as Scott said we are going to turn this over to my colleague as well Kim Middleton she's going to give a brief overview of how businesses can partner with NASA through technology licenses hi I'm Kim Middleton I'm a licensing specialist here at NASA Langley Research Center and also in the room with me is Glen King he's my teammate and also a licensing specialist on this next slide here you can see some of the businesses that we have done companies that we've done businesses with out in the past and you can see that there's a large range of them so let's get started so here at NASA Langley we mainly focus in the areas of advanced materials aerospace application sensors and detectors to find these technologies the best thing to do is go to our website the technology gateway or NASA tech transfer copy down that website and you can go there and search for just about any technology you want to you can also learn about other ways of doing business with us such as SpaceX agreements and SBIR opportunities we have several licenses here types of licenses at Langley the first one we'll discuss is the standard commercial license it's available to domestic and international organizations there are exclusive license which means the field of use is limited just to a specific field abuse or we only deal exclusively with you the partially exclusive license is one where where you deal with the particular field of you geographic territory or term so we can license to another company and maybe a different geographic territory or maybe who's using it in a different field of use and then there's the non-exclusive license and these terms are negotiated on a case by case basis we also instituted the start-up license this was developed to help them to address to the biggest challenges faced by most companies today startup companies and that's raising capital and securing IP so we don't charge you anything upfront for these licenses but once you start selling it a product or collecting money we will look at doing their commercial license and charging either standard 4.2 running royalty these startup licenses are available to companies formed expressly with the intent of commercializing and NASA technology they are only available to US companies they are non-exclusive as I mentioned no upfront cost and there are no minimum fees for the first three years the next license we have is an evaluation license and it's kind of takes the approach try it before you buy it we will license this to you for our twenty five hundred dollar fee for about one to two years and it allows you to test and demonstrate the technology again these are both for non-exclusive licenses so how do you get started well the first thing you would do would be to submit an application I'll point out I think the application is a little hard to find so once you search that website you find the technology you're interested in on the right-hand side up at the top is a little button that says submit your application here along with that for the commercial license we need a well with all of them we need a certificate of incorporation for mercial we also need a financial statements a business and commercialization plans projected revenue and royalties and a company balance sheet we will then negotiate the terms to get these license started here's a little flow chart that just kind of runs through the process you go to that tech gateway you'd find that technology or this technology that you think would work well you've contact somebody in our office for the specific technology be myself are on glen keane you would talk to us and we would find out if it was a fit for your company and what you wanted to do we would decide what type of license would best be suited for your needs you submit that application we would review it and after the review we would decide if you qualify to have the license and then we go into the negotiation process and come up with the terms of the agreement and develop those and come to something agreeable to both you and the and NASA was that the greet upon you excited and there you are you are a licensee of NASA's technology if you need any other information here is my contact information on this slide and there's also the website for the technology gateway as I mentioned before that you can go and farm whatever you're interested in licensing we thank you very much for listening us today we hope that we can be of help to you and we hope that this technology that Scott's presented to you today will be a value to your company great thank you very much Kim we received a good number of questions don't never going to be able to get to all these today but we will certainly be following up with every question that we do not answer during this webinar so thank you for everyone who submitted so far again please continue to type your questions into the chat box we will be addressing those if not right now with Apollo female within the week so I'm going to go ahead and get jump right into it so Scott one of our listeners wants to know is does this new liquid layer work in non vacuum environments yes it it relies upon oxygen being present to initiate that polymerization reaction so it can work anywhere where an oxygen leak may occur re um I suppose in addition to that it's what if it's one side is oxygenated and one side is some other gaseous substance as long as the we pressurize the site with a greater pressure contains oxygen that was so that would push oxygen through any breach that would form that would initiate the reaction if the other side was a was a higher pressure we would have to test it to see if the amount of action present would actually be enough to initiate the reaction okay great say this has been used this someone instance Institutes this technology in their fair applications and make it's multiple uses it gets multiple functions over time is it possible at the liquid layer in the middle could run help and you could have yes yeah it can and that is one of the potential limitations of this technology this is designed to be a one-time use only if you hit in the exact same area where it has already been healed it will probably punch out that solid plugg and there may or may not be enough liquid to fill into that gap and reseal it that's also one of the reasons why we decide to make this a multi-layered healing system so we have those front and back layers made of us with other material like sterling or PPG and we had hope that one of those plastics was able to seal itself up and seal that second breach that would happen so this isn't this is just product question in my mind I'm shredder listener wants to know as well he said it was a one-time meet so that one time used for that a specific spot or that yes this is it thought it could be I use being like two inches away yes it has the intention great okay the chances of micrometeoroid hitting exactly the same splat twice is probably pretty low agreed agreed but I was just wondering for non space environments certainly they might be more concerned about puncture you to know if your areas close by it's things like that so on to the next question do be self-healing plastics only work at speed I know you said you used ballistics and to simulate micrometeoroids which are coming in quite quickly yo do they does it work for slower punctures so the the plastic see this Erland in the PPG only work at high velocity now the testing that was done of those was a firing bullets that were at a kilometer a second going slower than that might not cause those to heal the healing action of those plastic depends on the impacts like heating up as the bullet passes through if it's slower it's not going to eat up as much and it may it may not heal the liquid layer on the other hand doesn't rely so much on the velocity it's just the presence of oxygen that is needed to initiate that solidification reaction that would form that solid clog again so the reason why we incorporated this multi layer to multi layers in the system so that for whatever type of damage would happen at least one of these mechanisms can kick in to see a level other it's the reactive liquid or one of the two plastic layers fantastic I've got one for Kim here what comes with the license for this technology so what comes with the own license is the information typically found in the patent so it's the information you will probably get a little bit of the inventors time but not much they'll be able to ask a few questions and some instances of a materialism bulb you can get a sample of the material by using an MTA and material transfer agreement of course they do get some right - yeah i reproducibly yes exactly I'm sorry yes exactly don't want to don't know Dorner for Google yes um but of course that is included in a license anything right to use the patent that's exactly right thank you for another one for Scott here can this be useful a submerged environment so 600 water maybe um something I actually came up at my at my dissertation defense would ask you that the chemistry as it is right now probably won't work with water but I think with some tweaks to the chemistry does that the concept could be implemented it would take some additional research in order to modify the system's up but I do think it's feasible okay I got a compound question here someone wants to know if the liquid is flammable toxic and if it's a solvent it is so it's not in a fault it's a liquid and the component of the formulation are either or it's most of the monomer was about one for one or two percent of the initiators the tributyl boring as far as its toxicity we generally we think the superior is generally safe to use that we haven't in-depth investigated as toxicity for flammability the attractant of boring that material in its pure form is quite difficult and dangerous to handle it is very reacted with oxygen and if you just open up a container of this material it will react with oxygen get up and catch yourself on fire but including it at a moderate concentration of one or two percent we think that this material would be would be safe to incorporate into a larger structure so we do we would certainly think that this would have to be a desiccated further great city this is a long one in the event one polymer layer heals but the other armorer side doesn't run on the anaerobic side because the liquid just seep out and there any way to mitigate such an effect yeah that is a that's a real that's a real concern with this so it's something that glances off the outside of a habitat and say the outside cracks but the inside doesn't there's no oxygen present now all liquids has some kind of vapor pressure so that liquids going to seep out or just evaporate off into into the vacuum that is difficult now again we because this is a multi-layered system and you know in this case it's good that the inner that the inner layer didn't break so at least the people inside are under no risk of this happens but now you have a a problem where it might drain out the liquid and render it useless throughout the rest you know throughout for impact elsewhere besides that one way to mitigate this we think might be to using a liquid with very low or essentially no vapor pressure such as modifying the monomers to be ionic liquids another way is to design a much more sophisticated middle layer so instead of just having large amounts of those liquid present you could design some kind of vascular networks that would allow you to pump the liquid throughout this layer so even if you did lose some liquid you then still replenish it this might also require an astronaut to go outside and put a patch over this crack but this at least having this mechanism available will allow you to refill the system with the reactive liquid fantastic well first I wasn't sure you'd have an answer for that and I think probably they're going to be our last question here this probably one is the most obvious and if this is if this liquid layer is supposed to react with oxygen how in the world did the work in space I've gotten I've gotten that question a lot at various presentations and even at my defense the this is this is intended to be used where there is oxygen on one side of a barrier and no oxygen on the other so you have a pressurized environment with atmosphere and on the outside you have a queue or near vacuum conditions and if it was designed to be used where if this wall gets punctured now obviously the atmosphere that is inside under pressure will leak out through that hole and it's that oxygen the oxygen that is leaking out through that hole that will initiate the series of reactions to turn that liquid into a solid so obviously there's no oxygen in space but we're not using are not using what's available in space we're using what's available inside the pressurized environment fantastic well if we didn't get to your question during the live Q&A session today we like I said earlier we will be following up by email what's in the next week if you have any questions do please submit them you can send it to that the email address you see on the screen currently and of course that you can find us on our website and submit questions through there and we'll be glad to get to you is within the next week if you submitted anything during the webinar and if you submit anything after we'll get back to you as soon as we can and once again I just want to thank everyone for your time and joining us today and we look forward to having you join us on our next webinar
