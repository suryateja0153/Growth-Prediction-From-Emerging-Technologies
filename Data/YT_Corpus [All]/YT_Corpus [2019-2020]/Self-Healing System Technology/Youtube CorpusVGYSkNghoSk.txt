 So I'm gonna on that note teach you something for  the immune system markers wouldn't you like to   learn that especially at this time of COVID and so  one of the things that you can do and again play   full out with me one of the things you can  do is you have to find this breast bone type   area it's a little bit hard just go ahead and  touch this breastbone there it's a little bit   hard and if you if you have found this sort of  harder place you know just tell me yes you found   it it's like bony area yeah and you make a fist  like this it's a gentle fist okay a gentle fist   it's not a tight fist like this okay a gentle fist  and as you make a gentle fist you very gently just   tap like this it's known as a thump a thymus  thump just very gently and then you can also   make a very gentle ah sound [ah...] and you  sound like tarzan a little bit when you do it this is increasing your immune  cells right now by the way your   white blood cells in your body are increasing  as you do this I mean you've not taken any   Vitamin C right now and it's going up in  your body so keep doing with me [ah...] and as you take a breath in and out go  ahead and just get a little sip of water
