 If you're a subscriber to this channel or a casual viewer and if you're not a subscriber you should be you may or you may not know about my Kickstarter campaign going on linked below by the way for the Alfred backpack hanger rugged durable utilitarian totally industrial looking become an aluminium $29 $32 for the stainless steel version plus shipping I'm gonna give you a sneak peek behind the scenes look at my Kickstarter campaign I'm gonna show you how I set it up how I ran it some of the pitfalls and where my backers come from and no they don't come from YouTube yes this is totally about converting my 26,000 subscribers in YouTube to a few backers on Kickstarter so that I can get my product into production plain and simple that's what this video is about let's start with the basics what is Kickstarter well Kickstarter is an online platform where people in theory makers like me can get their product funded by backers so small donations equal large volumes so you can get your product into production yeah the system totally gets abused companies like Lego have even had of course successful Kickstarter campaigns but in my opinion Kickstarter is really for smaller makers designers like myself to get their products into production and their dreams fulfilled Kickstarter is an all-or-nothing platform if you reach your goal in my case $5,000 you get funded you get your money you can go into production this is what my Kickstarter campaign page looks like products at the top a little video you can click on it on the right hand side shows all the backing levels so if you want to get a product you can pledge to become a backer if I reach my goal five thousand bucks not that huge goes into production ship the in theory that's what's supposed to happen the offer a backpack hanger holds your backpack can hold your mobile devices can charge them up at the same time you can hang your keys at the bottom simple utilitarian like I said very functional industrial-looking can pretty much go anywhere that's my product the first thing I did when I was going to do a Kickstarter campaign was to get organized so I created a document that had all the information in it that I needed so in this case links about the product information about the product what it was going to be about stuff that I was going to post in the Kickstarter campaign to let people know what the product is about beyond that this document holds a ton of other information marketing information who I want to contact how I want to publicize this product even research about the shipping bags that were going to use to ship them out to the backers in the end boxes all the little details contained in one document easily accessible and I can share it out on Google Docs works really good once I had a prototype made by the manufacturer down in Miami I made a little commercial because I can do that I have a youtube channel I need that commercial to run the Kickstarter campaign once I launched it gives you access to information so here we are on the dashboard and it shows us basically how much money we've raised every single day to get to the point we're at the goal is five thousand bucks it's a little closer to four thousand right now I'm getting close this shows you for example where your referrals come from so where people are clicking from before they come to Kickstarter to make a donation this way I can track where the backers come from some of the marketing that I did beyond my own was on Instagram I thought I'd give that a try crowd fund success cost me too twenty-five dollars they make a little post on their Instagram page hmm I get or they get 585 views into comments totally got me zero followers by the way on Instagram complete waste of money Instagram kind of sucks for social marketing because there's no linking it's terrible anyway lesson learned 25 bucks wasted got nothing out of it no backers alright so then I tried crystal wolf Facebook marketing Queen a one week campaign for 99 bucks forty five thousand subs on Twitter those are her posts totally uncreate 'iv posted the same thing every single day didn't reply to my emails no nothing changed cuz I can see the analytics where the backers come from this is what she sends me look at the top it says Strebel she'd even addressed me to my name anyway I did have some success because core 77 put me in the trending page two weeks ago for Kickstarter campaigns that was very successful I probably got three or four backers on that day super grateful thank you core 77 you know you are your first name begins with an are your last name begins with an N thank you from the bottom of my heart I can't thank you enough for your help let's take a look at some of the basic analytics this shows me where the clicks come from for the backers that I have you can see that a lot of them are external and that also comes from a newsletter that I have that has about a thousand people on it and so that drove some backers as well this is what a typical backer looks like in the information that I can see I can see their name their pledge amount and their location in the world so in this case is somebody from the United States and what they pledged let's talk about who my backers actually are so the majority of them are serial backers and friends and family so maybe 50-50 somewhere in there may be even more serial backers than friends and family so and you would think with twenty six thousand subs on YouTube you'd have a few more backers from YouTube but no most of them are serial backers meaning they've backed dozens in this case 52 this guy has so thank you to the serial backers the wild-card in this is the hundred and seventy nine and it's well over that at this point of people that are following the project and it does show those converted and it's only about five percent so that means there's a hundred and eighty probably two hundred people that are following this project that haven't pledged anything and that's a huge wildcard only gonna take a few to convert to make this a successful campaign and then this shows me the reward popularity which are the most popular rewards alright so currently I have one thousand bucks left to go probably only take about twenty backers to get that average pledge is like fifty sixty dollars so twenty thirty backers I mean I would love to crush it and do like ten thousand bucks and produce a whole bunch of them I'd be fantastic that's my goal also a couple more things of note if you think that Kickstarter is going to help you in any way shape or form during your campaign hmm you are sadly mistaken Kickstarter don't give a shit about you they really only care about their money that they pocket after the campaign is successful by the way I think they take about 5% or something like that so even if I just barely reach my goal they're gonna take a chunk out of that I never got featured on the landing page of Kickstarter never gotten any support from them in any way shape or form and I hear this from other Kickstarter people as well they really are only going to promote projects that are super successful and that meet there are certain analytic standards of course they're gonna promote the things that are most successful so that's a sneak peek at my Kickstarter campaign I realize that's a little bit of an unusual video for me but there'll be more great content in the future I hope that you become a backer and help me get the back banger into production the link to the Kickstarter campaign is below thank you for your support
