 hi everybody and welcome to the weekly card reading using the insight from the body deck by Courtney Putnam i'm michelle Clinard just in case you don't know that and I am an intuitive energy reader and healing practitioner which just means that I help facilitate your own natural healing through intuitive bodywork and an intuitive energy reading within the body mm-hmm and I'm also a coach I help people figure out what the root cause is that's blocking them from what they want and how they want to feel getting them unstuck and mm-hmm this week I am incredibly so far behind this reading was actually supposed to be this weekly message was supposed to be posted on Sunday and because of the holiday and the weekend and all the things I was running a little behind and couldn't get it to upload on Sunday evening and one I thought well great I'll just post it in the morning no problem and during the night we lost power and I didn't have power or Internet one or the other or both until Wednesday and I've been playing catch-up ever since so here I am with your weekly card reading and I almost did this yesterday but I really kind of felt an intuitive note it's just the wait till today so we're just figuring that this weekly reading is actually from like today through next weekend like the 24th 25th so um I've shuffled my deck and card has popped out that is the know if you can see this the uterus card trying to get the glare off the insight from the body deck is really art inspired by various organs and body parts and since I read energy within the body emotional energy it really speaks to me so this card the uterus and manifestation card is really conveying and quality of feminine qualities being and doing are the first thing that's that that come birth and rebirth renewal review reigniting purpose and prioritizing values so like evaluating priorities and then realigning with them so representing divine feminine energy the uterus card but those qualities are like home and safety being the giver and the taker and the warrior spirit intuitive nurturing creation justice balance connection to yourself to others in the world and then a an energy of passive resistance and maybe even passive or feminine oriented solutions oh and definitely unmatched resilience because I'm well just going by literal representation the uterus I mean you know what it's capable of right it houses a human it grows up to 500 times its pre-pregnancy size and still returns to a normal size after that talk about adaptability and flexibility I mean is the epitome of feminine attributes or energy it also is a contracting quality like the uterus surely contracts to push a human out in the case of a vaginal birth that contraction is I mean it it's in its incredible resilience and strength for starters but it's also I think about going within in order to create an outcome or a flow you do not have to have a uterus to contain womb energy or uterine energy within you it is a feminine energy this the uterus is representing but it also doesn't have anything to do with gender this message is genderless it is gender fluid it is the uterus represents the home to every human being that came into this world we all came into the world being housed in the uterus whether we were born via cesarean or vaginal delivery or however we came into the world we came in through that way whether we're male or female or genderless or whatever so it's nothing to do with gender it's nothing to do with having to have a uterus to benefit and tap into this energy because we all contain this energy within us and it's the nurturing gentle energy and thus this message this card is a reminder to us all to be gentle and nurturing especially right now given our circumstances with the pandemic but nurturing to ourselves and others it's bringing attention to our current state of being and doing or being or doing during this pandemic that it's saying that we're all kind of in the state of either being or doing some of us are doing some of us are being some of us are both doing and being this is how many are coping and some of some of us are essential workers and we're out there doing the thing and we're also doing in being in terms of coping with our current circumstances so we're either doing and getting things done or taking on tasks and projects in order to cope or we're just being we're slowing down or resting we may even have a low-energy but either way it's okay it's what you'd need it's how you can nurture yourself by honoring that there's no right or wrong or good or bad doing or being is just it just is it's whatever you need whatever way to cope and get through this challenging time honor it accept it and be or do at any given moment according to your needs the uterus card is also conveying a message of putting any worry or self judgment to rest about whether you are okay or normal or and this is specifically in regards to whether you're doing or being if you're fatigued if you're sleeping a lot if you're doing all the things and and being overly productive whatever you're doing you don't need to judge is it enough is this what you should be doing just accept it as it is an honor it as you grow able to okay so it is mmm not see what else oh it also wants us to remind us to consider who we have become this is our time for self-reflection and introspection individually and electively who have we become and considering this introspectively we're considering what we create for ourselves what we're creating in the world and if our creations what we're creating if it's in alignment with our authentic selves and humanity as a whole so you can ask yourself a handful of questions and journal about it and really kind of dive into this if you'd like to let's see I will make sure that there is a list of some journaling questions and introspective questions that you can take action on to really take the meaning of this card message and take it fully in and process it and integrate it and see what it does for you in terms of helping you cope helping you process emotions helping you move forward either now or when we return back to a more social world okay so the self evaluation you'll be able to find in the written version of this reading the full version and you can link to that below let's see I want to thank you for watching one more time here's the uterus card manifestation the I do encourage you to go and read the questions and do the journaling because manifestation is a really big part of this card and the message it's really that introspect introspection and considering what you're creating is really going to help you move forward the create or manifest more of what you need and more of what you want in terms of outcomes going forward and that's for us individually but also this there's a collective feel to it where there are some things that we can and need to do differently going forward so check that out and I want to thank everybody for watching and I hope you'll join me in the next video next week for the New Moon message followed by another weekly card reading a week from
