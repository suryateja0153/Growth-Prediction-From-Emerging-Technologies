 What I have experienced is like scholars they want to discover life, they want to discover what is a purpose why they came in. They look out for a banditry under that they will get purpose of life and all. what I felt was that I got my belief and I discovered myself may be this will be the that we need which I could do. Visuals. And this is the Gurukul system which we don't usually experience it in the modern world. But I experienced a Gurukul system over here that connect with all of us. And the bond which I am carrying now is very really good. I was not aware that this much could happen in such six days of time. And thank you so much to everyone.
