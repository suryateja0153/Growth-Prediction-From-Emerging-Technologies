 Self-Updating Map technology is a technique that combines autonomous driving robots and deep learning to maintain the recency of indoor maps. We notice that there is a problem with today’s map. It’s that many point of interests are not up-to-date. To do this, people used to do a substantial amount of manual work but now we have created a technology that allows machines to update themselves. First, the autonomous driving robot moves around the indoor space capturing visual data and then deep learning is used to extract the features of the images. We trained a network to determine if two input images, which are photos of the same place at different moments, to determine if these images are showing the same point of interest or not. This area shaped like a cloud shows the results. It is used by the deep learning engine to tell you “I looked at it and this is my verdict.” POIs that underwent changes are marked in pink whereas unchanged POIs are displayed in blue. In practice, structures like columns, ceilings, and floors create noise that interferes with the algorithm, and that's why ignoring them improves the performance of the algorithm. The system is also very efficient cost-wise, as a machine automates the work that ordinarily a person would do. We would like the system to recognize information other than signboards but the outdoor case is a bit more challenging. This is due to different lighting conditions, and different weathers. Our goal is to solve these issues and extend the use of the algorithm to the outdoors. NAVER LABS' Self-Updating Map technology is the product of joint research conducted by a team of Korean and European researchers over a period of one year. “Did it change? Learning to detect point-of-interest changes for proactive map updates” The associated paper will be presented at CVPR 2019 in California.
