 hi everyone i'm karina feuerstein i'm a program manager on the microsoft 365 defender team and i'm here to talk to you today about our automated cross-domain security and how it helps double your stock efficiency what is microsoft 365 defender we started off with microsoft's best in breed threat protection portfolio which includes point products to cover security for the critical components of the modern workplace it includes microsoft defender for identity formerly known as azure advanced threat protection this uses active directory signals and microsoft cloud intelligence to protect against identity-based threats compromised and malicious users and lateral movement microsoft defender for endpoint formerly microsoft defender advanced threat protection is our endpoint protection platform providing everything from prevention to detection investigation response and risk mitigation for endpoints then microsoft cloud app security which detects unusual behavior across cloud apps to identify ransomware compromised users or rogue applications and finally microsoft defender for office 365 formerly the microsoft office 365 advanced threat protection which offers threat protection across email and other collaboration vectors like microsoft teams sharepoint online and onedrive these products have traditionally operated separately each in its own round and they do an amazing job at it but we realized almost every threat actually spans across a number if not all of these domains so we decided to embark on the journey of breaking the silos and bringing these products together into a coordinated cross-domain security suite introducing microsoft 365 defender the next iteration of our microsoft threat protection journey automated cross-domain security that out of the box combines the power of these products by merging their signals and capabilities into a single cross-domain solution providing an end-to-end experience for protecting the organization's network to achieve this we've identified these top capabilities a single portal in place of the multiple per workload portals with unified entities built by normalizing and unifying the individual product signals stopping threats before they execute across all vectors from emails to endpoints to identity by coordinating across the protection stacks leveraging the ability to bring together individual signals across the workloads into end-to-end attacks then automatically remediating affected assets across workloads devices mailboxes users back to a working state without the need of security teams to take action or build remediation scripts providing a threat based pivot on threat intelligence and security posture prioritized based on organizational impact observed in near real time and priming and enriching data across domains to enable to easily hunt over the accumulated knowledge across all domains and then finally enabling a common set of management apis and connectors across the street it's important to note that this is not a new product it's a collection of new features provided on top of our existing m365 security products that mesh them together and provide new capabilities that are the result of this deep integration if you have an m365 e5 license or a license for any of our individual e5 product licenses you have microsoft 365 defender just turn it on and start enjoying the benefits so in the next 20 minutes or so we're going to talk about how microsoft 365 defender improves the sox efficiency leveraging its unified best-of-breed deeply integrated full protection stack we will see how over 70 of threats are prevented from even reaching into the organization with about 80 percent of remaining threat alerts reduced into fewer comprehensive stock work items and 75 of those automatically investigated and resolved for you so stock efficiency is more important these days than ever before for several reasons threats are on the rise which brings more and more alerts to the sock over time the sock has collected a huge number of security tools to address the various aspects of dealing with these threats and on the other side stock resources are scarce and often not sufficiently trained and all of this exacerbated this year by the covit situation users and security teams alike working remotely from home so how do we address these trends and the problems that they create the multitude of tools in the sock leads to added complexity lost time in context switching and results in more downtime actually for affected services to resolve this we'll see how the single unified portal for all microsoft 365 security tools deeply integrated to represent common entities helps with reducing this complexity and making for a faster workflow sock teams being slammed with over 10 000 alerts a day results in alert fatigue many alerts are not handled and this ends up being a longer dwell time for attackers before they're detected here we automatically merge group and correlate alerts into comprehensive incidents making these new consolidated stock work items greatly reducing the workload and helping end-to-end investigation and we feel our customers pay of being constantly understaffed and insufficiently trained so we're heavily investing in automated self-healing of impacted entities and supporting microsoft thread experts service for when the stock needs an expert hand to better understand how these and many more new capabilities we've introduced this year work towards improving the efficiency of your stock let's look at a case study of the salk leveraging microsoft 365 defender to investigate and respond to a typical attack the example attack we will look at crosses security domain boundaries as many of them do it starts with phishing emails goes to infect endpoints and runs some scripts for recon and to steal credentials then it moves laterally in the organization using scripts as well as internal mail hosting malware on an internet onedrive share the unified microsoft 365 defender portal now brings together not only common cross-domain functionality but also all capabilities from the existing defender for endpoint and defender for office portals enabling stock analysts to already work out of this unified portal without the need to ever go back to those individual portals for these workloads so opening the microsoft 365 defender unified portal in the morning our sock analyst lands on a new and improved dashboard that you see here the dashboard presents a unified state of security including top active threats trends in the organization security blogs and news new emerging threat reports and more in addition the dashboard directs the stock analyst to the next most important work item to focus on high severity active incidents remediation action pending approval and so on note that you're eligible to use microsoft 365 defender as we said not only with a m365e5 license but actually even if you only have an individual product e5 license you can turn it on start your efficiency savings right away and over time as you deploy more of your e5 products the functionality in microsoft 365 defender will seamlessly expand to leverage the additional workloads so let's go look at our incident this morning so once upon a time all we had were alert cues even with a lot of attention given to signal to noise ratio across microsoft 365 and having invested in solid security posture a mid-size organization still ended up with an average of a thousand threat encounters a day alert cues became long and winding and often unmanageable so first and foremost remember microsoft 365 is a full protection stack which means it is able not only to identify but to prevent threats from reaching the organization across endpoints email cloud and other common entry vectors collaboration across the domains only amplifies the ability to identify and block imminent threats and with these capabilities we estimate about 70 of potential encounters across all threat vectors are completely prevented with no additional action for the stock required so out of those thousand potential threat encounters only about 300 actually end up as actionable alerts in microsoft 365 defender for the remaining alerts microsoft 365 defender correlates those related to the same attack across all workloads endpoint identity email and cloud together into the end-to-end attack work items we call incidents presented in an incident queue which we see here now instead of 300 individual alerts because of their grouping into incidents the stock has 40 incidents to work on an average reduction of about 80 percent new for the incident queue are comprehensive titles you can see here on the left representing the incident's content expanding to see the alerts in them and the new incident api for third-party tool integration as you can see many of the incidents in the queue here were already remediated automatically our automated self-healing triggers on new incidents automatically investigating all assets and evidence involved across devices user identities mailboxes and coordinates automatic remediation with a goal of addressing about 75 of the incidents in the queue so with this amazing 24x7 virtual allen list constantly at work our stock analyst desk is cleared and they can focus only on the more important about 10 incidents to handle in depth in our attack story the system generated a multi-stage incident let's drill into it to investigate it the incident provides an all up summary of the attack including the attack sprawl how far it's progressed mapped to the mitre attack framework the scope and impacted entities across devices users and mailboxes in our case we have two impacted devices two users and one mailbox the main chain of events as represented by the top alerts observed in relation to this incident the current remediation state what parts of the incident have already been auto healed and what parts still require attention and all the evidence hashes ips and so on collected in relation to this incident if you're part of a sock team you know that excel spreadsheet or shared notebook you use to collect all your notes when you're in data points during an attack investigation well no need for that anymore the incident collects all that data for you making for a much faster and more efficient investigation so to continue the investigation of this incident let's drill into the alerts collected here this view shows us the list of all alerts the system correlated into this incident as they were deemed related to this attack alerts are brought into the incident from all workloads and the incident connects the dots between them into one end-to-end story we can see the endpoint detections of a suspect lnk file and some powershell activity a suspicious url click reported from the email side and credential theft activity detected on the identity side all is part of the same flow of events in fact you'll notice that some of these alerts are generated by microsoft 365 defender itself because of the cross-domain signal correlation new in this view is grouping of similar alerts within the incident for better readability let's drill into one of the endpoint powershell alerts for further investigation to investigate the alert we land on the new unified alert investigation page whether investigating an endpoint alert or an email alert the experience is the same and tailored to typical soft investigation workflows presenting all important details activities and related alerts in the execution sequence in one comprehensive view the affected device and user account are highlighted at top to allow for quick assessment of risk based on organizational parameters in our case we can see the suspect powershell activity stemming from a wmi remote execution at the top of the page indicating likely lateral movement of the attacker to this box if you feel you've exhausted your expertise and need to phone a friend our microsoft threat experts are a click away to support your sock with expert advice and threat intelligence fill out your question and email address and our experts will get back to you with answers and advice if we need more details about the affected devices one click here brings us to the microsoft 365 defender unified device page the device page brings together data about the device from all workloads into one view directory data for example from defender for identity logged-on users combined from defender of endpoint and identity and the device timeline from defender for endpoints no need to go look in several different portals for pieces of the picture anymore the stock analyst can also take quick manual actions from right there for example now that we know this device is indeed compromised we can isolate it from the network with one click until its investigation and remediation are completed to track this and other actions taken in microsoft 365 defender we can use the unified action center this is where all actions taken across the different workloads are logged new to the action center is the logging of both automatic actions taken by the system as well as manual actions taken by sock analysts from here we can view action history and approve pending actions individually or in bulk for efficiency when dealing with similar artifacts we can see here that the system already took quite a few actions to remediate the affected assets in our attack we can drill in for details for example let's go see what this file quarantine action was about the automatic investigation details page is now a unified experience as an integral part of the microsoft 365 defender portal enabling us to view details for endpoint and email related automatic investigations and remediation actions by defender for endpoint or office alike now we can also move to investigate mike barden's account one of the users compromised in this attack the user page in microsoft 365 defender is now also unified across the workloads and brings together data about the user from the different sources including for example the user's activity timeline from the point of view of defender for endpoint and defender for identity combined and if we really want to go hunt for more around this attack surprise there's a go hunt button here as in many other spots in the portal that takes us to advanced hunting in the context of what we were investigating go hunt pre-populates advanced hunting with the initial query right off the bat relevant to the investigation context you're coming from for example in our case the relevant query for more details about the selected user's activity is popped in so you don't have to know how to write it or spend the time to type as a reminder advanced hunting enables free hunting over the raw data from all microsoft 365 workloads lots of new data points were added recently including application and identity data and email post delivery data a new side plane allows us to easily inspect rows in the result set and take further actions from right here again no unnecessary clicks everything's at your fingertips to save work and time and some cool new features were added to include profile information in queries for example i can now filter a file search for only those files with very low prevalence and those that are unsigned other new features include creating cross-domain custom detections documentation for all tables and fields is now available right here in the portal and a new advanced hunting api enables integration of microsoft 365 defender hunting with other third-party tools great efficiency gains here too being able to get in one query what you'd have to do in several steps across different tools before finally once we're done investigating and remediating this threat we can take a step back and look at the organizational level what do we know about this threat what's its current organizational impact and moreover what can we do to prevent it from reoccurring microsoft 365 defenders threat analytics reports are here exactly to answer these questions for you new reports are published into the portal whenever a new threat or campaign emerges it provides detailed threat intelligence including target industries goals and ttps of the threats across the microsoft 365 workloads and you can see at a glance in near real time whether your organization is exposed to this threat and where what you can do to reduce your exposure and prevent it completely and whether you're already impacted hopefully not but if so how and where we typically see at least five such high impact emerging threats in the landscape every month when these emerge the sock can do away with the running around under pressure trying to find answers to these questions the threat analytics report provides a cso ready view with all relevant information collected and summarized for them so how does microsoft 365 defender make for the ultimate security tool for maximum stock efficiency let's recap we've seen how the protection stack is able to prevent and block 70 percent of the threats coming at us on the detection front the deep integration between best of breed security capabilities across the different workloads makes for better coverage and more accurate detection incidents that bring together individual alerts into end-to-end attack stories reduce the work queue by another 80 percent and help simpler and faster investigations and microsoft threat experts are there for you to bridge to bridge any expertise gap automatic investigation and remediation works like a virtual analyst and takes care of another 75 percent of the remaining incidents leaving 10 down from a thousand we started from to work on then cross domains hunting lets you find more signals across the extremely rich and large m365 data lake with quick go hunt pivot points that pre-populate your queries for you and threat analytics reports provide all the threat intelligence impact and exposure data for any emerging threat to help the stock be informed and prepared even before the cso comes asking before we close let's hear milad aslaner one of our customer program managers talk with one of our amazing customers rabobank about their experience with microsoft 365 defender in practice thank you covino hello nico hello it's great having you with us today you're part of the security operations center uh do you want to introduce yourself yes thank you for having us uh milad today my name is uh rao van de forte i'm the global service owner of the cyber defense center and in that role like you're responsible for the architecture roadmap product program improvement of the security services we have including the other ones we use for microsoft hi milot my name is nico vandar i'm also working in the cyber defense center i was i'm working as a cyber lead cyber security engineer my focus area is everything related to the cyber kill chain might attack framework and together with rule we started this journey with microsoft three years ago awesome so great to have you folks virtually here so raoul can you describe me how it used to be for your security team before you introduce microsoft 365 defender yes um like before like we moved um to microsoft to you guys we were like more uh point solution focused so like yeah we had like a lot of products that were like the best in class um where like in the magic quadrant of gardner on top but um the big issue we had that with that like from an engineering perspective was that um we were like trying to integrate those products but it's like it was like costing us so many resources time and the real added value was yeah not always there and and and also like from a security operations perspective um the the team the shock was having too many portals to do their investigation so the efficiency focus was like your heart and and and that's why you know we were searching for like what's the the best way to have that added value and um we are now focusing more and more on like we call it like the ecosystem where uh the microsoft 365 defender suite is yeah our like your main foundation fantastic so curious nico how is microsoft 360 defender from your perspective made your security more efficient the the visibility that we have now across and within the complete network that's very important so with the efficiency there that we can make custom detection rules also but also zoom in and do some more triaging way faster than before that's one of the most important things that we get out of the combination and the integration of all the products awesome are you able to provide maybe an example at this moment we can see where some of the attacks are coming from are they coming fire mail are they and then we can get them also to see on which mailbox they are we can uh also see if a mill is still coming through and they are still on the end point if we see an endpoint that's coming from where we can do a back watch engineering and remove all that kind of attacks and block that mail and all the mailboxes within the complete organization and that is really a winning point for us an improvement that sounds exciting well i'm curious what does a typical day look like for your security team now what are they focusing on with with this new efficiency that they gained through micro365 defender i think like the the best example is that like recently we enabled the um i'm like we're calling that like the the single pane of glass so the the portal that's combined by like the several products we were using before and that the team is now like able to focus on the incidents that are in there and to do the investigation in like one portal one pane and that like yeah like almost all the information and data that's needed it's in there and that's yeah helping the teams to focus and i think that's like you know one of them the the real added values we have now that it's helping them to do a better investigation and another example is by like you're moving towards this this ecosystem um the uh rate of false positives it's like it declined uh big time so now like the incidents we have it's it's like yeah that's it's not always like a true positive but it's like way better than before um and yeah the the sock and the teams are like improving that like every day to um yeah work on the incidents that yeah really uh are important awesome nico i'm curious so you folks are using uh micro368 defender and advanced hunting heavily talk to me a little bit about the advanced hunting cable across your security data what does that enable you that you couldn't do before yeah before it was really hard to get all the data in one place and go start hunting from that place now it's already dead so we can do it based on again on the cyber kill chain the mitotic framework every important data to start hunting is already there in one portal and we can start from there quite easily and before it was on an on-premise environment we have to combine we have to onboard all the uh the sources and then we have to hope that the loss is still there and all the maintenance around that that cost a lot of time and now it's quite easy go to the portal and do your ending and start so that's really a big improvement that sounds great well thank you so much nico thank you all uh for joining us today and with that back to you covina thanks milan and our rabbleback friends so this is microsoft 365 defender in the bigger picture microsoft 365 defender is part of our microsoft defender xdr solution which together with azure sentinel or cloud scene
