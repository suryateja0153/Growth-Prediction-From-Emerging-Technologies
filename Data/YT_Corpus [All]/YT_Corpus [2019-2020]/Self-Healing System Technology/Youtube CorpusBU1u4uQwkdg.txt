 I'm making a major announcement with this video I've been in the closet for a long time and I'm finally coming out because I can't record audio in my closet anymore let's build a vocal booth don't forget to follow me on social media on Twitter at BOTS InDesign and now on Instagram also at BOTS InDesign my name is Eric Strebel I'm an industrial designer welcome to my channel about product design and making I hope that you like and joy and become a subscriber make sure you give the video a thumbs up and then you hit the bell hit the bell again so you get the little parentheses around it that way you'll be notified every time I have a new video don't forget to check out the design and making merchants just below the video on the shelf t-shirts hoodies stickers leggings and phone cases a very early morning trip to my local big-box retailer renting a truck and all my materials that's how I started out this project and see everything before I even did that I did a sketch figuring out the basic construction I had some general dimensions and I knew what this thing was gonna look like my big limitation for this vocal booth is my height the ceiling in my basement is only 80 inches tall so it's not super just barely big enough for me to fit in I'm gonna rip everything down this is the frame here these are one buys two inches and these are the two by fours that are gonna make the floor base and here's the quarter inch why would that everything is gonna get cheated with that's going to wrap the pink insulation foam on the inside so my big thing with this booth was light weight and so we're gonna build these composite walls they're gonna have two inches of styrofoam on it inside there is a wooden frame that frames these walls everything is modular and then they will get skinned with quarter-inch plywood so I got the little frames built here and they'll eventually get filled in with the two-inch pink insulation styrofoam when that's how that's gonna work it's put a little roof on here yeah ultimately there's gonna be a light that goes in there as well so let's screw together this is the base the part that you stand on that everything gets built on and I'm gonna recess the floor a little bit you can see I have ripped out the little corner pieces let's get back to building the walls when it cut the styrofoam that's gonna go into the little walls we're gonna do this with a utility knife here a retractable blade knife I'm cutting this all by hand to try to minimize the amount of foam that gets released into the environment I could have cut it on the table saw I want to keep that to a minimum and I want to cut it with a knife it works pretty good actually now right here you can see the wooden frame fits around the pink foam pretty good and I made those wooden strips exactly the two inches the thickness of the foam I did end up getting one sheet that was slightly thicker than the other ones by accident they were all 150 but one of them was a 250 not exactly sure what the difference is there but one of them was just a tick thicker and I end up having to shim that a little bit later you'll see now the one wall is gonna get electrical in it there's gonna be outlet box on the outside for two outlets to power the portable hard drive and my laptop the inside will get some power since there's going to be a monitor as well and the dimmer switch to control the light on the inside of this thing we use some contact cement to eliminate everything together basically I'm going to eliminate the feeding on the outside to the foam on the inside the big reason here is I just want to prevent any sort of air movement any sort of potential rattling that could happen and just keep all that noise to an absolute minimum using a water-based contact cement I'm just rolling that out and then ultimately I'm gonna screw all the edges together to make these composites so they the walls becomes very strong and relatively lightweight I see other people on ebay make these booths out of sheet rock and my goodness I can only imagine how much that stuff weighs I want my unit to be modular and movable because who knows where I need to move it to so I want to keep it light weight and as insulated as possible now I made a mistake when I ripped the exterior quarter-inch sheeting down and for some reason I made it about three inches too short not sure what happened there but I absolutely had this brain fart so I end up having to glue that other strip on separate not a big deal in this composite construction still incredibly strong stiff and relatively sound proof now this is not a soundproof booth it is in my basement is relatively quiet I just need to have a wonderful dead space to record in so we stack all the walls that I put together here on top of each other and I got some old PC cases here that are just gonna provide some weight I have little outlet boxes that we're gonna do all the electrical in and of course they are deeper than a standard wall in your house now walls in my whisper room are only two inches thick so we need to cut them down and normally I would do that on a bandsaw but my bandsaw does not have enough height I just have a small bandsaw so I have to do this by hand not a big deal and so this gives me my boxes cut them down no biggie now for the electrical on everything is in one wall and the electrical is also in the ceiling for the dimmable LED I cut a little hole or drill a little hole here in the top unit and we're gonna end up using an extension cord and we're gonna hack that up and that's gonna be our plug or power for this unit I have this old craftsman Rotozip and I decided to use this because it was handy was in the garage I was too lazy to bust out the router I actually owned two routers and so I just use this Rotozip and worked really good this is a little toy basically so drop in the boxes here we'll drill some holes in between the two boxes the inside one and the outside power one you know want to make those things fit and there's the channel where the power is gonna run down you see the hole I drilled at the top there and we'll screw everything together you want to do all that routing and channeling before you put your sheathing on so you get that relatively easy so you can string your power through later on so here's the units with both sides of the sheathing they are of course glued together as well with the contact cement like we did on the other side while that stuff is just sort of drying overnight and setting up let's go back and work on the base so we're going to drop in a half inch MDF floor that's gonna make it nice to stand on something to be super hard and ultimately in the end we'll get some foam insulation I glue everything together here with some gorilla glue and we'll let that dry and let's cut out the top so this is the roof and I'm cutting a 2 inch by 2 inch 2 foot by 2 foot opening in the ceiling and it's gonna ultimately get a LED that is dimmable and so I raise the blade up into the plywood here to cut this out because I don't actually own a jigsaw so not the not the way you're supposed to use the table saw but certainly works just be really careful when you're doing something like this you raise the blade up into your wood move the saw in the wrong direction this speaker when you're doing it all right so let's cut out this hole get a little hacksaw blade here and openings gonna drop out try not to hit the dog when it falls on the floor yeah watch out okay so that's our hole this is our frame and this is the top sitting on the base actually right here use some gorilla glue want to seal everything up as much as we can make it as airtight as possible that also helps keep the sound from coming in the booth from the outside do the best I can to seal everything up as I'm going along so this is the opening you're looking at it upside down and you'll see it put together here a little bit I'd go through the screw everything together so let's do a little test fit of what we have there you can see the base made out of the two by fours with the one-inch floor that's recessed and then my two-inch styrofoam walls and you can see the electrical and the one on the left that's actually the wall that you will face when you do the recording put the roof on that is the hole where the lights going to go and you can get a little fly around here and see what the booth kind of is gonna look like ultimately there's gonna be a door where I walked in and out of and we'll build that at some point in the build as well I make them a little miscalculation on my electrical I can't go quite to the corner because the other wall gets attached there so I need to come back with my Rotozip and route out another opening here and this is where I'm gonna move the light switch to with the dimmer and drop in a box here as well and these are all little screw in boxes you can buy these at your big-box retailer this is for existing construction so you can put in boxes above or after you have your sheeting done I drop in a little gorilla glue here as well for the light and yes I am just permanently gluing in the LED into the ceiling of this thing I want to keep everything within my two inches if at all possible if I ever have to replace that out pot to take the whole thing apart I'm gonna drop in some styrofoam here as well and we'll make the cutout for the electrical box now the two-foot by two-foot LED panel has some thickness and here I basically route out all of this foam I hate doing this stuff I don't like foam it gets everywhere it's not good for the environment but it's something that I did here to make room for the LED you'll see how it all comes together a huge mess don't like it but did it anyway here again using that Rotozip back and forth to route out that's about a half inch something like that of space so that the styrofoam can go in and cover up that led and have some good insulation up there hopefully things don't get too hot yeah those flat panel LEDs they don't run very hot they stay pretty cool so hopefully it's gonna be good over the long term I'm not gonna have any issues there with that again contact cement on both sides of the styrofoam and on the plywood just to put everything together so it stays nice composite structure and here you can see why I had to route out the foam for the LED light panel this is the groove at the top of the wall where the power is gonna come out you can see the extension cord here that we cut up and we just snake through the opening that we left earlier so some pre-planning is required so my electrical outlets and here everything is kind of roughed in with the power switch on and off dims that LED and ultimately that's gonna go overhead so you can adjust the lighting let's put everything back together this is a little opening so we can snake the power out of the LED in the roof and that you can see that extension cord there so everything is gonna get plugged in you'll plug this hole whisper room in to half power on that wall and then we'll use the rest of the extension cord to come up and plug that into the ceiling unit and that will just lay on the very top now we do need to allow cables to come from the outside to the inside for the computer and the hard drive that's as far as I got this is what we're gonna cover in the next video and ultimately build the door it gets covered with some fabric on the outside and then the acoustic foam on the to give you a nice deadspace this is a massive build so look for part
