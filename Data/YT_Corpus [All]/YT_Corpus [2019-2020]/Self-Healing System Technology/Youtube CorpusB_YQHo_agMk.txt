 live from New York it's the Jews covering AWS global summit 2019 brought to you by Amazon Web Services welcome back here in New York City for the any of us summit I'm stupid my co-host is Cory Quinn and happy to welcome two guests from NetApp first my right welcome back to the program from another cloud show earlier this year you'll see Steffensen who's the CTO and vice president for cloud services and to his right while it's a first time on the program I actually was on one of his earlier podcast Jeff Dickey who's joined that up as the chief technologists inside that same cloud and data services group Jeff welcome and you'll see welcome back thank you feeling you okay so let's start with you so you know we've watched you know the cloud and data services you know from my words it's like almost I want a new brand it's like this is not the you know on tap everywhere you know best NFS you know the number one thing there it's you know it's about multi cloud it's about getting the value out of my data that transformation we've seen overall in what was known as the storage industry there are a lot of new people a lot of new products and you know it's the you know the and as I think there was one NetApp term is all of the history and the things you can trust but a lot of new things so give us the updates on what's exciting in your world yeah absolutely I mean of course we are still still relying on that old trusted on top and waffle store it's operating system in the backend but we have abstracted a lot of that into a more automation or you're consuming it in a more out of autonomous way we are actually taking all the storage snobs that the store that traditional stores are necessarily used to you know tweaking and all that that's all done and managed by us it's fully as a service and we are more focused on the data management capabilities off on top than the actual storage system or the performance of the store its operating system I mean we are in a very unique position as NASA I mean we have a very strong foothold in the enterprise and now we have integrated services with all the public clouds I mean fully native integrated services either going through their own console or or and their own their own api's or with our own UI so the data management capabilities that we are actually bringing to the table is you can seamlessly migrate from the core to the ads and to the cloud depending on where you want your data to decide so our goal is actually to do something very similar as kubernetes has done to the application layer they have made it completely mobile there is no longer that VM for math issues that we had in the old days it's basically just a kernel module I can move it wherever on top of a hypervisor of choice or a public cloud of choice but that has always been sort of left behind on some proprietary box sitting there but not happen like I said native is in this very unique position of being able to move migrate to replicate and split the data according to your strategy whether it's on-premise or the public cloud all right Jeff would love to give you your viewpoint is what you're hear from customers I've known you for many years talk about you know that that journey towards cloud and what is cloud and how does it fit into their customer environment so you know give us what what brought into NetApp and you know some of the conversations you're having as if you've been you know digging in with the net up team well the the coming to Ned app is actually a long story you know I've I've known the green cloud folks for a long time I think was the first kind of us partner of theirs and had been a big fan of their first there their cloud and then there's their software so I was really excited when the the data acquisition happened and you know for about a year I was learning like the stuff they were working on and that was blowing my mind and again I've worked with almost every storage company out there so it's exciting to like the the future of what was happening and then after the the acquisition of stack point which I was currently working with you know so it's like knit F could have took my two favorite companies in the short time so I said hey I want to be working on you guys you guys are doing the coolest stuff that I've seen right now and the road map is blowing my mind I want to I want to join so it's been it's been a great time here I think it's what's most unique what I found is the the typical when you're doing cloud consulting you go after the low-hanging fruit it's it's very simple strategy you know if you were to go to a customer and say let's take your highest demanding most revenue generating systems and we're going to migrate those to eight of us first well they're gonna look at the 10 million dollar contract and you know the two year engagements say no we're not going to do that you go for the low-hanging fruit but because of the products that have come out and what we're doing in the public clouds were you know for the first time we have in a fast you know like basically SLA performant file system in the cloud that can handle the the biggest baddest on-prem apps so now that we're able to do that so what customers are doing there they are now we're taking those those big ones and it's accelerating the whole journey to cloud because instead of creating more of a chasm between your public cloud infrastructure and your on-prem there's a lot of people you know will face it if you've got a 50 million dollar budget you're putting it mostly into cloud and some of your on friend which begins still rendering a lot of revenue is not getting the love it needs and it's not becoming cloudy thurr and you have this kind of chasm so I think it's great that you know with with the customers were working with or they're very excited to be moving what they thought they were never going to be able to move because just what's there and now they have native connections to all their the services they love like like you know here at AWS so it's just great because you know yes they're consolidating their data and you're having less silos but that's exciting but what excites me most is what are they gonna do next and after that what are the connects with that like as they learn how to use their data and connect more to cloud services and our cloud services and and the public cloud services they're gonna be able to do way more than they ever thought they would something that I think would resonate with a number of folks has been that I mean I go a little bit back a little older than I look although I wear it super well and I I cut my teeth on waffle and working with snapmirror and doing all kinds of interesting things with that it's easy to glance Walker on the expo hall and glance at and figure huh I see there's a NetApp booth you must still be trying to convince AWS to let you shove a filer into US East one it that's not really what your company does anymore in the traditional sense but I think a lot of people may have lost that message from a cloud perspective what is NetApp doing in 2019 so I mean we we are really really software focus so I mean we're doing a lot of work we are container izing that waffle operating system we're really excited about launching that that's alpha today that basically means lawson get an alpha an october that basically means that you could get all the on top data management queries on top of any storage the operating system on top at the top of any physical or persistent disks in any of these different public locks eps volumes google pd's or usher it's it's it's we wanted to make it make make make it so anybody can actually deploy on top we've already always had that story with on top select but being able to contain that I said I don't know if we can actually so we can actually reap the benefits of kubernetes when it comes to high availability ratification auto-scaling and self-healing capabilities to make it a much more robust scale-out as well as scale-up solution so that's that's truly our focus and our focus for 2019 is of course we've we've been really really busy with our heads down coding for a long long time or for a long time long very short time in NASA terms but in cloud terms very very long like for the last 18 months but now we're really sort of integrating our entire portfolio where we have monitoring deep analytics compliancy who beneath this storage providers schedulers so everything is sort of gelling together now so you know I think back a couple of years ago if you talk to Amazon the answer to everything was move everything to the public cloud yeah today Amazon at least admitted that hybrid cloud is a thing yes a hybrid necessarily but you know with the types of outposts and what their part doing with their partnership with with VMware and the like they're doing that when I look at customers most of them have multi cloud now when we say multi-cloud it means they have lots of clouds and whether or not they're tied together they're not doing that and while Amazon won't admit to it and isn't looking to manage in that environment they're playing in that because absolutely if I have lots of clouds one of them is likely AWS NetApp's it's at the intersection a lot of this you have your you know a huge install base inside the data center you're working very much with Amazon and the other cloud providers so I would have hoping to get from you is your your insight on customers you know where are they today what are they struggling with in that hybrid or multi cloud world and where do you see things with touring as we go the next couple of years well I mean the fact of the matter is 83% of all workloads still recite on premise whether it's uh well it's taste like that or doesn't I mean AWS is doing outpost Gugu is doing anthos assure is doing a sure stack and the good thing is we are actually playing with all of them we are collaborating on all these different projects both on the storage layer as well as on B's like application lifecycle management from our point of from our point of view it is really important that we start tying all the infrastructure related stuff into the application layer so you're actually managing everything from that layer and down so for a developer like me it's actually really simple to actually do all the tasks and completely manage my own solution of course I need operations to be managing the infrastructure but I should be oblivious to it as a developer and and and what we are actually seeing customers doing now more and more and it's actually really refreshing coming here to New York and meeting all these financial companies they have always been like probably the the slowest movers to the public cloud because of compliancy reasons and other stuff but they are actually really adopting it they have segmented up their workloads and really know what teams are allowed to provision and are supposed to be running in the public cloud in order to tap into the innovation that's happening there and what teams are only allowed to work on on-premise environments so you're so I mean it sort of relates into the true cloud concept the true cloud concept being everything is a cloud and there is no lock-in have the freedom of choice where to provision where to spin up your workloads so we're seeing that more and more from our customers yeah yeah Holly great yeah Jeff you know wonder if you could give a little bit more as he said you know net ups done quite a few acquisitions in the last couple of years what sort of things should people be you know thinking about NetApp that they might not have you know a couple years ago well you know I'll tell a quick story my first day as the dead up employee was at coop con in Seattle and I remember you know I was wearing that badge and I had a friend that I was I was partner with and he looks my bad didn't happen it's like like the the box in the closet people and just like well I mean not anymore you know and it that's I think that's the biggest meeting Network appliance those are known net up long enough no it's uh yeah it's now the internet application right now it's a little different so I think the big thing is you know you know it's not just a storage I mean storage is a key component that it's very important but that's that's not the only thing and I think on the cloud side it's it's very important because I don't you know we're still maintaining this relationship with with with our storage appliances and everything but we have more more buyers now so we can go across the company and say well what do what are you doing like are you NS re are you a developer lead or you know are you a VP of Operations like we have all these products that that work for them yet in the end it's a single vision to the deep insights of everything they're doing with us yeah so just a quick follow up on that so you know I think we've been net I bought a kubernetes company it was like okay I'm trying to understand how that fits when I look at net ups biggest partners I think you know VMware Cisco Red Hat all going heavily after software solutions including the kubernetes piece so yeah you know how does net up do differently because you still external partners yeah but I think I think we're in a strong place because you know now we're two things we're bringing the apps to the data and the data to the apps so it's where do you want to be there's there's the the right place for your app there's there's a lot of choice now and now we have you know now you can choose where is this gonna live best where is this going to operate where is this gonna you know serve our customers best what's going to be the the most cost effective you know being able to deploy and manage and it means you know type it a couple characters in and your entire production kubernetes deployment is backed up anywhere you want like there's just you know you know the apps are nothing without data the data is nothing without the app right so you know it's bringing those two together I think it's very important to kind of get up get out that's you know my job is getting that out that you know it's not storage silos this is about your apps what are you doing with it what do you what do you where do you want your apps and what is that data has the data helping your apps grow and you know we're helping people move forward and innovate faster with products I mean both both companies my company green cloud and stack point vomit we were really really early adopters of kubernetes and we've always taken a very both companies very application centric point of view on kubernetes well most everybody else has taken a very infrastructure centric approach we were to stuffed up companies just developers and we always sort of felt like because it's a very common misunderstanding that poopourri this was actually built for developers it wasn't it was a taste and infrastructure play built and developed by the Google a series to run code so everything that we were adding on top of it and beneath it it ties it all together so I mean for a developer working on our kubernetes offerings he's basically working in his own element he's just doing commits and magic happens in me in the background we tie we have we tie the development branch to a specific node pool we tie the staging parents' to another one and and the production environment once you commit that then it actually goes through like a necessary process where they are basically the gatekeepers where they actually either allow or or say we found the part for are not able to deploy this according to our standards so tying it all together all the way from the storage layer all the way up to the application layer is what we are all about and that and I got the same question when when we were required and we had when we were greeted we were in a really really good situation where we had term sheets from three different companies are not allowed to say which ones but everybody once I sold it to NASA they were like wine Manta but if you go to coupe con and you are always there there is a very live matrix on what the biggest problems are with kubernetes and persistent volume claims and storage and data management hasn't been solved yet and that's where we believe that we have a unique way of offering those data management capabilities all the way up the stack all right well yangtze and Jeff thank you so much for giving us the update there absolutely Cory Quinn I'm Stu minimun will be a cube con later this year in San Diego we're at Amazon reinvent always go to the cube dotnet to see all the shows there Pratt as well as you know hit the search and you know you could see these thousands of videos always no registration to be able to check that out so check all out all the interviews and as always thanks for watching the Q
