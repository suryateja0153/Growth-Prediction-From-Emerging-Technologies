 Softwarization of the network is possible due to Virtualization and NFV/SDN technologies. However, it's not about replacing hardware with software. Imagine a network that is data-driven, continiously extending its knowledge to behave more "intelligently". A network with no need for expensive hardware updates, as frequent software updates cover all. This enables rapid delivery of innovative and attractive services to customers and and a higher level of automation, leading to lower costs for the service provider. But how is it possible to manage VNFs provided by different vendors? This question may cause CSPs headaches. AI and machine learning is the right answer. The challenge is to choose the right VNF for the end-customer, as VNFs may have different characteristics. Fortunately, based on historical data, both AI and machine learning can discover which VNF is best for a given service. With this knowledge, up to date metrics and predicted benefits, it's finally possible to swap in runtime between different vendors' VNFs to optimize costs, performance and customer experience. All these automated network upgrades, reconfiguration processes, VNF hot swaps or capacity improvements may happen well in the background, so the end-customer won't even notice any impact on the way they use the services. AI machine learining should not only react to problems, but also proactively organize required network capacity and reconfigure services to prepare for changing demand. As a result, customers never experience any delays or disruptions! Comarch - your next vendor healing experience.
