 [Music] hello and welcome to innovation day digital resilient transformation first of all i want to thank all of you for joining this session in the morning sessions you would have gone through a lot of discussion covering various topics example [Music] digitizing data center powering data center the future of innovation we have looked at technology landscape and what the i.t landscape looks like a more futuristic discussion and intuitive industry and and many more this topic we are going to cover industry 4.0 and it ot convergence my name is nikhil patak i'm from schneider electric and i'm going to be moderating this panel and it's going to be very interesting discussion but before we start discussing different topics i would like us to take back a little bit uh in past and refresh and travel the path what humankind has taken while we had undergone the industrialization so let's start with what we call industry 1.0 industry 1.0 late 19th century we have looked at the use of steam engines and what it can get us as a part of the industrialized environment then we moved on to industry 2.0 in 20th century talking about mass production and more robust organized manufacturing processes which really helped us to produce at scale same century later part what we call an information era we started using a lot of information and i would call it industry t.o which provided us what we know as automation journey and that's where we started an automation journey come to industry 4.0 in today's presence era which is connecting iot with manufacturing processes and that's i would say a biggest technological transformation which we have seen when we talk about industrialization it's not about only manufacturing processes it's about the entire ecosystem in which we operate we have learned a lot about smart factories smart manufacturing we know about what we call a dark factories lights out in a factory right we talk about artificial intelligence machine learning self-healing processes and much more just thinking of how do we make this happen we are today just collecting so much of a data and analyzing it and all this data actually is being generated on a shop floor we are collecting it there and we are analyzing it which is helping us for some really good actionable insight it's providing us lots of intelligence and that data has so much of a power to drive what we call a huge transformation for industry 4.0 but not only and everything revolves around data there's there's much more beyond data i think we are looking at the enablers which is a entire ecosystem so now that's exactly the discussion we we know that the data is so important the industrial age is a big enabler for analyzing collecting this data and taking some actions but beyond that there's a whole ecosystem and i'll keep using this with ecosystem because that's most important when we talk about itot conversions right so that's the discussion which we are going to have it today we have a stellar panel stellar speakers with us each one of them having a very good experience over many years in this field of iot iiot and let me first introduce our panel i would like to introduce first john vicente he is chief technology officer as stratus technologies john is senior officer and chief architect at status technologies and he is defining and evangelizing the strategy at status with a focus on age and iiot then please welcome tripp parton chief technology officer for converge servers age and iot system at hewlett packard enterprise his primary responsibility is to drive technology strategies offer roadmap and partnership plan across business unit portfolio with a focus on age and iot last but not the least welcome jared campbell who is a director for strategic alliance marketing at aviva and as all of us know aviva is a global leader for industrial software jared has over 22 years of experience in applying and marketing industrial automation and software in different industry domains starting with semiconductor machinery oil and gas chemical power and infrastructure industry and he holds more than a dozen patents more than a dozen patents in the manufacturing and industrial automation fields so to all three of you thank you for joining this panel discussion so uh let me start with the first question and uh the question is for you john you have been pretty close to customer um your team is close to customer uh as as a part of the chief architect uh with industry 4.0 how would you see from a customer perspective how how they are evolving in defining their processes um the ecosystem uh customers demand uh to make um things happen once again right so uh just just your perspective uh if you want to kind of share with all of us first thank you nikhil for context i want to talk about my perception and vision of this transformation and then i want to give a perspective on the vantage point on the transformation from the customer's point of view and then specifically get into requirements on that transformation their requirements and that really depends on the customer and their uh current situation and so i want to really set up that context so i'll start with my first slide here in my view industry 4.0 and edge computing are somewhat synonymous and they're they're essentially headed to the same end state and that end state in my opinion is autonomous autonomous systems so if you think about that end state and look at where we are today i refer to that in this roadmap here if you will this is a high-level view of technology evolution for edge computing it's about connected we're in the secure managed and connected stage it's the beginning stages of convergence over the next few years we'll move more into open open software defined and eventually reach convergence where i refer to it that as 3.0 or real time and resilience so that's my view my perception of what this transformation look like looks like so with that in mind going to my next slide here stratus has developed what we call a maturity model for edge computing or the five eyes isolated informed insightful intelligent and visible and if you look at the bottom here in terms of technology evolution it maps somewhat to what i presented in that roadmap slide but this view is more from the vantage point of the customer customer adoption and readiness and as you look at different companies very similar to the it industry there is really a spectrum of adoption and readiness and maturity of these companies and customers are recognizing that so i think it's important as we start to look at customers understanding uh where they are in terms of this maturity is important both from a capability perspective uh as well as processes and i would say as well the human aspect so you see this evolution happening and this maturation process is important to understand where customers are and where they're headed to so without getting into more detail on what this table is showing what's important here is to understand the customer understand the journey that they're going to pursue and be able to map the technology and the evolution of technology and the capabilities necessary to their specific needs their use cases and what they value uh in in their environment thanks john i think a very very interesting perspective what what we started with uh after after hearing from you um that leads me to the next question and we talked about software um and the question is for jared software is a key enabler no doubt about it but what we would like to know is a play of software how and why in the solution architecture that we provide to our customer sure thanks so when we think about software in the industry 4.0 context i think it's important to think about a couple of things uh who needs access to the data what are you doing with the data and um you know are there any special requirements around time speed of execution data storage and security and so when we think about all of those things uh we at aviva look at the sort of the edge to enterprise story is what we call it which is we start at the machine and think about at the asset location what is the data we want to connect and collect to do we need to visualize it there do we need to make decisions at the machine or do we move that data up to maybe a higher architectural level in the control room where we're going to operate the the the overall plant or our facility we're going to analyze the data um and you know kind of the conventional idea of the control room is still there but now we're able to move some of that functionality i would say to a lower level closer to the machine where you can do advanced analytics embedded on edge devices give operators more visibility more knowledge about what's going on with the process and so we kind of have in the traditional plant sense the asset location in the control room that we look at but then above that we have this concept of of the enterprise which has traditionally been your i.t space not necessarily ot space and in the it space typically you've looked at things like you know reporting and dashboarding and and how the business is operating well what's happening in industry 4.0 is we're able to converge using cloud technology uh the data from the ot side and the i t side together in that inner price space and that opens the door for advanced analytics machine learning a lot of other tools that we've not had before the other thing it does is it breaks down silos so whereas before maybe an operator had knowledge of how his machine was working but he didn't really have visibility to how all the machines in all the different sites and locations that the company operates is working and whether his happens to be working similarly or differently from others and so by using software and converging it and ot data and building purpose built analysis operational tools and performance tools we can share data back and forth across the asset the control room and the enterprise layer in sort of this comprehensive edge to enterprise approach excellent uh jared i like the the reference of the use case what you you talked about and i also captured uh some some words uh breaking down silos cloud technology uh enterprise layer uh itot um and and that actually uh brings me to the core of the discussion and and the core of our topic and that's about it ot integration so um to trip uh the question is for you uh how are we making it work itu-ot integration yeah thanks nikhil and it was interesting so as jared was talking about software started to have flashbacks from earlier in my career when i was working in the software implementation space and specifically around erp systems so if you kind of think back right when erp systems first came out the problem they were solving is that back office financial accounting type systems were made up of a bunch of individual systems that each did their own job you had a general ledger system you had an accounts payable you had payroll you had accounts receivable these were all separate systems that all did very specific things and the challenge was they were all really centered around the same types of activities and so you had challenges with interoperability and challenge with groups working together and so what ended up happening was companies set back and looked at that problem and said you know if we start designing the software so that you have a common internal infrastructure a common data model even and i think in this case they centered it around like the chart of accounts right and used that as a way to bring all these individual systems together that was the birth of erp systems and then you saw the efficiencies and the insight that was gained by corporations to do their finances that way and to do their accounting that way and to be able to report to the street that way and have much more confidence because they took all these individualized systems and brought those together in a way sort of uniting the right factors behind the scenes with the data models and then allowing what used to be a bunch of independent systems to now work together and i still see this as sort of the same a paradigm that's now being uh tackled uh in the industrial areas is they have a bunch of individual systems you know there's a lot of technology in these industrial areas in factories on plant floors but each of these systems is really solving a specific problem and is built to sort of work on its own doesn't worry too much about what's happening to the left of it or to the right of it i mean if you even look at an assembly line as an example uh the assembly line is made up of a bunch of different vendors each doing individual tasks and it's really up to the designer of that full system to get the individual tasks in the correct order to actually accomplish everything needed to finish and create the widget that it is that you're creating right but none of those systems really interact with each other it's all a person that's sort of making all of this or people making all of this work together and i think if we kind of follow that example that we saw with erp systems and look to do the same sorts of integrations in the industrial side and leveraging iot and leveraging some i.t capabilities then we can look for the manufacturing side the related industrial utilities et cetera to have some of the same gains and successes and increase in insights that we saw you know in back office accounting and finance back when the erp systems first came out and it's not just on the software side right if you if you kind of look at it even on the hardware the way hardware was designed the way infrastructure architectures were designed moving from mainframe to client server type systems these were all done in a way to really embrace this unification on the software side that erp systems were bringing but also recognizing that in order to have the this many different types of users all on the same system each of them have different focuses there's different types of capabilities that are required they may need processing at different times of a month given whatever they're focusing on and so not just on the software side but on the hardware side changes were made to the design of the hardware to really optimize the way these erp systems would work and so as we're seeing new software players and new software packages being put together to really help drive some of these same types of advantages now for industrials and utilities and the like we're also going to see that on the hardware side and that's been something really that hpe has been focused on is we've really been taking our years of data center capabilities and understanding what works and the types of design changes and the types of optimizations that we've created um not only for optimization of the software packages we're working with but also for the manageability and the security of those systems but when you start to look at industrials or manufacturing or industrial iot type use cases you know how and where those get implemented is very different so we want to take those 20 to 30 years of expertise that hpe has created really optimizing the data center but then start making adjustments in terms of size weight power and temperature of the types of form factors that we take these capabilities and place them into so that they can be deployed in non-data center locations they can be deployed you know in closets in plants in non-data center environments where you don't have as much control over the temperature and the light and quite honestly maybe even directly on a shop floor directly next to the machine itself that it's interacting with because that's required based on security or latency or regulations or a number of other factors where you really need the right level of compute running the right software packages really right on the shop floor right next to some of the industrial equipment so that you can really optimize that environment and start to be able to take some of these same gains that erp systems brought to the back office 20 years ago and see some of those same effects now with our industrial customers uh thanks tripp that's uh that's a very interesting perspective what you provided so now um if uh i have to summarize uh of of these three questions and highlights what uh all three of you provided uh in in industry 4.0 perspective um the current state uh the requirement and the challenges what we see today and from there i would like to move on to our next topic uh which is more to do with ecosystem and uh i would say a collaborative i.t ot system because i think that's that's the foundation right i'm talking about collaborative system because that's a foundation on which we are building solution architect and this solution architect is is just to make sure that it covers end-to-end process and the delivers uh what is intended uh from the system um so uh the the topic is this it ot collaborative system what value uh it generates for our customer and uh the question is uh to you tripp again um while looking at uh interoperability i think that's that's the must for this collaborative i.t operative uh it ot system [Music] how can we get to the next level of competency and it's to do with the technology and also people so basically i'm talking about a full ecosystem you know nikhil i think that's that's really going to be an interesting challenge and the reason for that is a lot of the players that have been in this space so far are used to designing closed systems they're used to designing systems that are purpose built specifically for solving a specific problem you know i mentioned earlier when you talk about assembly lines and you've got the different stations that do very particular things and the same thing in this case right these are the players that were building these systems specifically for that purpose but a lot of times what happened was in order to sort of guard and maintain their market share they use very specific protocols they use very specific ways to communicate with their machinery so the way you would get into that to interact with that data to try to get access to that data was very restricted and very closed and quite honestly again this is not new for it this is something we saw 20 30 maybe even 40 years ago and if you remember some of the initial computer manufacturers where there was a weighing systems or a unisys or even some early ibm mainframes what you ran into is you had these powerful computer systems that were built but then all of the software was very specific very proprietary the operating system the way that worked the types of packages you could run on it you pretty much had to get everything from that same vendor and so now transition 20 or 30 years later with the advent of open systems within the it world moving to standards like x86 having just a very few operating systems and even those operating systems still for the most part run on the same common hardware infrastructure the same common chipset layouts so you have a much more robust and much more open operating environment to work from and so the ability now for these systems to interoperate for the ability for you to be able to start the sharing that it has developed over the last 20 or 30 years you're just starting to see that come into the industrial space and that's one of the reasons a lot of it players like an hpe and others have actually been able to move into the industrial iot space and start to bring in some of the advantages of open systems and this is actually something we've been hearing from our customers for a while now so i'll even use a use case that's not even specific to industrials so in talking to our telco and department of defense customers you know this that's another set of industries where it's very common for systems to be very specifically built just for that industry just for the types of use cases that they had whether it was telecommunication equipment uh things that get deployed out to towers or whether it's ruggedizing uh military recognizing ait equipment that the military could then take and use um on battlefield or in deployment type scenarios well what we started hearing back from those customers is while those systems are great and solve the problems they need to because everything is purpose-built the cost of the systems back to those customers is very high because they have to absorb all of the r and d that went into those systems and so just like that and that was really the case back when mainframes first came out and again those unisys and wang examples that i gave so now what happens when you move to an open standard where you've got many more vendors involved any more customers many more systems that can be built what happens is you start to then build a platform that can be leveraged not just for one use case or two use cases but for five for ten use cases and not just for one industry but five six seven eight nine industries and so what happens is the r d for those systems gets spread out across all those use cases and all those industries and all those customers and your overall cost base for that system goes down and we saw that happen in it you know over the last 20 or 25 years and now as as it are bringing some of these same open standards into industrials into the shop floor directly into plants and being able to not necessarily rip and replace a lot of these systems that are currently in place but being able to leverage new techniques to be able to interact with those systems you know leveraging the ability now that's the computer systems are robust enough to be able to interact with and interpret those different protocols translate that data start to get data into as common a format as possible and then allow those same kind of benefits of a common platform of a unified system of open standards to really come into play not only to allow you to get to the data that you normally wouldn't be able to get to but also to do that at a cost factor that's much more easy for these individualized plants and the way that they're used to buying and consuming capabilities and technology you know in an incremental solve a problem as you go type of a basis and so now these technologies can be put into cost factors that allow the plants to be able to do that now you know if i wanted to push the envelope a little bit i could say nirvana would be being able to get to a common data platform overall in a common data model if i go way back early in my career i worked for one of the three big credit bureaus here in the u.s with equifax but you also have transunion and experian and so even though those were competitors eventually what happened is that entire industry settled on a credit reporting data model that was common because even though they were competitors it became easier for the interoperability across all the customer sets for those three different competitors that really own the industry to come together on a data model i don't know if that's going to happen anytime soon in the industrials but at least getting to open standards on the hardware and getting software capabilities that allow you to take these disparate data sets and these disparate protocols and begin to bring those together together so that you can at least start maybe not as an industry creating a common data model but as an individual customer creating your own common data model you know those are really the keys to start to bring it and ot together and start to really drive value uh interesting interesting trip um that the question now is uh for jared and um i would like to go back to um the topic of software right uh once again key enabler uh jared would you like to highlight um from an alliance perspective and the software what's the value add that uh that gets to the customer um talking about once again alliances and software sure so i'm going to use an illustration here to to you know focus my point um what you see here on the screen is a diagram of software architecture that we put together for a water utility in the united states and what you can see here is that the utility is trying to bring together all of the different sites that they have to control the wastewater treatment the collections the water sources the power bring all of that data together they have different reporting requirements at different levels they have different access levels they have it integration with their customer database with um their gis information all of this has to come together so the first step in making this all work from a software standpoint is to have an ecosystem and trip mentioned the the open standards and the interoperability is the number one requirement so if everyone that's providing software in this space and there's no you know single provider here this is many different software providers that the water utility is using to accomplish this goal uh they have to be able to share data so that's first and foremost but then moving beyond just the ecosystem you start to think about alliances and partnerships where uh the different players in the ecosystem have come together and the reason we do that is to make life easier for the customer so in this particular example uh the customer wanted to buy our software but they needed some servers to run the software on in each of the locations like their wastewater treatment plant or their water treatment plant and it just so happens in this case that stratus and john servers were the servers they chose and one of the reasons they chose them is because we had worked together to test and validate that our software runs really well on the stratus technology servers and so when when that is done by the suppliers in advance it gives the customer the confidence that they can minimize their risk when they're they're trying to push the edge on their capabilities and the more things we as suppliers can do to streamline that to to really uh speed up the time to results and to minimize the the potential pitfalls that may come as they're deploying new technology that's only going to help the customer get to where they want to be faster so i see alliances as a way that we as suppliers can work together in the customer's best interest and make sure they get to the return on investment they expect as fast as possible so um so we looked at alliance and software what jared talked about uh and we are actually talking about an ecosystem as i mentioned earlier and that's most important uh for this transformation to happen or effective transformation to happen so uh john um a question is um for a system integrator who are as i might just say connecting the dots right we have um customers requirement we have hardware software alliance partners and then understanding customer requirement and creating a right solution and deploying it a complete process from a system integrator what full value they can bring it to end customer uh what are the key success factor uh which you may would like to highlight and maybe you if you want to kind of uh tell us about couple of use cases uh to strengthen um further uh what you're you're going to be talking about sure to kill uh i'm gonna i'm gonna tail off of what both trip and jared said with regards to solutions and i'm using a slide here jared talked about some joint work we did with aviva and it's really to highlight uh some of the key points that um both of my peers here have mentioned i think we're moving into a solutions era first of all and it's important that we understand that solutions are going to require partnerships uh an awareness of the customer's requirements and as well standards with that in mind they're gonna have to navigate quite a bit they're gonna broker they're gonna manage solutions that may cross over between cloud and edge require both i.t based solutions or technologies and ot hybrid solutions where the combined for example some of what we deliver with our zero touch platform is a hybrid platform providing both operational and traditional i.t technologies so in this example you see aviva and stratus with microsoft essentially delivering a complete end-to-end solution hardware and software ot and it cloud and edge and it's important to recognize that as we move to this next generation set of solutions standards are critical and there's a number of initiatives today that are driving standards across the board without getting into a whole lot of detail on on on which ones or promoting uh any specific ones the intent is that there's a recognition that this complexity that's coming forward will require interoperability and it will require more standard interfaces both hardware and software so these systems can come together so uh interesting insight um we looked at it i think two questions uh covering uh fundamental topics um for industry 4.0 the foundation the enablers and of course the ecosystem and and that's that's very that's very helpful uh we would like to continue the discussion as much as we can but we are running down the clock here and i have one last question and that question is same for all of you uh the question is more futuristic right if you have to think about one or two game changer uh in three to five years um what that would be and and you can you can do a prediction you can give your your opinion and i would like to start with jared uh and then john and then a trip uh one or two game changer what you see for industry 4.0 uh for three to five year in future sure nikhil well i'll be honest i wish we had three to five years to think about what we need to do right now right um in in the last earnings report uh last week the ceo of microsoft was quoted as saying we've seen two years worth of digital transformation in the past two months um you know the things that we've been thinking about were that were on the horizon things like lights out manufacturing um you know remote uh collaboration remote uh control of factories all of those things are being prioritized and there's an urgency to to move that roadmap to bring it in from three to five years out to three to five months out possibly so you know right now what i see and with our customers that we've been talking to is there's there's three key areas process people and technology we have to converge all of those and we have to think cloud first and ai enabled and as we do that we can start to realize more mobile and remote working environments more autonomous factories those types of things and so um you know i i think everyone knew that was on the roadmap what i think is happening is we're pulling in the event horizon to be much much closer than than i think most people expected sure actually i agree with uh most of what jared said if not all um what what i'm going to focus on more specifically are the technologies and there's several disruptors that i think are very important for us to look at especially in the industrial space you know certainly we are looking at a transition today where we're moving to be more customer-centric more data and insights oriented but fundamentally there's still infrastructure challenges that uh are going to create barriers and so when you look at uh technologies like virtualization and wireless specifically those are probably the key game changers in my mind which is basically taking virtualization based technologies you know traditional hypervisor based vm based containers microservices orchestration technologies those are powerful technologies that really haven't infiltrated industrial automation and control and the second is essentially uh unwiring the machines and there's an opportunity there to bring in some some of the emerging wi-fi 6g as well as 5g technologies on uh on the lte or more of the remote side so when when i look at those key technologies i think they're fundamental as we move to to uh an era of artificial intelligence we still need to address uh some challenges where i think there's still opportunity to uh to essentially match where the the industry has evolved to on the i.t side okay well with the benefit of going last on my predictions for three to five years i get to build off of what both the gentleman said just just now now i agree with both but i actually think they they played it a little safe so i think i want to push the envelope a little and and make a little bit of bolder uh predictions here and kind of shake things up at the end first and foremost i think we're going to see much much more i t type solutions and i t type hardware infrastructure and even its type protocols and standards making its way directly onto the shop floor more and more i think that's something that we're already starting to see accelerate and over the next three to five years i think it's going to be commonplace that companies may even shift from creating data centers and trying to connect to the factories to actually taking these newer edge capabilities that are being created that are robust enough that can run the same types of data sets and the same types of software that normally is reserved to the data center of the cloud and actually running them directly on the shop floor you know for hpe that's been a huge focus of ours and i think we're going to continue to see that to grow maybe 5 even 10x what it looks like today with the amount of it gear and of course the related software to go with that that'll go directly on the shop floors and one of the big drivers for that i think is going to be because you need systems that can support the growth in accelerators you know whether it's gpus whether it's fpgas i think the use of accelerators specifically to drive either heavy data related compute maybe machine learning and ai models but i think more specifically video analytics being able to use video analytics to help drive problem identification and quality assurance type use cases across the industrials i think is is going to be a huge growth uh and so because of that you're going to have way more i.t gear on the shop floor and you're going to have way more of that being driven by accelerators um you know i also agree with the the comment that was made earlier about autonomous lines and so i actually want to take that a step further and really push the envelope to say within the next three to five years i predict there'll be many many more autonomous lines on the shop floor in plants and in factories then we'll have autonomous cars i know all the talk's been about autonomous cars all these investment dollars going in all the platforms going in in the next three to five years you're going to see autonomous lines and factories leap frog that by leaps and bounds and actually being implemented and driving real values while autonomous cars will still be things that we're testing out in parking lots and finally to finish up i i think the something we really haven't talked about i think augmented reality is going to be something that moves from sci-fi or a gaming type of a technology and really makes its way into industrials uh into manufacturing and in utilities and in these types of industries and the reason for that is another problem that we're seeing is not just these data silos within these plants but it's the fact that you know there this is an aging population that are made that are working these jobs currently the next generation is never going to spend as much time 20 30 years of the same company maybe even the same plant working their way up from a line all the way to a supervisor so you've got an internal expertise gap that you're starting to develop and with some of these newer ar technologies you can now maybe have a few centralized experts as your role and so while you're balancing out the time it takes to roll out these new industrial iot capabilities to really automate the plants you're going to have a few of these resources that really have in-depth knowledge but you're able to leverage these ar technologies so that you can have a much more junior resource in a remote location that's directly in front of the machine or the area that's having the problem they're leveraging these augmented reality solutions so they're wearing the goggles of the glasses or the headgear or whatever they're looking at the problem that's instantly being back to the expert maybe they're even at home in a retired state getting paid just a little bit on the side they're able to see in real time diagnose interact draw directly on what the the end user is looking at and so that when they're looking at it in real time they're seeing the machine and they're seeing the notes and also potentially interacting live with that expert resource and so this is a case where ar technology is going to make its way from then you know the holodeck from star wars from star trek and really on to the shop floors to drive real values to help these our customers and these industries solve this aging workforce problem and so that's my third prediction is i think augmented reality is going to make a huge gain um you know in these areas so thank you um to all three of you on a very good perspective on um the game changer uh and i really liked it uh different views and um what what you people think so that that brings us to end of the discussion and i just want to go back from where we started uh industry 4.0 we referred to uh smart manufacturing smart factory machine learning artificial intelligence the self-healing process and much more and then we came on to the topic of the ecosystem because if we want everything to work the way we expect it to work um for industrial age managing the data and and the four end-to-end process i think uh the ecosystem is the most important and we have seen the different views from our steam panelists uh so um a very interesting insight um i would like to mention couple of things over here as as as we uh close our discussion that it is so important to create a perfect ecosystem uh it's not about only one thing and that's only about generating and managing data it's about a full enterprise the we've be managed the data a software layer it ot integration uh a right way of convergence and everyone has a role to play schneider electric is very uniquely positioned as a leader in this industry 4.0 helping the transformation helping our customer and we are working uh with our alliance partner like hewlett packard enterprise aviva uh the global leader industrial software and also uh completely like status technology uh and creating a right kind of ecosystem uh to provide and to generate value for our customer or to help our customer in their digital transformation journey uh i would like to thank all the panelists for a great insight that they provide us us and uh more importantly i would like to thank all of you uh for uh engaging us uh staying engaged during this interesting discussion uh for your patients i hope that the discussion what we had would have helped you with a lot of insight and i would uh kind of encourage you uh with your questions uh please do write to us uh we will come back to you all of you with answer for your specific questions and um any insights more insights you want uh we would be more than happy to help you uh and once again thank you uh for your engagement [Music] [Applause] you
