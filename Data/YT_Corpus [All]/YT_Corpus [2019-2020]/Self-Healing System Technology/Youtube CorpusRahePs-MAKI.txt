 they're sparkly and they're pretty and they come from the ground I have a really difficult time believing it when people say that crystals can heal or crystals have different powers hi I'm crystal and today we're gonna be investigating crystals not me crystal for like crystals crystals you know so I live in Los Angeles which means that there is no shortage of people who are obsessed with crystals like my friend Hannah hi I'm Hannah and I love crystals and I want to show you a couple of my absolute favorites these are my amethyst showers fluorite serpentine works geode and I have this little stash here that's all of our birth stones that's funny that's aquamarine this is rutilated quartz beautiful and then this malachite what does this remind you at home I have to buy it citrine yeah I love crystal so according to the internet the use of crystals and healing practices dates back around 6,000 years to ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia it's claimed that crystals can do things like stimulate the immune system help with memory and focus protect you from negative energy supposedly it can even do things like promote healthy sleep aid in digestion and alleviate fear and self-doubt basically there's a really long list of things that crystals can supposedly do but I wanted to know the truth do they actually offer legitimate health benefits or are they just another wacky wellness trend so to figure it out I decided to do a couple of things first I wanted to visit a crystal shop and speak to a crystals expert I grew up around crystals like it blows my mind that you can take a crystal and that just came right out of the earth like the Earth's treasures treasures yeah do you remember a hidden like loving rocks like collecting rocks I told you I failed geography geology I feel both of them but so like you don't actually believe that they have magical powers I don't think they're magical but I think you can't deny that they have energy because we use quartz to power so many things I don't rely on them for healing or like if I'm sick I'm not like let me just put a Coronel on my face you know I it's the crystal be heroes if I see a crystal and it's one that I can't stop thinking about it and I feel like there's some reason in my life and I probably need it I feel like that's a really good way to justify a shopping addiction but I'm not gambling okay at least like if I need to sell them I could sell them and the best part about crystals if you ever buy one nobody else will have that crystal it's the only one I am so ready to go in here hi crystal nice to meet you Hannah nice to meet you too welcome how did you get into crystals there was one day that I was standing in front of a quartz cluster that was floor-to-ceiling so it was literally a million dollars and my knees started to vibrate and I was so like bitter and jaded and I was like ah crystals don't do anything and then I had this genuine physical reaction and that's when I started to actually understand the healing powers of crystals I have to be honest I'm a natural-born critic I have a really difficult time believing it when people say that crystals can heal or crystals have energy or they have different powers but at the same time I also don't believe everyone is just illusion all you know it I know she don't use me as the example nothing that we sell nothing that we talk about should be in lieu of medical advice if you have a medical condition then seek a doctor like that's why doctors exist if we're talking about something metaphysical that's why crystals exist so you'd mentioned skepticism about crystals having energy that's science so that is why crystals were used in radios in watches Crystal's have something called piezo electricity which means that they hold a charge so there is science that proves that everything around us right now can hold a charge it's like Wi-Fi we can't see Wi-Fi we know it exists and we're affected by it in ways that we don't always know and it's really important for us to be aware of what's affecting us on a daily basis because the unseen exists and so being around the crystals it helps you remember to tune in to what's around you at all times when we do talk about specifically crystal healing people aren't saying I broke my leg and I'm going to hold a crystal up to it and it's going to heal my leg that's not what they're talking about right when it comes to the belief system in healing if something in you is broken you want to take certain care to that part which means that my awareness is going to the part of me that is in pain this is just a rock and so we put our intention in it it is not that I'm going to put this on my nightstand and hope that it magically works on its own with me not doing any work if I'm intending to help amplify my intention that is what people use crystals for it's about the relationship of us understanding what it is that we want to heal and this can help amplify the power of our thoughts I do believe that there is such like an extreme connection between the mind and the body what we think and feel really does affect our physical existence like if you talk to your plants in a loving way if you play your plant beautiful music it will flourish why would we think that a plant is more advanced than we are why would we think that a plant has more capability to respond to positive input than what we can we have all of the tools we don't need all of this exterior things it's very very helpful but our relationship with ourselves is by far the most important thing and having something physical next to me as a reminder is a wonderful way to kind of keep that personal accountability of am i living the life that I'm setting out to live it's what we put our focus on that has the most power and so crystals work in perfect alignment and what it is you're choosing to focus on and nothing in nature is an accident after all of this I still wanted to talk to a medical professional to find out what exactly is going on here and learn more about the power of intention setting I've learned and studied about metaphysics and spiritualism over the years various religions and I'm aware of the philosophy and idea that crystals possess a tremendous amount of dense energy and that the energy from crystals are supposed to help release more energy into the universe to create positive changes in one's life from everything that you know is that true this is an interesting discussion here so my ultimate thoughts are that crystals in and of themselves are unlikely to make a huge impact on someone's life or psychological functioning or mood we have to be very careful about not viewing them as superstitious objects I think that even people who practice the use of crystals in a spiritual manner don't necessarily view the crystal itself as the instrument as change but rather part of a larger spiritual practice I think that crystals have more of a place in metaphysics and spiritualism than they do in clinical psychology or scientific evidence it's not really anything to do with the crystal itself it's really just about conscious intention setting exactly but I'm curious to know kind of what's going on in our brains when we're focused on intention settings a lot of different regions of the brain light up when we're visualizing and using the ability to think about what we're trying to create and it starts to open up problem-solving centers of our brain that allow us to think about how we might obtain what it is that we're actually visualizing so it's like even though the crystal itself is not directly the cause of something happening the act of holding that crystal and believing that it will does actually cause a reaction in your brain yes I think prayer also works in very similar ways right the belief or the expectation that your prayers are going to be answered is doing something neuro chemically that makes us feel better but it's so interesting yes the exact mechanics of how this works and how this impacts our psychology is something we just don't have enough research or data on and after Hannah and I spoke with Cheryl at the Crystal areum she was kind enough to gift me this crystal it's called lepidolite and it's supposed to be very calming she said this she felt like I really needed this in my life right now and she suggested that I bring it home and use it to set some intentions place it under my pillow and see how it works for me let's try it and see how it goes so I'm sick I'm really rundown I'm traveling for work right now so I don't even get to be at home and I just got dumped after four years so I brought this little guy with me and I just really need you to heal me we'll see we'll see it just occurred to me that I have been traveling around California carrying a purple rock with me everywhere I go for quite a few days now I don't know what if anything I expected to happen but I did look up lepidolite today online and it said that it is a stone of transition and is meant to bring deep emotional healing so if nothing else clearly I ended up with the right crystal for this particular moment in my life so I decided to drive out to Palm Springs to visit some friends and family for the weekend and go on a little hike and I've just been trying to use this time to reflect and really think about what I want I don't know if it's the fresh air or the movement or the crystal but um I'm finally starting to feel a little bit better and just feel more in myself again so it's been about two weeks and while I am by no means healed from this life of people I do feel a lot better and I'm really finally starting to see that everything is gonna be okay and well I don't necessarily think that it's because of the crystal feeling it in my pocket every day I think has been a fantastic reminder to just be mindful and intentional with my thoughts and my decisions and just the way that I'm moving through the world and that in itself has been a significant game changer what do you think I think there were some really good points made about how there isn't much research and so I'm kind of right down the middle I don't know how to feel about it for me I just need to see it a little more concrete proof either way I think what I learned is that it's really more about intention setting and that it's about focusing your energy on the things that you want in life and working towards that and that if that's what you're doing and maybe using a beautiful crystal to help remind you to do that every day if that makes you happy and that works and you see positive results from that then I'm all for it and I think that's pretty cool if there are any other weird and wacky wellness trends that you want us to investigate and possibly debunk let us know in the comments below I feel like that moment about self-love was really special that's why I told my husband next time he opposes a purchase I'm gonna beg this makes me love myself ok touch your boss but before I love myself the more I can love you exactly
