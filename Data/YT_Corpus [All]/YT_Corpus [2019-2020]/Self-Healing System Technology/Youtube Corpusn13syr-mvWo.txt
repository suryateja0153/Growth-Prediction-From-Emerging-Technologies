 The water shortage is a great challenge for southwestern United States. Our research is focused on developing alternative water supplies using municipal wastewater, produce water and industrial wastewater also including the brackish groundwater. Right now we are at the Jacob hands wastewater treatment facility of Las Cruces. Here we're developing innovative treatment technologies to convert wastewater into drinking water. Basically, we are trying to treat our domestic wastewater the primary central domestic wastewater using an algal system. So in here we used species of algae called Galdieria sulphuraria. offer year so we are like out inland in a normal wastewater treatment plant the water has to go through a lot of processes in order to achieve the discharge standards but right now what we are trying to introduce the system just after the primary sedimentation tank directly we are trying to achieve the discharge standard with just one step this is so for this treatment facility that you see behind me is the uncle photobioreactor so it uses algae species to convert organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus into the biomass that is alkyl Palmas and then the algal biomass will be separated can be used to produce the bio energy and the fertilizer the water from Las Cruces wastewater treatment is discharged into the river but we can use this water for drinking then this will elevate the water shortage in the region this technology can have very proud applications one is for the potable water reuse. Another one can be used for the rural areas and small water systems because you know we can use algae treatments this is a low maintenance maintenance technologies low energy consumption it can even produce energy from the biofuel and the reverse osmosis and forward osmosis technologies we can fully automated them so that I think these technologies. If we can develop low cost low consumption robust technologies we can use it for small communities rural areas
