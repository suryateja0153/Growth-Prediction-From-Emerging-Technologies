 Hello, my name is Julian Lucek. I'm a Distinguished Systems Engineer at Juniper Networks. I'd like to talk to you today about fully-automated network self-healing with NorthStar and HealthBot. Let's have a look at how NorthStar and HealthBot work together to provide fully-automated network self-healing. Why does this matter? Well, normally identifying the position of a fault in the network can be very time-consuming, and during this time customer traffic can be adversely affected. Especially insidious are so-called grey failures. A grey failure is one in which a network element has neither completely failed nor is it completely healthy, it's somewhere in-between, and very often those types of grey failures are not detected by normal network protocols such as the IGPs or BFD. So, let's see how HealthBot and NorthStar help mitigate this situation. So, here we have HealthBot and we have NorthStar and here is your network, and HealthBot is a health monitoring system. It's capable of receiving a large amount of data from network elements pertaining to their status and error conditions and among other things, it's capable of detecting the existence of faults in the network. When HealthBot detects such a fault, for example, let's suppose it's detected  that there are some errors occurring on this link here, it automatically sends a REST API call to NorthStar requesting an immediate maintenance window on that faulty link. What that means is that NorthStar is triggered to automatically move away all of the LSPs that have been using that link, and so what that means is that the link is now drained of traffic and so the operator can then troubleshoot in the knowledge that they're not going to affect live data by their troubleshooting operations. For example, they might need to clean the fibre or change a pluggable optic. So, what's the benefit of all this? Well, NorthStar and HealthBot are working together to fully automate the detection and remediation of network faults. In fact, we're so confident in NorthStar's ability to help you that we encourage you to try it for yourself today. And if you want to learn more about NorthStar and HealthBot have a look at juniper.net.
