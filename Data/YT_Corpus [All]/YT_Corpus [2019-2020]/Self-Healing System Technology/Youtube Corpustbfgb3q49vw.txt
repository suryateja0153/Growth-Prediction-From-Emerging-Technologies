 well I feel I'm very lucky to be to spend 14 years of my career to be in the first hundred years of the Department history and was a very excited about the next number decades oh I can't go into together with department one not a hundred years it's very hard to follow Jen and Bill they give very exciting talk they already consumed my energy level so I'm going to speak about energy so I need to pump up a little bit I like to share with you about nanotechnology for energy and environment I remember when I applied to our department as a faculty the hire was on computational material science but the department didn't get any computation of material science in that year the department got a little Amy to Tony the faculty so I I feel a sense of very lucky so around the time I joined in the department my initial proposal wasn't that much into energy at all but I was a time in 2005 this is a big transition the Society recognized these are the problem we are seeing we need clean energy we also need to clean up the environment at the same time so I was thinking you know how do I do that how do I contribute so I was praying now even though I haven't done anything in these areas yet I move nearly full speed into energy in environment so fast food for for 14 years this is program we set up we work on solar welcome batteries well known catalysis air filtration and what of your tradition and so on but today let me just pick a few examples and really in the spirit bill just mentioned it's an error of engineering with materials diaper now very exciting opportunity first example I want to share with you is reinventing bare face with nanotechnology in the morning when the crack bearer was sharing with you the Moore's law of semiconductor industry the chip right and have you look at our everyday you know life the experience we have you all remember this the first is a mobile phone coming out is so big and then it's marching down so small a smaller size of course it's multiple technology going in there you know more powerful computer chip wireless communication but at the end of the day what's limiting the size of your phone another to the other batteries the first one is using lead a severe is so heavy right so this nickel can been coming in you can miss small in smaller phone but we see the opposite share in the last 15 years the phone is getting bigger and bigger this reason behind it you know you probably want a bigger screen but you wonder why it's actually also battery driving the size if you open a phone this is iPhone six-plus you see that big blob right there that's a big piece of batteries right it's much bigger than any part of the phone and you say one you know looks like for my iPhone 6 iPhone 11 right now the size doesn't change that much we have more computational power what of from outside doesn't change actually inside change you see the l-shape right there now Apple try to put in more abilities into the phone so we are really power hunger at this moment really power hunger I hope one day by the time I retire maybe the bear his size we're getting closer to the computer chip size that's the goal that's the goal by the time I retire so now you see nowadays you know batteries used in the mobile electronics in the drone in the electric car we are talking about this for the stationary storage this big industry driving behind this let me such to ask the question oh yeah before before I go into that let me mentioned a little bit of history so you all seen this a beer showing the Nobel Prize was finally given to the three gentlemen for developing the lithium-ion batteries by the way John Goodenough is 97 years old this year and stem eating ham our alum alumni from the department is 78 this study actually used to be for you to do a proceeding on National Academy no signs to show and having a little bit lithium you intake a little bit of lithium you can live longer I think this probably explained you can go for a long time you know Bettina William cherry me you know we are working on lithium batteries it's probably the only thing spread around the building I think the whole department can get much longer you know on average they will see so the connection right there of course Bob right there spin now you know a few novel very talented buddies didn't post up so when it's only faculty actually didn't know that his children Department at all this is all in retrospect well I'll tell you my version of the story so when I joined in faculty up to now we try to think about how do we adjust the Grand Challenges and energy storage areas the question we ask is how high energy bared his can go the energy density in a given size even weight how much more energy can you stop can you extend a battery life by three times or more instead of seven or ten years let's go for 30 years that's very important what about fast charging can we do within 10 minutes what's the fundamentals limiting this process can we made a bear he's completely safe once in a whi you see the battery catching fire an explosion what's the reason behind this can become a solution to solve that can reduce the cost by three times then how you bail at your car will completely fly you know low causing now how do we sense the battery inside health condition so we know the bear things are coming let's stop it and how do we do better we we use recycling and how do we do large-scale energy storage I mean these are the questions I think we're sending to material scientists with the great opportunities of coastal very very tough to solve so I didn't know enough so I transfer over 14 years so we work on all type of problem let me just pick one the first one we asked is how high energy dense the battery can go if you look back the history the Nobel prize-winning work is graphite intercalation is lithium by this lithium cobalt oxide is all this better occidentalis lithium so after about 28 years of commercial history of lithium-ion batteries we are seeing close to limit and graphite intercalate elysium can you use silicon to store lithium turned out to be in the 1980s will show that bob huggins paper the phase diagram indicate lithium and silicon can arrow together so when it's on in factory I didn't know this at all because I didn't work on batteries back in 2005 it just one day as such literature and symbols paper of lithium and silicon can arrow that sounds exciting that could be used for Barry I told my students then I started to work on this and also simply for the cathode I mean this is the frame wall of the castle three intercalation listen coming in and our reversibly but could you use a new material that can hold a lot more lithium such as sulfur very low cost we don't know how to do this we don't know how to do this we're yet so we all come back to to its new material if you can made a new materials to world we are willing it looking into energy density going from now about somewhere around 250 ml per kilo up to 500 maybe even about 600 we are talking about a bow and maybe triple of the energy density dangle well if you can make new materials to work but the problem it's really challenging right there for the past 28 years these hosts they were host material using yourself in the laptop the lessons learn is you know there's no chemical bond breaking but new material because so many lithium are coming in you're going to blow the chemical bonding house Adams moved to long distance complete structure change big volume expansion from less than 10 percent to 100 percent or even 400 percent volume expansion so we need to design the materials to take on those challenges to be reversible in and out over a thousand cycle a few thousand cycles so speaking of silicon now come back to silicon silicon was the first materials I pick and invoke with my students and silicon uptake 11 times more lithium compared to the graphite but a volume expansion is about 400 percent that's too much it cost mechanical breaking a cause instability of solid electrolyte interface so your battery life is very very short I started this project um this is of my first batch of white distilled and Candice Chen I also see another thing Isaac Davis shown in the audience right there maybe do is the first batch of student at how for I didn't know Stanford student cost so much by the way crack at the time so I had the four students I started to see financial pressure right away so these are this is certainly the pressure and publication and financial all come together so I didn't know all this but anyway fast forward we started to think about how do we come out a new solution for that and my training in in PhD and postdoc is from nanomaterials nano size and know how to mainly a no materials very well I told Candace I said let's make some silicon nanowires that probably can overcome the volume expansion and braking problem so we we did it and almost immediately we saw the effect right away so you can police them in you can take them out reversibly multiple times that really the lemma paper get my group going into the bed who feel now let's look at how challenge this problem is apparently this mechanical braking issue in a lot of mechanics thinking and we need a tool to study this at the time I know very little about mechanical property luckily we have beer Nick's in the department so I went up to talk to me I say beer what teach me a little bit about our mechanics so that's how I started to learn we use this technique Matt was the student development is technique who is now a faculty in Georgia attack I think he's in audience somewhere to really start to police him in and out of silicon in the same time just watching what's happening inside electron microscope we can put the particles right there lithium coming in electrons coming in we cool on I want to show you one of the in situ video this silicon nanowire has to emit about 200 nanometers we saw copper coating on the surface now leave them coming in you will be able to tell the silicon expansion is a lot this force is so strong it braids the surrounding coating but silicon you know a damn it is small enough it does not break it does not break but if you take a nanostructure silicon like the one in the middle this big one is about a hundred nanometer in diameter lithium coming in a lot of rhythm going in this particle is expanding and they subtle cumulate a lot of stress so after a while this particle cannot really you know hold on all of its materials and anymore then it's broken so this explained in the early days people try to make silicon to be usable as spare it but very very challenging if you have breaking happening materials loose electrical contact and then your batteries die the first time you charge it that's the conclusion you know in the past now using nano materials you could hold on these materials they don't break and also using a tanning like this we can identify what will be the political breaking size below the size silicon will not play anymore roughly about 150 nanometer for the nanoparticles so it's turn out to be providing a guideline for the whole industry to use how small particle size they would like to have in order to avoid breaking so now this has huge amending to the Hobart his industry people try to put silicon into the O'Berry electro so starting from generation one we have been through about you know twelve years now of a learning curve so we construct close you on the a no wires we do the whole off structure to relate relax the stream better and then we also know how to utilize the Hubble Warhol or structure to build stable solid electrolyte interface force this blue-collar silicon to expand to what's inside instead of going outside if you have expansion to what's outside even though it doesn't break but it's freezing organic you'll actually you never have a stable interface to build you know the sei layer so the batteries also died so we learned quite a bit in the past twelve years is now twelve generational design we have been through we are about to stop right there because this child generation I think is really getting close to solve all this material design principle right now and let the industry take our 2008 I found in my first company not knowing also how hard that is to a dual company in 2008 I found the Empress we raised about 150 million dollars by now but a lot of money too until nowadays well luckily we still survive we now have the Prada in on the market is a production line one in line to particular line to is produced right now in Freemont we have the highest energy density per visit in the world you know rechargeable and getting to about 431 per kilo and 1200 or 1300 watt per liter roughly 80% of the energy density of the current technology we deliver that product and the this is the air bass drum the Cypress s using our berries high energy and fly in the sky 25 days and no stopping during the day using solar cell to charge of the batteries during the night keep using the battery to power this Chong this elevation is very high 70 thousand feet very high elevation I'm glad to see now silicon finally make it into the real applications and not how industry is working hard try to use the silicon and a large scale of course still not easy you know going to industry you need to still solve many many challenges I don't have time to go into so what's an app to silicon and three years ago White House announced battery 500 consortium program it's try to make 500 watt per kilogram of the batteries Stanford has a partner institution in slag and Timo is a P&L we have a team of people right there and probably there's no a consultant doing better than ours we have two Nobel Prize winner as P I in in the consortium so try to adjust the Challenger 500 watt per kilo but in order to get that to work we have to look Handley tomato and now if you look all the way back to the Bob hugging stem we think helps time in the late 1960s to beginning of 1970s that was the time people try to make me tomato and know to work there's no host materials by 1980s there's a company coming up or lithium metal batteries sold commercially soon after that the battery catch a fire explosion taking took place so that the the company was closed and nobody there to touch lithium metal since then in a commercial space well we're running out of materials we need to look a little metal so now you state start to have these lithium platings stripping during the charging and discharging process how do we handle that make it reversible with high efficiency without going all this damn joy let's revisit that in this process - paper we wrote down we said Melissa metal what's the loop horses number one is high chemical reactivity number two is doing lithium plating you are creating this volume change in infinite in the relative sense it's infinite volume change right there going to a plating state where empty state so everyone mininum out per centimeter squirrel capacity unify micro lithium realistically you need 50 micron per layer of lithium in a plating stripping how do you handle the volume change these two couple together creating all the surrounding problem so we need to solve the root causes then we come an idea and 2013 steeps you come back to Stanford after stepping down from secretary energy position he and I talked about this we say we need to solve with a matter problem it's a few pricks are coming in particularly in 2016 we say why don't we learn from graphite where alpha is a host material to intercalate lithium ion we do want to have a host materials you can embed in metallic lithium in there so we construct City Hall on carbon hose graphene oxide hose so if your whole structure right there you put lithium metal in the volume is holding there you take leave them out it will not collapse back down you really hope you know holding that structure right there you overcome the volume expansion issue really holding there and then you can build stable interface so we show that in this true publication and also we also figure out you know the interface to control chemical reactivity is very important we come on number of different ideas to enable stable interface let me highlight one this is the collaboration research and ambough in chemical engineering turn out to be we can apply self-healing polymer very dynamic polymer in the interface so this dynamic polymer if we want to break this polymer it has hydrogen bond it can reform so what it means is we want to shut our lithium danja to play that poly miss at you very hard this polymer is flowable keep covering the lithium metal surface without expose the hot spot to the electrolyte so we saw quite a bit of improvement along this direction but we are not in the primetime yet to say we saw all the problem not yet we still have the next few decades we probably need to work very hard to uh solve this problem so a lot of all this material development you know my glue keep wondering I wondered myself you know lithium batteries has been commercialized but nobody have really seen a Tommy scale resolution of metallic lithium we know battery materials a lot of them are very fragile you put into TM they're gone you know beam damaged right away so about three years ago apparently you know we noticed the biology community structural biologists developed the choir um to solve the protein crystal structure that called my attention I talked to two of my student I say why don't we borrow this technique from biologists and develop that towards the battery materials so we started work on this yujeong again being that to graduate student your tongue is about to join in UCLA as a system professor I posted lithium and then crunch in liquid nitrogen you know the connection is really cold all the you know psych chemical reactions stopped at a temperature without exposed to air we tear up the quiet transfer and transfer into the TM something is not trivial to develop this technique even it took us awhile I always put his paper writer if you notice we submitted 2016 December 15 and get a separate 2017 September fourteenth nine months we will nine months first time I showed how much scale resolution imaging to people people wouldn't believe it is that you can get a Thomas scale resolution metabolism so it took us three runs of we will to premiere available we have seen the real thing now let me share with you first of all is the those tests like the lab table lab is the cranium image the top right those were the black color is ho doing right there that's because I'm the regulation if you zoom in you know that means your sample right away it's absolutely should we do the dose testing and indeed lithium metal it's very stable in a quiet condition you can do 10,000 electrons for angstrom square imaging before you see the obvious damaging so it's a about you know a thousand times more robust than the protein molecules and we confirm it's metallic lithium using eels and this is atomic scale resolution thanks to Bob's leadership bringing Titan to Stanford we have Titan we put purchase acquire holder we were able to see atomic scale resolution or lithium so not only that using cryo-em you know you from Jen's a presentation you have seen you know query is very powerful because you can stabilize very fragile materials using cryo-em we could solve but one of the long outstanding problem in the battery feel is about the solid electrolyte interface what's the inter facial structure this proposal is mosaic or the layer structure but nobody really have seen that so we were able to you know and the 1 electrolyte condition you can see a little mantle and this that 20 nanometers below the white color line that's the SGI so we see in organic particle embedded into amorphous matches Sung's like matrix model you know mosaic at i/o model but as soon as you put in electrolyte and it fluorinated happening we see the multi layer you see by layer one it's in organic coating in the outside using a tiny like this we were able to also a correlate this structure with electrochemical performance so this is cryo-em you know and in the past about fourteen years there's a lot going on at Stanford campus we have real church on in the department and we successful launch a very exciting initiative last week I consider that this is a gift to the department 400 years of birthday as a gift is launching this major initiative called storage acts and really and I serve as the co directors and this is the program try to bring in significant industry support to support each research group support graduate student having a very visible platform to put Stanford globally on the map of energy storage so piece the another reason to status is because for the battery research is opportunity for most lansky and time scale or for doing research for material scientists as well as for other engineering department to work together to solve a big problem for materials all the way to the system level we also have already critical mass and causing this multiple length scale so we feel like this is a great timing to do so I probably have a few minutes left let me just mention one small topic to you but a lot of fun that also in a sense is also engineering these materials is new type of textile I would never imagined when I join a faculty I will work on textile I thought this is very old technology really nothing there but enough to be that wasn't true this is in collaboration with genre funding in EE Department about four five years ago up high E and the department energy asked us this question and saying how do we say building energy consumption every year is we spend 13 percent of energy total energy consumption just for heating and cooling the building our air conditioning is set at 22 degrees Celsius in a summer time if we allow this air conditioners happen to go up windows time to go down we save a lot of energy every one degree Celsius change or save for me save 10% two degrees Celsius we say 20% if do is asking for K me to 2.5 Equis sources then we save 25% of the energy so now the question becomes instead of cooling and heating the building can be cool and heat individual person that will be very nice everybody's a carrier air conditioning on your body right but make sure it's very lightweight so then we say well how do we do that each person is about 100 watt of light bulb that's the power we consume so we have a few hundred light bulb right here you know giving our energy at this moment well let's look at the how we dissipate the heat below 30 degrees Celsius this you know gray color curve right there is radiation about 40 to 60 percent how we lose heat depends on radiation and in this convection coming in and it is evaporation if you are doing exercise having spec coming are evaporation will pick up by so in the office environment we really need to work on radiation but turn out to be in the textile field there's no many idea to work on radiation maybe you know one or two brand right they're not really working that way after I test a textile now it's not working where they are just doing this marketing only so but let's look at how do we do that let's look at cooling in the summertime we want to do cooling you want your infrared radiation to go out human body radiation is between 4 micron to 20 micron in our body temperature pick around 10 micron if you look at all the clothing everybody here you are wearing they are not transparent to the infrared radiation they are not good for this radiation cooling but can we find the right polymer that could do it we do have that polymer right at the bottom right guess what it's very low cost and everybody's kitchen is your kitchen wrap polyethylene and polypropylene if you look at its spectrum right there that green curve right there you only have very small absorption peak right there it's mostly transparent to human body infrared radiation what this polymer they are not valuable what's the biggest problem of the first problem you see they are also transparent to the visible light that's the biggest problem we need to solve first I mean don't think this is chilly it's not sugar because polyethylene is so in them well I learned all my photonics knowledge from Omicron Kazuma and Mike McGee when early days I join a faculty you know I didn't know much about photons so learning from these two I have a little bit of background after that in a later with junk way then we say well let's engineer nanopores into the polyethylene what turn out to be engineering yellow pores suddenly the idea is the pole size is a similar size as the visible wavelength can scatter all this whisper light infrared can still go through but polyester is very hard to process it's been out it took us a year to figure out how do we do that actually within a year we couldn't figure that out just one day I talk to my students about you now I said what this material exists in my lab this is just a battery separator all right this is polyethylene using the batteries separate Katherine and know to prevent shorting as porch and I said why don't you go measure the battery separator it's probably the coolest materials in the world so we did that and then you look at infrared lights till now about 90 percent transmittance but visible range home for 2.7 my clock is zero now it's opaque is why color by still transparent with IR and we measure how cool that is in a summer time in order to be the coolest you were nothing that's the coolest way that's a bearskin no nothing can beat bare skin but as soon as you put a quarter thin layer right there your temperature go up to 37 degrees Celsius to get skin temperature well nano PE go up to only 34 point three thirty four point three we have about 2.7 degree cooler than a quarter we say close to 30% of energy and building energy consumption so this is exciting then we asked what can we invent something that's even better we came very in the summertime you know and also wintertime and in California the temperature there are high so big between day and night let's do pi functional and we actually rented a Duma by functional clothing that is you change the Mesa Vista spy layer coating right there once I admit have high miss eva TR si has low emissivity so if you want to have cooling effect happening you let a high miss Eva T facing outside amid UI are a lot faster and then you want to do heating goes to the restroom and very ends aisle so you will go to heating we sure this is possible you can go up to about you know six degree seven degrees Celsius in that type of range of Delta I mean the best we can do public go to Nye and 10 degree cells is perfect for California one clothing during the day during the night you can all work so let me a my talk just views the summering summary slides it's now the lesson side learn is if you discover a problem you want to solve and you can sometimes come back to all the way to the materials you change the materials you're tuning you can adjust that problem this one was carried out by a big group of graduating and postdoc and many of them have gone out to become very successful and we're looking at the past hundred years the alumina we have I think this is this departments tradition very CLE clear very supportive to each other to students to college beauties will continue for the next hundred years a portal you will have a you don't need to do much to maintain this right we will just keep going yeah hopefully that's easy thank you very much [Applause]
