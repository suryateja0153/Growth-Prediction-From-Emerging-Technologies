 hey everybody adam savage here with a tool tip from my cave that starts with a story uh a couple of weeks ago i was milling something on my mill and it was made of steel and i was milling it at a fairly high rate and the chunks that were coming off were coming off blue that meant that the steel that was being carved off was being carved off with enough heat that it was actually heat coloring the swarf coming off my mill and one of those tiny little pieces when i turned away from the mill came around the side of my face and hit me in the eye uh i went to the eye doctor the next day she was able using the magnification slit thing that they have to see that there was still a little tiny piece of steel in my eye and it took three visits to get it all out now i am a lifelong maker uh and i am grateful that in 40 years of making stuff i have only had to visit the doctor twice because of my eyes but that makes me very very lucky and i don't like being lucky uh i like being smart and that is why today's tool tip is about goggles yes ladies and gentlemen i know you watch my videos and sometimes you think that i don't imply apply enough safety measures i totally get that and i hear you sure i get that i am here to tell you i am a goggle convert and it is time for everyone to wear some goggles and i've covered goggles on the channel before um but i've covered like exotic cool looking goggles weird goggles goggles that were props from science fiction shows these are my favorite consumer level goggles they're made by dewalt i love how light they are um i normally have three or four pairs around here but recently i lost them all it might have been during the savage build shoot or some other uh away shoot in which i packed up some safety gear so i've recently ordered a couple of new pairs of these dewalts and here are the things i like about them i like the polycarbonate lens uh it is relatively it's not scratch proof but it stays okay for a lot longer than many i really like how lightweight they are and i like this rubber seal so i wear heavy glasses which means that goggles can be a nightmare for me and these goggles if you look up close they fit my big glasses frames really really well and they're actually nice and comfortable because of their light weight it doesn't feel like something's pulling on my face and a low threshold to entry encourages use it encourages utilization so uh years ago when i played the saxophone uh my saxophone teacher said the moment you find a saxophone mouthpiece that works better for you than the one you currently have you should spend whatever it takes to buy that mouthpiece he was giving me an upgrade platform for a saxophone and he was explaining essentially that mouthpieces are so objective and so personal that the moment you find one that fits you you should jump on it now i'm here to say same thing about safety protection and specifically safety goggles if you have a pair that you don't like ask around find a pair you do like invest in it these by the way are 12 bucks these i you can spend more on other types of dewalt goggles we will link to this in the description but these are like 10 to 12 bucks that that is worth investing in trying them out to see if they work for you uh the other thing i do with these when i'm not using them they go in a dust-proof cabinet so that when i pull them out i don't have to clean them off or scrape some dust on the lens i think that's all demoralizing i plan to do today about goggles wear your goggles your glasses aren't quite enough i am here to tell you and every eye doctor you've ever met has seen some of the worst things you can possibly imagine things that you can no longer see yeah yeah okay uh hey wear your goggles uh these are my favorites your mileage may vary if you have a pair that fit your weird specific type of face or eyes or glasses i'd love to know about it in the comments spread the word help others discover the safety procedures that you use to keep you safe thank you guys for joining me for this quick and dirty tool tip i will see you next time
