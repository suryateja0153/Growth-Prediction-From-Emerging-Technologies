 Hi Hi, welcome to Home Wisdom This video is about Xiaomi anti dust mites vacuum cleaner CM800 review Let's talk about dust mites first We may have heard about mites for ages and the species found around us are house dust mites Even on the cleanest looking bed might have dust mites House dust mites cannot be seen by naked eye They survive by consuming flakes of dead skin fall off human and pet bodies It can cause allergic reactions and cause asthma The worst case is it burrows and lay eggs under our outer skin and cause scabies Nowadays there are many choices of anti dust mites vacuum cleaner that comes with varieties of features Following are some key points on choosing anti dust mites vacuum cleaner UV-C light and hot steam radiation can kill mites altogether with their eggs Please note that ultraviolet light has to be UV-C type The smaller the gap between nozzle and cleaning surface gives optimal suction performance High frequency tapping is crucial, it can loosen the mites from fabric fiber Some type of vacuum cleaner use hard brush for it Even dead mites that are remained inside bed release enzyme which cause allergies and asthma The most effective way to exterminate dust mites is to suck them up Therefore the most important feature in a vacuum cleaner is the suction power Next, let's see what features offered by Xiaomi CM800 Just like other products by Deerma, the body is made of ABS plastics with glossy finish I like the simple yet elegant design There is only one button to operate the vacuum cleaner On both sides there are the exhaust holes There are four wheels to support the maneuver and the front ones activate the UV-C light and this is the beating pad The reason that made me curious on this vacuum cleaner is it produces up to 50°C hot air from here Basically the mechanism and the body design is fairly simple, the filtration uses HEPA filter The dust box is located beneath, there is a note written to remind us to install HEPA filter before attaching to the body Dust is sucked here through this flap and filtered out This HEPA filter has the same texture with the one on Deerma DX700 only without extra filtration layer Make sure the circle of HEPA filter face the machine upon installation The provided plug is JP type with 4.5 meters length cable The front shape has the same width as the UV-C light hole, it helps knowing the exact position of the light Without that little detail there will be some areas missed by the UV-C light There is an indicator light which shows the UV-C light activity status According to some research, not all types of UV light kill dust mites only UV-C light kills dust mites and CM800 is equipped with it For optimal results, we must expose all areas with UV-C light slowly and don't forget CM800 release up to 50°C hot air Cleaned area will feel like sun-dried Note that it has an auto shutoff system when overheat After 20 minutes of usage the suction power will reduce significantly and will be back again after put to rest for half an hour The cleaning process is easy Wipe the body with dry micro fiber cloth We can clean dust box and HEPA filter under running water or simply wipe the dust box with micro fiber cloth then clean the filter with tiny brush provided in the package As you can see there is so much dirt even though I only clean a single size bed This is my review of Xiaomi Deerma CM800 Some specifications will be shown on screen In conclusion all the features of CM800 are good The downside of it is the auto shut off system that makes cleaning large areas less ideal as the time consumed to wait for the machine to cool off However it is ideal to clean small area or single bed dorm especially when the room is lack of sunlight In other hand it has strong points on suction power and tapping frequency compared to other vacuum cleaner and those two are the main aspects when choosing anti dust mites vacuum cleaner That's all for this review, I hope this video is helpful Please kindly like this video and don't forget to subscribe
