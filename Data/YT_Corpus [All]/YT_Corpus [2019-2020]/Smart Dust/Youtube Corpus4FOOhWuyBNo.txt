 Hi there guys Bernie here from Marcrist  today we are talking about dust management so what is dust what does basically is silica crystals within a material you're cutting so concrete porcelain marble whichever these crystals can get ingested into the lungs and then cause silicosis which is very detrimental to your health so we've come up with some solutions to aid the dust removal and to negate the risks while ever using the Marcrist dust management systems the operator the user should always still be wearing his PPE so whichever environment you are working in so hard hat safety goggles mask ear defenders and a pair of gloves just go look at the CRDC125-T dust management guard so with this guard primarily it's for mortar raking can use it for other diamond cutting as well so we'll just have a quick run through the guard so what do you get you see if you look at the guard you'll see nice clear case so you can always see what you cut you - where you going at all times so first you can see depth control on the back we've got the mounting plate so you can mount it onto the angle grinder and they're just the boss size to fit your make up angle grinder also we've got the guide for when cutting so you were just the guide left or right to get the blades into line and you can follow wherever you're guarding also we've got 360 degree swivel port so connecting you're in plus back onto the port and away you go ok so we're back now with the mounting of the CRDC125-T onto the angle grinder for reference we are mounting this onto a Bosch GWS7115 240 volt machine okay so when it comes down to fitting the CRDC125-T you'll notice we've got it fitted on the angle grinder you can see we've got the base plate the expansion ring on to the black boss there so all you need to do is select whichever ring type you need mount it onto the grinder tighten up the two screws behind the plate tighten it all down so it's it's lovely onto the boss okay now we've installed the back plate all we need to do now is put the back plate and the dust management you want it together all we do push down lock in then use the thumb screw tighten it down onto the guard and just nip it tight there we go don't take it over insert the secondary one so there we go we've got two mounting points onto the rear base plate nice and tight nice and secure okay so the next phase now the guards nice and tight it's ready to rock and roll so all we need to do we need to add the standard flange which comes with the angle grinder locate it onto the shaft then which is very important we need to add the extension flange which comes in the kit like so please ensure you use this flange at all times if you don't you will damage the guard when it's in use the extension flange just lifts the blade away from the dust management guard and with no problem at all next then we need to insert the blade remember 22 point two millimeter bore size for the whichever item you was in ensure the blaze mounted in the correct direction then second we need to add the client has left it over little tight inside obviously we've got a six millimeter mortar aching blade on there just snip that down so it's nice and tight at the lock insert the pin spanner alright so make sure it's nice and tight and then you're ready to go okay so the next problem we're going to look at is the VR750 twin motor raking blade from Marcrist so now we're going to have a look at the side profile of the VR750 and compare it to the standard MR350 you'll notice with the MR350 millimeter segment thickness there you'll see it takes all the mortar away yet one pass no problem takes up the full volume of mortar out of the joint no problem issue with this is over time the grinder gets tired the bearings get warm because the blades are thicker and it's just maximum power on the angle grinder at all times compare that to the VR750 twin blades you'll see much less material being removed so each blade completely thin compared to the MR350 so again less power less dust less pressure on the angle grinder and less fatigue to the operator as well okay let's look at some more features with a VR750 so we said before twin blade system so what does that mean so compared with the normal mortar raker for the thickness of the joint with the VR750 is actually three blades for the price of one so how does it work so if we lift off the top blade you'll see there's a locking flange in the middle when you buy the kit you also get two other locking flanges in the kit get a 5 mil a 6 mil and then also the 8 mil for the 8 mil joints there so I can say before three blades for the price of once all three thicknesses so no matter which property you're going to if it's a modern property and all the property you've always got the solution for the job in hand okay so one final feature we're going to be looking at with the VR 750 is the core protection so what I mean by the core is the blade core so you'll see with the VR750 we actually have diamond protection so what is the difference between that and say the MR750 which is a tungsten carbide protection is a question we always get asked so with the VR750 you'll see the protection is actually part of the cutting segment as well so as well as protecting it's also cutting this gives its extreme speed while cutting and keeps the blades nice and straight obviously as we know with mortar it's very abrasive and very aggressive and each sort of it would eat away at the blade core if there was no protection there if we compare that to tungsten carbide you'll see with a standard mortar  raking blade the segment's to the ground in the cutting then the tops and protection is much narrower on this on this blade so all the doing all the tungsten protection is doing is protecting the blade core it doesn't have any effects while cutting okay in this video we're going to be fitting the VR750 twin mortar raking blade from Marcrist into the CRDC125-T guard okay the first step once again we need to add the extension flange onto the grinder okay the next step we need to add one of the flanges into the center of the VR 750 blades so either the 5 the six or the eight millimeter flange so obviously for whichever width you cut in add the correct flange appropriate to the width you cut in so for this one we're going to do the five mil so locate the 5 mil into the grilles add the top weighed like so press down and lock together slide the blades in and just locate them onto the flange okay the next phase we just need to add the knots let's lift it through the guard lock it into place rotate it down like so use the spindle lock make sure the blades are sitting nice and tight there we can see nice and tight put the cutting guard depth glass back and locate down now we're going to add at the VR750 blades to the machine once again but this time we're going to be used the 8 millimeter flange with the eight millimeter flange we have to fit the base slightly slightly different to the 5 millimeter flange okay so the first step we need to add the flange on to the bottom blade ensuring it's in position like so now we just up the first flange slide it over drop it onto the flange ensuring it's tight down like so okay now we've added the bottom blade now we need to add the top blade so we have to slide this in throw the guard open over the the flange a little bit of juggling to drop it into position like so sometimes it just moves out okay guys we've added the top blade we made sure everything's secure and everything's aligned now we just need to add the top flange this time we're going to be putting the top flange into the grinding position so face down like so so we slide it in a little bit fiddly once again for it's okay slide it in position rotate it down once again use the spindle lock and the pin spanner lock it into position there we go slide the guard up lock it down into position
