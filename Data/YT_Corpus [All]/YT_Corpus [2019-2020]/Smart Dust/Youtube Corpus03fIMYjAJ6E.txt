 a mobile device or handheld computer is a computing device small enough to hold and operate in the hand typically any handheld computer device will have an LCD flat screen interface providing a touchscreen interface with digital buttons and keyboard or physical buttons along with a physical keyboard many such devices can connect to the Internet and interconnect with other devices such as car entertainment systems or headsets via Wi-Fi Bluetooth cellular networks or Near Field Communication NFC integrated cameras digital media players the ability to place and receive telephone calls video games and Global Positioning System GPS capabilities are common power is typically provided by a lithium battery mobile devices may run mobile operating systems that allow third party apps specialized for said capabilities to be installed and run early smartphones were joined in the late 2000s by larger but otherwise essentially the same tablets input and output is now usually via a touchscreen interface phones tablets and personal digital assistants may provide much of the functionality of a laptop desktop computer but more conveniently in addition to exclusive features enterprise digital assistants can provide additional business functionality such as integrated data capture via barcode rfid and smart card readers by 2010 mobile devices often contain senses such as accelerometers magnetometers and gyroscopes allowing detection of orientation and motion mobile devices may provide biometric user authentication such as face recognition or fingerprint recognition major global manufacturers of mobile devices include Apple Samsung Sony Google HTC LG and Motorola Mobility topic characteristics device mobility can be viewed in the context of several dimensions physical dimensions and weight whether or not the device is mobile or some kind of host to which it is attached to is mobile what kind of host devices can be bound up how devices are attached to a host when the mobility occur strictly speaking many so-called mobile devices are not mobile it is the host that is mobile ie a mobile human host carries a non mobile smartphone device an example of a true mobile computing device where the device itself is mobile is a robot another example is an autonomous vehicle there are three basic ways mobile devices can be physically bound to mobile hosts accompanied surface mounted or embedded into the fabric of the host eg an embedded controller embedded in a host device accompanied refers to an object being loosely bound and accompanying a mobile host eg a smartphone can be carried in a bag or pocket but can easily be misplaced hence mobile hosts with embedded devices such as an autonomous vehicle can appear larger than pocket-sized as stated earlier the most common size of mobile computing device is pocket-sized that can be handheld but other sizes for mobile devices exist to mark wiser known as the father of ubiquitous computing computing everywhere referred to device sizes that are tab sized pad and board sized wear tabs are defined as accompanied or wearable centimeter sized devices eg smartphones and pads are defined as handheld decimeter sized devices eg laptops if one changes the form of the mobile devices in terms of being non planar one can also have skin devices and tiny dust sized devices dust refers to miniaturized devices without direct HCI interfaces each micro electromechanical systems MEMS ranging from nanometers through micrometers to millimeters see also smart dust skin fabrics based upon light-emitting and conductive polymers and organic computer devices these can be formed into more flexible non planar display surfaces and products such as clothes and curtains seola display also see smart device although mobility is often regarded as synonymous with having wireless connectivity these terms are different not all network access by mobile users applications and devices need be via wireless networks and vice versa wireless access devices can be static and mobile users can move in between wired and wireless hotspots such as in internet cafes some mobile devices can be used as mobile Internet devices to access the Internet while moving but they do not need to do this and many phone functions or applications are still operational even while disconnected to the Internet what makes the mobile device unique compared to other technologies is the inherent flexibility in the hardware and also the software flexible applications include video chat web browsing payment systems and FC audio recording etc as mobile devices become ubiquitous there will be a proliferation of services which include the use of the cloud although a common form of mobile device a smartphone has a display another perhaps even more common form of smart computing device the smart card eg used as a bank card or travel card does not have a display this mobile device often has a CPU and memory but needs to connect or be inserted into a reader in order to display its internal data or state topic types there are many kinds of mobile devices designed for different applications this includes mobile computers mobile internet devices tablets smartphones laptops wearable computers calculator watches Smart porches head-mounted displays personal digital assistants enterprise digital assistants graphing calculators handheld game consoles portable media players calculators ultra mobile pcs digital media player digital still cameras DSC digital video cameras DVC or digital camcorders feature phones pagers personal navigation devices P and D smart cards topic uses handheld devices have become ruggedized for use in mobile field management uses include digitizing notes sending and receiving invoices asset management recording signatures managing parts and scanning barcodes in 2009 developments in mobile collaboration systems enabled the use of handheld devices that combine video audio and on-screen drawing capabilities to enable multi-party conferencing in real time independent of location handheld computers are available in a variety of form factors including smart phones on the low end handheld PDAs ultra mobile PCs and tablet PCs palm OS Weber's users can watch television through internet by IPTV on some mobile devices mobile television receivers have existed since the 1960s and in the 21st century mobile phone providers began making television available on cellular phones in the 2010s mobile devices can sync and share many data despite the distance or specifications of said devices in the medical field mobile devices are quickly becoming essential tools for accessing clean information such as drugs treatment even medical calculation due to the popularity of mobile gaming the gambling industry started offering casino games on mobile devices which in turn lead to inclusion of these devices in anti Hazzard legislature as devices that could potentially be used in illegal gambling other potentially illegal activities might include the use of mobile devices in distributing child pornography and the legal sex industry use of mobile apps and hardware to promote its activities as well as the possibility of using mobile devices to perform trans-border services which are all issues that need to be regulated in the military mobile devices have created new opportunities for the Armed Forces to deliver training and educational materials to soldiers regardless of where they are stationed topic see also converge device html5 in mobile
