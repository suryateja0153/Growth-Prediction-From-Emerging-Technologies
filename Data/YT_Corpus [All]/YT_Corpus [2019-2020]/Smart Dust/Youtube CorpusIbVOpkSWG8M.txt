 measurement and signature intelligence mas int is a technical branch of intelligence gathering which serves to detect track identify or describe the signatures distinctive characteristics of fixed or dynamic target sources this often includes radar intelligence acoustic intelligence nuclear intelligence and chemical and biological intelligence ma si and T is defined as scientific and technical intelligence derived from the analysis of data obtained from sensing instruments for the purpose of identifying any distinctive features associated with the source emitter or sender to facilitate the latter's measurement and identification ma si and T may have aspects of intelligence analysis management since certain aspects of ma SI and t such as the analysis of electromagnetic radiation received by signals intelligence are more of an analysis technique than a collection method some ma si and T techniques require purpose-built sensors ma si and T was recognized by the United States Department of Defense as an intelligence discipline in 1986 ma si and T as technically derived intelligence that when collected processed and analyzed by dedicated mas int systems results in intelligence that detects and classifies targets and identifies or describes signatures distinctive characteristics of fixed or dynamic target sources in addition to ma si and T I meant and human can subsequently be used to track or more precisely classify targets identified through the intelligence process while traditional I meant and SIGINT are not considered to be mas int efforts images and signals from other intelligence gathering processes can be further examined through the mas int discipline such as determining the depth of buried assets in imagery gathered through the I meant process William K Moore described the discipline mas int looks at every intelligence indicator with new eyes and makes available new indicators as well it measures and identifies battlespace entities via multiple means that are difficult to spoof and it provides intelligence that confirms the more traditional sources but as also robust enough to stand with spectrometry to differentiate between paint and foliage or recognizing radar decoys because the signal lacks unintentional characteristics of the real radar system at the same time it can detect things that other sensors cannot sense or sometimes it can be the first sensor to recognize a potentially critical data it can be difficult to draw a line between tactical sensors and strategic mas int sensors indeed the same sensor may be used tactically or strategically in a tactical role a submarine might use acoustic sensors active and passive sonar to close in on a target or get away from a pursuer those same passive sonars may be used by a submarine operating stealthily in a foreign harbour to characterize the signature of a new submarine type ma si and T and technical intelligence tension can overlap a good distinction is that a technical intelligence analyst often has possession of a piece of enemy equipment such as an artillery round which can be evaluated in a laboratory ma si and t even ma si and team materials intelligence has to infer things about an object that it can only sense remotely mas int electoral optical and radar sensors could determine the muzzle velocity of the shell ma s int chemical and spectroscopic sensors could determine its propellant the two disciplines are complimentary consider that the technical intelligence analyst may not have the artillery piece to fire the round on a test range while the mas int analyst has multispectral recordings of it being used in the field as with many intelligence disciplines it can be a challenge to integrate the technologies into the active services so they can be used by war fighters topic understanding measurement and signature in the context of mas int measurement relates to the finite metric parameters of target's signature covers the distinctive features of phenomena equipment or objects as they are sensed by the collection instruments the signature is used to recognize the phenomenon the equipment or object once its distinctive features are detected mas int measurement searches for differences from known norms and characterizes the signatures of new phenomena for example the first time a new rocket fuel exhaust is measured it would be a deviation from a norm when the properties of that exhaust are measured such as its thermal energy spectral analysis of its light ie spectrometry etc those properties become a new signature in the MAS int database ma si and T has been described as a non-literal discipline it feeds on a target unintended emissive byproducts or trails the spectral chemical or RF emissions and object leaves behind these trails form distinctive signatures which can be exploited as reliable discriminators to characterize specific events or disclose hidden targets while there are specialized ma si and T sensors much of the mas int discipline involves analysis of information from other sensors for example a sensor may provide information on a radar beam collected as part of electronics intelligence e Li NT gathering mission incidental characteristics recorded such as the spillover of the main beam side lobes or the interference its transmitter produces would come under ma s int ma s int specialists themselves struggle with providing simple explanations of their field one attempt calls it that si si of the intelligence community in imitation of the television series si si crime scene investigation this emphasizes how mas int depends on a great many Sciences to interpret data another possible definition calls it astronomy except for the direction of view the illusion here is to observe a astronomy being a set of techniques that do remote sensing looking away from the earth contrasted with how mas int employs remote sensing looking toward the earth astronomers make observations in multiple electromagnetic spectra ranging through radio waves infrared visible and ultraviolet light into the x-ray spectrum and beyond they correlate these multi spectral observations and create hybrid often false color images to give a visual representation of wavelength and energy but much of their detailed information is more likely a graph of such things as intensity and wavelength vs. viewing angle topic national and multinational there has been work on developing standardized mas int terminology and architecture in NATO other work addresses the disappointments of non cooperative target recognition for this function infrared beacons infrared mas int proved disappointing but millimeter wave recognition shows more promise still cooperative network based position exchange may be crucial in preventing fratricide the bottom line is that mas int cannot identify who is inside a tank or aircraft of interest numerous countries produce their own into submarine warfare sensors such as hydrophones active sonar magnetic anomaly detectors and other hydrographic sensors that are frequently considered to ordinary to be called mas int topic China China is not reported to be pursuing the more specialized mas int technologies although it does produce it to end to submarine censors topic Germany following the first successful launch on December 19 2006 about a year after the intended launch date further satellites were launched at roughly six-month intervals and the entire system of this five satellites are loop a synthetic aperture radar constellation achieved full operational readiness on the 22nd of July 2008 topic Italy Italy and France are cooperating on the deployment of the dual use Orfeo civilian and military satellite system Orfeo as a dual use civilian and military earth observation satellite network developed jointly between France and Italy Italy is developing the cosmos kimdax band polarimetric synthetic aperture radar to fly on two of the satellites topic Russia Russia does have non-imaging infrared satellites to detect missile launches Russia produces of course a wide range of n2 submarine warfare sensors topic united kingdom UK developed the first successful acoustic system sound ranging to detect hostile artillery an end to submarine acoustic detection in World War one in the 1990s an improved acoustic system for artillery location acoustic artillery location system was introduced which complements counterbattery radar topic United States within the US intelligence community the Directorate of MAS int and Technical collections office of the Defense Intelligence Agency as the central agency for MAS int this was formerly called the central mas INT office for education and research there is the Center for MAS int studies and research of the Air Force Institute of Technology clearly the National Reconnaissance Office and National Security Agency work in collecting ma si and T especially with military components other intelligence community organizations also have a collection role and possibly an analytic role in 1962 the Central Intelligence Agency deputy Directorate for research now the deputy director at for science and technology formally took on e li NT & COMINT responsibilities the consolidation of the e Li NT program was one of the major goals of the reorganization it is responsible for research development testing and production of e Li NT & COMINT collection equipment for all agency operations technical operation and maintenance of CIA deployed non agent Li NT systems training and maintenance of agent e Li NT equipment technical support to the third party agreements data reduction of agency collected Li NT signals l int support peculiar to the penetration problems associated with the agents reconnaissance program under NRL maintain a quick reaction capability for l int and COMINT equipment CIA's office of research and development was formed to stimulate research and innovation testing leading to the exploitation of non agent intelligence collection methods all non agent technical collection systems will be considered by this office and those appropriate for field deployment will be so deployed the agency's missile detection system project deleted based on backscatter radar as an example this office will also provide integrated systems analysis of all possible collection methods against the Soviet anti-ballistic missile program as an example it is not clear where Li NT would end an MA Si and T would begin for some of these projects but the role of both is potentially present ma si and T in any event was not formalized as a u.s. defined intelligence discipline until 1986 topic mas int from clandestinely placed sensors CIA took on a more distinct mas int responsibility in 1987 the National Security Archive commented in 1987 deputy director for science and technology Evan Hyneman established a new office for Special Projects concerned not with satellites but with emplaced sensors sensors that could be placed in a fixed location to collect signals intelligence or measurement and signature intelligence ma si and T about a specific target such sensors had been used to monitor Chinese missile Soviet laser activity military movements and foreign nuclear programs the office was established to bring together scientists from the DSN T's office of SIGINT operations who designed such systems with operators from the Directorate of operations who were responsible for transporting the devices to their clandestine locations and installing them the national geospatial-intelligence agency plays a role in geophysical mas int topic multi-national counter-proliferation all nuclear testing of any level was forbidden under the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty CTBT which has not entered into force but there is controversy over whether the preparatory commission for the comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty organization CTBT o or the treaty organization itself will be able to detect sufficiently small events it is possible to gain valuable data from a nuclear test that has an extremely low yield useless as a weapon but sufficient to test weapons technology CTBT does not recognize the threshold principle and assumes all tests are detectable the CTBT o runs in international monitoring system aims of ma SI and t sensors for verification which include seismic acoustic and radio nuclide techniques see National Technical means of verification for a discussion of the controversies surrounding the ability of the m's to detect nuclear tests topic military uses even though today's mas int is often on the edge of technologies many of them under high security classification the techniques have a long history captains of warships in the age of sail used his eyes and his ears and sense of touch a wetted finger raised to the breeze to measure the characteristics of wind and wave he used a mental library of signatures to decide what tactical course to follow based on whether medieval fortification engineers would put their ear to the ground to obtain acoustic measurements of possible digging to undermine their walls acoustic and optical methods for locating hostile artillery go back to World War one while these methods were replaced with radar for modern counterbattery fire there is a resurgence of interest in acoustic gun fire locators against snipers and urban terrorists several warfighter application areas are listed below also see deeply buried structures topic non-cooperative target recognition mas int could be of tactical use in non-cooperative target recognition n CTR so that even with the failure of identification Friend or Foe iff systems friendly fire incidents could be prevented topic unattended ground sensors another strong need where mas int may help as with unattended ground sensors UGS during the Vietnam War UGS did not provide the functionality desired in the McNamara line and operation igloo white they have improved considerably but are still an additional capability for humans on the ground not usually replacing people altogether in the u.s. much of the igloo white technology came from Sandia National Laboratories which subsequently designed the mini intrusion detection system mids family and the US Marine Corps zijn gsq 261 tactical remote sensor system TR SS another major US Army initiative was the remotely monitored battlefield sensor system REM ba SS which had upgraded to improved REM ba SS I REM ba SS and now is considering REM ba SS to the REM ba SS generations for example increasingly intertwine interconnections of infrared ma si and t magnetic mas int seismic ma si and T an acoustic mas int the UK and Australia also are interested in ug s Bailey's defense communications a division of French dailies and former lyrical builds the covert local area sensor system for intruder classification classic for use in 35 countries including 12 NATO members Australia adopted the classic 2000 version which in turn becomes part of the Australian Linux system which also includes Textron systems terrain commander surveillance system classic has two kinds of sensors optical acoustic SATCOM integrated sensor Oasis and air deliverable acoustic sensor Attis as well as television cameras thermal imagers and low light cameras ADUs sensors were in a u.s. program Army rapid force projection initiative advanced concept technology demonstration a CTD using Oasis acoustic sensors and central processing but not the electoral optical component Addis sensors are emplaced in clusters of three or four for increased detection capability and for triangulation Textron says that the Attis acoustic sensors can track fixed-wing aircraft helicopters and UAVs as well as traditional ground threats a CTD added remote miniature weather station our mws from system innovations these are M WS measure temperature humidity wind direction and speed visibility and barometric pressure which can then be sent over commercial or military satellite links employing UGS is especially challenging in urban areas where there is a great deal more background energy and a need to separate important measurements from them acoustic sensors will need to distinguish vehicles in aircraft from footsteps unless personnel detection as a goal and things such as construction blasting they will need to discriminate among simultaneous targets infrared imaging for the urban environment will need smaller pixels if either the targets or the sensor is moving micro electromechanical accelerometers will be needed topic research programs smart dust and Wolfpack still more of an UGS research program under DARPA is smart dust which is a program for developing massively parallel networks of hundreds or thousands on the order of one cubic millimeter another DARPA program is Wolfpack a ground-based electronic warfare system Wolfpack is made up of a pack of wolves wolves are distributed electronic detection nodes with location and classification capability which may use radio frequency ma si and T techniques along with Li NT methods the Wolves could be hand artillery or airdrop delivered wolf pack may fit into an Air Force program for a new sub-discipline of counter es m as well as distributed suppression of enemy air defenses d SE ad an enhancement on seed if the wolves are co-located with jammers or other ECM and they are very close to the target they will not need much power to mask the signatures of friendly ground forces in frequencies used for communications or local detection d SE ad works in a similar way but at radar frequencies it may be interesting to compare this counter li NT discipline with eccm topic disciplines mas int is made up of six major disciplines but the disciplines overlap and intertwine they interact with the more traditional intelligence disciplines of human I ment and SIGINT to be more confusing while ma SI and t is highly technical and is called such touchant as another discipline dealing with such things as the analysis of captured equipment an example of the interaction s image redefined mas int IDM an eidm mas int application would measure the image pixel by pixel and try to identify the physical materials or types of energy that are responsible for pixels or groups of pixels signatures when the signatures are then correlated to precise geography or details of an object the combined information becomes something greater than the whole of its I ment and mas int parts as with many branches of mas int specific techniques may overlap with the six major conceptual disciplines of mas int defined by the Center for mas int studies and research which divides mas int into electro-optical nuclear geophysical radar materials and radiofrequency disciplines a different set of disciplines comes from dia nuclear chemical and biological features emitted energy eg nuclear thermal and electromagnetic reflected are irradiated energy eg radiofrequency light and sound mechanical sound eg engine propeller or machinery noise magnetic properties eg magnetic flux and anomalies motion eg flight vibration or movement and material composition the two sets are not mutually exclusive and it is entirely possible that as this newly recognized discipline emerges a new and more widely accepted set will evolve for example the D list considers vibration in the center for mas I and T studies and research lists mechanical vibrations of different sorts can be measured by geophysical acoustic electro optical laser or radar sensors topic basic interaction of energy sources with targets remote-sensing depends on the interaction of a source of energy with a target and energy measured from the target in the remote sensing diagram source 1a is an independent natural source such as the Sun source 1b as a source perhaps man-made that illuminates the target such as a searchlight or ground radar transmitter source 1c as a natural source such as the heat of the earth with which the target interferes the target itself may produce emitted radiation such as the glow of a red hot object which sensor - measures alternatively sensor one might measure as reflected radiation the interaction of the target with source 1a as in conventional sunlit photography if the energy comes from source 1b sensor one is doing the equivalent of photography by flash source 3a as under the observers control such as a radar transmitter and sensor 3 B can be tightly coupled to source 3 an example of coupling might be that sensor 3 will only look for backscatter radiation after the speed of light delay from source 3a to the target and back to the position of sensor 3 be such waiting for a signal at a certain time with radar would be an example of electronic counter countermeasures eccm so that a signal jamming aircraft closer to sensor 3b would be ignored abba static remote sensing system would separate source 3a from sensor 3b a multi static system could have multiple pairs of coupled sources and sensors or an uneven ratio of sources and sensors as long as all are correlated it is well known that by static and multi static radar are a potential means of defeating low radar observability aircraft it is also a requirement from operations personnel concerned with shallow water operations techniques such as synthetic aperture of source 3a and sensor 3 be co-located but the source sensor array takes multiple measurements over time giving the effect of physical separation of source and sensor any of the illuminations of the target ie source 1a 1b or 3a and the returning radiation can be affected by the atmosphere or natural phenomena such as the ocean between source and target or between target and sensor observe that the atmosphere comes between the radiation source and the target and between the target and the sensor depending on the type of radiation and sensor in use the atmosphere can have little interfering effect or have a tremendous effect requiring extensive engineering to overcome first the atmosphere may absorb part of the energy passing through it this is bad enough for sensing if all wavelengths are affected evenly but it becomes much more complex when the radiation is of multiple wavelengths and the attenuation differs among wavelengths second the atmosphere may cause an otherwise tightly collimated energy beam to spread topic classes of sensor sensing systems have five major sub components signal collectors which concentrate the energy as with a telescope lens or a radar antenna that focuses the energy at a detector signal detectors such as charge-coupled devices for light or a radar receiver signal processing which may remove artifacts from single images or compute a synthetic image from multiple views recording mechanism recording return mechanisms such as digital telemetry from satellites or aircraft ejection systems for recorded media or physical return of a sensor carrier with the recordings aboard ma si and T sensors may be framing or scanning or synthetic a framing sensor such as a conventional camera records the received radiation as a single object scanning systems use a detector that moves across the field of radiation to create a raster or more complex object synthetic systems combine multiple objects into a single one sensors may be passive or coupled to an active source ie active sensor passive sensors receive radiation from the target either from the energy of the target emits or from other sources not synchronized with the sensor most mas int sensors will create digital recordings or transmissions but specific cases might use film recording analog recording or transmissions or even more specialized means of capturing information topic passive sensing figure remote sensing geometry illustrate several key aspects of a scanning sensor the instantaneous field of view IFO V is the area from which radiation currently impinges on the detector the swath width as the distance centered on the sensor path from which signal will be captured in a single scan swath width as a function of the angular field of view a fov of the scanning system most scanning sensors have an array of detectors such that the IFO V is the angle subtended by each detector and the AF of V is the total angle subtended by the array push broom sensors either have a sufficiently large IFO V or the scan moves fast enough with respect to the forward speed of the sensor platform that an entire swath width is recorded without movement artifacts these sensors are also known as survey or wide field devices comparable to wide-angle lenses on conventional cameras whisk-broom or spot light sensors have the effect of stopping the scan and focusing the detector on one part of the swath typically capturing greater detail in that area this is also called a close look scanner comparable to a telephoto lens on a camera passive sensors can capture information for which there is no way to generate man-made radiation such as gravity geodetic passive sensors can provide detailed information on the geology or hydrology of the earth topic active sensors active sensors are conceptually of two types imaging and non imaging especially when combining classes of sensor such as ma si and T and I meant it can be hard to define if a given ma si and T sensor as imaging or not in general however ma si and T measurements are mapped to pixels of a clearly imaging system or to geo spatial coordinates known precisely to the ma s int sensor carrying platform in ma s int the active signal source can be anywhere in the electromagnetic spectrum from radio waves to x-rays limited only by the propagation of the signal from the source x-ray sources for example must be in very close proximity to the target while lasers can illuminate a target from a high satellite orbit while this discussion has emphasized the electromagnetic spectrum there are also both active eg sonar and passive eg hydrophone and micro barograph acoustic sensors topic quality of sensing several factors make up the quality of a given sensors information acquisition but assessing quality can become quite complex when the end product combines the data from multiple sensors several factors however are commonly used to characterize the basic quality of a single sensing system spatial resolution defines the correspondence between each recorded pixel in the square real-world area that the pixel covers spectral resolution as the number of discrete frequency or equivalent bands recorded in an individual pixel remember that relatively coarse spectral resolution from one sensor such as the spectroscopic analyzer that reveals a bush his painted plaster may greatly enhance the ultimate value of a different sensor with finer spectral resolution radiometric resolution as the number of levels of energy recorded per pixel in each spectral band temporal resolution describes the intervals at which the target is sensed this is meaningful only in synthetic imaging comparison over a longer time base or in producing full motion imagery geospatial resolution is the quality of mapping pixels especially in multiple passes to known Geographic or other stable references topic queuing cross queuing is the passing of detection geolocation and targeting information to another sensor without human intervention in a system of sensors each sensor must understand which other sensors complement it typically some sensors are sensitive ie with a low incidence of false negatives while others have a low incidence of false positives a fast sensitive sensor that covers a large area such as SIGINT or acoustic can pass coordinates of a target of interest to a sensitive narrowband RF spectrum analyzer for l int or a hyper spectral electoral optical sensor putting sensitive and selective or otherwise complementary sensors into the same reconnaissance or surveillance system enhances the capabilities of the entire system as in the rocket launch spotter when combining sensors however even a quite coarse sensor of one type can cause a huge increase in the value of another more fine grained sensor for example a highly precise visible light camera can create an accurate representation of a tree and its foliage a course spectral analyzer in the visible light spectrum however can reveal that the green leaves are painted plastic and the tree is camouflaging something else once the fact of camouflage is determined the next step might be to use imaging radar or some other sensing system that will not be confused by the paint cuing however is a step before automatic target recognition which requires both extensive signature libraries and reliable matching to it
