 In the latest update valve opened up the dust2 skybox. Now, you can smoke of certain spots on bombsite B from out of tunnels. To smoke doors, you should go into this corner. Look up and locate this rectangle. Aim in the middle of the right edge in the rectangle. Release the smoke while standing to smoke doors. This is, for now, the simplest way to smoke off doors, but be careful as you are exposed from anyone peeking in tunnels close. You don't need to be extremely precise to land this smoke. Most times it is smart to combine this smoke with a back platform smoke to eliminate long-range combat. To throw it you go into the same corner and simply aim at this wooden plank. I've tried to find a window smoke as well but was unsuccessful. It is very hard to find a consistent and safe to throw window smoke from tunnels. These two smokes should be enough for B site take. Thanks for watching and I'll see you all next time!
