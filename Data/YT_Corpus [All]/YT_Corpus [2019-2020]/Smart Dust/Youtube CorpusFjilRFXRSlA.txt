 Speaker 1: All right, so what other equipment do you want to talk about? Speaker 2: Actually I'd like to talk about dust masks. Speaker 1: Okay. Speaker 2: Can you tell me a little bit about them? Speaker 1: I absolutely would love to. So this is the only type of dust masks that we really should be wearing at The Budd Group. If we're in a situation where there's a harmful chemical in the air or maybe a harmful dust in the air that requires us to wear a respirator, the manager would actually know that and we have a whole process that's separate from this. Speaker 1: So really the point of wearing these is if something's just agitating you and you feel more comfortable wearing one and so there's not a lot to it. All you need to do is, I like to pre-pinch the nose a little bit and then just slip it on, pull it over and then go ahead and pinch that nose to make sure that you're getting a nice seal and that's all there is to it. Speaker 1: Again, a dust mask like this has really made for big particles and dust and is not going to do a lot to keep out small particles. So this is really just to help with agitation or maybe if you were doing some high dusting and you had some big stuff fall on, you just don't want to get anything in your mouth, that's really when we should be wearing stuff like this. Speaker 2: Excellent. Speaker 1: All right. What's next? Speaker 2: Pro safety tip number four. Create new speaker: If you're concerned of any dust or large particles in the air, dust masks are provided for anyone who wishes to wear it. Create new speaker: If there's a harmful chemical or dust in the air that requires a more serious masks, such as a respirator, contact your manager. Dust masks won't protect you from small or harmful particles. Create new speaker: After you've placed the dust mask on your face, be sure to pinch the metal nose strip to complete the seal of the mask.
