 hello everybody my name is Jennifer maker today I am showing you how to design right and cut pantry labels with a Cricut cutting machine on the great maker show and tell so I recently renovated my kitchen with beautiful glass-front cabinets and I really want to put some canisters in jars in there but the thing is I need to label them because otherwise the ingredients are just way too hard to tell apart I had been using my brother Pete uh CH labeler but those labels are just not very pretty or really big enough to reach from a distance so I am going to use my Cricut to create my own custom pantry labels that look good and are easy to read and I'm going to show you how to do it too so for this project do you want either full sheet label paper like this or the Cricut smart label writable vinyl on a roll now I prefer the smart vinyls smart label by his look and feel and I think it looks I think it sticks better to surfaces too you also need some canisters and jars to label I'm using the Aqsa pop containers as well as mason jars in various sizes now if you use mason jars look for ones with smooth sides as your labels will stick to those them so much better than those with the raised designs you know the ones I'm talking about now I'm gonna use my Cricut cutting machines to cut and right my pantry labels you can make these on any Cricut but in this tutorial I'm going to show you how to make them on a Cricut joy and on a Cricut maker but an explorer would also do the advantage to using the Cricut joy is that you can use the smart label material without a mat and it's easier to take the Cricut right into the kitchen with you as you label all your stuff and don't have to keep making trips back and forth oh and you need a pen for your labels too I am using a black fine point Cricut pen which is a point four millimeter tip the size of the pen tip matters if you use my designs your Cricut can right and to decorate your pantry labels with the pen right in the machine and they look fabulous it goes right in here now last but not least you need to design for your pantry labels it can be simple or fancy it's completely up to you I'm going to show you how to make three different styles a super easy simple label a big easy to read bold label like this and a fancy script label that's totally on trend I'll even show you my personal tricks for getting the cricket pen to film the thoughts for bolder and more beautiful labels so let me start by showing you how to design pantry labels that suit your style and decor step 1 design your pantry labels here we are in Cricut design space which is the design software that you'll use for your Cricut joy Cricut explore or a Cricut maker click on new project over here on the Left I'm going to show you how to make three different pantry label styles the first will be simple the second is bold and the third is fancy let's start with a simple one for every pantry label that we make we need two basic things a shape for the label and the writing itself the label that we put on to it to begin let's get a shape click on shapes over here on the left and you can click a circle for example and there we have a shape that's pretty easy now let's make this white just because most our labels are white right and it just helps us visualize it so we go up to this box up here while the circle is selected and we click on the white square so now we have a box now it's important that you make your label the right size for your container for example I know that a two inch circle is the right size for my container so to change the size we go to the top here under size and we just selected the numbers and we change it from whatever it is to whatever we want it to be so I'm going to type in 2 and press return and it resizes for me and I'm going to use these buttons down here to make this a little larger so that we can see what we're doing just just the view not the actual circle so here we have a circle which is great but we need to get a label onto it don't we so the simplest way to do this is to click on text right over here on the left and a box comes up that says add text here and we're gonna type in a name for our first ingredient so flour so that's too big so we're going to use this resize handle here and click and drag it until it's like a holster to the right size and click and drag it into position now very important we need to tell the Cricut that we want to use the pen to write this label on our pantry label we need to actually change it from cut which is the default to draw so everything by default is cut and that's important to understand whenever you want to draw something you need to change it to draw so with the word selected go up to the line type menu here at the top and choose draw just like this okay now this is the way that it will write on your label perhaps you think this is amazing and if you do then you're almost ready to go all you have to do is select both your shape and your word both of them so you can see they're both selected over here and then click attach if you don't do this they won't actually the word won't actually appear on your label okay so if this is all you want and you love this then this is it you're good to go just make sure that you have changed your label name to draw your shape is cut and you have them attached and you can see right here attached alright alright so but what if you want to change the way that this font looks what if you don't like this bubble letter effect a lot of people don't they want it to look like it's actually written with a pen that you might have done that looks nice and not some weird outline you can do this and you use a writing font to do this so let's first detach everything so we can get to there our larum our word here so now I've selected our name and I'm going to go up and we're gonna choose a different font so I'm gonna go to the font menu right now it's crickets and generally defaults to that and over here under filter on the right side I'm going to select writing and this will show me only fonts that have a writing style which means that it will just be a single line or something similar to that that actually looks like writing and if you don't have cricut access a lot of them will be at extra cost but there is one and I believe it's actually Cricut sans it's just the writing version of it so if you have access to anything with an a means that it's included in cricut access all right so what we that you access the writing font is you go to style at the top of the screen and you choose writing so if you don't choose writing you're not getting the writing font and there we go you see how different that looks it's a lot different so let's make sure that everything is aligned so I've selected both the label shape and the word to go to the align menu and I'm gonna click Center and that's going to align both my ingredients I'd my circle and then I'm going to attach again make sure you have a draw layer and a cut layer and this my friends is a simple pantry label you can make them in any of the writing fonts any of the fonts you get to choose what you want and you can go crazy and make them for everything so we're going to set this one aside and move on to the next label I'll set this over here just so it's out of our way okay so our next label is a bold font this font is not particularly bold and if you have a pantry like I do that is not well lit it is really rather small it's difficult to see a delicate font like this in your pantry and you don't want to be grabbing the flower when you really wanted the cornmeal right that's totally not going to taste very good so there is a way to make a bolder font and let me show you how to do that so again we will make a shape and this time I will just choose a square and if you don't like having boring shapes like this there's alternatives if you go to images and you click on cartridges there's several cartridges here labels with the flourish line labels with decorative lines that aligns simple lines slash lines all of these filled with label shapes and style right so lots of labels here so we could pick this one and I have these labels are part of Cricut access and just so everyone knows it's called simple labels alright so I'm gonna choose this one we'll use this one instead so go ahead and delete this square so I know that for my jars no my containers my larger containers I want them to be about 4 inches and it's also important to know that the Cricut joy like the the maximum size if you're going to use label paper is four and a quarter inches I believe right for in a quarter inches so let's just make these four inches wide so I'm just selecting the size up there at the top and changing it to four so there we go four inches nice big label it doesn't matter what color it is only that you can see it alright so now we need a font and I'd mean a bold font so I'm going to click on text and I'm gonna work right my gradient name we're just gonna use to say one so we can compare it's nice and easy so here's the word flower it's not bold but there are options and I'm going to use a font that I've downloaded online that has a fill that goes with it and it's called carte blanche and we had to change this filter so it says my fonts just right let's close this and do this again filter take off writing there we go you might if you if ever you can't find your fonts make sure your filters you can click on clear filters like this you can click on system and that will show your fonts that you've uploaded I have a whole tutorial on how to find funds and upload fonts to Cricut design space on both a desktop laptop and on the iOS version of Cricut design space so this is the I want it's called DK carte-blanche and I'm going to change it to that and you can see right away that this is going to be an amazingly awesome bold font right now it's set to cut okay so make sure that we change this to draw line type menu there we go so this is what it will look like when it draws because it's got its filled in with these are sort of hash marks and this is this is fairly unusual there are maybe a dozen fonts that have a sort of style like this there's not a lot and I don't know of any Willy that are part of cricut access currently if you want this font it's over at dafont.com so we have this set to draw we have our label let's select both layers and go to a line and choose Center just like before and then attach them there we go so now our bold parents your label is ready to go so let's move this over with this one here now what about a fancy label so I have got you covered there I have actually designed a whole bunch of things for you so that you can make labels that are bold and beautiful so they are on my blog my blog is located at Jennifer maker.com and these are free dish that's really clear my designs are always free and you go to the red bar at the top of the screen and you click on enter the library and once you're in the library you can browse but I have a rather long list of free files and it can get a little a little hard to find things I will admit so the best thing to do is to search the page that would be typing on your keyboard command F on the Mac or ctrl F on Windows so here's a little little window that comes up and I'm going to type the word pantry and it shows up right there highlight for me and all I have to do is click this file and it downloads and once it's downloaded I can open it up and here are all the files and I have label shapes and I have penned pantry labels so let's start with the shapes and you want the SVG file whenever you upload now don't don't look like this that will not help you instead go to Cricut design space click on upload upload images and browse and then go find the file that you so here's my downloads folder here's the file I downloaded and here is the label shapes SVG file it says SVG right in the file name if ever you can't see it make sure that your window is expanded all the way so you can see the full file name alright I click that and we're going to open it up you see all the shapes over here I have lots of them and we select it and then we click insert images to put it onto our canvas and now I'm gonna make the canvas smaller so we can see all of these lovely shapes there's lots of shapes here I am going to choose I have actually a couple different ways to do this I'm going to first ungroup using this icon in the upper right so that the labels in here are separated and can be selected individually and I am going to use this one here to show you how you can make a really cool border and I am going to use this one here to show you how we do the pretty Penda font and now go ahead and just grip these up and hide them for now we don't need to worry about here's the group and we just click the I to hide them since we're not working with them now I want to go back so I can see my files much better okay so here's one fancy label and here's the other one is no one's not quite fancy yet alright so for this first one here I made a pretty border now again this happens to be done with the I mean technically you could cut it right out of this label if you wanted to but I think it looks a lot prettier when it's pinned so we need to change this from cut to draw and it looks like that and you can even change the color because I was like to do these in teal so there it isn't teal and then we can put a name right in the middle I mean we couldn't take one of these or we can make a new one let's use one of cricket's other writing fonts so I'm going to type flower and we're going to go up to the font menu and it gave me click on filter let's first click the to get rid of the our search our search result and click on filter and click clear field sources to be sure and then click writing and these are all of the writing fonts that are available and there's lots and lots of choices here a lot of good ones for labels would be things like be mine anything I mean sometimes like this is not what your label your writing fat won't look like so sometimes you just have to experiment and see what looks good on your font and this is kind of the fun of designing a label and working with design space you will spend way more time designing your labels than you will actually cutting them out that's the easy part actually I know it was for me so here's a font that is cute it's called dandelion let's go ahead and change it to that so we can see what looks like I'm gonna click and drag it over on top of our label and use a resize handle to make it the right size and I want to make sure that it's draw which it is selected as draw and let's change the same pen color as our outline which was Jala teal because it'll be much more efficient and yeah that looks awesome I think so just like before we need to select everything so we just couldn't just click and drag a selection box around it like this or you can actually use that you know click the layers over on the right if you want and then click attach so now we have a fancy label that will make this pretty leaf border around it and the word flower alright now let me show you my favorite one and this use is another file that I created so we're going to upload it click on upload upload image and browse and look for that pantry labels pinned SVG file and click open no this is a big image and you're going to get a warning at the top that says image is large please be patient it's possible that if you have a slow computer it could take a long time so just be patient once it's uploaded you'll see it over here and then click Save again be patient it's uploading it's about I think it's three megabytes and it has to process all of that data so just be patient and let it upload so once is uploaded click it so it's selected with the green outline and then click insert images and give it some time to load onto your screen there we go they're so pretty so these are all SVG files that I have made and these all use the pen font and they fill in to make this nice beautiful bold script font so once they upload we need to ungroup them so that we can select each one individually and let's click and drag flower over to our label just like this and I'm gonna zoom in so that we can see that now remember what I said earlier in that files default to cut so if you look up here at the line type menu it says cut you do not want to cut this that would be zero fun and it will not look good at all you want to draw it so you click on draw and you'll know it doesn't change the bubble letters it stays looking like this and that's the magic of this SVG file that I designed there are 55 labels in this file I'm hoping that I've got most of your pantry items of course not all for example some people have wheat flour and cake flour and white flour so that's okay let me show you what to do so here is flour and we're going to click on text again and we're gonna type cake alright so here's the word cake and I'll just kind of give myself some space okay so this font it doesn't look so good not these two did not go together they're both just too fancy I recommend a much simpler font let's go to the font menu and let's say nice simple thought Cricut sans is probably fine and Cricut sans is free so let's just go select that forget sans okay and let's do all caps actually instead of lower case let's say cake like this yeah like this better and then we're gonna use our resize handle to make it a much more appropriate size and click and drag this right here and make sure it says draw which it does isn't that awesome guys I think it's super cute so we have our flower layer which is set to draw and we have our descriptive word which of course you don't have to have if you only use one type of flower and we have our fancy label so again we select everything for that one label just one label of time and we click attach so we now have four labels we have our simple basic label we have way we have our bold label and we have two fancy labels yeah aren't these cool let's make the backgrounds all the same on these so that the Cricut understands that we want to cut them all out of the same paper that's important to do so let's find the background to find the the label shape of each one so I'm going to select it and then over on the right we'll see all the layers highlighted click on just the one lay the value the label shape and go up to the color menu and choose white weight it's a good because we're working on cut these on them wait do the same thing for each of the other ones find the label shape click on it change the color to white and again over here here is the label shape and change it to white and since we're going to do these all on one sheet or at least attempt two we're going to change this the color of the ink we want it to match the others so we're going to change it back to black not gel fine point black and this is an important distinction all this my flower font here is designed specifically to work with the fine point tip pen the 0.4 millimeter pen that if you go bigger I can't guarantee that is don't look so great it might fill in a lot more but be very bold and you might lose some of the detail so I recommend you stick with the fine point something else is important to note you'll notice that I didn't really it didn't change the size of the flower once it uploaded and right this fancy one you want to keep it the same size roughly you could go a little smaller or a little bigger but not a lot more without losing some of the cool filled in bits right so just keep that in mind it's designed specifically for pantry labels open of course I know you guys are gonna ask me well what if I want to make my own that you haven't thought of I used a font to create these it's called shelleyan script and I bought it online from thought bundles I have a commercial license for it and let's go change it to that so here are filters type in shelleyan here it is right here it's fixed this letter spacing it drives me nuts that's not it there we go that's much closer actually it's moving this down a little bit okay so it's important to understand that when we change this to draw it's not gonna look like what I have designed it's going to look like this bubble letters right and of course we can get rid of the touching part spread just welding it and that looks a little bit better but it's not the same as this right now I did this using an S by creating an SVG in Adobe Illustrator so you are welcome to if you know how to make SVG's and how to fill things in you're welcome to do that in Inkscape or illustrator or you know any kind of like vector program that can output an SVG but you're not going to get the same effects as me just so that's clear but maybe you just want to like cut it out or maybe you want to fill it in by hands maybe you love to color in that case feel free to just do the bubble letters and fill them in with marker or something fun like that alright so I think that we are ready to try making these step3 cut and write your pantry labels it's time to actually make these pantry labels that we've designed so when you're ready to go you just click make it up in the upper right corner and it sends it to your preview mat now I've got this currently set to my maker which you can see up here in the corner and this is what my preview mat will look like always check that you have a draw layer and a cut layer and there's not other mats for other colors or anything like that you can have multiple mats if you're doing a lot of labels but they should all be the same draw and cut on the same color of material just like we see here and I'm gonna rearrange she's just a bit I'm gonna move the simple one over here and then put the bold one here and then this one here and this one here just so that we can see them in order after we've finished going to click continue and the maker process is the same for the explore process there's no difference in how this will work so our machine is connected always make sure it's turned on and it's near your computer so our first step is to put these on to label paper so click on browse all materials and we're going to search for the best way to found this is adhesive paper adhesive-backed and click done and your pressure is fine the way it is so it tells you what to do load the black pen in to clamp a put your fine point blade in clamp B and then load the mat and press the load button so now let's prepare the same thing but for the joy I have both machines connected so that we can do them together so here's the exact same project and I've set this one to the joy so we're gonna go go ahead the same thing and click that green make it button in the upper right hand corner now the joy asks us how we're going to load our materials and since we're doing a label paper and that's not a smart material we're going to say on the mat so this is for any material and then we click on mat and then click done it gives us this preview mat and again we need to double check that we have everything on the same color and it says draw it and cut and this looks good but we can change our material size from four and a half by six and a half to four and a half by twelve because we have a longer mat and I want to do the exact same thing I did before and put these into order just so that it's easier for us to look at how they did in the order that we made them so here's simple bold and fancy there we go so we click continue for the joy and we're going to do the same thing we're going to look for the right material now the joy does not have the same material available so what I found that works best for label paper is actually to use premium vinyl and so that is right here and go ahead and click done and I'm setting my pressure to less because it's just a little stronger than I need so we have our maker all ready to go and we have our joy of age go first for fun we're gonna do these at the exact same time so you can see how it works let's switch over to my work area and get our mats loaded up alright so I've got everything all set up and ready to go here is my maker if you don't have a maker you can use an explorer for this tutorial as well and here is my joy to both plugged in and ready to go here are my materials and my mats the pens that we'll use for the Cricut maker and Explorer are these pens that say Cricut explore on them they also work for the maker we want the point for tip pen that's important for this tutorial the color does not matter just the size so we're going to go ahead and take that out and then for the Cricut joy we're going to use their pens so the Cricut joy is smaller and that means it has smaller mat smaller materials smaller pens and even a smaller blade so everything is a little bit smaller so we're going to use the same size tip size though so it's still a point four millimeter fine point pen and that will be our pen again color is not that important all right so that's our pen now for the actual material we're going to try two different ways we're going to why just doing standard label paper to see how that works that will do that in both the maker and the joy and then we'll try the smart label writable vinyl which is really cool and then we'll compare and see which one really works the best and one other option that I won't be showing you but that you can consider is glossy sticker paper so this is white matte and this is glossy sticker so paper if you want your pantry labels to be see-through this is an option that you can use so it'll be clear okay we're gonna focus on right now we're going to focus on our full white label paper alright so we have our two mats and it's important to note that these mats are specific to each machine you have to use the 12 by 12 or 12 by 24 in the Explorer maker and you need to use Ford 1/2 inch wide matte or no matte if you're using a smart material like the smart vinyl this does not need a matte which you'll see in a minute so it does they do have some smaller mats I believe gosh I can't remember for the cards yeah okay here we go these are ready to go so we have our label paper on our mats we have our pens ready so design space tells us to load the black pen into the clamp so we're going to do that for both the machines now here's an important tip before you put your pen into your machines make sure that it's primed and by that I mean make sure the ink is flowing so we'll just take a scrap piece of paper and we'll literally just write with it and you it's not uncommon for it to kind of start out a little bit light and as we write it gets darker right so that looks fine to me there okay and we'll go ahead and put this into the maker so we open the clamp and put it into the maker until it clicks sometimes it doesn't click but you definitely want this little arrow that you see here to meaning the top of your pen adapter so here that clip click there and then close the clamp and then put the cap on your pen so that it doesn't get lost so let's prime the joy pen as well and this one looks good to go no doubt it is a newer pen just want to make sure that it's about the same and it is looks about the same to me so let's open up the cricket joy and you take out the blade because it has one clamp put in it our pen it will not it will be I'll feel a little bit loose it doesn't lock in the same way this is fine you just close the clamp just like this and put your cap on all right so that's ready to go all right so now we're ready to load our mats into our machines so to load the maker or the Explorer you press it against the rollers and press the load button the joy loads differently as you you want to put it in but as you approach the rollers it grabs it for you there's no button there's no loader on the button just like that [Music] and that cool all right so let's hop back over to Cricut design space so our makers ready to go and all we have to do is press the flashing button and our Joey is ready to go and in this case we actually press the green button on the screen so I'm going to do these together at the same time so we can watch them ready set go [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] now the joy prompts us to put the blade in so we remove the pen blade in and press go on the screen and both machines cut out our labels for us so as they've written our labels and now they're cutting them out and there we go they finish basically within seconds of each other so to unload the maker or the Explorer you press the flashing unload button and to unload the joy you actually press the unload button on the screen and it unloads for you and there we go these look wonderful so here are labels now let's take a closer look at the one that filled in with our pen doesn't that look excellent it did a great job it's very bold and vibrant the label on the Left penned by the maker it does look a little lighter than the one penned by the joy I'm not sure if it's because the pen is perhaps a little older or the joy's marker is better but you probably wouldn't notice unless you were comparing them side by side I think they'd look really amazing alright so those are our labels made with label paper let's take them off the mat I always flip your mat over to peel your material away now let's take a look at the smart label material that's available for the joy this is a writable vinyl and you don't need a mat for it it's really cool this is my first time using it this is five and a half inches by 48 inches long this is writable vinyl which I have never seen before so this is really rather exciting and you can see if you look at the edges I'll hold it up in the light shine it it doesn't come quite to the edge and this is where the rollers are going to bring it in on the edge all we have to do is unroll it just enough to get you see now the cricket joy is auto-feeding it and straightening it as it does so I actually have put it in just slightly crooked initially and it fixed that for me which was really cool that's it that's all we had to do and now we're ready to go ahead and write alright so let's go back to crooked design space and make sure that we've changed our material to be the smart vinyl so to do that we're gonna click on this material line again and let's see is it up here smart label writable vinyl is right here so and we want to use the default pressure we're going to put the black pen in so here's our pen and remember it doesn't it doesn't lock and initially you have to close the the clamp now there's a note here gel pens and metallic markers are not recommended for this material so just sticking with the regular fine point pen is the right choice and everything looks great and it's time for us to go ahead and click go [Music] [Music] [Music] all right and we need to put an iron vine point blade into our joy so we take out the pen put in the blade close the clamp and press go on our screen [Music] and it's complete and we press unload so there we go we have labels let's take a closer look at these the ink is beautiful I have to say first of all that's the biggest difference I can see right away is they just look lovely let's compare these to the ones that we did in the label paper earlier so you can see a difference right away in the vibrancy of the ink right so putting it on this label this writable vinyl definitely makes the ink really stand out so these are very pretty now I know what you're thinking can we use the smart label writable vinyl on our Explorer or maker cutting mats well you know I love to test things so we're gonna find out right now all right so here we have the smart label writable vinyl and we want to put on 9 inches now it's important to note that because there is this margin here right along the edges of both sides where the vinyl doesn't come all the way over you need to position it so that either your labels are moved over or you have this section moved over a bit so that there's vinyl right at the edge okay so load up our maker we're gonna put in my pen close the clamp put this on everything looks good moment of truth oh we should just go ahead and do this okay so we go back to Cricut design space things look good let's go ahead and press the button [Music] [Music] [Music] alright that finished and it looks like it did it and it looks pretty awesome actually let's take a closer look at this so comparing the smart label on the maker on the left here with the smart label made on the joy on the right I think the maker the ink isn't quite as bold as it is on the joy but otherwise they look really good so it looks like you could use your Explorer or maker with the smart vinyl - step 4 apply your pantry labels to your containers in jars putting your pantry labels on your containers and jars is the easiest step first wipe down any surface you want to apply your pantry labels to with rubbing alcohol and a lint free cloth or wipe such as a coffee filter this is going to help your label apply and stay stuck better now carefully peel the label off the backing and place it on your container as straight as you can if you use label paper you'll probably be able to reposition it if you get it on crooked but you will not be able to reposition the smart label very easily if you're at all concerned about it just measure and mark with a pen that will wipe off easily now here's an important note the smart vinyl can be peeled up from the backing with a finger just as I'm doing here but if you find it hard to pull up simply weed the vinyl around the label first and I definitely recommend that you weed first for any intricately cut labels on the smart label as otherwise your label may want to tear at the corners as it as you peel it up and I have a tip for you when you place your smart vinyl on a container start at one edge and smooth across from the edge to the other edge this is going to help you avoid wrinkles and bubbles so here's the question I have and maybe you have as well which one of these is better is it the label paper or the smart label writable vinyl let's compare the two first stickiness the smart label vinyl sticks way better to containers than label paper after only a few days the label paper was already starting to lift off my jars which was really sad so if you use label paper you're going to need to reinforce them with extra tape or glue but you don't have to do that with a smart label vinyl ink application the ink looks quite a bit more bold and vibrant on a smart label vinyl than it does on the label paper so that's another point in the favor of smart label how about look and feel I definitely preferred the glossy white and smooth finish of the smart label vinyl to the matte finish of a label paper and smudging so the ink is smudge proof on the smart vinyl immediately after writing whereas you need to give the label paper a bit more time for the ink to dry so you'll want to be careful in that touch it in the beginning eventually both the label paper and the smart vinyl are smudge proof now it's important to note that neither of these is washable if you wash it the ink will run but because this smart final surface is glossy you can wipe Coco dust and greasy fingers off with a dry cloth on the smart vinyl labels a whole lot easier then you could wipe it off on the plain label paper which might soak that dust or that grease right up now if you think you'll be touching your containers often with damp or wet hands and don't want to risk your ink running just spray them with a clear acrylic spray sealer a few times you'll want to wait about 5 to 10 minutes between coats I have sprayed labels in the past and that works really quite well and it protects the ink note that you'll probably want to weed the excess vinyl from your smart vinyl before you spray it is otherwise it might be hard to peel up your label but when I look at all the factors between the label paper and a smart vinyl smart vinyl definitely comes out ahead and that's what I'll be doing all of my pantry labels in I am really pleased with how my pantry label designs and tests have turned out though I can't decide if I like the scallops labels or the fancy script labels best I'll just have to use them both and now that I've tried making them on different crickets and with different materials I know what is going to work best for me my vote is definitely for the smart label vinyl material and I'm going to use the Cricut joy because I can go mat list and that's easier and I can take it right into my kitchen and it's gonna be so much more efficient I'm really impressed with this little thing I do hope you found this tutorial helpful let me know what you think also let me know
