 Welcome to my channel today I'm sharing with you my no dust makeup box with a mirror I am Juliet Migwi and on this channel I normally share with you my DIY home decor tips and my life hacks Today this uh cuts across both the home decor and the life hack because I'm sharing with you one of the ways you can declutter and organize your dresser top I don't have a lot of makeup I know some of you have tons and tonness uh for me it's not too much but I wanted to share this with you and if you're new on this channel please subscribe and press the notification button so that you can be aware of my video uploads and if you've been here watching and you haven't yet please consider joining my YouTube family everything I use on this video is linked in the description below so uh over time I have done a few things and one of the things I did when I was younger was I was a cabin crew for Kenya Airways and Emirates and I had to wear makeup but we didn't have YouTube where we used to learn how to do it so we did it mathogothanio you know over time I got some makeup I learned a few things and I've always used this traveler makeup bag because it makes my life easier I don't have too much but the more I'm doing videos the more I'm finding it harder to keep pulling it out of the drawer to put it outside this is the no dust make a box with a mirror and it also has a light is what I ended up getting because I don't have to worry about my makeup on here getting or carrying or picking up dust because I don't use makeup often maybe when I'm going out or when I'm shooting videos and the other thing is it is small enough as you can see up here that it doesn't clutter my space my space stays organized because I don't like many things up here at the same time with that it means I can also not hoard a lot of makeup I can only pick what I need not you know most times we get sales or we see oh this is the latest this is the latest for me if I pick something new let's say like foundation I get rid of the other one because it means I don't need it if need to buy something else it means I don't need what I already had and so with this clear space including this jewelry box that we madeover check the card above and so with this I have space for my highlighters and eyeshadows my powders and bronzer a few of the eyeshadows contour brush and in here I keep most of the things that are standing let's see like my foundation and my brushes it's easier to pick them from in there and this makeup box does not come sectioned or with compartments in here so I made this nail polish marble art makeup holder from reused glass and you can check the card above or after this at the end of the video to see how we did that and I could have bought but I decided hey I'm supposed to be the princess of DIY so why not do it myself if while you are picking your makeup you feel this door is restricting or not as easy you can open the latches on the side pull them down then lift this up put it on the side like this if your dresser is higher or if you need the mirror to be a little higher you can have it on the side or you can have it on top and then pick your makeup with ease and then after you're done just put everything back and latch and the last thing i love about this is that it has this mirror that allows me to close up people mascara eyeliner you know how tough it is for me but I'm still trying to do that and when it is dark I can just switch on the light and it's easy ah for me to to do my makeup and so I've shared my very short easy decluttering organizing for your makeup I know there are many types out there this is what worked for me if you have any questions or comments please write them in the comments below and as I said everything we've used in this video is linked in the description below don't forget to subscribe and press the notification button so that you can know my next video upload please people join me in this God bless you!
