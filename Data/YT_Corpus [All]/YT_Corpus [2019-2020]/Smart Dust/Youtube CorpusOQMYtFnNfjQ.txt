 The South Korean government put into effect emergency measures nationwide since this morning to tackle fine dust. This is the first time they've been implemented since a new anti-pollution act took effect last week. Cha Sang-mi zooms in on the actions are taken. The air is terrible again here in South Korea. The entire nation, except Jeju Island, is under emergency fine dust reduction measures for the first time since the Special Act on Fine Dust Reduction and Management came into force a week ago. The act bans old diesel vehicles over 2-and-a-half tons from all roads... when fine dust levels exceed 50 micrograms per cubic meter, for two consecutive days. The level of pollution in Seoul is particularly high, over 75 micrograms, prompting the city to issue its own emergency alert. Air quality forecasters say the special act will help get rid of some of the dust, especially starting in June, when another provision of the act will take effect, imposing driving restrictions on everyone, not just civil servants. "The special act includes measures that will reduce the ultra fine dust. The measures are being expanded from just government workers to everyone, so that will help reduce the pollution significantly." Forecasters expect the fine dust to stick around through the weekend and beyond, and they've urged people to stay indoors and wear a mask with a filter if heading outside. Also under the act, cities can also cancel school or reduce class times when dust levels are too high. Cha Sang-mi, Arirang News.
