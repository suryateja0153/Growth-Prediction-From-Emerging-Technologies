 Hello, I'm Michelle Park here with the latest weather update. The air quality was decent in Seoul today while Gyeongsang-do provinces were under hazy skies. The dust concentrations will go up high in the capital tonight and stay bad in the south. Wednesday afternoon won't be as clear and sunny as today. In fact, it will turn grey into the day and Jeju could see some rain. The countries surrounding Korea are also going to be blanketed with clouds with cooler daytime highs than today. The morning will kick off with negative readings except for the far south, Seoul beginning the day at minus 3 degrees Celsius. There's a big boost in the readings,... Seoul reaching up to 7 degrees, while many parts of the southeast make it into the teens. Looking at the rest of this week,... there's a cold spell on Friday and nationwide rain on Sunday. I'll leave you with the weather conditions around the world.
