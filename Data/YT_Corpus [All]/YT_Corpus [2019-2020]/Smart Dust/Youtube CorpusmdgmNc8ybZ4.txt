 Local Researchers have found that air purifiers can reduce indoor fine dust by over 81 percent when windows are closed. The Gyeonggi-do Institute of Health & Environment also found that purifiers are most effective when the power is turned to the maximum level for the first ten minutes,... and then to a normal level afterwards. The institute plans to make public the results of its 10-day experiment to help people use their air purifiers more effectively.
