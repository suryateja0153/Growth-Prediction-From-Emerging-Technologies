 hey guys! how's it going? long time no see welcome back!!! today, I'm going to be talking about the Brawliseum, which is a new game mode i guess or a new tavern raw that'll be coming in about a week i believe the launch date is on let me check really quick september 23rd which uh is next week it's it's not too far so you know today we're going to go in depth and talk about what brawl's theme is should you play it how to get into it the rewards except i'm going to give a complete guide to the bralesses this will help you make a lot of gold a lot of money some packs too if you're good at it before we jump in though guys i just want to apologize for being m.i.a for like a week i was uh competing in the master's tour i don't want to talk about it so we're not going to talk about it i don't want to see any comments asking me about it okay please don't ask it went horribly it went really bad so please don't ask and after that i was just kind of you know i was bummed out and playing among us with some other streamers uh asmodai terence chalky who works a blizzard just a lot of people sun glitters i mean if you've checked out any hearthstone streamers playing among us all sorry i was probably there at some point but yeah guys so i didn't want to apologize when i wasn't playing among us or competing the master story i was watching a lot of anime like a lot of anime god of high school was pretty good so it was re-zero so yeah my bad guys but before we get in guys i want to ask one teeny tiny favor if you guys can like the video comment subscribe that mean a lot to me i know i've been a bad father i've been m.i.a for a little bit but i'm just trying to roleplay like your real dad and leave you and this time at least i came back so you know we're doing good anyway guys we're going to jump right in talk about the brawl of siems let's get it all right so first and foremost i want to talk about what the brawler seem is uh we haven't had one of these in a very long time i think it was like early 2019 was the last one it might have been late 2018 even but it's been a while and it's been a while i mean a while this is like my favorite game mode and i've been so sad without it uh essentially it's a heroic role seam i think we had like a budget version before where it was like super cheap to play and that the roars weren't great this one is the heroic brawl seam you got to be a real hero to play this it's expensive it's it's uh it's all i can say it's expensive it's a thousand gold for one entry or ten dollars which it's kind of absurd if you think about it that's ten times the arena price but the rewards are worthwhile if you do well in it so first and foremost should you play the brawls cm well maybe if you're good at hearthstone or you think you create a hearthstone i'd play it if you have the money to spend if you have like half a collection you're missing a lot of cards this is not worth the investment play arena farm uh solo player content just don't don't do it if you can't afford it make sure that you are comfortable spending the money it's kind of like gambling you don't want to put the gold up that you don't have if you're not comfortable spending the gold if you're uncomfortable losing the gold don't don't do it because more often than not if you aren't a top level player you're probably not going to break even so i would definitely suggest being comfortable before you play it but the brawl seam is essentially kind of like uh kind of like arena in a lot of ways you came in you pick a deck or make a deck there's no drafting you can use the cards in your collection i believe it's only cards in your collection using these this deck that you built whatever you want you could netdeck off hs replay netdeck off www.templestorm.com go over there we've met a snapshot it's great yeah you can not deck do whatever you want you go in and you play against other people who have brought a deck in once you lock a deck in you have to play it until the end of the ball seam which is until you lose three games or score 12 wins so it's pretty much just like arena for the terms of like when you get relegated and kicked out or not uh you can win six games in a row lose two games and then win six more and you'll get the 12 win reward you can go 12-0 you'll get the same reward all that matters is that you win as many games as possible so the rewards will be shown on screen by my wonderful editor thank you god bless you there you know you can see what they are if you do really badly you go zero three you're only getting a single pack that's not good you're spending a thousand gold for one pack you got ripped off bro like that's that's something like budget you know you got you went to like louis baton and got ripped off man like just don't do it if you're comfortable though and you start getting like five wins you can get six packs which is worth evidently 600 gold you'll get 220 dust which i'm not really sure i think a pack is guaranteed like 50 dust so maybe it's more hunter dust i don't know mass hard 50 that's four of us anyway you'll get six gold or six packs 220 dust and 220 gold that probably just about breaks even i think you need to go about six to seven wins to break even i'm no math guy though but this is where you want to hit if you're not comfortable hitting here this is where i would probably tap out and not play your tavern roll where the rewards get interesting though are 10 and above when you start hitting 10 wins you start getting golden legendaries alongside the pack rewards as you'll see the backwards just massively increase but as of 9 wins you'll start getting 16 packs 400 dust 400 gold then when you hit 10 wins you get the same rewards but also a golden legendary 11 wins is the same reward except 80 more gold and 80 more dust and a second golden legendary gold legendaries are worth sixteen hundred dust apiece so that's a lot the golden legendary alone is four times the price or the reward sorry the dust reward for nine wins that's a lot then if you hit 12 wins that's where you're like you've been like praising some god and you've been worshiping something you're doing some weird stuff [ __ ] sorry i don't [ __ ] swear on youtube doing some weird [ __ ] it worked out you get 50 packs that's a pre-order you spent ten dollars or a thousand gold you got 50 packs and a thousand one hundred dust a thousand one hundred gold and three golden legendaries if you can comfortably get 12 wins once or twice you're probably set for the next expansion or at least for the rest of this expansion you can craft pretty much everything i completely made that up the math probably doesn't check out but if you're doing well you're gonna get some rewards so i would definitely recommend if you're comfortable checking this checking it out you know brawl seems pretty cool so i mentioned it in my last part but i want to go over it just again quickly should you play the braless scene i'm going to say the average player probably shouldn't play more than once it's a lot of fun i do think they match you your wins based on your mmr in standard so i think if you are playing and you're confident you'll probably play people around your skill level but i'm not sure how that works but the average player doesn't have a lot of goal to be sitting on i've been saving up since they announced this and i have about three thousand and i'm probably going to spend some money on this because i'm an addict it's horrible i love spending money to maybe get packs it's it's cool but i think the average players should probably avoid this it's it's high risk high reward it's a definition of high risk high reward it's a lot but if you're comfortable with your skill level you know you can definitely do it if you have some gold laying around and you think like i could probably get about six wins why not try it it's fun try it once but this is a disclaimer if you lose all of your gold on this if you take a loan out on your house you lose it your wife leaves you your kids never talk to you again because you want to gamble the brawl see him it is not my fault okay you can go over like youtube like monsanto's youtube channel blame him that's fine don't blame me because i will not take any blame i'll just say keck w noob so you know don't blame me but i do think maybe trying out once if you have gold if you don't have it then obviously you can watch me do it on twitch.tv luke underscore chess i thought this video has just been like me selling out quite a bit but that's okay gotta do it all right so now i want to go more into depth on some more interesting topics such as how to win in the brawl cm i know everyone watches the brawl seam guide you guys probably already know what it is but you know i gotta break it down for those of you who don't if you made it this far though you're a real challenger you are comfortable you are going into this brawl cm ready to win and you know what i commend you so how do you win well the first thing is you want to submit the best deck possible you don't want to go in there and be like hmm well on ladder i've been playing my home bureau pure paladin at a 51 one right now none of that none of that no pure paladin you're not touching paladin you're not submitting shaman i don't care how comfortable you are if your name's not wire you're not submitting shaman if your name's not no one no one submit palette josephine paladin i know curator's replay says do not submit paladin the deck sucks if you're going to do it please play the pen version pen flinger it's the only one that's good but submit the top decks go on different websites do some research use your common sense sites like hs replay tempo storm vicious syndicate see what people think are the best decks i for one if you're very comfortable and you have time i would recommend playing mage turtle mage and tempo mage are very very good i would argue they are the best acts in the game but they are very hard to play regardless it's important that you submit real decks as much as you know you can go on twitter and you'll see someone tweets like i just went 12-0 with my aggro token juror deck don't don't submit it you know they hire old some kids don't you're not gonna hire all the kids you're just gonna lose your gold you're gonna be mad so just don't do it submit real decks the decks that i would recommend for this are probably tempo mage or turtlemage one variant of mage is good if you don't want to play mage though because they are pretty high skill cap bomb warrior is a good deck uh guardian animal druid is a good deck if you want a fun list king farous has been seeing a lot of play lately it's pretty cool if you have the gold for it if you don't have the gold for it probably shouldn't be playing the brawl soon uh what else is there a priest is always good you make your opponent wanna end their life that's an added benefit i guess for some psychopaths and finally soul demon hunter it's kind of hard because you have to like predict what other people will submit but generally these are the decks that i would recommend another thing is tech cards are actually kind of okay in the brawl scene you won't see your opponent's decklist it'll be closed lists so if you sneak in something like a acidic swamp ooze i'm so sorry jay alexander please do not yell at me again please i'm sorry but if you submit a acidic swamp it was in your deck you know it can get your opponent a lot of people won't be playing around it they won't be expecting it especially if you're not playing a class that normally runs it i will say though this probably does hurt your deck playing tech cards that are only good in one or two matchups it's kind of risky i do anticipate a lot of people playing bomb warrior though because it's the easiest to play right now and it's very good so maybe flipping in like a swamp ooze or a sticky finger and certain decks might be okay but i'd make sure that you're not cutting an important card if you're gonna do this look for a tournament list that someone else was playing then take it i think theaters.com should have all the tournament lists just be very cautious because i don't know i don't want you guys taking malygos out of your mallet and being like i tried the sticky fingers but the priest didn't have a weapon i don't want to hear it so just be cautious all right just don't do it and uh yeah be smart the last rule that i think for the brawl scene that's important is you need to know how to play your decks i know this like sounds very obvious but there's like something that i see so much on youtube videos or comments on youtube videos rather in my twitch chat etc is like what deck should i craft i'm gonna play this and then people just like instantly all in on a deck they play it and they lose they get upset you need to know how to play your decks a lot of decks have similar play styles tempo decks will play like other tempo decks face decks might play like other face stacks freeze mage played similarly in some ways to raza priest control warrior plays pretty similarly to odd warrior but you got to know your deck inside and out you've got to know the matchups you gotta know we need to mulligan for each match-up you just always want to know what you need to be doing at every time and you're not going to learn that in the brawler scene you might learn it in the brawl cm but you're going to lose 10 so don't do that take it to ladder play as much as you can learn the deck watch dreamers learn the deck twitch tv slash luke underscore hs i will teach you how to play the decks for free but for real just make sure you're comfortable don't go in here and be nervous it's a big investment you don't want to be that kid who shows up without being prepared everyone else is going to get mastering your deck you might even queue a player in here and you're going to be the person first timing a complex otk deck and you're going to mess up your turtle mage bounce and it's going to be really embarrassing and you're never going to live it down for the rest of your life you will go to bed three years from now and you'll lay in bed just thinking about how you messed that up on a stream in front of thousands of people don't do it learn your ducks so on that fun note please remember to learn your decks and set it up just the best way to win guys submit the top decks if you want to play tech cards make sure it's a good and well refined list but don't be afraid to experiment play tech cards don't trust random people on twitter if they did well that's cool you probably won't have the same results variance plays a big part just stick to the top decks stick to a game plan and then finally learn your decks inside and out master them i think in general the takeaway is brawl cm is fun it's one of the most fun things i've ever done on hearthstone aside from actual tournaments but you need to have the gold or money to spend don't get into this and then be upset that you lost money like you are gonna lose probably more than you're gonna win 12 wins in a row well 12 wins with only three losses is definitely doable for top players but like even the best arena players only average right like what seven point eight nine eight i'm making numbers up and talking up my ass completely probably something i should have researched but no one averages twelve wins in arena it's just not a thing but i'll see him you can get probably a higher average because if you're a professional player queuing into the average ladder player you can probably go eight out of three pretty consistently i'd say nine out of three maybe even more depending what the deck or meta is but right now in this current meta i think make sure you're comfortable before you do it if you are comfortable and you're like i am going to get 12 wins every time i'm insane at this game and you do you're going to make so much gold your hearthstone economy is going to be so good you could in theory just with ten dollars get 12 wins five times in a row and go and pin it and keep playing and you're probably set for a couple expansions so yeah that's a takeaway guy i do guys rather than girls everyone else everyone is included here takeaways i do think brelsum is a solid edition hearthstone and i'm very excited to come back i'm gonna be playing it non-stop once it releases i probably wouldn't get a ladder finish this month because i'll be playing raw same the entire month but you know if you're not comfortable check out some streams watch some other people do it if you are brave enough to test your strength in the colosseum the berelicium then do it don't let anyone tell you no i know i've been like pushing a lot that i need you guys to make sure you're comfortable before you do it but it's a big investment and you you i don't want to be that guy who pushes you to do something you're not ready to do you know i don't want to be that guy only you guys will know if you're gonna be comfortable with this it is a lot of fun and i'm very excited for it though so you know don't be afraid to try something new at least try it once if you can afford to if you have a thousand gold or you know save up for the next 10 days and then you can play one in the middle i would definitely try at least once it feels as close to tournament mode as we've ever gotten so if you like anything competitive there's a lot more stress and importance on each game in standard games of hearthstone if you lose you'll lose ranks but it's not that big of a deal you can get your star back you can get your legend points back it doesn't matter but see him if you're losing you're not getting your money back and it's not like arena where it's like 100 gold and you can get that in like a quest in like 20 games in a day or something you have to actually put a lot of time into saving up for this so yeah definitely you know don't be too afraid check it out guys and if you do enjoy the bralesses let me know in the comments how it goes for you i'll probably upload a video of me uh hopefully going 12-0 next week if not 12 3. if not there will be a video about it and if you ask about it i'll be pissed but hopefully i do well and then it'll be there guys i

next month just give you guys a little roundabout on the meta yeah also important question for you guys i'm always looking for new content ideas i love to make content and i have a lot of fun but i
