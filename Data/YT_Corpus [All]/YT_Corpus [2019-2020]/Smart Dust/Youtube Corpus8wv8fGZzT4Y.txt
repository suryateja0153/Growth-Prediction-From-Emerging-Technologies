 welcome to modded the series we take a look at the different modules that you can use in your DIY projects today we will take a look at this dust sensor that can be used for air quality monitoring we will first take a closer look at the module itself understand how it works look at some images to get an idea of the construction and we will finally use an Arduino to open the sensor readings this module was suggested by a viewer so thank you for that firstly why do we need something like this the air around us is made up of gases and several other elements that are invisible to our eyes when viewed directly particulates are microscopic particles of solid or liquid matter that are suspended in air these are extremely tiny and in the micrometer range so we cannot see them directly but we can inhale them which can give rise to a lot of health issues wikipedia states that exposure to high levels of particulate matter is the sixth leading risk factor for premature deaths globally and some of these illnesses include heart diseases stroke lung cancer chronic lung disease and other respiratory infections the particles themselves have been grouped into two categories based on their size the ones that have a diameter between 2.5 to 10 micrometers are called coarse particles and these are represented by pm10 the ones that have a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or less are called ultrafine particles and are designated by PM 2.5 we can compare these diameters with that of the human air which is 50 to 70 micrometers in diameter as you can see here we are dealing with particles that are very tiny based on the concentration of these particles and other factors we can categorize the air quality by determining something called the air quality index different countries use different thresholds to determine this but they usually all fall are on the same ballpark figure this Wikipedia page gives you some more information and these are the values for the UK this color coded table shows you the different PM levels that correspond to the air quality it also lists some effects that may be observed after knowing all of this it definitely is a good idea to monitor the concentration of these particles and the SDS zero-one-one sensor that we will be using it has a pretty good job at this it can measure both PM 2.5 and PM 10 particles and has a range of 0 to 999 point 9 micrograms per meter cube the sensor output can be obtained as a PWM signal or over the serial port the sensor is also very responsive with the response time below 10 seconds I purchased this one for about 19 pounds though you can also get it for about 15 dollars on Aliexpress the package itself contain the main sensor module a USB to serial converter and a connecting cable the connector is labeled on both sides and we also have a small fan that is used for a circulation this is the air inlet port which means that when the fan is switched on air will flow from here through the sensor and out this way since we have a fan here there will be a slight hum from the blades but that's unavoidable for a sensor like this I have tested it out for a few hours and it is not that noisy at all but I'm not sure how loud it will get over the sensor lifetime this page gives you an inside look at the sensor module the main sensing components are the laser light and a diode for detection both of these are contained inside the enclosure which means that they are not affected by external light in effect what you have is this the fan pulls an air from the inlet port and this passes between the laser and the diode as seen here it is n Poe start from the top the amount of light that falls on the diode will depend on the particulate matter that is present in the air a higher concentration of particles will result in lower light and so on this signal is then amplified and processed to give us the final output now that we know how this sensor works let us quickly try to obtain the output values first let's use the USB to serial converter module which uses the CH 430 g IC one end of the cable plugs into the sensor and other plugs into the converter module you can then plug this into your computer the first thing we need to do is make sure that the USB to serial port driver is installed so open up device manager to check its status as you can see we need to install the driver for the chip I'd recommend heading over to this park front page and then downloading the driver file for Windows follow the on-screen instructions wait for the setup to complete and you should then have a serial port like this now open up the arduino ide make sure you select the correct comport and then use the Tools menu to open up the serial monitor the board read needs to be set at 9600 bits per second has that as a default setting for the sensor module you will obtain something like this and these are the raw sensor readings which means that there are numbers and not a text string that we can read that is the reason why we would need an arduino to make sense of these values so disconnect the module from the computer and follow along I will be using an Arduino Nano for this and I will use some jumper cables to connect the module to the Arduino board go back to the arduino ide and use the tools menu to open up the library manager type in sts 0 1 1 to give you a list of suitable libraries and then install this library shown here now plug in the arduino nano and make sure you select the right board and comport then use the file manner to open up the QuickStart example as seen here the first thing we need to do is change the rx pin to 0 and the TX pin to 1 these are the default pins for the serial port the sketch simply initializes the serial port then initializes the sensor obtains the readings and then prints them out to the serial port you can then hit the upload button and wait for it to complete once done disconnect the board and use this reference diagram to connect the module to the arduino nano i'm going to directly use jumper cables like these though you can also use a breadboard if you like you can then plug in the module 2 here the fans pin then make sure we'll have the kite Campos selected and use the tools manner to obtain the serial monitor but you will be able to obtain an output like this both these values are extremely low and these are within the safe hollow pollution levels which is a good thing one thing to keep in mind is that you have to disguise the serial port cable in order to upload in your sketch if we do not do this and you will get an upload error in the arduino ide the next thing i wanted to do is add this to asp home and there is a component for this already however when i tried using it I couldn't get it to read the sensor at all the logs also did not give you any information regarding this with the exception of an occasional checksum error this appears to be an issue with the library and I haven't found a solution to it yet which means that we cannot directly use it with ESP home however since we can obtain the readings using an Arduino we can publish them to an mqtt topic and then use them in node read or send them to a display we have already looked at doing this in previous video so do check them out if you are not familiar with this process so there you have it an extremely easy and accurate way of obtaining the concentration of particulate matter using the STS 0 1 1 module we will take a look at different models like this in future videos so do subscribe to stay updated if you haven't already thank you for watching and I will see you in the next one
