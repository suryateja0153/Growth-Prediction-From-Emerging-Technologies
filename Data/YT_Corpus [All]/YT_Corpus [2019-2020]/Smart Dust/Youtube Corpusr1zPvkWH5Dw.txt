 Welcome everyone. I wanted to do a quick video about the Yoroi send all feature One of my previous videos I talked about trying to trap as much value in a blockchain as possible and this is basically your change so being able to send all the ADA you don't have to have little change staying on some sort of platform or wallet. It's a great feature that you don't and I hope that more exchanges use this and more wallets in the future use this so what you can do is you click the Chrome extension your Yoroi Chrome extension and this is my Yoroi Chrome extension with ledger support so I have connected my ledger you want to go and you click your Daedalus you're going to click the wallet you want and then hit the receive tab once you hit the receive tab you're going to go and copy the address here it will say your address is copied to a clipboard you can go back to your Chrome extension go to the receiver wallet address and paste that address and we're going to send all the ADA so you don't have to put an amount you can just click send all ADA and as you can see it's 9.332715 ADA with 0.167291ADA of fees so it automatically zeros out your account as you can see 9.500006 ADA and 9.500006 ADA We can hit next and we're going to send using the ledger and once you have your ledger connected you can go ahead and start a new transaction. It's going to tell you to send the ADA. The verification address will show up in your ledger and you can just hit the right button to verify that all the characters are there but you copied it directly from the clipboard so everything should be good. It will give you the transaction fee amount which is 0.167291 ADA so around a tenth of an ADA which is borderline negligible at this point We're going to confirm transaction on the ledger. We just wait. Here we go and the transaction is pending so we can go to Daedalus. We're going to go to summary and the transaction is pending as you can see the transaction has gone through. It's confirmed now with low transaction assurance and as the number of blocks increases it's going to go from low to medium to high in every block within cardano is around 20 seconds so that was a very quick transaction and I just emptied out my ledger wallet on Yoroi and send it back to Daedalus so you can just go back and forth back and forth back and forth so you don't have .0001 ADA left on your Yoroi wallet or you don't have to do the manual calculation which is pretty difficult let me know what you think about this feature and until the next video thank you
