 hi my name is Johnny John in today's video we are going to talk about brain computer interface in multimedia communication this presentation includes the history of brain computer interaction we are also gonna explore the relationship between BCI and multimedia communications and discuss the influences of BCI especially in the multimedia communication field let's get started so first of all what is BCI a BCI is a computer based system that acquires brain signals analyzes them and translates them into commands that are relayed to an output device to carry out the desired action the recent decades have witnessed an explosion in the area of BCI research back to the origins at the beginning of the 20th century the first brain signal study came from the psychic energy study there was a day when German psychiatrist Hans Berger was experiencing a horse accident in a cavalry training in the same instance many kilometers away Hans his sister spontaneously had a strong feeling that her brother was in danger Hans was impressed by this as a result he decided to discover the physiological basis of psychic energy in 1924 the first human brain signal electroencephalography II was successfully recorded by Hans Berger it refers to the recording of the spontaneous electrical activity of the human brain over a period of time in 1946 w gray walter demonstrated one of his ich frequency analyzers in the historic ether Dome of the Massachusetts General Hospital at a meeting of the Eastern Association of electroencephalography until the early 1950s the gray walter frequency analyzer was used in several studies the original demonstration and the subsequent studies employing the frequency analyzer perhaps set the stage at the MGH for subsequent developments in relation to the analysis of beings some artists were also trying to explore new possibilities of the eat in 1965 Lussier met the scientist Edmund Dhawan who was investigating alpha brainwaves inspired by Diwan Alvin Lucier finished his art project music for solo performer in the performance the brainwaves are constantly picked up with the electrodes and amplified with a brainwave amplifier a filter allows only the alpha waves to pass through then the signal is split into several channels and each channel is amplified and routed to a loudspeaker the cones of the speaker's follow the Alpha rhythm and make percussion instruments sound either by hitting them directly or by the motion of the air one or two assistants control the volume of the individual channels and in doing so determine the musical shape of the piece [Music] in 1973 the term brain computer interface was finally coined by Jacques Vidal Chuck produced the first peer-reviewed publications on the BCI field June 2004 marked a significant development in the field when Mathew Nagel became the first human to be implanted with a BCI cyber kinetics his brain game in December 2004 Jonathan Wolfe pas and researchers at the New York State Department of Health's wodsworth Center came up with a research report that demonstrated the ability to control a computer using a BCI in the study patients were asked to wear a cap that contained electrodes to capture each signals from the motor cortex part of the cerebrum governing movement nowadays a typical BCI system is composed of four major components signal acquisition signal pre-processing feature extraction and classification to get the signals there are three different methods non-invasive semi invasive and invasive non-invasive means the sensors are placed on the scalp to measure the electrical potentials produced by the brain II or the magnetic field meant for semi invasive BCI the electrodes are placed on the exposed surface of the brain ECoG and for invasive BCI the micro electrodes are placed directly into the cortex measuring the activity of a single neuron there are several non-invasive techniques that researchers can use to study the brain they are magnetoencephalography positron emission tomography functional magnetic resonance imaging near-infrared spectroscopy in a fMRI measures brain activity by detecting changes associated with blood flow by using FN IR s brain activity is measured through hemodynamic responses associated with neuron behavior brain computer interfaces BCI's have proven promising for a wide range of applications ranging from communication and control for motor impaired users to gaming targeted at the general public real-time mental state monitoring and stroke rehabilitation to name a few one of the main goals of BCI is to replace or restore useful functions to people disabled by neuromuscular disorders in 2011 Henry Holtzman and his group developed the mind rider app at MIT Media Lab it's ahead based wearable that tracks the users eeeek signal in real-time it reveals how your rides movement and location engage your mind this combination of Egan GIS could give new insight into people's riding experience led by Professor Johnny Chi ueshiba the researchers at the keio university biomedical engineering laboratory have developed a brain computer interface BCI based on the Second Life users can walk or fly their avatars throughout the virtual world as well as move their limbs change directions and perform a variety of other tasks by merely thinking about it according to johannes Koval's interview study in 2020 BCI users perceive themselves as active operators of a technology that offers them social participation and impacts their self-definition users also appreciate the opportunity to regain lost capabilities as well as to gain new ones however BCI use contains elements that challenge common experiences for example when the technology conflicts with the effective side of BCI users the interview result shows that the potential benefits of BCI's are regarded as outweighing the risks and that BCI use is considered to promote valuable qualities and capabilities let's move on to the final question Huckabee see I change multimedia communications communication refers to a process to express and share either real or imaginary experiences between humans it took place from the early days of cavemen when they told stories around the fire and drew sketchy figures on the walls of their caves the evolution in communication would consist of improving the quality of the expression and that of the shared experience without inherently modifying its underlying nature just like from black-and-white television to color to high-definition to stereo to 3d holographic images a revolution in communication would refer to a change at the fundamental level either due to new modalities or to the addition of new dimensions for example from cave drawing to photography and telephones to cinemas to the Internet in the 20th century researchers were focusing on human machine interfaces and used them to communicate human senses the human-computer interaction provides the capability of interaction through smart cameras haptics olfaction and others the appearance of BCI reminds us that the next revolution in communication could be possible it shows a way that allows us to communicate our senses and emotions directly by using brain-to-brain interface a TBI involves inducing two distinct brains to directly communicate with each other the TBI systems were initially implemented in humans using non-invasive recordings and brain stimulation feed information was transferred from the sensory motor cortex of one participant to the visual or motor cortex of the second participant a number of BTB eyes involving different species have also been recently demonstrated for example by linking the brain of a human to the spinal cord of an anesthetized rat in another example of interspecies B TBI a human brain guided the movements of a Madagascar hissing cockroach along an s-shaped track controlling the cockroach antennae via electrical stimulation human brains have also been connected to cell cultures experimentally demonstrating that brain activity can control gene expression using an eat based BMI to trigger optogenetic stimulation of designer cells thereby mediating their genetic expression moreover the human brain cloud interface could significantly amplify the communication ability of human beings and improve human learning capacities and intelligence it might also transition totally immersive virtual and augmented reality x' to unprecedented levels allowing for more meaningful experiences and fuller expression for in-between users it's speculative all that in the future human communication will not be limited to language vision touch hearing taste or smell this communication could be more intelligent than the seven limbed aliens in the science fiction film arrival after finishing this video here I left some questions for you first based on the capacity of the current BCI technologies what's the possible next generation BCI applications then what's the potential business value of BCI products finally can you speculate the future scene of how the BCI be applied in multimedia communication [Music] thanks for watching this video I hope you find this information of interest [Music] Oh [Music]
