 hello everyone today I'm gonna be talking about a beautiful device we all use the brain the brain is a beautiful magnificent device highly complicated we all use but we all under utilized this beautiful device it's very complicated but we barely scratch the surface of its features of its enormous capabilities and even with just crushing the surface of its capabilities we as a humans do wondrous things when we devise our brains the reason why I wonder utilize the brains is because it's autonomous this beautiful device when you wake up in the morning it turns on on its own when you go to sleep it turns off on its own although you could argue this sometimes that actually works while you were sleeping and it solves problems for you while you were sleeping I experienced this and I've heard people telling me that they've solved mathematical equations while they were sleeping so we got used to it we were born and started using our brains no one told us or no one gave us a user manual of how to use it and no one told us there are hidden doors and features and buttons and there's a lot of wonders in this rain there's a lot of sophistication there are features that will not use it and despite that we as humans accomplished a lot with just utilizing the brain as an autonomous device so think with me for a second if we knew all that indoors all the bonds all the features of this magnificent device how much more can we accomplish as humans and to prove for you that we actually are under utilizing the brain and I'm gonna give you an analogy to the engine the internal combustion engine that we have in our cars that engine doesn't only run on one rpm it doesn't want to run on one rotation per minute it runs on several rotations per minutes based on the situation based on the conditions and we created that machine and we found out that it doesn't always have to run on one speed it has surrounding different speeds based on the conditions and that gives us an optimal operation off the engine in look at your dashboard when you're driving sometimes you speak at the dashboard and look at the RPM of the engine you'll find that it runs the different rpms so what is the reason we're trying to optimize the engine your brain which is a much more sophisticated device does have a capability to run different speeds that's only one of the small features that are hidden and we don't use it as a matter of fact many people run on one speed throughout their lives and their brain is only running at one speed what could they do and how much more they could accomplish if they discovered how to unlock the speed of their brain which is only one feature and in order for me to demo for you or give you a visual display of how could someone run for their life on utilizing their brain at one speed there's a lot of people that go through life only using their body at one speed I'm going to demo for you using a shadow boxing technique three different speeds that you could do but most people that I know only right I want speed so let me do the demo for you and that hopefully will give you a visual of how people utilize their brains only at one speed and then how people could utilize their brain at three speeds and guess what if you utilize your brain at even more speeds what could you accomplish more but one would ask why would I need to run my brain at different speeds sometimes when you're in discussion with someone and they're coming to you with a problem and they're emotional and they're in the mode they want to talk to you you have to switch your brain into a slower speed to be listening to the person in front of you and then if someone is is coming to you for a coaching advice and they want you to be coaching them to a problem you're gonna be talking and then you have to switch to a medium speed but if you're solving a technical problem if you are solving a very difficult problem what do you do you switch to high speed in your brain to be able to solve that problem really the speed of the brain is situational I don't claim that I know all the speeds that the brain should be operating at but I know one thing it shouldn't be operating I want speed only so let me demo for you this the three speeds using shadowboxing and that should give you an indication that a lot of people go through life using their physical body at one speed similarly they run through life using the rain at one speed and what else is hidden in that brain other than the speed of the brain what else can we utilize just like the engine it's one of the features of the engine that runs a different rpms alright let's get dangerous so I'm gonna demo for you speed number one two and three going from slow medium and high speed number one I'm gonna go to speed number two vespi number two speed number three super speed or like I call it speeding without so hopefully that gives you an idea that you have that ability to run on different speeds physically you sure do have an ability to run your brain at different speeds once you learn how to unlock these features and this wondrous device the reason why we don't use these features in the brain is number one the brain is autonomous you got used to it being autonomous you wake up it runs you go to sleep it turns off number two there's no problems with your brain it works like people say if it's not broken don't fix it your brain is not broken so the guess swap you're not fixing but if I had the ability to take you on a tour into this beautiful vehicle very sophisticated and you find yourself only using one lane in that vehicle you're just walking by the doors to the left and to the right the bonds and the features and you like I can't believe I haven't been using this I can't believe I haven't been touching this bottom what does this red button do if I have that ability to take you on a tour into your brain and show you that beautiful wondrous wool and capabilities unlimited capabilities you would know that you would say wow how much I under utilized my brain speed is one of the features it's one button what else hides in the brain of yours all those doors can someone write us a manual on how to navigate that you need to learn the techniques if you discover them you should uncover them for whole world and hopefully more to come towards that within a video before called mind six back to help you train some of the features like we said before the is like any muscle if you train it it gets stronger, if you train it it gets bigger and better it gets more efficient and maybe you unlock different doors they call that training my six-pack look it up in one of my previous videos and hopefully we uncover more hidden doors and give you some abilities and a guideline on how to uncover or discover one feature at a time and do this beautiful mind of yours thank you
