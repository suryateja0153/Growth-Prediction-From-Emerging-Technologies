 have you heard about neural link the new brain machine interface company that Elon Musk founded in today's video I'm gonna explain what neural link is and look at a few ways that we can use it to improve ourselves let's get started [Music] hey I'm the improvement geek sharing scientific self-improvement to help you achieve your goals a few days ago our favorite meme Lord and Mars fanboy Elon Musk gave us a presentation on its newest venture a neuro technology company called neural Inc which is developing brain machine interfaces the sensor discussed during the presentation has a processing circuit and threads with electrodes that can read and write the electrical signals of neurons because the threads are tiny stiff and need to be placed near neurons and away from blood vessels a specialized robot is used to implant them the robot has a microscope which allows the surgeon to precisely target implant locations and the entire process can be automated a component called the link is placed on the outside of the ear which contains a battery to wirelessly charge the sensor and a Bluetooth chip to facilitate wireless communication between the sensor and an iPhone app so far neural link is only tested the device on rats and monkeys they hope to perform their first human trial by the end of 2020 with the intent of implanting the sensor and a paralyzed patient to enable them to operate a computer or a phone the mission of neural link is to help with brain disorders autumn in our brains and make for a better future but eelain's endgame is for the devices to eventually help humanity merge with artificial intelligence while some have been wondering what this could mean for the fate of humanity I immediately started investigating ways that neural link it helped us improve ourselves because the device will be capable of measuring the electrical activity of neurons and pacific locations it's reasonable to think that it and the accompanying iPhone app will eventually enable us to monitor our brain for specific actions emotions and even thoughts being able to keep track of certain neural activity could be quite useful because it would let us keep track of when and how often we're doing certain things that may be subconscious just like my late-night peanut butter binges see many of our habits especially patterns of thoughts and emotions are largely or sometimes even entirely subconscious which makes it really difficult for us to know when and how often we're engaging in them perhaps we can get a notification from the neuro-link app when certain activities or thoughts or oceans are detected this may seem a bit silly but after all awareness is the first step towards changing something about ourselves in his 2017 book why we sleep dr. Matthew Walker discusses sleep spindles short bursts of neural activity which aid in memory consolidation dr. Walker details a 2006 study where subjects were asked to remember a certain number of facts before they went to sleep the subjects in the experimental group were stimulated with precisely timed electrical pulses which increase the number of sleep spindles they experienced the next morning the experimental group was able to remember twice as many facts as the control group who did not receive electoral simulation if the neuro-link device could give us these same electrical impulses then we'd be able to experience more sleep spindles and be able to learn more and if I had access to this I might finally learn all the shortcuts in my video editing software speaking of which as a programmer video creator and PC gamer I spent a lot of time interfacing with computer software through a mouse and keyboard unfortunately for me these massive hands aren't quite as dexterous as you might think what can make doing things on a computer really slow and clunky the neuro-link device can make life a lot easier for me by allowing me to interact with my computer with just my mind this would let me write programs and edit videos so much faster which would let me be a lot more productive of course our productivity was something typically scales with our knowledge of that something which goes back to my earlier point about learning faster if you want to learn more about neural link I put some great resources in the description I definitely recommend checking out the wait but why article is quite long but it has a lot of great information and it really provides context for neural link and how it will fit in with our lives leave a comment down below and let me know what you think of neural link does it make you excited or concern for our future it'll be years before neural link has these capabilities and will be available for you and I but don't worry you can start improving right now by subscribing to this channel I upload new scientific self-improvement videos every Saturday morning so I'll see you in the next one [Music]
