 company new classes of nano membrane electrodes with the flexible electronics and here deep learning algorithm could help disabled people wirelessly control an electric wheelchair interact with the computer or operate a small robotic vehicle without putting a bulky hair electrode cap or contending with wires by providing a fully portable wireless brain-machine interface BMI the varible system could offer an improvement over conventional electroencephalography EEG for measuring signals from visually evoked potentials in the human brain the system's ability to measure EEG signals for BMI has been evaluated with six human subjects but has not been studied with disabled individuals Georgia Tech researchers this work reports fundamental strategies to design an economic portable EEG system for a broad range of assistive devices smart home systems and neuro gaming interfaces gathering brand signals now record use of an electrode studded cap that uses with electrodes address use and wires to connect with computer equipment that interprets the signals the researchers are taking advantage of a new class of flexible wireless sensors and electronics that can be easily applied to the skin the system includes three primary components one is highly flexible hair mounted electrodes that make direct contact with the scalp through her second is an ultra-thin nano membrane electrode and third one is soft flexible circuitry with a Bluetooth telemetry unit the recorded data from the brain is processed in the flexible circuitry then wirelessly delivered to a tablet computer via bluetooth from up to 15 meters away beyond the sensing requirements detecting and analyzing the brain signals have been challenging because of the low signal amplitude which is in the range of tens of micro volts similar to electrical noise in the body researchers also must deal with variation in human brains yet accurately measuring their signals is essential to determining what the user wants the system to do to address those challenges the research team turned to deep learning neural network algorithms running on the flexible circuitry deep learning methods commonly used to classify features of everyday things such as cats and dogs are used to analyze the EEG signals the system uses three elastomeric scalp electrodes held onto the head with a fabric band ultra-thin wireless electronics conformed to the neck and yes skin like printed electrode placed under skin below and here there are dry soft electrodes adhered to the skin and do not use adhesive or gel along with ease of use the system could reduce noise and interference and provide higher data transmission rates compared to existing systems the system was evaluated with six human subjects their deep learning algorithm with real-time data classification could control an electric wheelchair and a small robotic vehicle their signals could also be used to control a display system without using a keyboard joystick or other controller
