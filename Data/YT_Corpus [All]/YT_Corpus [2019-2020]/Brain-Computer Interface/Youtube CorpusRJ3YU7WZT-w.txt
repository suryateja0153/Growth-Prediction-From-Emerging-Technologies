 let's say we wanted a robot arm something simple to do something for us you know like scratch your head seems innocuous right just do this no it's way more complicated than that not only do I have to move my arm at the correct angle I have to move it to the right spot on my head the exact spot which is really important when you got an itch which can be hard with a built-in arm let alone one that isn't attached to your body directly then you have to get to that spot and apply pressure but not too much pressure because you don't want to rip your skin and you don't want to puncture your skull this is a robot arm remember it's made of metal and motor so there's a lot to think about and a lot to worry about we need to know what the brain is telling itself what language the brain is speaking to itself and we need the computer that you're connecting this robot arm through to understand all of that before we can even approach the idea of putting it near my skull not crazy to think about yeah BC eyes or brain computer interfaces are really complicated because you're talking about brains what is the language of the brain itself is it binary like computers is it the language of the user do the do Spanish brains speak in Spanish or Chinese brains and Chinese English brains and English French Braden's in French does the brain have a universal language think back to that man moving a rat's tail from earlier is that proof that one brain and another speak the same language not really but the brain does have a language and we are learning it so let's kick into this one and figure it out submarino's is episode two of five on upgrading our brain organs so make sure that you stick around for all the episodes go back if you haven't seen episode 1 here we go in 1888 Santiago - Ramona cahal the spanish neuroscientist who has the best name ever discovered the neuron well he actually did it in 1887 published it in 1888 and then he won the Nobel Prize in Physiology and medicine in 1906 and he did it for this thing called neuron theory basically neuron theory is the same today as it was a century ago and jessica has a little model this is my model of a neuron and this is kind of the body of the neuron and this is like the wire and this is where the information gets sent to and so when the body of the neuron decides it wants to send information it will send an electrical impulse this way and that electrical impulse creates a magnetic fuel an electrical field that can be picked up using an electrode that is an opportunity of that neuron and so what you have is a lot of these neurons in your brain that create a lot of activity that we can see using electrodes but the farther away your electrode is the harder it is to pick up those signals and so what we want to do is figure out what is the activity that we're looking for and then how can we record it the brain definitely communicates in electricity and related ions because the ions are generated the electricity and hormones and then on top of that you have high frequency spikes going on so the spikes are little bursts of electricity since everything's electric and it works on basically a threshold here's like a go/no-go threshold one spike down here that maybe that spike would have happened once your hormones had boosted the threshold a little bit so you're making more excitable in certain areas and less in others so the brains language isn't just one thing it's a combination of electricity and hormones that's Charlene fletcher by the way I called her because she looks at brains from the side of an engineer and not a biologist I'm Charlene Fletcher I've got a PhD in bioengineering where I spend all my time working on intra cortical brain computer interfaces control robotic arms basically any engineer who comes not usually into neuroscience is like that's totally solvable in a little bit of math and then none of the algorithms can't quite perform as well as humans and so there's a lot of things in neuroscience that I've seen or that I've seen other people come into it they're just like how are you guys not solving this yet it's so simple and we invite them in and then they don't solve it immediately and they start to appreciate it we're trying our best you know scientists are doing really cool stuff but some of these problems are just just insane if anyone is gonna know the language of the brain it's an engineer who is trying like it every single day listen to the brain and then make a language that a robot could speak from it so I asked what is the language of the brain like what is it how does it talk to itself your neurons in your brain communicate with electricity which is super convenient for BCI researchers because if it was like a chemical it would be much harder for us to detect these single things going on if you were using a multimeter you'd have kind of the same thing where you want it touch a circuit and see what the voltages is that not crazy in the future documentary The Matrix Morpheus turns a human into a battery while yes we do have electricity and we don't have enough electricity to actually power anything that was cool sci-fi but just the five part we generate electricity in the form of ions they're not electrons like the plug in your wall instead it's charged particles or charged molecules moving through your body so sodium or potassium calcium or magnesium and each element has an electric charge for example sodium is positive so our neuron gets an electrical input by ions moving from cell to cell proteins on the cell membrane act like bouncers so they might let in a sodium ion which means the cell creates a positive charge within itself the movement of ions from cell one to sell two moves the charge through our brains and it happens really fast really fast and it's easy to think that's how computers work right you switch on and off you have no charge then you have a charge but it's not quite as so a computer operates on a binary system so it has zeros and ones and the brain some of the neurons operate like that some of them are on or off but then there are also neurons that use a gradient for intensity so for example when you sense pain it's not just is there pain or is there no pain but you can sense a different gradient of pain like oh it kind of stings - oh my god I'm gonna die so there's all these different gradients for that type of sensation but there's a threshold for these types of sensations and so your sensation will be no pain up until a certain point and then after which there is dedicated neurons that say okay now we're on but then beyond that there could be a little bit on and a lot on and so there's different binary systems but also create systems within the brain but let's say zero is inhibitory and one is excitatory excited yeah I can't say don't worry but so inhibitory is like no don't turn off stay off and then excitatory is like okay you're trying to pass on this information take it so that's kind of but what is in the information packet like is it no yeah that's what I thought we don't know that's crazy oh that's so weird it's they're just sending gifts that's what I feel setting means so what a cell wants to communicate something to another cell it fires an action potential we call it a spike it's very quick little burst one millisecond sends the data and we were able to record that because it's a really high amplitude relative to the rest of the thing by higher amplitude I mean like maybe a hundred micro volts peak-to-peak it's a little guy but you know we have two hundred things monitoring basically two hundred individual populations of cells so you might get up to like three or four cells on a single electrode tip and so the eraser Foreman will be about four millimeters they fit on me and I'm um but then the array length is 1.5 millimeters so they got 1.5 millimeters into your brain which is just enough to go right to where your motor cortex the areas that you know project your spinal cord are sending out commands saying move move this way move that way and so we use drop on these neurons and so people are typically spinal cord injured so their brain is perfectly healthy but they've lost the link between their brain and their limbs and so instead of restoring that link because we don't know how yet we can record the same activity that would normally be happening if you saw it move my arm and instead we just kind of redirect that to a computer the computer processes that decodes it and then we sum that to a end effector but the thing is we don't know what processing goes through that neurons mind for it to know whether or not it needs to inhibit or excite so that's that's kind of the mystery that we're trying to figure out there are all like studying different aspects of this thing and it's so crazy that you can break down the understanding of power functions in two different things like it's so crazy I read things and literature all the time and like how did you think about that how did you think to look at that that's that's insane oh my god this is so crazy and it's not over yet one way to think about the language of the brain is to think neuron on neuron off but it's really more neuron signaling neuron inhibiting other neurons from signaling so it's not really analogous at all in a bit in a computer one bit zero or one electrons flip the switch to on or off and that's it but inside of our heads each neuron is kind of like its own little computer the neuron might get lots of different input and then at some point pal output their brain is constantly on and taking in things all the time from different senses it's like okay so each neuron gets several inputs how does it know what is what and how does it know which receiving neuron needs what so that's that's the part that we're trying to understand neural coding and it still blows my mind to think about it that these lols honey cells receive so much input and then they have to figure it out in microseconds and pass it on to the next one and I'm a human being and I can't even deal with too many things at once that said we can still learn what the brain is doing even if we can't exactly digitally decode it and we do that by looking at lots of different brains we use the brain computer interface as I mentioned earlier EEG Zef MRIs physical electrodes and we learn the brain's analog patterns when the brain is doing this we know that means this and with training people can control some pretty extraordinary things the way we decode what's happening in the brain requires us to know what we're looking for movement for example there are specific areas of the brain that are dedicated to movement and so when you think oh I'm gonna flex my bicep a couple times a computer can pick up that signature and then you would basically tell the computer what thinking of flexing a bicep looks like in the electromagnetic field from there that could be you can then tell like a prosthetic arm or something to flex a certain muscle basically there was this linear map between what your neurons are doing and the direction your arm is moving and on top of that there's a linear approximation for how you're moving in space how you moving your arm in space and what your neurons are doing so with those two things you can put it together you can start you know you can record from a monkey's brain Wisel alive and moving around not paralyzed and then you try to see how well you can guess where his arm is based on his neural activity this kind of stuff was done in the 80s and it was the foundation that all BCI is based on did you catch that by the way the brain is sending linear velocity signals linear when you want to move your arm to the right the brain is literally mapping a signal that goes to the right that is so crazy right so let's say that the brain wants to draw a circle I'm a little handy a pencil I draw my circle not the best circle and try again that's it that's not bad that's not bad actually the brain has to measure velocity and angle and pressure all in three dimensions we know how to do this because we monitored thousands of different animal trials using monkeys where they literally drew circles while scanning their brains scientists realized which neurons work in the monkey brains for this making an hour move that's easy but little finger movements that's hard there is a lot to learn when you're drawing the perfect circle and I am terrible at dry I draw occasionally for this show trying to illustrate something and I was trying to get better at drawing so I was watching this Skillshare class by Chantel Martin and we're all at home right now and so I also just needed a hobby so why not learning to draw Chantel said to try drawing rapid-fire or maybe try with music or try standing up and all of this was so fun and so weird and I did actually get better at illustrating things guys started to practice more and it was kind of fun if you want to learn something new you should check out Skillshare it's an online community of creative learners who

and I was like that sounds like my people so thanks but let's go back to the brain so the language of the brain depends on a lot of little things luckily it seems to be universal there are different animal brains that generally work in the same fashion which means the language of the brain is decodable but it's not as simple as a computer it's not binary it's not on and off and we haven't even really talked about how it's affected by emotions or if we try to do multiple tasks at a time let me go back to Morpheus and what he said remember the battery thing here's one that's a little more accurate if real is what you can feel and smell taste and see then real is simply electrical signals interpreted by your brain that is the brain's language and we're trying to listen to it through the wall of our neighbor's apartment and trying to figure out exactly what they're saying but more on that next time thanks to Charlene Lisl and Jessica for their help so far we'll see you on Friday for episode 3 of 5 in this series if you have any questions or want to talk about what you learned today make sure you head down into the comments I am trace and I will see you in the future
