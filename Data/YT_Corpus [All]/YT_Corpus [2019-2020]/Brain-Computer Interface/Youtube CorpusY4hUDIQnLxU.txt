 [Music] welcome to quick tech news where we keep you updated in the world of tech without wasting your time elon musk held a live streamed event on youtube where his neuralink company showcased a pig outfitted with their brain link device the implant had been with gertrude the pig for two months at the time of the demonstration as her snout touched things a series of neurons were firing off in her head which was picked up by the implant the purpose of this device is to solve important brain and spine problems with a seamlessly implanted device meaning a device that you don't feel or see but it solves an important problem their new design has been dramatically simplified over last year's version rather than a sort of earpiece sitting behind the ear it's now a large coin which replaces a piece of skull and has very short wires connecting to the part of the brain that needs assistance the device has an all-day battery life and is inductively charged so basically think of a wireless charger for your phone or smartwatch a robot performs the surgery in less than an hour you'd be able to leave the hospital on the same day without the need for general anesthetics the robot can detect where there are blood vessels in the brain and can insert the electrodes in such a way so that there's no internal bleeding and no noticeable damage the neural implant in another pig is used to predict the position of the joints based on brain activity so this pig on the treadmill of course is moving in a rather predictable fashion but nonetheless the neuralink device is able to with high precision predict what position the pig's joints are in at any given time neuralink is working closely with the fda and have received a breakthrough device designation in july this means they are now preparing for the first human implantation once they acquire some more approvals and perform further safety testing their first clinical trials are aimed at people with paraplegia or tetraplegia so cervical spinal cord injuries for example if this person has very limited control over their facial muscles this implant could help restore control over those regions long term musk sees the possibility of combining multiple neuralink devices and restoring somebody's full body motion musk goes further to explain that eventually it would be possible to save and replay memories which as he mentions does sound a bit like a black mirror episode pricing came up at the end and though we don't have a confirmed launch price the ambition of this is of course to make it as affordable as possible a few thousand dollars is a realistic goal according to elon musk which would make it comparable to lasik or laser eye surgery the device itself should not be expensive since much of the hardware is used in smartphones and smart wearables what do you guys think about this is it a positive move for mankind or is this the start of something that could become very sinister let us know down below if you enjoyed this video i would really appreciate if you like the video subscribe and tell your friends to help get this channel off the ground thanks and see you next time
