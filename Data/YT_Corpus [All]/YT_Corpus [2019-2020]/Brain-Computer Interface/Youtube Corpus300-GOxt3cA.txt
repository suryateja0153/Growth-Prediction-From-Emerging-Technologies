 in this episode we're going to show you publicly available brain augmentation technology this technology to us is so exciting because it allows us to so totally change the way that we experience the world in our lives and talk to experts who reveal a future of unbelievable risks and rewards but let me tell you we're staring at a world in which we will fundamentally change the definition of what it means to be human this is not science fiction welcome to imagine beyond the mind my name is Ian McIntyre I'm the CEO and co-founder of a company called hump that makes wearable patch that improves your working memory at its heart hum is a little battery and that battery produces an electrical stimulation that induces this wonderful benefit which is for a brief time about two hours you're a little bit smarter today we're putting hum to the test one twin will be wearing a working patch the other Adhamiya my name's Alex my name's Sarah and we are identical twins we've never lived apart our brains are identical we have identical brain we think the same we're running a cognitive performance test that assesses working memory the twins will see a sequence of flashing blocks and they must remember the sequence and copy it the more you get right the better your working memory is are you ready I'm more competitive I have to win say was definitely not gonna win the test Alex isn't winning in the control test that we did before use the patch Sarah was the top scorer with an average of six point three and a high school eight here's what we did you tell you when we ran the test using hum only one of you is actually wearing a working patch is the big reveal Alex with the patch you now matched your identical twin you both scored an average of six point three but this time you were the top scorer the high score of eight congratulations you're the smart one now knows to say the blockhouse itself seems meaningless much less whether you got a seven or eight but here's the astounding part someone that gets an eight instead of a seven they go further in their education their earn more money across their lifetime they literally live long we now have this power this is moving out of the lab and into the world today I'm actually very excited for the future with this developing technology what I can achieve that might not be possible now as a human being maybe it's possible as a human being in ten years or 20 years once you are able to have brain implants we're going to be able to affect this function to improve our cognition the challenge is to somehow augment ourselves but in a way that we preserve our humanism brain computer interface is a very growing concern it's like a nightmare if you imagine someone hacks your brain what can they do with that we haven't seen anything like that yet but this actually has happened with other hence care devices like pacemakers it's just a matter of time it will happen what happens if we don't augment people and working memory from being a 7 2 & 8 but instead we augment them for being a 7 to a 20 there are no 20s we don't really know what that would be like and so what it comes down to is what's what's what are some of the crucial features of humanity that we want to preserve I wish that when I need to be completely in love that I could push my emotions all the way up and I could have the most amazing and loving evening the ultimate goal is a world in which everybody has this chance to have a rich cognitive and emotional life this may sound like science fiction but we are genuinely talking about changing the definition of what it means to be human and the biggest question is for whom [Music]
