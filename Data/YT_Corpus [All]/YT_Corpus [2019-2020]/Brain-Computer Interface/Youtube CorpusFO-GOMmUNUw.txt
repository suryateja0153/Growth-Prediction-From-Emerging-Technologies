 welcome everyone thank you for joining us today for our virtual event wired for thought breakthroughs in brain computer and cognitive science earlier this year tufts university received a transformative donation one that positions tufts to be a leader in cognitive and brain science research and innovation today's event is both a celebration of that gift and a launch of a new era at tufts one of our panelists today is tufts alumnus jeff stibel earlier this year jeff and his partners made possible the creation of the stable denet consortium for brain and cognitive science by donating their company brain gate inc and its patented technology to tops as part of this gift jeff also established two faculty positions to support this important work inspired by his positive undergraduate experience at tufts i am truly grateful for jeff's and his partner's generous gesture and as a scientist myself i am energized by the possibilities that lie ahead today's conversation explores both the present and the future of brain science the research underway the emerging technologies and the implications for our society this is a timely and important conversation not just at tufts we are now the stewards of these seminal patents in brain computer interfaces but for all of us i am grateful that you have chosen to join us today and i am pleased to welcome jim glazer dean of the school of arts and sciences to share more and introduce our speakers thank you thank you president monaco i'm thrilled to be part of this event celebrating the gift of brain gate and the establishment of the steibo dennett consortium for brain and cognitive science as dean of the school of arts and sciences at tufts i am so proud when i talk about our faculty in addition to the gift of braingate and the new consortium jeff steibel has created two new professorships specifically to support brain and cognitive science i am thrilled that you'll be hearing from the inaugural holders of these two positions gina cooperberg a long time member of the tufts community and head of the tufts neurocognition lab is a respected scholar in the field of language processing and has recently been employed appointed the dennett steibel professor of cognitive science we were also able to recruit stephanie bod who began at tufts this semester an innovative researcher exploring how the brain understands and informs our movement she is the inaugural stable family assistant professor of brain and cognitive science gifts to support professorships strengthen our ability to attract and retain the most talented faculty who in turn inspired generations of students i know that jeff skipped was in fact inspired by his own interactions with tufts faculty while he was a student here specifically university professor daniel bennett who we will also be hearing from later in this program many of you joining us today are here because you know or know of dan one of our most esteemed faculty members and a giant in the field of philosophy and cognition it brings me great joy to see dan honored through this gift as well jeff and his partners at braingate felt that tufts university would be a good home for this priceless gift and i would agree faculty research and scholarship like the kind we'll hear about today can create direct and positive change in the world with this gift we look forward to doing just that we now like to turn things over to our live panel we'll kick off our discussion on breakthroughs in brain computer and cognitive science please welcome bob cook dean of the graduate school of arts and sciences who will serve as our moderator mike levin daniver bush distinguished professor in biology and a tufts alum and tom lee author of the neurogeneration and founder and president of emotive systems and finally my good friend and tufts alum jeff steigle thank you all right thank you president monaco and dean glazer good afternoon and welcome i'm bob cook i'm the dean of the graduate school of arts and sciences i'm also a professor in the department of psychology and i'm your host for today we're thrilled that you're here for our first event related to the establishment of the steibel dennett consortium wired for thought today we'll be offering up an hour of information with some of the leading scholars in this area here at tufts besides several upcoming video presentations we are joined by the following wonderful live panel for today's event so uh let's have each of the panelists introduce themselves can you uh say a bit about your experience in the field of cognitive and brain sciences and broadly uh your experiences in brain computer interfaces and technology why ton why don't we start with with you sure thank you both thank you and welcome everyone it's a pleasure to join you today i've been in the field for over 10 years now and we focus primarily on electroencephalography eeg for short reaching easier to say it's a form of non-invasive measurement of brain activity and obviously there are many different ways that we can image what's going on in the brain if we're trying to think about a simple analog of a map when you're visiting a new city fmri gives you the the spatial resolution to know where all of the buildings are where the stadium is where the schools are where the homes are and the residential areas but eeg offers you the information around the dynamics of that system how people are moving around you know in the morning dropping off their kids at school and then going to work that kind of information is what we actually capture with eeg and we now support tools um we offer tools to support neuroscientific research in 120 countries specifically around brain computer interface uh one of the most prominent demonstrations that we did was um with a man who was paralyzed from the neck down from a carjacking incident in brazil and he was able to drive a formula one car around a racetrack just using uh his mind and our machine learning algorithms no that's amazing uh mike why don't you go next thank you so much uh it's a real pleasure to be here uh so i direct the allen discovery center at tufts and one of the things that my group is very interested in is how uh cells and collections of cells make decisions so all of the cells in your body make decisions when they work together to build complex organs to repair those organs and to resist aging and we discovered years ago that many of those conversations are electrical in nature so all cells in the body communicate electrically and it is our job to be able to read out and translate those conversations so that we can understand how cells cooperate towards these amazing morphogenetic feats so our goal is to use this technology and technologies like it to be able to listen into these electrical conversations to decode them and then to drive applications in fields like regenerative medicine cancer reprogramming and even synthetic morphology or building novel artificial living machines all of this relies on understanding what the cells are saying to each other and being able to read these electrical signals is a huge part of that so i'm super excited about this all right and and uh last but not least jeff why don't you why don't you introduce yourself and and why don't you share a little bit more about the brain gate technology that you've stewarded with our audience so they know more about the details of it sure happy to bob and uh um i i am probably least and at least least interesting uh from the perspective of what's being done in you know on the forward side with brain science um because you know my my background in in the brain is a bit dated about 20 years uh so or so i started my you know my academic studies at tufts uh you know got a degree in cognitive sciences and then went on to graduate school to study the brain and cognitive sciences but for better or worse i went to the dark side and left with a couple other professors and uh and started in business and ran a number of consumer internet companies and have been doing that for the most part ever since uh but uh but always continued to follow and track what was happening in the brain uh and uh in that field have written a couple of books and continued to do i do some independent research and stay active in the research community and braingate had always fascinated me it was a technology that originally emerged from a commercial standpoint out of brown university where i was in graduate school it moved into a commercial space unfortunately it just wasn't viable at the time but it was pushed into a public company grew at least in terms of perception but not in terms of of actual ability so as you know as that technology continued to evolve in advance but the business did not me and my colleagues ended up acquiring the business and i became chairman i and up until the donation of of the braingate technology and business to tufts university uh i remain chairman of that business uh braingate is a remarkable technology and it in many ways sits in between the commercial efforts that you know that ton and her company has done and the work that uh that mike has done uh so i mean this this is an incredibly interesting panel from that perspective because what braingate effectively does is it leverages a computer chip to record the neuronal activity the electrical signals um inside the brain so not from outside but inside which gives you a much better signal-to-noise ratio and allows you to decode the language of the brain and this is really the first time that we've been able to do this not just with animals but with humans as well and once you do that it enables a really deep level of understanding on the research side but but equally important it allows us to interpret that language convert it into computer or machine language and then use that information to provide feedback which will allow a you know a quadriplegic or paraplegic to use a wheelchair as an example for someone who's missing a limb to control a prosthetic uh or for someone who is a locked impatient who can't speak or communicate to you know say i love you to their loved ones for the first time ever typing an email with nothing but their mind so it really is transformative technology uh it has been proven now in you know in human and animal trials uh and you know and tufts is now at the forefront of that next generation uh that's that is great one of the important developments from this is uh the fact that the the stable denim consortium was related to brain and cognitive sciences was created and now you've had a chance to to meet jeff steibel uh here's our opportunity to meet and hear from dr dan dennett dan is one of the world's leading philosophers and has had highly influential ideas related to cognitive and brain sciences and the notion of consciousness along with numerous other important contributions because of this event i recently had the great privilege to speak with dr dennett about some of these issues and their relationships to brain gate technology i would like to share a portion of that conversation and then we'll get the piano panel's reactions uh to what dan had to to observe it and in this segment dan and i were discussing the relationship between humanity and our long historical connection to the use of technology and some of the benefits and concerns about direct connections between our brains and technology so let's take a couple minutes to play that segment well a lot of the benefits will be not so much for us on the research end as for people in the world will find their jobs easier because they won't have to push as many buttons and turn as many levers dials because because of a simple brain link which will enable them to do that now that in itself i don't think is a revolutionary development um for hundreds of years people have used hand tools to understand the world to feel the world that the blind man's cane is is a fine example it's as if it's as if his fingers extended right out to the right out to the road i can tell textures and and all kinds of things like that so where i see the direct brain prosthesis interface as a not a revolutionary development but as a more gradual development but a very important one and which aspects will reign interesting question one thing i'm actually worried about is who's going to be in control attention is the key to control who controls your attention controls you to a surprising degree and right now there are many agents many corporations many activities in the world that are dead set on controlling your attention on your on your smartphone on your computer and for me one of the most important things we have to do is learn to protect our own attention from these lures from these attractors because they're very dangerous and and they're tremendously potent we don't want other people pulling our strings and turning us into puppets we've got to control our own strings and that takes some serious work and i guess one of the things i would really like to see is technology which helps the individual empower herself or himself to keep those attention draggers at bay and help us concentrate on what really needs to get done if we can do that we will have a wonderful invention so jeff what what do you think about dan's observations about brain computer interfaces are they just an inevitable gradual development that had to happen or are they revolutionary i mean is there is that something you can agree with or is is he missing something important here i i mean i i would say like like with much of what dan says there's a lot to be unpacked there um and uh and he he's he's writing so in so many ways i think what you've got to do is you've got to separate the the actual device or innovate um from the impact that it is going to make to the human mind uh both from a perception standpoint and a reality standpoint the the actual invention isn't anything interesting all we're doing is tapping into the electrical currents of the brain right the brain communicates using electrical and and chemical currents we're tapping into those and we're using neural networks to interpret what those you know what that information tells us uh it is not revolutionary or it's no more revolutionary uh than when we extend when we extended our our you know hands and limbs using using tools um which at the time was revolutionary in hindsight it doesn't feel that way or when you know when we came up with bispectals or glasses to extend our ability to see what is remarkable and revolutionary is the fact that our brains aren't nearly as special as we thought uh and and that is the thing that i think individuals are going to grapple with psychologically that we don't actually have complete control of our minds because it is you know it is a composite of cells and you know i think this is what you know what mike has taken to the logical conclusion um frankly logical uh in hindsight i didn't see this uh but it's not even just the brain uh it's you know it's our cellular composition as a whole that creates the self organism to be able to do things and to change and to interact and i think what dan is speaking to is something so much more broad than brain gate but brain gate is is such a clear risk factor in it which is we are rapidly losing control of our self of our attention and after that because of technology coming inbound as opposed to us controlling it there is increasing danger as this technology gets closer and closer to going from hardware to wet wear so so mike you have a a long history of looking at the the actions of cells as a unit and jeff makes reference to the brain uh is this uh given your perspective as a developmental biologist does did this seem inevitable this this evolution of brain computing interfaces well uh this actually this idea that uh cognition is not just a property of the brain and that there is some degree of memory decision making attention all of the things that dan spoke about that this is actually an ancient uh set of capacities that evolution found very early on actually probably around the time of bacterial biofilms and this has been to a large extent forgotten you know as neuroscience has taken uh taken off a massive amount of attention rightly so is placed on the brain but the field of basal cognition is is just sort of re-emerging and uh these kinds of technologies that are going to help us uh bridge the um the continuum between uh very very sort of early primitive systems sly molds and and you know various tissues of your body and then elaborate brains uh this is critical this is critical technology for understanding the relationship of brain to body and for actually starting to understand how information is processed both in the brain and outside the brain this is exactly the kind of technology that we need to be able to listen in on all of the conversations that these cells are having with each other so so tom in in in the in dan's segment he provocatively says something about uh the the people who control our attention control us uh i'd love to get your view of that of that statement has facebook amazon has our smartphones have they just captured the world by by capturing our attention i think it's very provocative and and to really unpack that i think we first need to understand that our attentional system works very much like a single channel so if something holds your attention you're not able to apply it towards something else so the other sensory inputs are actively suppressed while you're attending to that particular input until something else like an elephant walks into a room demands your attention right and so this this but at the same time attention is also very fickle and so clearly facebook with what now what 2.7 billion monthly active users it certainly in that sense has captured the world but i think the word control here is something that we need to be thoughtful about as well because um from a statistical standpoint yes but not in the particular so it is able to in for a statistical standpoint it's able to influence the world the things that you see the information that you you have access to but it doesn't actually control what you actually do so you watch a dictator for example you're glued to the screen your it pulls your attention but doesn't necessarily mean that you will do exactly what that person will say and so from from that particular standpoint i think we still have a lot of um autonomy and that's where i think this is very exciting frontier what we're doing with braingate with some of the neurotechnologies with what mike is doing with what we're doing on the non-invasive side technology is allowing us to change our relationship with our brains and allowing us to change our understanding and allowing us to see for the first time what how our attention is being utilized and and calling that to attention so the analog for me is a little bit similar to ekg so in the past we we looked at what you know how the heart was performing and now we have them you know in our apple watches and we can start to it calls to our attention what's happening and the same thing is happening um with the with neurotechnology and our relationship with our brain and that evolution is very exciting um hopefully it will allow us to to do what dan had talked about which is be more aware of how our attentional triggers are being pulled thank you so and uh let's why don't we go to uh another segment of our com of my conversation with dan at this point uh in our conversation dan began to raise some important ethical uh issues and questions i think this kind of technology uh provoked so why don't we play that segment and and then we'll come back and get everyone's reaction i think one of the reasons as a philosopher that i'm so much engaged in this field is that i think it raises important ethical issues social issues i think we're it's hard to uh to emphasize the effects this can have and the uh ways in which these technologies and the political power and corporate power behind them uh threaten many things that that we hold dear i think we should be extremely vigilant about these technologies and also at the same time we should be looking for ways to use the technologies to protect us from from them it's a it's a sort of iterative process when when many years ago when george smith and i here at tess started the curricular software studio um we said look there's there's two ways that a computer can give you power there's the bulldozer way and there's the nautilus makes you personally stronger and our goal at the software studio was to create in effect nautilus machines for the mind and i think that's a that's a project that we should resume uh full bore now and think about ways in which we can harness this fabulous technology to strengthen our own ability to avoid the uh the junk and the and the misuse of time that the rest of the technology is trying to induce in us jeff i know you have some strong opinions about the the ethics of this technological development especially in the area for helping people do you want to elaborate more on your your thinking in that area yeah sure and i think dan largely encapsulated the the risk as well as the opportunity i mean with any technology it's it's a two-sided coin and you know on the one hand you you always have the inevitable extremists um usually quite smart quite intelligent um who who at the first sight of a new technology um you know is scream you know scream bloody murder and you know and assume fear it's socrates is the great example right i mean the technology of his day was the written word uh and you know he he refused to let himself or any of his students write because he thought that that technology would corrupt the youth uh the mind of the youth um and you know as we've learned that was more of a nautilus technology than a bulldog bulldozer technology to use dan's analogy um it is it is the single reason why me and my team at braingate decided to donate this technology to tufts uh because we're business people and we know what our jobs are in business and you know in business our jobs are to create opportunities with technology to leverage that technology to increase revenues and profitability and if you just think back to the early days of technology it's exactly what we did and you know bob we we we were leveraging your field more than you know more than leveraging compute technology we found tricks that we could implement um that that inevitably brought people closer and closer to our technology so that they would buy more and more and and those tricks eventually stole the attention of the mind away from the individual and towards what whatever the technology was or whatever we wanted and what we learned with those tricks was that there was there was actually a predictable thesis and pattern for doing this and it came down to data and if we could control and command enough data that was personalized and narrow we could gain anyone's attention because we know that the most important word in the human language is your name whatever that is and if we could get to your name and what you wanted you know what what uh what in business is sometimes called the long tail um but what we really mean by that is what you and no one else wants something so targeted and so defined uh we will be able to control your you know control your attention and we can use that for good or we can use that for bad uh in business we're not looking to use it for any other purpose other than to make money braingate has the potential to take that one step further we we are inside your mind um and when that is being used as as a common good to help paraplegics and quadriplegics and locked in patients that's one thing uh and and i see very little downside in pushing this technology forward in that capacity when you start using this for for the broader good um so that you know so that mike uh is going to have a you know a brand gate device embedded in his mind uh and we start thinking about whether this is going to help him bulldoze or it's going to help him build through you know through repetition and nautilus exercise uh that's not our place to answer it's not the business people's place it's not the engineer's place business is designed to determine how much money you can make engineers are designed to determine how you can build it in the most efficient manner it's not the scientists decisions scientists are there to figure out how and whether something is possible uh it it's it's for philosophers in ephesus uh to tell us and you know and part of this stuff's donation comes with the promise that we will be thinking about these problems you know with foresight not in hindsight but of course as you mentioned some of some of these kinds of direct brain links could become cognitive enhancers for a select few who can afford that how how can we afford not how do we avoid uh dividing society into those who can afford this kind of technology or from those who can't well i mean look i've i've had one for the last three years and it hasn't done that much for me kidding and in all in all seriousness um i i think i think that's a really good question and you know it's a it's a fitting question you know in 2020 because we do have a you know a socio-economic crisis on our hands between haves and haves not in not in so many areas uh and cognition is of course one of them and you know as we move towards a more intellectual workforce long term uh where you know where knowledge workers are being to some extent overvalued uh and other areas are being either undervalued or replaced uh it is it is something we we have to think about not just who should have this because it will provide an advantage uh but but also um who who might be forced to have this uh to you know to be pushed into that advantaged position so there are a lot of dynamics at play that we've got to think about very broadly in advance of commercialization i totally agree with jeff um on that point and i actually think that you know as technologists we tend to focus on the access question how do we make things smarter faster but cheaper more affordable so that we can get it out to as many people as we can but what we often miss in that access equation is to think about the inclusion um and and what what jeff alluded to in terms of the data piece and and we're seeing that as we amass larger and larger data sets is the diversity that exists in the world um when when when the brain where the brain is concerned and so that that question around brain diversity being able to ensure that our data sets are actually inclusive and representative of the population but also our business models um allow people to take part in wealth creation so that we don't create that um amplify that divide that we're already seeing is really really important and thinking about that in a deliberate manner and offering stewardship around how do we engineer and create new businesses that are more ethical in its approach in thinking about technology both from an access and inclusion standpoint is really really important right and so um during our conversation um with uh during my conversation with dan one of the issues that uh that that came up uh was uh that you have a collaborate he has a collaboration going with one of our panelists mike levin and during our conversation we talked about how dan's ideas of the intentional stance the fact that uh taking the view that inanimate objects in other parts of the world can be understood as if they have uh intentions even if they they don't uh have been applied to the idea of developmental biology so mike could you say a little bit more about your work with dan and and and how the intentional stance or things like that uh related to cognition have impacted your thinking about biological systems and um and and what your collaboration has produced so far sure um actually dan's work has been uh absolutely instrumental in my thinking for years about this uh this field because one of the things that um he's really uh developed is this idea for how to uh cognitive agents so systems that think about things that make predictions that have memory that represent counterfactual events and so on how to think about these things in uh ways that are independent from their implementation so so people are very comfortable with saying that okay a situated brain in the in the body can think and can have memory but as soon as you try to use those terms in other kinds of systems maybe it's an engineered robot or maybe it's a um it's a creature that that manages problem solving without a brain and people get very uncomfortable and they say well that's not true cognition that's sort of um you're misusing the word it's sort of as if cognition and then and then humans and maybe some great apes have this have this real cognition and so one of the things that um that dan's work has been really uh really influential in is to really very logically uh and very clearly take apart all of the assumptions that go into these things and really examine the philosophical foundations of under what circumstances we can or should ascribe these sorts of in the these these sorts of intentional words to uh active agents in the world and the idea is not to anthropomorphize uh simple systems the idea is exactly the opposite it's to dispel the the the mystery or or the magic that we sort of assume that okay you know humans have this kind of magical uh ability to think and then and then other things you know we just sort of we shouldn't we shouldn't um talk as if as if they have it and if you take evolution seriously as dan has certainly done then you have to ask yourself well where did these capacities come from and how far back do they extend and should we really be swapping out this notion of real cognition for sort of as if cognition for a continuum and uh and this is the kind of thing that dan and i have been have been working on so i work on this in the lab and then um with dan we've been uh we've been discussing some of the uh some of the the philosophical and conceptual uh things that have to get clear in in order to define for example what is a decision right so when you have a system and it might be something like a mechanical clock and it does certain things and you wouldn't really say that's a decision but then you have um you know you have you have humans who can who can think deeply about things and and make considerate decisions and then you have systems in between so all kinds of uh organisms with brains without brains i mean plants all sorts of things that can choose among multiple options based on things that have happened to them in the past and things that are happening far away um or or even in the future that they can anticipate so uh this is what they and i are working on is to establish a a rigorous uh conceptual foundation for understanding mind in all sorts of implementations because i really think and i think this technology actually is going to be critical to this development because it'll be very important in uh combining novel types of bodies so biologically created structures with computer interfaces i think we're going to be surrounded soon in our lifetimes i think by an incredible variety of active agents some of them will be fully robotic some of them will be partly biological there's going to be a massive explosion in the kinds of the kinds of agents that we're surrounded with you know internet of things and various soft body robotics and so on and we we really have to develop a mature understanding of cognition in these unusual implementations and a matching uh set of ethics that uh that will guide how we treat other creatures that look very different from us and that um have cognitive behaviors but don't look anything like us and this is this is a really important extension of of both the ethics and the sort of philosophy of mine field and and it's interesting mike i i can i can think of a of a radical idea and experiment that that that will be radical to probably everyone but you and dan where you take a brain gate chip and rather than insert it into the motor cortex as we do now you'd ins you insert it into the thigh um or into you know into the arm and listen bells there um and if you can predict some amount of thought from what is happening in those cells that are communicating with one another then you you've effectively proven that thesis that that you know the our our notion of where thought is derived of in you know in humans and animals uh is you know is probably misplaced yeah well i think that's a a great summary and so i i thank you uh panel for a fantastic exploration of of these ideas at least it's the beginning of an important conversation uh if you want to hear more of my conversation with dan dennett uh please visit the stable den at consortium site in the next few days where the entire discussion will be available i now would like to introduce a video presentation of research currently being undertaken at tufts as a direct result of jeff stable's gift to the university the first part outlines the research of professor professor bod uh in the department of psychology which will be followed up by a presentation by dr gina cooperberg from the same department we hope you find them informative as to the cutting edge research that's being done here at the university when those presentations are over we will return the panel will be here to answer your questions so please use this opportunity to submit questions and we'll have a live q a after stephanie and gina's presentation so why don't we start those two thank you bob stephanie it's great to see you i'll let you take it away hello gina hello everybody my name is stephanie vader and since september 1st i'm the stable family assistant professor of brain and cognitive science at tufts university in the next minute i will give you an overview over my research topic and how it relates to brain gait but before i start i would like to ask you to literally sit on one of your hands while i'm speaking in my research i investigate how we perceive the world and our bodies through the different senses in this moment your sense of touch indicates the pressure of your body on your hand you hear my voice through your ears and the computer screen is seen through your eyes it appears as if our senses mirror the physical reality quite well yet on a moment-by-moment basis our senses only provide rudimentary and ambiguous information for example the visual information the brain receives from your eyes looks far more like this and the pressure receptors in your hand send the same signal whether you your partner or your dog sits on your head so the big question in perception research is if our senses are not that good how does the brain generate the clear perception of the world we consciously experience my response is by combining different pieces of information the tactile sensors in your hand indicate that pressure is exerted on your hand the proprioceptive sensors in your joints and muscles provide information about your current body posture and this information is consistent with the possibility that your body is actually waiting on your hand of course you can look down your body and even though you can't see your hand all the information you get is consistent with the hypothesis that you yourself are sitting on your head and you might be aware that the dog is not allowed on the silver and doesn't rule out that he is sitting on your hand and of course you will remember that you just sat down on your hand when i asked you to do so the brain combines these and other pieces of information into the distinct percept you're right now having that you are sitting on your hand the idea that perception of the world relies on a combination of sensory and prior information is already about 140 years old but only in the last decade did researchers start to scrutinize the mathematical principles that govern this integration in mylab we investigate these calculations and the components with a special focus on the perception of the body so how does this relate to the braingate technology what braingate does is it translates thought into action for example it allows paralyzed patients to control movements of a robot arm by thinking about the movement in the same way patients could control the movements of a prosthetic hand an exoskeleton or their own paralyzed muscles under natural circumstances action and perception are inherently coupled our concepts guide our actions and our actions trigger new concepts for example when we grasp a bottle we use our senses of touch and proprioception and vision to perfectly adjust the grip and neither squash or drop the part the brainlead technology has the potential to emulate this tight coupling between action and perception by creating artificial sensations through brain stimulation in this direction has already started when we think about creating sensations through brain stimulation the slightly depressing facts i told you in the beginning about the shortcomings of our sensory system turn into good news if we can tap into the calculations the brain is built to do the combination of information across different senses and with prior knowledge very little ambiguous information in one sense can go a long way towards the naturalistic percept of our thought controls in the beginning i asked you to sit on your hand because doing so might temporarily affect your perception your hand now might feel numb or tingle and you might not have full control over it your tactile and proprioceptive perception might be interrupted you can use your other hand to manipulate the numb hand but these movements probably feel strange and robot like keep this feeling in mind while your sensations return and your movements feel normal again the brainwave technology has the potential to give patients this normalcy of perceiving the effects of their actions and i hope that this little demo illustrated the difference this technology can make and with this i thank you for your attention and jeff for his generous gift and hand it over to two that was wonderful thank you stephanie my name is gina cooperberg and i'm the dennett steibel professor of cognitive science and i direct the neurocognition of language lab here at tufts and at mass general hospital i'm also here today to tell you a bit about my research and how i see it linking to braingate my research program aims to understand perhaps the most powerful and uniquely human of brain functions language now being able to produce and comprehend language so that we can communicate with one another feels effortless at least most of the time it does but in fact the neurobiological mechanisms underlying language processing are incredibly complex and when these mechanisms break down which can happen in many different ways in many different types of neurological disorders ranging from stroke to locked in syndrome the consequences can be devastating leaving people isolated and unable to communicate with each other so as you've already heard today braingate is a powerful brain computer interface that can record neural activity directly from inside the brain and send this activity to a computer which decodes the motor intention and converts it into a signal that can control an external device now as stephanie just mentioned this device could be a robotic arm which would enable someone with locked-in syndrome to carry out movements that otherwise they wouldn't be able to perform on their own it might also be a computer cursor which would allow someone with locked in syndrome to spell out words so that they can actually communicate with other people now the brain activity that's traditionally recorded using brain computer interfaces like brain gait are the signals that produce motor action and these signals are produced by just one specific part of the brain the motor cortex which i've shown here in this slide however when the brain processes language it produces this type of motor activity only at the very final stage of a very complex set of computations and these language processing mechanisms engage many different parts of the brain producing very complex patterns of neural activity that depend on the meaning of what we're trying to say so for example even when we read a single word like the word baby the brain activates multiple different regions that encode the particular sets of semantic features that define a baby for example the fact that a baby is small and human and together these brain regions produce a unique and widespread pattern of activity that's distinct from the pattern of activity that's produced when we read a different word like for example rose and so what we'd really like a brain computer interface to be able to do for someone who can't communicate by themselves is not just to decode the motor activity that their brains produce but to decode the whole pattern of activity and use this pattern more directly to generate words and sentences that can be communicated to others now this may seem futuristic but in this recent paper the researchers showed that this type of direct language decoding is at least in principle possible what they did was to record patterns of neural activity from electrodes that were implanted in widespread areas of the brain as people read sentences and then using sophisticated ai methods they decoded this neural signal so that they could figure out what these sentences were now in this particular study it was possible to measure brain activity directly from the surface of people's brains because these patients already had electrodes implanted because they were being monitored for neurological conditions but having a neurosurgeon actually open up the skull to insert electrodes over so much of the brain may be too invasive in every situation and so in the future what we'd like to be able to do is to record neural activity non-invasively in other words we'd like to record patterns of activity that are produced by the brain but instead of actually opening up the skull and implanting electrodes directly on the brain itself we'd like to record these patterns of activity from sensors that we place at the surface of the scalp and this is exactly what my own lab does we use non-invasive multimodal neuroimaging tools eeg meg and fmri to measure brain activity as people process language we're particularly interested in how the brain uses context to predict what words are going to come next during language comprehension for example in one recent study we tracked the brain activity produced millisecond by millisecond when people encountered words that they had predicted following context like inside the crib there was a tiny baby understanding the role of prediction in language processing is really important because when we communicate we talk quickly and so it's only by predicting ahead that the brain is actually able to keep up now it used to be thought that the brain activity that we measure the surface of the scalp is too distorted and blurry to be able to use it to distinguish between different words but what we've recently shown is that during word by word sentence comprehension we can detect at the surface of the scalp unique patterns of brain activity that are associated with the specific words that people predict before these words actually appear for example after reading the sentence context inside the crib there was a tiny before people actually see the next word baby we were able to detect a specific spatial and temporal pattern of neural activity that corresponded to the prediction of this word and we were able to show that this pattern was distinct from the pattern that the brain produced after reading a different sentence context that predicted a different word rose we're really excited about these findings because they suggest a future direction for brain computer interface research in addition to using these interfaces to record neural activity directly from inside the brain and decoding the motor activity to control a cursor to spell out words letter by letter it may actually be possible in the future to record whole spatial and temporal patterns of neural activity non-invasively from the surface of the skull and to use these patterns to decode words and sentences in order to help people with numerous different types of language disorders to communicate with one another thank you so much i'd also like to take the opportunity to thank jeff steibel and his team for this wonderful gift and with that i'll hand it back to the panel all right thank you very much stephanie and gina so welcome back to our our live uh q a part of of today's program uh we we have the the pleasure to be joined by the magic of technology by uh dan dennett uh in in the uh in the flesh uh who is gonna join our panel uh for a series of um questions that have been submitted by uh uh our audience um and we've got a considerable number of questions and the panel has agreed to stay just a little bit longer past five to try and answer them that said we do want to be respectful of your time and so if you need to leave we understand that we have recorded the event so you can return to see it in its entirety so if you do need to leave uh thank you for your time and and your attention so uh we'll just start at the top one of the one of the the first questions okay we're gonna put chips in the brain have have people given thought as to how we might be able to do that less invasively uh than uh than uh direct surgical manipulations todd you've given this a fair amount of thought did you ask that to me bob yes you know i i think i yeah i think that what as jeff alluded to from the very beginning what we can achieve with brain gate by putting something into the brain is going to be far more um superior from a fidelity standpoint than what we can achieve um from the ex from the surface of the scalp but what we saw with gina is and with our work so far automotive is that there is still a lot you can do from a non-invasive standpoint and so i see those these technologies as being complementary the more we know about what happens inside the brain allows us to inform um how we might be able to use non-invasive methods in a much more um precise way because we just underline understand more of the system and how it works and so we can build better machine learning models that can predict more accurately so i think that these systems can be very complementary um over time and hopefully for things that are not for the degrees of control that is not so critical we may be able to use non-invasive um forms of technology and then for mission critical things um you know defer to the more invasive types of technology so it will be a blend you don't have to necessarily use uh fully implantable implants for to solve everything yes it it it somewhat goes back to the the um some thoughts i've had about driverless cars i always wondered how we would have driverless cars how would we would ever give it up uh driving because of the self-control that you have but it's perfectly clear it's going to be gradual and the cars are just going to get progressively smarter and smarter and smarter and at some point will be very comfortable with letting go of the wheel so a couple of other questions from our our audience um are more on the on the dark side one is uh are there dangers in this technology that can be hacked or uh could it lead to control um of people with these kinds of implants that anybody want to try and um take on that particularly i mean i'm happy to take it broadly with i think with any new technology there there are dangers uh and you know anything that is being applied directly to you know to our biology uh feels more threatening more invasive than others so i think we have to tread lightly we have to be careful um about those but you know for better or worse we we have already lost our privacy we have already lost our autonomy um that has been long gone and you know your your concept of that slippery slope bob um it's it's us old people who are holding on to that notion that you know driverless cars well it'll slowly go away really it's just that next generation that doesn't grow up with it um just thinks we're old people um and uh i think you know that that has largely happened when you look at the context of most of the technology as it has kind of materialized and you know and become part of us become one with us if you just think about like proprioception and how we use tools um it is it is very difficult um from the outside in to tell where you know where the limb ends and the prosthetic or you know or other technological device begins and we we will probably have that with you know with braingate as well okay so um the uh a companion question along the same lines as uh one of one of our um audience uh worries about uh what happens when uh darpa comes knocking on our door to try and win wars with uh computer-enhanced soldiers uh mike i you i know have had some some interactions with darpa do you have particular views on this yeah um we have we have a number of uh relationships with darpa and you know darpa has so the department of defense has a massive breast cancer program they uh develop lots of technologies that end up being incredibly useful for health and various other applications in the public sector i think i think we have to uh we have to make our piece with the fact that almost any invention of any type i mean the wright brothers uh you know setting bones you know anything you can imagine that makes life better somebody's going to come up with some way to use it in conflict okay i think that's that's inevitable and so i think the answer to this is not to squash down um uh development and innovation the answer is to uh be be really uh transparent and take uh solid control of how our technology is being used and the resources that we allow people to use in the way they deploy these things so so darpa does so for example one project we had have to do with limb regeneration and so of course they're thinking about uh repairing uh you know repairing people who who have been injured in in various kinds of military engagements but you know massive numbers of of civilians are walking around with limb loss and with various other uh ailments that are just you know a a real a real drain on their quality of life and on the economy and so these kind of advances are essential for for making life and health span better for everybody and we we need to keep an eye on how they're used but there's no there's no road for for squashing innovation i also think to mike's point i think war may end up changing over time as well because at the end of the day as professor dennett said very precisely um control of your attention and the things that people care about controlling will evolve it won't necessarily just be about killing people because the the value to that is going to be very limited and so new forms of warfare around how do you have better control over people's mind share and other forms of war and that's the kind of things that we you know i think what jeff is doing in terms of putting braingate into the the the space for academics and scholars and ethicists to really think about the unintended consequences of technology allows us to think about this broader question of how does this technology evolve over time and how will societies and our values change over time as a result of some of these enabling tools so so dan uh one of our audience members uh is curious about artificial intelligence and then really asks a fundamental question of machines will they ever achieve the human ability for creativity and discovery and i i know you've given a lot of thought to this question yes i have and i think the imagined super ai the uh super intelligent ai system that many people think is just around the corner i think it's still decades away uh and that's a good thing that it is real real creativity real creative thought uh uh depends on uh they mind having goals having having agendas having also the idea of exploring its own knowledge looking for novelty and prizing novelty in certain ways and although i think it's absolutely possible that i haven't seen any work in ai yet which is making much progress on this the machine learning is making some wonderful i think of them as fabrics they're wonderfully smart fabrics but they don't have the architecture for a creative thought yet they're they're very uh actually they're very passive they're very dependent on the knowledge that has been acquired by creative minds uh up till now i think it's possible i think we should uh hope that it takes a long time because we have a lot of of thinking to do about whether we how we want to control this and my favorite way of alerting people to the issues is a really super intelligent agent is autonomous in a way that you and i are and imagine if you were whisked away somewhere and woke up to discover that there now were some people who had control of your on off button uh and they could simply turn you off either put you to sleep or or stop you in your tracks anytime they wanted i don't know about you but my first order of business would be to figure out how to rest control of the on off button away from those people i would devote all my creative intelligence to figuring out how to snooker them into giving me access to those controls i'd want to get out of their control so we have to recognize that if we start making ais that are that autonomous they're going to be more autonomous than we want and and the irony is because i tend to i tend to agree with dan that we're we're a long ways off from that but to to pull on that analogy a little bit further i suspect we're probably already there and it's not with ai that's pulling our attention and tugging on our on off button it's you know it it's the internet and you know and what companies have done to exploit it and you know and take control of our minds and uh and we should all be in high alert i think i think dan's right okay a couple of our audience i see so some very positive benefits of this uh they talk about uh could could this kind of brain gate technology be applied to uh to cochlear implants does it have some implications for maybe helping people with with issues related to mental health um do we do we see those possibilities here sure we're talking about data so you know the more data you can get about how the mind um is interacting at the cellular level uh the more you're gonna be able to leverage that for good uh one one question we have also asked uh could we create gut gait uh is there some way that we can develop a technology that would help us to uh uh control uh uh our our internal health uh related to to to digestion and and food and uh mike i know you've worried a little bit about uh the the impact of gut microbiomes on on behavior is this at first it it is it's an interesting take on on a play on words but it has deeper implications doesn't it yeah yeah i think uh we you know we tend to think of ourselves as this um kind of single unified uh intelligence but the reality is we're a patchwork of different modules that are that are having various kinds of inputs that all together result in our behavior and not only our own cells but you know we're host to a whole bunch of microbiota that live in this in this community of cells and that have an impact both on the structure and the function of the organism and so understanding these electrical signals yeah we've seen how bacteria impact the bioelectric decisions that uh cells in the body are undertaking to create nervous systems and and so on um this this technology will and then others like it will be essential to understanding how all of these things work together to form what we call a person well we've we've uh gone over by by our allotted time and so um i'll bring this really interesting conversation to a close uh we have uh lots of questions we've hoped that you have found tonight uh as stimulating uh as as obviously the the panelists have so thank you for joining us for tonight's event i want to thank each of our panelists for their contributions uh we hope you've found tonight informative and that it makes clear that exciting things are afoot here at tufts university as we advance into the heart of the 21st century so we will work hard to make sure that you stay informed of these and other exciting developments at the university and so we'll bring our proceedings to a close i want to thank you and and wish you a good night you
