 what's up folks welcome to the first episode of log series on my channel now what I do on my channel is technically blogging but this vlog story is gonna be more informal conversation around what projects are up to what I'm thinking about when I'm doing some interesting bits from and my favorite topics which is self-improvement psychology the philosophy technology and what I'm going to talk about to defining a unstructured conversation and so here we go so when I was thinking about the first episode I thought what would be the most appropriate thing to talk about I thought what would be more appropriate than talking about we're in the inspiration for this blog started from and for that we have to go a couple of months back in February 23 in February mainly I went to the spectacle : f of X going to f of X this Cretors festival should I say I'm with Alka right here and look who's coming Nandhini look who's coming what's on your mind again I am we got linearts starting with the event soon so excited what is happening before and after and into the whole story and an active amount of like that particular scene and character where does that person stand in the graph of the entire story so in respecting the entire story that you have to design very rarely I won't individually just design a scene which is just for that particular moment but I try to always keep in mind what is happening before and what is going to happen after a lot of thoughts throughout the day amazing sessions by rock J and in the morning by the girl a lot of thoughts a lot of new ideas on storytelling and how I want to do you know tell this different stories and ideas that are in my head a lot of experiments I want to try out so so looking forward to it and yeah now it is open mic we plug on a pitch and I hope to I don't know how to put this down like this is so much happening in my mind [Applause] [Music] [Music] create a festival where hundreds of creator from different fields gather together and have batch days of workshop it's at 7:00 a.m. in the morning Yoga excitement pranayama and goes all the way to 1 a.m. 2 a.m. in the night and some of us do not even sleep I slept I read my sleep I need method not function but some folks did not sleep at all they met some crazy creators like a chef who spent 18 years 18 years like Bob and then fashion designer who came back from the u.s. to take up the family business in Seoul and turned it into a luxury labels of men that match youtubers Rica's always here [Music] you know the great founder of BuzzFeed India and tons of crazy folks like endless conversations around everything eldest son from oh by the way my favorite duckweed hey this is a resort junkie and here yeah the FX festival provide breakfast that is the view so like I said it rained last night so hard they had to cover up the stage that's the giant big X find your X not the X and yeah that's a view [Music] [Music] Wow and it was just crazy nut syphilis fact they were most of filmmakers they Vegas hours they're doing workshops and they will be pogrom all our founder observer Literature Festival speaking just the and acaba who's an artist just one after the other amazing video folks when we do this like boom landing this then also like given to this this project this one but like people yeah I need two volunteers again so you lose the arm and you do [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] and at night democracy performances from battle of excess to the legendary [Music] you know what happens when you put so many three different people in one space the first thing that happens is in couple of hours you realized that this is a space filled with amazing people who have amazing ideas amazing talent caliber and protection and then you you know start to open up even more you start to become one rebel you start to share your failures and wrong ideas as you know frequently and as easily as you share the belt from the ideas of successful ideas and that's where real creativity starts to happen you start to step out of the comfort zone you get more ideas and you get to and one other thing like that that happened during that time you start to see your own limitations you start to see your own packings I realized I have certain pattern of self-criticism which do they will be disables me and then causes me to tune down certain ambitions and goals which I could easily otherwise have had so after you know like fun tons of fun and tons of bad days and insightful days it came time to leave and that is when I realized that there is an uncomfortable and not just the uncomfort of you know being in this line is amazing group and becoming so close so soon while he's doing you can I get a pen yeah thank you and then at that time I was in the bus on my way back and I saw a man wouldn't slide would don't fm by the way create clearly go check it out is another group message that comes and it says something will respect that what you're feeling the uncomfort you're feeling is because you're stepping out of your comfort zone and any sort of creativity and change requires you to step out of comfort zone and that person of my key take away as well yourself and comfortable in some little space deliberately to push your boundaries forward in using and that's what we think of doing a blog as well to be you know to try more things to try no experiments have to be more vulnerable to feel that discomfort and you know of finding things and that let me do you know thinking about perfectionism and creativity and how they can perfectionism could be enemy of creativity Oh - creativity - you know because it prevents you from doing and putting things out there and then I have to think I realized two thoughts the first part I realized was hydration in design and in writing as well you know you write and make another drop in another copies are also iterations is a powerful and antidote to perfectionism because it allows you frees you from making this video this blog posts the perfect one because you lower the next one the next one the next one to be good one and the second thing I learned was realized more as I got reminded of this my favorite ports which was to go something like this it says so you're a rebel right you read them then show your heart to everyone to everyone and that's powerful you know that's what it speaks that creativity and impact it wise one mobility they will always be people will judge you so make peace with that like those were some critical take aways you know which were around creativity for your nail country and show the song you wanted right now and you're showing your heart showing your antenna I'm not talking about letting go of privacy it's not about that it's not that you should everything it's about your show you're us in tank it's about you should do things with the pillars of the intent and some people would say even if like other people are taking advantage of it on judging it or making fun of it you don't give you know you don't care about that you still show your heart to do it it's all so much though you know a thousand months as a final mark for my
