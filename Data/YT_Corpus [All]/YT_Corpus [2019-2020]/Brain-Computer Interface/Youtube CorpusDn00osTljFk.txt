 the main reason why this lab exists is that it's unique because of its capability to study two persons in interaction the main contrast that we study here is that one person is actively playing with the game while the other person is a bystander so doing nothing in except looking at what the other player is doing we measure the heads of the participants so that we can get the right cap size we prepare the caps by placing the electrodes on them and then we position the caps on the head then we bring them over to the installation station where we actually put the gel in the each electrode to make the contact we'll install some other peripheral sensors like the EDA signal and the blood pulse signal we're recording EEG we're recording eye tracking data we're recording video signals this field is relatively new and the aim of this field is to consider learning as a ongoing process the field of online measures of learning is trying to address this important question by looking at very fine grained information over time involving the cognition and effect of a learner in contrast to many other fields we don't have paradigms for this kind of research we don't have established way of doing ways of doing things we are inventing everything that light equation is really where everything begins and ends because we use all those that different data channels we have to make sure that every step that the data is in proper shape it is not degraded somehow and it keeps being synchronized to the millisecond [Music] observer allows us to launch the video recording in the eye trackers at precisely the same moment permits us to synchronize other data streams using the sync box which sends out triggers to the EEG recording for example so that we can line up those triggers and really synchronize the data stream his lab has so much capabilities to study humans and their many facets I mean cognition effect in any situations in which two people would be required to to to coexist or to do something side-by-side [Music]
