 To set up your remote monitor follow these simple steps. Start by plugging the power cord into the laptop and the other end into an electrical outlet. Locate a USB port on your laptop and plug the wand cord into the USB port. Open the laptop and press the power button in the upper right corner, next to the keyboard. The main menu will appear on the screen. Place the cupped side of the wand directly over the neurostimulator and rest it against your head. Click Step 1: Test Wand Signal. A window will open on the screen with 2 vertical blue bars. Move the wand over the neurostimulator until both bars are at least half full. Click “Done.” Continue to hold the wand in that position for the following step. Click Step 2: Interrogate. A window that reads “Gathering information” will open to let you know that data collection has begun. Continue to hold the wand while the blue bar fills. Another window will open to let you know when data collection has been completed. Click the “Return to Main Menu” button. You can now put the wand down and prepare to send data to the secure website. You will need to connect your laptop using an Ethernet cable. Locate the Ethernet port and plug one end of the cable into your laptop, and the other into your modem or router. Sending Data to the Secure PDMS Website Click on Step 3: Transfer Data Click the “Synchronize” button. A window will open to tell you that the remote monitor is connecting to the secure website.

When the data transfer is complete, a window that reads: “Synchronization completed successfully” will appear. Click the OK button. Click on Step 4: Exit. Click “yes” to confirm you want to turn the remote monitor off. Then, store the monitor in a safe place until you are ready to use it again.
