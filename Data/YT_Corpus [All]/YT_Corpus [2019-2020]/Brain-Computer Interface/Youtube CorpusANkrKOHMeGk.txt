 [Music] so good morning today we have john john lee from university of korea integrated by bio electronics lab to give a talk about high conductive and flexible sensory integrated with personal device for practical bio signal measurement and applications without further ado you have the floor thank you for introductions today i'm gonna announce to you the topic i study at the university i have fabricate highly conductive and flexible sensors and developed the wearable biosensor biosensing device and conducted a studied about the healthcare applications with the biosignals so i'm gonna present a selection of topic that matches the theme of my summer internship so the topic the title of toffee is a highly conductive and flexible sensor integrated with personal device for practical bios signal measurements and applications we generally measure the electrical biosignals on our skin the source of the electrical potential is uh generated by the neurons and cells activity and the onstar action potential exists the certain stressful voltages it flew through the ion channels of our body so our body is in homogeneous bone conductor and if the ion fluxes can create the electric potential on the surface of our body so we can measure the summation of action potential generally by the neurons on our skin we call this biosignals as you can see here we can measure the lots of vital signs on our skin through the measurements of the biosignals we can easily determine whether or not our organ is our each organism normally performed by the way we call the each biosignal spiritually the brain signal is electro as hologram we called eeg and the heart signal is electrocardiogram we called ecg and the muscle signal is electromyogram and we call the emg and eye signal is electro oculogram we called eog something like that so among this type of many biosignals the eeg and ecg is the very important biosignals of our body related to our life so i'm gonna focus on to present with the eeg signal and the eg signal measurements device as i mentioned before the eeg signal is the most one of the most important bio signals of our body so in the past the eeg signal is normally used in the clinical diagnosis areas but as the technology developed it has been used a lot of research areas such as ubiquitous healthcare brain company interface and even social applications areas by using the general public so this uh this biosignal is more and more becoming uh popular among the general publics despite the interest of the general public there are several drawbacks to the conventional easy recording systems there are some limitations due to the characteristic of the eeg signals coming from the head so the conventional easy recording system have lots of electrodes limitation on mobility and pace program and even currently developed wearable eeg sensors have obturative wearing so nobody wants to wear this kind of devices in their daily life so i think new paradigm of eeg device will be highly required for anyone to use in their everyday life so i i have developed new paradigm of wherever i had one device such as the eeg device with the five different visions the new device must be simple using and unobtrusive wearing a wireless recording and also comfortable varying and even bio-comfortable for users in the case of the bio body on sensor that is attached our bodies it is more focused on the functionality without considering appearance that is because the body one sensor are able to hide under our closes however in the case of the head run sensor it is not able to hide under our closest that is because our face and head is generally exposed so the form factor of wearable head-on device is very very important so i i thought of the wearable device concept of a combining easy sensor with a personal device such as the hadron personal device among the lots of personal device i choose earphone and eyeglasses from factor to measure the eeg eeg in of the wearable sensor so it has some advantages about user friendly and easy to wear and unobtrusive wearing in our daily life so with these advantages we can we can use widely used this kind of wear device in our daily applications in health care areas such as pci and human machine interface and brain company interface so the first topic to introduce is in-ear easy from concept nowadays you can easily see those who wears their earphones in all the time so they are using it during studying reading a book and even doing a sports so the earphones have become a necessary item of our nowadays so the earphone is a kind of best form factor to wear on our head without any efforts by the way the brain signal can be detected in our eye in our ears because the brain signal spread out radially in the brain so i combined these two two different ideas together to develop a wearable device to measure the eeg signal in the year since the eeg signals amplitude is quite small so the sensing material is highly most highly conductive and flexible so i developed the shiba nano wires cntpdms using by mixing silver nanowires and carbon nanotubes which are highly conductive materials with the biocompatible pdms elastomers what is pdms oh it's a it's kind of a rubber so it's a kind of elastomer and the characteristic is quite soft and flexible and yeah it's a kind of silly styling oh silicone yes yes so i made this silver nanowire cntpdms composite and the characteristic and the carbon nanotubes provides the conformer connectivity conductive connectivity in the elastomers and the silver nanowire dramatically improves the conductivities so here's our some here shows some result of the electrical property characteristic of silver nanowire synthpdms composite and especially on the c figures it shows the skin and skin and electrodes contact impedance the result shows that silver nanowire since pdms contact impedance is comparable to the commercial wet type of silver super chronic electrodes that so i use these highly conductive sensing materials with the eeg sensing device uh device electrodes yes why did you use both carbon nanotubes and silver oh yes some ones better than the other wire machines actually on for the just just using the carbon nanotubes it has a conductivity but it's not that high for using uh for measuring the eeg signals so i'm i uh i put the simple nano wires a little bit it improves dramatically the conductivity so it can take out the carbon it's not as good you have to have both yes both yes so the carbon nanotubes uh explain explain explain the aspect ratio to patrick of of the carbon nanotubes that will maybe help him understand oh why what's orientation aspect millennium answer the question yes the uh the diameter of cnt carbon nanotubes is about 20 to 30 nanometers and the long length is 200 micrometers so it's quite long and aspect ratio is quite large so it connected it can connect the conduct contact conductivity inside the elastomers yes so uh here shows the appearance and the components of in-ear ego phone as you can see here the in-ear eg earphone consists of two parts one is the simple nanowire synth pdms based in-ear cap sensor and the other is erg egf phone which is the measuring system so the eeg cap sensor is made by attaching the conductive interconnection layer with the silver nanowire cntpdms composite together on the memory foam memory foam so and this in-ear cap sensor is also designed and plug out is a resp replaceable so the in-ear cam the eeg signal is measured by with the in-ear cap sensor and transmitted to the metal layer of the frame of each earphone and transmit transfer to the circuit system through the signal lines also the mechanical modulus of in-ear cap sensor is much lower than that of the bark polymers that spark polymers so this result shows that in your cap sensor provides comfort wearing of in your easier phone i also did the comfort study of the in-ear cap sensor the finite element analysis simulation was conducted to study degree of the comfort when wearing the near eager phone of our eyes our ears so i carefully designed the model of ears and each part of the inner cap sensor and i also did a a study about applied pressures when the in-ear cap sensor come into our ears as a result the applied pressure is more loading enough to cause the discomfort and the electrical resistance change of the sensor is did not change significantly so with this result i indirectly learned that this in-ear cap sensor is suitable for measuring and wearing of our ears here's just the easy recording system uh the recording system is one channel system and consists of three electrodes source reference and ground so the measure of the easy signal is transmitted to the wirelessly to the smart devices such as smartphone and laptops through the analog filters and application systems so you do can you go back so you do differential amplification where is the reference right what are in the linear electrode yes okay so uh the sensor position optimization test was performed to optimize the sensor position inside the ear so i carefully divide the each experiments into the several groups so and then finally found the best position of the linear cap sensor of the electrodes so the best optimized position is when the source electrode is upward of the right earphone and the reference electrodes is upward and ground electrodes is downward of the left earphones so with this optimized sensor positions i i measured some eeg signals of the feasibility test the feasibility test was performed to evaluate the developed device so three feasibility tests was performed two is two is related to the visual stimulation and one is related to the auditory stimulations the first feasibility test was alpha rhythm detection test in general people are in rest state or close their eyes the 8 to 14 heads of the alpha rhythm is highly expressed in our brain so with this biological mechanism mechanism i measure the upper region by closing our eyes so for the experiment setup we instructed the subject to open their eyes before 60 seconds and close their eyes another 60 seconds so as you can see at the a figures you can easily figure out the signal differences before and after 60 seconds and also the on the b figures the spectrogram results the x-axis shows the time and y-axis shows the frequency so on this figures you can also figure out the alpha reading on the near the 10 hertz after 60 seconds although the amplitude of the energy earphones is lower than that of a commercial system which is attached on our head but we successfully measured the alpha rhythm with the linear easier phone so please clarify all the two spectrograms yes on the right we have a signal from a cap yes and on the left is your yes so you still can see yes yes yes but uh amplitude is quite different yes the second and third feasibility tests was related to the ebook potential so the ebook potential is brain brain response against the external stimulation so the second is about visually stimulation and third is about auditory stimulation we also successfully measure can measure the both visually and auditory stimulations brain activities for the practical application of uh our inner easy earphone we we try to measure the thrusting state of people so we usually do the concentration work such as studying and reading a book and reading papers while wearing our earphones so and we often fall asleep and getting a dressing state without our knowing so here is our motivation of this applications that if if the earphone can await the people during the drastic state the work efficiency will be improved so for the generally when the people are uh in the transiting state the four to seven hertz of that event and eight to fourteen health of the alphabet is getting stronger so with this uh biological uh biological mechanism we measure that we try to measure the drastic state so for the uh experiment setup we had a repetitive clicking task on the subject who was limited their sleep before before the previous day driving them more drowning state so we instructed the subject to click the button when the red when when the black sign changed the red sign the black sign the sign changes randomly so during the experiments i measure the clicking reaction times and name on the errors when the clicking reaction time exists the stress certain threshold time so during the experiments i judged the trusting state of the people when the number of errors going high so during the transition state i successfully measured the change of the eeg signals the alpha van and set events getting stronger so as a result that this is the kind of very simple version of applications but we successfully measure the trust in state with the linear ego phone so this is a very promising easy wearable eeg device for the practical use in our daily life the second topic is smart eyeglasses concept as you know the eyeglass is so familiar to us so it is no exaggeration say that one third of populations using the eyeglasses by the way uh it's very surprisingly more than 87 percent of the human sensory input is can be obtained by our head such as the five senses so we can measure the variety of biometric information such as brain signals and eye signals and the other five senses with several sensors of at the at our head and we can use this kind of biometric information to use the command signal to manipulate the machines so on this topic i'm going to show you the human machine interface applications with with some sensors attached on the eyeglasses from vector yes form factor c so this figure shows the appearance and the confidence of multifunctional smart electronic eyeglasses so as you can see here some sensors and systems are embedded in the eyeglasses so the frame of eyeglasses is customizable for users and made by using 3d printing technologies and biosignal measurement sensors are attached five different plates to measure the eeg signal and eog signals and the sensing material is similar to the previous reported one so it is uh carbon nanotube based elastomers and the color changeable display is for the protect our eyes from the uv radiations actively so we apply some color changeable materials on the lens of eyeglasses and the other commercial sensor and wireless system is embedded in the frame of eyeglasses for the material color changeable glass lens we use the previously reported electrochromic gel the electrochromic gel can change their colors by oxidation and reduction reactions in the ionic components of electrochromic gel by applying certain voltages to the electrochromic gel the characteristic of this gel is transparent and freestandable that we can easily apply these materials to the length of our glasses and then the when the 13 or more intensity of uv is detected but detected by uv sensor the systems the microcontroller actively applied the voltages to the electrochromic gel to change their colors so this uh device can change their colors to for the eyeglasses to the sunglasses and the reverse reaction can be up available just a question so this is a film which goes over the optical lenses yes so this is the result of a smart rear image of the smart electronic eyeglasses so incestuous sunglasses modes and some sensors and systems are embedded in the eyeglasses so the biosignal measurement electrodes are embedded here and very complemently contact to our bodies just wearing the eyeglasses and the commercial sensor and electronic recording systems are embedded the body of the eyeglasses so various type of biomaterial informations can can measure with the smart monitoring systems i will show this slide i will show the machine interface applications with commercial components so first is the color change of lens operation and second is motion detection with uh acceleration sensor so on the first uh human mesh interface applications we can measure the ambient uv intensity with the uv sensor of our system and when the uv intensity is detected by the sensor the system actively applied the voltages to operate the sunglasses so on the especially on the ee graph e figures the when the uv light is turned on the eyeglasses change the sunglasses in directly and the transmittance of sunglasses with the uv wavelength is extremely low so this figure this result shows that the sunglasses mode can actually protect our eyes from the uv radiations so this kind of applications can be used for our daily life and also for the using the displays with the ar and vr technologies the second is motion detections so we're combining the three different components of each axis data together and we figure out the different motion differences patterns such as working and running and stand sit down and stand up like that so we recognize the emergency situations such as the falling down so these applications can be used for the patient who needs help when they're falling down these wearable devices can contact their families with the smartphone and you use it just a three-axis accelerometer no gyro no compass just no okay here shows the human machine interface with the brain activity results we also successfully measure the brain activities with such as alpha rhythms and we apply the this technologies with the direction controls so for the human machine applications with the eeg signals we had a direction control that actually uh generally on the humans when see the see the certain frequency of the visual stimulations the brain modulated with the same frequency of the visual stimulation and we can detect the peak of the stimulation that we call this ssbp visually stimulation steady state visually stimulate evoked potentials so we use this technology when the subjects want to select the right directions the subjects stared at for a while for the 14 heads so if the subject shows these uh stimulations their brain modulate with the 14 headers so we can measure the 14 hertz of the peak with the frequency areas and we use this peak signal with the command signal to for the direction control so this kind of technology is quite common in the brain company interface areas and we also demo with this kind of technology with the eyeglasses so this this is for useful for the patients who can moving their limbs freely and also it can useful for the ar or br technologies this is shows the human motion interface with the eyeglasses eye activities the eog signals the eog signal is quite clear signals such as our heart activities so so this eog signal has much advantages to use as a command signal to manipulate the machines so the sakari eye movement which is one of the eog signals the sakurai eye movement is a electrical signal that occurs when the eyes moves quickly left to right and right to left so as you can see here the sig and the amplitude and shape of the sakaragai movements is depending on the angles eye movements angles and directions so as you can see here you can figure out the difference shape of the left signal and the right signals so we use this technologies we measure the ichi sakariya movement signals up to 40 degrees by the 10 degrees and we classify it so with this result we apply this technology to the very very basic game controls the tetris uh block movements so when the subjects uh shows subjects moves their eyes 20 degrees the block moves one step and 40 degrees it moves two steps so here's just the eog signals and we control the blocks in real time something like that so this is the kind of very basic applications with the usg signals but we chose the possibility with the eog signals to manipulate the mushes by just wearing our eyeglasses and moving our eyes so conclusion uh i have introduced the promising personalized head one devices for practical healthcare applications of the first is in your ego phone and second is multifunctional smart eye glasses both devices are combining biosignal measurement sensors with a personal device and the characteristic of this device is 3d printing and customizable design for anyone and very simple and convenient and comfort to using for anyone to use and the appearance is very reasonable for in daily life using also many kinds of has information can be detected from the head the system is fully wearable due to the wireless system so i think this two head one biosignal devices is promising for health care areas for pci and hmi areas before i finish the presentation i'm gonna introduce uh briefly for my research topic of summer internship i'm currently trying to fabricating the wearable stress detection detector with the biosignals we usually feel the stress stressful but we just thinking about is not a big deal but the chronic stress can be a serious uh disease so so our body feels uh some some stress the body uh makes some symptoms like anxiety anger and headache something like that so and then according to some surveys more than 75 percent of the u.s authors report that they have a at least one symptoms of the stress and more surprisingly more than uh 85 percent of disease are related to the stress so almost all kinds of diseases are related to our stress so it is very important to know and manage our individual stress level so the stress level detector is highly record highly required in future daily life so among the according to the previous reported papers there are some kinds of biosignals related to our stress level so i among the among those biosignals i choose three three bio signals the eeg and ecg and the gsr the skin conductance that's because these three bio signals are deeply related to the our healthy life and also the stress level so i tried to measure the fully wearable in-ear biometric stress detector and i used the form factor as a earphone type as i mentioned above and especially i motivated with the sporty type of commercial earphone that's because this type of earphone have a lot of content areas of our heads and it can stabilize fixes this device on our head so i use this uh form factor and some of the bio signal measurements electrodes are attached near the ear and our neck so ultimately our research core our research goal is to alert our users when the user have a high stress level and drives them to rest and release the stress so we are working on the we are now working on with the kite paper and uh actually uh currently our in progress is just trying to acquiring the bio signals the eeg and ecg and gsr and actually we need some machine learning technologies so i would like to collaborate with the expert of the machine learning and familiar to biosignal signal processing so please contact me anyone who interested in this topic with this email address yes thank you for listening you think uh so going back to the linear electrodes you did the you did the electronics right yes tell me a little bit about the analog part and what kind of a2d converter you use it what is the the gain of that differential amplifier okay oh yes the gain is about 3 000 gain is applied for measuring the eeg signals with i met i use the operation amplifier with the amplifications yes what is the bandwidth of the band pass filter uh fantastic filter is a third uh degree of the uh butterworth whatever's been passed filters so it is one half to 35 health uh the band pass error to 35 order butterworth for both low pass and for for high pass you have separate quarterback yes yes nice so your input signal is in the magnitude of 10 micro volts yes yes with 3 000 it goes 300 millivolts yes yes okay this is already now good for day to day yes you go to the next slide i'm interested to know where the census and the references are next slide yeah so i um i did some sensor position test so for uh for the ground electrodes and reference electrodes i fixed it upward and downwards and i changed the uh each direction of source electrodes like that so as i found that when for this position is very best for detect eeg inside the ear have you uh collected experiments when the subjects moved their eyes oh yes yes uh the eyes movement is detected inside the eeg signals but it can reduce reject with signal processing yes i understand that your configuration of where the electrodes are it's also optimal for eog oh so you ended up getting a lot of eog just because of the configuration oh yes yes because you're picking exactly that dipole oh yes so as you mentioned the eog sum of eog is detected inside the eeg signals but we can reject the kind of eog signals inside the eeg signals yeah and the same question about ecg so in your last design you have your in-ear electrodes for eeg yes and your residues right electrodes are here yes i'm pretty sure you'll see plenty of ecg in the image electrodes how you deal with that uh actually i separate the measuring system of the i use the two two band pass filters with the ecg and eegs so i separately measure the analog signals to microcontroller so it's not that yeah measuring she is a very broadband signal compared to eeg pretty much the bandwidth of the electrical geographic signal is all over the place for of the eeg uh actually uh i i have the same example here which the basically the health activity was projected on this on this line actually uh for my experiments i cannot find the uh ecg signals inside the ear so uh interesting yes they'll be not that problem down here because we couldn't find it in the ear so so even with even with filtering you couldn't couldn't parse it out so which is contrary to what you told me two weeks ago or three a month ago where you said it was going to be so strong it was going to drown everything out we had just the opposite challenge so maybe so so this is an area where maybe we have some learnings to do or there needs to be some you know some deep deep uh signal processing we'll also separate out mg2 so in magnetometers you pick it up anywhere but eeg that's not necessarily the case but in a more general sense there's no reason why you only have one sensor on the right since you have this two channel on the left you should just do it legit generic two by two and then just work out what type of signals that you actually want that's where and and then go from there you don't have to say that's a reference in the ground because your sensory profile would be different you can treat that as a beamformer so any more questions colleagues the earwax is that an insulator or a conductor i mean does that make it signal degrade over time after we wear this all day uh actually at the long term measurements experiments is not conducted there i think the for the ear measurements there's some uh generate some heat from inside our body so i'm not sure about that but the electrodes is very dry type of electrodes so when the sweat is exposed by the our skin it doesn't matter to measure the signals yeah it's also cultural dependent so depending on on ethnicity um their conductivity their form of the e-wax is different the density of the facilities yeah and caucasians more liquid and there's the fifth percentile shrek right help you yeah i just have a question wearing the ssvp uh stimulation so uh did you display it on the glasses or just uh uh yes averaging for the pst how much was it how long oh it's uh we measure the 30 uh seconds yeah so it's there so it's one subject it's one trial 30 seconds yes yes yes it's quite long but your eyes are left right yeah yeah so it's basically an overt concentrated floating person yeah if you don't see anything more questions um i guess yeah i see the mechanical and sensor setup but do you have results at this point or not kind of research yeah i mean are you able to classify so eyes open closed like blinks can you do blinks i mean i'm trying to see what's the limit of what you can see on the previous slides you were seeing eye blinks yes you know some other times these experiments we instructed subjects to stay stay their eyes in yeah yeah so we reject the eye clicking and blinking like that so yeah for our measurements yeah okay and you have a place where you want this to end up like are you trying to drive the signal processing to a point where you can pick up more things or were you kind of finished with your study what's yeah more questions if not let's thank our speaker again you
