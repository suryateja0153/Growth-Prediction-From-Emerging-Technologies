 uh another question from twitter will you be able to save and replay memories in the future uh yes i think uh in the future you will be able to save and replay memories um and this is obviously sounding increasingly like a black mirror episode but uh well i guess they're pretty good predicting um but yeah essentially if you have a whole rain interface everything that's encoded in memory you could you could upload you could basically store your memories um as a backup and restore the memories um then ultimately you could potentially download them into a new body or into a robot body the future's gonna be weird
