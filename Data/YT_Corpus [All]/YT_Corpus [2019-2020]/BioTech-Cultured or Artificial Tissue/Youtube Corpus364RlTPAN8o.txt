 an oncolytic virus is a virus that preferentially infects and kills cancer cells as the infected cancer cells are destroyed by oncologists they release new infectious virus particles or variants to help destroy the remaining tumor Uncle edik viruses are thought not only to cause direct destruction of the tumor cells but also to stimulate hosts anti-tumor immune system responses the potential of viruses as anti-cancer agents was first realised in the early 20th century although coordinated research efforts did not begin until the 1960s a number of viruses including adenovirus reowww virus measles herpes simplex Newcastle disease virus and vaccinia have been clinically tested as oncolytic agents most current oncolytic viruses are engineered for tumor selectivity although there are naturally-occurring examples such as Rio virus in the seneca virus resulting in clinical trials the first oncolytic virus to be approved by a national regulatory agency was genetically unmodified echo 7 strain enterovirus r IG VI are approved in latvia in 2004 for the treatment of skin melanoma it was subsequently approved in Georgia and Armenia and oncolytic adenovirus are genetically modified adenovirus named H 101 was approved in China in 2005 for the treatment of head and neck cancer in 2015 tolima gene la her pelvic on Kovacs t-vec an oncolytic herpes virus which is a modified herpes simplex virus became the first oncolytic virus to be approved for use in the US and European Union for the treatment of advanced inoperable melanoma topic history connection between cancer regression and viruses has long been theorized and case reports of regression noted in cervical cancer Burkitt lymphoma and Hodgkin lymphoma after immunization or infection with an unrelated virus appeared at the beginning of the 20th century efforts to treat cancer through immunization or verow therapy deliberate infection with a virus began in the mid 20th century as the technology for creating a custom virus did not exist all early efforts focused on finding natural oncolytic viruses during the 1960's promising research involved using polio virus adenovirus coxsackievirus eco enterovirus r IG vir and others the early complications were occasional cases of uncontrolled infection resulting in significant morbidity and mortality the very frequent development of an immune response while harmless to the patient destroyed the virus and thus prevented it from destroying the cancer only certain cancers could be treated through verow therapy was also recognized very early even when a response was seen these responses were neither complete nor durable the field of aero therapy was nearly abandoned for a time as the technology required to modify viruses didn't exist in chemotherapy and radiotherapy technology enjoy early success however now these technologies have been thoroughly developed cancer is still a major cause of mortality and there is still a need for novel cancer therapies this sidelined therapy has now gained renewed interest topic herpes simplex virus herpes simplex virus HSV was one of the first viruses to be adapted to attack cancer cells selectively because it was well understood easy to manipulate and relatively harmless it's natural state merely causing cold sores so likely to pose fewer risks the herpes simplex virus type 1 hsv-1 mutant 1716 lacks both copies of the ICP 34.5 gene and as a result is no longer able to replicate in terminally differentiated and non-dividing cells but will infect and cause lysis very efficiently in cancer cells and this has proved to be an effective tumor targeting strategy in a wide range of in vivo cancer models the HSV 1 7 1 6 virus has induced tumor regression and increased survival times in 1996 the first approval was given in Europe for a clinical trial using the oncolytic virus HSV 1 7 1 6 from 1997 to 2003 strain HSV 1 7 1 6 was injected into tumors of patients with glioblastoma multiforme a highly malignant brain tumor with no evidence of toxicity or side effects and some long-term survivors other safety trials have used HSV 1 7 1 6 to treat patients with melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck since then other studies have shown that the outer coating of HSV one seven one six variants can be targeted to specific types of cancer cells and can be used to deliver a variety of additional genes into cancer cells such as genes to split a harmless pro drug inside cancer cells to release toxic chemotherapy or genes which command infected cancer cells to concentrate protein tagged with radioactive iodine so that individual cancer cells are killed by micro dose radiation as well as by virus induced cell lysis other oncolytic viruses based on HSV have also been developed and are in clinical trials one that has been approved by the FDA for advanced melanoma is Amgen's tolima gene la her pelvic topic on Corinne H 101 the first oncolytic virus to be approved by a regulatory agency was a genetically modified adenovirus named h 101 by shanghai sunway biotech it gained regulatory approval in 2005 from China's State Food and Drug Administration s FDA for the treatment of head and neck cancer son ways H 101 and the very similar onyx 15 have been engineered to remove a viral defense mechanism that interacts with a normal human gene p53 which is very frequently dysregulated in cancer cells despite the promises of early in vivo lab work these viruses do not specifically infect cancer cells but they still kill cancer cells preferentially while overall survival rates are not known short-term response rates are approximately doubled for H 101 plus chemotherapy when compared to chemotherapy alone it appears to work best when injected directly into a tumor and when any resulting fever is not suppressed systemic therapy such as through infusion through an intravenous line is desirable for treating metastatic disease it is now marketed under the brand name on Corinne topic mechanisms of action topic immunotherapy with advances in cancer immunotherapy such as immune checkpoint inhibitors increased attention has been given to using oncolytic viruses to increase anti-tumor immunity there are two main considerations of the interaction between oncolytic viruses and the immune system topic immunity is an obstacle a major obstacle to the success of oncolytic viruses is the patient immune system which naturally attempts to deactivate any virus this can be a particular problem for intravenous injection where the virus must first survive interactions with the blood complement and neutralizing antibodies it has been shown that immuno suppression by chemotherapy and inhibition of the complement system can enhance oncolytic virus therapy pre-existing immunity can be partly avoided by using viruses that are not common human pathogens however this does not avoid subsequent antibody generation yet some studies have shown that pre immunity to oncolytic viruses doesn't cause a significant reduction in efficacy alternatively the viral vector can be coated with a polymer such as polyethylene glycol shielding it from antibodies but this also prevents viral coat proteins adhering to host cells another way to help oncolytic viruses reach cancer growths after intravenous injection is to hide them inside macrophages a type of white blood cell macrophages automatically migrate to areas of tissue destruction especially where oxygen levels are low characteristic of cancer growths and have been used successfully to deliver on coletek viruses to prostate cancer in animals topic immunity is an ally although it poses a hurdle by inactivating viruses the patient's immune system can also act as an ally against tumors infection attracts the attention of the immune system to the tumor and may help to generate useful and long-lasting anti-tumor immunity this essentially produces a personalized cancer vaccine many cases of spontaneous remission of cancer have been recorded though not fully understood they are thought likely to be a result of a sudden immune response or infection efforts to induce this phenomenon have used cancer vaccines derived from cancer cells or selected cancer antigens or direct treatment with immune stimulating factors on skin cancers some oncolytic viruses are very immuno genic and may by infection of the tumor elicit an anti-tumor immune response especially viruses delivering cytokines or other immune stimulating factors viruses selectively infect tumor cells because of their defective antiviral response allergic an attenuated herpes simplex virus has been genetically engineered to replicate preferentially within tumor cells and to generate antigens that elicit an immune response topic on coletek behavior of wild-type viruses topic vaccinia virus vaccinia virus v AC v is arguably the most successful live bio therapeutic agent because of its critical role in the eradication of smallpox one of the most deadly diseases in human history long before the smallpox eradication campaign was launched v AC V was exploited as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of cancer in 1922 Levada T and Niccolo reported that v AC V was able to inhibit the growth of various tumors in mice and rats this was the first demonstration of viral oncologists in the laboratory this virus was subsequently shown to selectively infect and destroy tumor cells with great potency while sparing normal cells both in cell cultures and in animal models since vaccinia virus has long been recognized as an ideal backbone for vaccines due to its potent antigen presentation capability this combines well with its natural uncle edik activities is an oncolytic virus for cancer immunotherapy topic vesicular stomatitis virus vesicular stomatitis virus vsv is a rhabdo virus consisting of five genes encoded by a negative sense single-stranded RNA genome in nature vsv infects insects as well as livestock where it causes a relatively localized and non-fatal illness the low pathogenicity of this virus is due in large part to its sensitivity to interferons a class of proteins that are released into the tissues and bloodstream during infection these molecules activate genetic antiviral defense programs that protect cells from infection and prevent spread of the virus however in 2000 steidel licked eared owl demonstrated that defects in these pathways render cancer cells unresponsive to the protective effects of interferons and therefore highly sensitive to infection with vsv since vsv undergoes a rapid cytolytic replication cycle infection leads to death of the malignant cell and roughly a 1,000 fold amplification of virus within 24 hours vsv is therefore highly suitable for therapeutic application and several groups have gone on to show that systemic lis administered vsv can be delivered to a tumor site where it replicates and induces disease regression often leading to durable cures attenuation of the virus by engineering a deletion of met 51 of the matrix protein ablates virtually all infection of normal tissues while replication in tumor cells is unaffected recent research has shown that this virus has the potential to cure brain tumors thanks to its oncolytic properties poliovirus poliovirus is a natural invasive neurotropic virus making it the obvious choice for selective replication in tumors derived from neuronal cells poliovirus has a plus strand RNA genome the translation of which depends on a tissue specific internal ribosome entry site iers within the five feet untranslated region of the viral genome which is active in cells of neuronal origin and allows translation of the viral genome without a five-feet cap Gro Meyer at our 2,000 replaced the normal poliovirus iers with a rhinovirus iers altering tissue specificity the resulting pv-1 our IPO virus was able to selectively destroy malignant glioma cells while leaving normal neuronal cells untouched topic reowww virus REO viruses an acronym for respiratory enteric orphan virus generally infect mammalian respiratory and bowel systems most people have been exposed to REO virus by adulthood however the infection does not typically produce symptoms the link to the REO viruses oncolytic ability was established after it was discovered to reproduce well in various cancer cell lines and Lissa's these cells REO listen is a formulation of REO virus that is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of various cancers topic seneca virus seneca virus also known as Seneca Valley virus is a naturally occurring wild-type oncolytic picornavirus discovered in 2001 as a tissue culture contaminated genetic therapy Inc the initial isolate svv 0:01 is being developed as an antique Lance a therapeutic by Neotropics Inc under the name in TXO 104 cancers with neuro endocrine features including small cell lung cancer in a variety of pediatric solid tumors topic r IG vir our IG vir is a drug that was approved by the state agency of medicines of the Republic of Latvia in 2004 it is wild-type echo 7 a member of echovirus family the potential use of echo virus as an ankh oolitic virus to treat cancer was discovered by latvian scientist aina muceniece in the 1960s and 1970s the data used to register the drug in latvia is not sufficient to obtain approval to use it in the US Europe or Japan as of 2017 there was no good evidence that our IG vir is an effective cancer treatment on march 19th 2019 the manufacturer of echo 7 CLA tima announced the drugs removal from sale in latvia quoting financial and strategic reasons and insufficient profitability however several days later an investigative TV show revealed that state agency of medicines had run laboratory tests on the vials and found that the amount of echo 7 virus is of a much smaller amount than claimed by the manufacturer according to agency lab director it's like buying what you think is lemon juice but finding that what you have is lemon flavoured water in March 2019 the distribution of echo 7 in latvia has been stopped topic sem leaky forest virus sem leaky forest virus sfv is a virus that naturally infects cells of the central nervous system and causes in careful itis a genetically engineered form has been pre clinically tested as a non coletek virus against a severe brain tumor type glioblastoma the sfv was genetically modified with micro no target sequences so that it only replicated in brain tumor cells and not in normal brain cells the modified virus reduced tumor growth and prolonged survival of mice with brain tumors the modified virus was also found to efficiently kill human glioblastoma tumor cell lines topic other the murabba virus first identified in brazilian sandflies is being tested clinically topic engineering oncolytic viruses topic directed evolution an innovative approach of development termed directed evolution involves the creation of new viral variants or serotypes specifically directed against tumor cells via rounds of directed selection using large populations of randomly generated recombinant precursor viruses the increased biodiversity produced by the initial homologous recombination step provides a large random pool of viral candidates which can then be passed through a series of selection steps designed to lead towards a pre-specified outcome eg higher tumor specific activity without requiring any previous knowledge of the resultant viral mechanisms that are responsible for that outcome the pool of resultant oncolytic viruses can then be further screened in preclinical models to select a non coletek virus with the desired therapeutic characteristics directed evolution was applied on human adenovirus one of many viruses that are being developed as oncolytic agents to create a highly selective and yet potent oncolytic vaccine as a result of this process Khaled won a novel chimeric member of the group B adenoviruses was generated this hybrid of adenovirus serotypes at 11 P and AB 3 shows much higher potency in tumors selectivity than the control viruses including AD 5 at 11 P and ad 3 and was confirmed to generate approximately two logs more viral progeny on freshly isolated human colon tumor tissue than on matching normal tissue topic attenuation attenuation involves deleting viral genes or gene regions to eliminate viral functions that are expendable in tumor cells but not in normal cells thus making the virus safer and more tumor specific cancer cells and virus infected cells have similar alterations in their cell signaling pathways particularly those that govern progression through the cell cycle viral gene whose function is to alter a pathway is dispensable in cells where the pathway is defective but not in cells where the pathway is active the enzymes thymidine kinase and ribonucleotide reductase in cells are responsible for DNA synthesis and are only expressed in cells which are actively replicating these enzymes also exist in the genomes of certain viruses eg HSV vaccinia and allow viral replication in quiescent non replicating cells so if they are inactivated by mutation the virus will only be able to replicate in proliferating cells such as cancer cells topic tumor targeting there are two main approaches for generating tumors selectivity transduction 'el and non-transactional targeting transduction 'el targeting involves modifying the viral coat proteins to target tumor cells while reducing entry to non tumor cells this approach to tumor selectivity has mainly focused on adenoviruses in hsv-1 although it is entirely viable with other viruses non transduction or targeting involves altering the genome of the virus so it can only replicate in cancer cells most frequently as part of the attenuation of the virus transcription targeting can also be used where critical parts of the viral genome are placed under the control of a tumor specific promoter a suitable promoter should be active in the tumor but inactive in the majority of normal tissue particularly the liver which is the organ that is most exposed to blood-borne viruses many such promoters have been identified and studied for the treatment of a range of cancers similarly viral replication can be finely tuned with the use of micro neurs mirna artificial target sites or myrna response element mres differential expression of miRNAs between healthy tissues and tumors permit to engineer on coletek viruses d targeted from certain tissues of interest while allowing its replication in the tumor cells double targeting with both transduction 'el and non transduction or targeting methods is more effective than any one form of targeting alone topic reporter genes both in the laboratory and in the clinic it is useful to have a simple means of identifying cells infected by the experimental virus this can be done by equipping the virus with reporter genes not normally present in viral genomes which encode easily identifiable protein markers one example of such proteins is GFP green fluorescent protein which when present in infected cells will cause a fluorescent green light to be emitted when stimulated by blue light an advantage of this method is that it can be used on live cells and in patients with superficial infected lesions it enables rapid non-invasive confirmation of viral infection another example of a visual marker useful in living cells is luciferase an enzyme from the firefly which in the presence of luciferin emits light detectable by specialized cameras the e.coli enzymes beta glucuronidase and beta galactosidase can also be encoded by some viruses these enzymes in the presence of certain substrates can produce intense colored compounds useful for visualizing infected cells and also for quantifying gene expression topic patients to improve oncolytic activity on coletek viruses can be used against cancers in ways that are additional to lysis of infected cells topic suicide genes viruses can be used as vectors for delivery of suicide genes encoding enzymes that can metabolize a separately administered non-toxic Pro drug into a potent saito toxin which can diffuse to in kill neighboring cells one herpes simplex virus encoding a thymidine kinase suicide gene has progressed to phase 3 clinical trials the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase phosphorylates the pro drug ganciclovir which is then incorporated into DNA blocking DNA synthesis the tumor selectivity of oncolytic viruses ensures that the suicide genes are only expressed in cancer cells however our bystander effect on surrounding tumor cells has been described with several suicide gene systems topic suppression of angiogenesis angiogenesis blood vessel formation is an essential part of the formation of large tumor masses angiogenesis can be inhibited by the expression of several genes which can be delivered to cancer cells in viral vectors resulting in suppression of angiogenesis and oxygen starvation in the tumor the infection of cells with viruses containing the genes for angio Stabbin an Ender statin synthesis inhibitor tumor growth in mice enhanced anti tumor activities have been demonstrated in a recombinant vaccinia virus encoding anti-angiogenic therapeutic antibody and with an HSV one seven one six variant expressing an inhibitor of angiogenesis topic radioiodine addition of the sodium iodide symporter nice gene to the viral genome causes infected tumor cells to express nests and accumulate iodine when combined with radioiodine therapy it allows local radiotherapy of the tumor as used to treat thyroid cancer the radio iodine can also be used to visualize viral replication within the body by the use of a gamma camera this approach has been used successfully pre clinically with adenovirus measles virus and vaccinia virus topic approved therapeutic agents Tolima gene la her pelvic on Kovacs gm-csf aka t-vec by Amgen successfully completed phase 3 trials for advanced melanoma in March 2013 in October 2015 the US FDA approved t-vec with the brand name in logic for the treatment of melanoma in patients with inoperable tumors becoming the first approved oncolytic agent in the Western world it is based on herpes simplex virus HSV one it has also been tested in a phase one trial for pancreatic cancer and a phase three trial in head and neck cancer together with cisplatin chemotherapy and radiotherapy topic on Collette viruses in conjunction with existing cancer therapies it is in conjunction with conventional cancer therapies that oncolytic viruses have often showed the most promise since combined therapies operate synergistically with no apparent negative effects topic clinical trials on EXO 1-5 underwent trials in conjunction with chemotherapy before it was abandoned in the early 2000s the combined treatment gave a greater response than either treatment alone but the results were not entirely conclusive vaccinia virus GL ONC 1 was studied in a trial combined with chemo and radiotherapy a standard of care for patients newly diagnosed with head and neck cancer herpes simplex virus adenovirus REO virus and neuron leukemia virus are also undergoing clinical trials as a part of combination therapies topic preclinical research chair Natal 2001 used cv 706 a prostate-specific adenovirus in conjunction with radiotherapy on prostate cancer in mice the combined treatment resulted in a synergistic increase in cell death as well as a significant increase in viral burst size the number of virus particles released from each cell lysis no alteration in viral specificity was observed SCP re h vir h sv one seven one six has also shown synergy in preclinical research when used in combination with several cancer chemo therapies the anti-angiogenesis drug Bevis ism abbe anti-vegf antibody has been shown to reduce the inflammatory response to oncolytic HSV and improve the roa therapy in mice a modified oncolytic vaccinia virus encoding a single Chane anti-vegf antibody mimicking Bevis ism abbe was shown to have significantly enhanced anti tumour activities than parental virus in animal models topic in fiction in science fiction the concept of a non coletek virus was first introduced to the public in Jack williamson's novel dragon's island published in 1951 although Williamson's imaginary virus was based on a bacteriophage rather than a mammalian virus Dragons island is also known for being the source of the term genetic engineering the plot of the Hollywood film I am Legend is based on the premise that a worldwide epidemic was caused by a viral cure for cancer in the Fox Broadcasting Company TV series house season 2 episode 19 a strain of herpes simplex virus
