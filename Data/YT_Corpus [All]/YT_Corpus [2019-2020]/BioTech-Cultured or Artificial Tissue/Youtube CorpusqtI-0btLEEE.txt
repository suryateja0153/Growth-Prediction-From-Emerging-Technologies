 [Music] hi welcome to this particular module and as we have seen the last module about cells let us see in this model what is cell culture alright so if you talk about cell culture it is defined as a process of cultivating cells and tissues outside the body of an organism and when you do that is called ex vivo so if I take the let's say a tissue from an animal and study the tissue is called ex vivo study or XY was study alright and if we are studying the cells are we are growing the cells on a petri dish or yes we are studying we are growing a organoid on a petri dish and we are then loading it in a device or studying that particular organ odds or cell in an artificial environment it is called in vitro okay in vivo is where in D we are studying the tissues or we are studying these cells within the body alright within the body outside the body in the laboratory so in vivo ex vivo in vitro this is easy way of understanding but if you want to define it the body cell culture then we have to understand it's a process of cultivating cells and tissues outside the body of an organism in an artificial environment like a petri dish which replicates the in vivo conditions such as what are the conditions temperature nutrition and protecting from invading microorganisms and when you are talking about invading microorganisms the invading microorganisms for the cells are bacteria which we call bacterial infection virus which we call viral infection so the any to the cells are bacteria and viruses okay so then we have to create an environment which will replicate the in vivo situation the situation within the body such as temperature nutrition the co2 concentration the humidity the oxygen concentration right and to protect those cells when we are growing in the laboratory against microorganisms such as bacteria you got it so that is the definition of a cell culture so let us go back to the slide which we see is cells and tissue cultures are terms that are used interchangeably and basically denotes the cells or cluster of cells in vitro that means that I can say cell culture or I can say tissue culture that are used interchangeably because group of cells will form a tissue group of cells can form organoid group of cells came from spheroid group of cells that's why we can say a tissue culture or we can say a cell culture cool so let us see who discovered first time cell culture it was first successfully undertaken by Ross Harrison in 1907 and this is just a trivia and just for information and the cells may be removed from the tissue directly called primary culture and this aggregated by enzymatic or mechanical methods before cultivation or they may be derived from a cell line that has already been established by three methods how first is if I take the tissue and if I do the enzymatic reaction then the cells will this aggregate it will separate aggregation coming together this aggregation separating out so if I use enzymatic reaction I can this aggregate those cells second is I can use a mechanical way of this aggregating those cells third thing is I can derive further cells from the existing cell line it's three ways of doing it and all three ways are given or illustrated in the next slide which is right over here and you can see here the first one let us let us understand this particular flow so you have an organ cells can be isolated or you can say the the disaggregated by enzymatic and mechanical actions so you can see cells here now you had to grow the cells right and the growing of cell is because of the cell division that we as in the last module and when the cell reaches to a state which is about 80 percent of its maximum capacity we say it's a confluent culture confluent culture this this this value changes from a lab to lab but but in general it is close to 80 percent okay so now we have confluence cells then what we do we have to do a secondary culture or a primary cell line that means that we will subculture it when we subculture it and we against card growing the things it is called secondary cell line we keep on sub culturing it until the cell division continues up to finite division that means that one time we have done the cell culture right see here you have taken the cells you have culture it this is first time then you have confluent so you can do a second subculture so you can say second time then you are again doing it we say third time again doing it for time in it fifth time but at some point you will see that further the cells would not divide so it is only limited to finite divisions okay this is one way of doing it and we are talking about primary culture the second way of doing is we have organ or a tumor and cells are isolated from tumor and there further culture here and we keep on culturing further you see so again the cells division continues up to invite definite divisions in this case all right but at some point we are losing the property of the original tissues so I we had to restrict ourselves for few of the sub cultures and then we had to change the cell line the primary cell line right alway can generate another group of cells from the tissue and we will see by how can we understand the the effect of effect of drugs whereas the effect of drugs since we are talking about cancer we say chemotherapy drug see a GMO chemo therapy drugs or we say immunotherapy immuno therapy drugs or we say combinational therapy combi nest not therapy all right so we want to understand from a group of drugs for chemotherapy which group we had to use or I want to understand from the group of drugs existing for immunotherapy which one I have to used or combination therapy which one I had to use then I had to understand the cell culture I had to use the different drugs onto the cell to understand which drug is more efficient or which has a better efficacy for a particular tumor of ours and we can also design a patient-centric what is that patient centric okay patient-centric device for testing or for screaming patient-centric device for screening SC AR e e screaming ni ng right screening different drugs the idea is that if you have a three approved drugs by a drug authority right and if a patient comes with her with a problem or it's diagnosed with let's say breast cancer so out of the approved drug which struck we have to use for that particular patient right we need to know which Turk I can use for a given patient and for that do we have a patient centric platform or we are just relying that through the last patient showed a better response to a drug number three right and that's why for the next patient I will continue with doc number three out of three drugs available so how we can come up with a engineering solution and that means that can we design a patient centric platform all right so that is an idea that what we you had to understand and we want to discuss okay I'll move to the next slide and we need to understand few terminologies so so what I said is that we will be discussing that patients and take platforms and those designs at some point in these lectures all right series of lectures so when you talk about terminologies we have first term called primary cell culture and that term is when cells surgically removed from an organism placed in a this is this is wrong sentence when cells are such as the moon from an organ not organism okay from an organ placed in in a suitable cell culture environment at each divide and grow they are called primary cell culture okay so when you take out the cells from an organ and then so when you say organ organ being said finally organized like tissues tissues forms organ so you take out the cells from the tissue and when take out the sets of the tissue and you place in a suitable culture culture environment what will happen you will HEA attach to each other it will start dividing and will start growing right and that is called your primary cell culture for the second definition second definition is cell line so what is a line where the primary cell culture is subculture and they demonstrate then ability to propagate indefinitely right you can keep on growing next subsets of cells next one next one is adherent cells and adherent cells are when cell grows as a mono layer attaching themself to the substrate like glass or plastic it is also called Anchorage I encourage dependence alright so this is the mono layer okay understand this very clearly adarand cells are when cells grow as mono layer attaching themselves to a substrate which is glass or plastic and it's also called anchorage dependence next word a next term is confluence the term confluence is used as an estimate of the number of adarand cells in a culture disk flask and refers to the proportion of the surface is covered by cells we we told you right I told you write that in the in the earlier slide you see a term called confluent you see a confluent culture right that's what we are discussing here confluence a term used as an estimate of number of adren cells what is Error in cells yeah just seen here right in a culture and refers to a proportion of the surface cover cells that's why I said 80% 85% of the surface covered we have to again subculture the cells next is passaging or passing and the process of splitting of sub culturing of the cells is called passaging easy right terms are very easy to understand very easy to remember so if I want to understand now the tissue culture process flow what are the tissue culture process flow let us see in the slide ok so let's see let me let me term like this one and this is to let us first see first one which is number one so what will do we will isolate our tissue will dissect right so selection of required tissue removal of fatty and necrotic cells and then what we'll do three things one is fine dissection by chopping down explain size that means when you buy chopping other tissue further or we will take out the cells using mechanical D disaggregation or we will take out the cells using enzymatic this aggregation right then if I use the fine dissection dissection then I have primary implants further if I go down I can have explained or I can have outer growth if I have explained I can transfer it and then I can do the secondary explained called if I use for the outgrow then you can do subculture and it forms a cell line what it we have seen this part and same thing goes for this part right now let us see the mechanical way the mechanical way of these disaggregating cells will lead us to dispersed primary culture which will further subculture and you can have a cell line simple right when you talk about enzymatic disaggregation then there are three things one is called cold trypsin second is called vom trypsin third is called collagenous and the process is called trypsin ization trypsin ization all right either you do with coal trypsin or use one trypsin and or you use collagenous if I want to use cold trypsin then I have to overnight cold short incubation if I want to use warm trypsin how to use long incubation and repeat sampling well if I use collagenous then long incubation and complete medium after that I will centrifuge the cells so that I can get the cells at the bottom of the centrifuge device I will resuspend and seed the cells to form primary culture except subculture and I will have a cell line this is the process flow for tissue culture based on three techniques one is dip regeneration second is mechanical desegregation third one is find the section or dissections let us see the second one process flow very simple hmm here first is tissue explants are excised using sharps cable then mechanical deception by pestle and mortar then filtering using point 22 micrometer filter third next one is enzymatic digestion or trypsin or collagenous not rice in its trypsin okay trypsin T ry psi n trypsin next one is cells are counted on hemocytometer and he seeded into the media then we had to take a flask and we had to load 5 ml of cells into 25 centimeter square flasks next one we had to incubate this flask in a co2 incubator and when you do that what will happen the cells will start dividing attaching to each other and then we will reach a confluence state in about 2 to 3 days which is about 80% of confluency right I already discussed this thing last time that we have to attain 80% confluency when we are going to incubate the cells in a co2 incubator what what is incubator and what is co2 incubator this incubator has a properties like it we had to maintain 5% co2 there is a relativity of 95 percent relative humidity and then now the temperature is 37 degree centigrade this is more like the in vivo situation the situation within the body easy this is what is the tissue culture and if I further want to go and understand the sub culturing and cryopreservation what can I do so let us see the sub culture again I'll name sub culturing as one and cryopreservation s 2 so if I want to do sub culturing I had to process this but I had to follow this particular process alright first is a remove spent media from the cultural vessel at the preborn dissociation reach a reagent such as trypsin then they lock the container next is incubate the circle cell culture at room temperature then add equivalent well two volumes of preform complete growth medium then spread the cells into two to three flasks and incubate the cells so what exactly that means you had to take the cell so I will take the cells like this right or on this right then what I will do and then what I will do I will rock the container little bit rock the container then right then incubate the cell culture my cell at room temperature so then I will keep this for two minutes in room temperature after that add equivalent of two volumes of pre-warmed growth medium so I will take this one right this was the cells and then in that I will add the two volumes of pre-walk growth media then I'll take the cells and load into three different flasks okay so I load the cells here by taking from here I load here and I load here after loading I'll incubate the cells incubation is done in a co2 incubator at 37 degree centigrade five percent co2 ninety-five percent relative humidity okay now if I want to see cryopreservation what what does that mean that we had to preserve the cells for a long time for that first is remove the growth media and wash the cells by PBS and remove PBS by aspiration you ready with PBS so now what we have we only have cells then dissociate the cells by trypsin will add trypsin then delete the cells with growth medium we let the girl medium and then centrifuge at 200 G for five minutes at room temperature and remove the growth medium by aspirations now here the cell then withers resuspend the cells in one to two ml of freezing medium containing DMSO and finally transfer the cell to cryo walls cryo walls are the walls that can hold the cells for a longer time in a you know cryopreservation unit then we have to incubate gravels at minus 80 degree centigrade before we transfer next day the car walls into liquid nitrogen this is how we cryopreserve the cells now this is just the information okay we we have to just understand that there are this kind of techniques available by which we use the sub sub culturing and cryopreservation alright so this end of this particular module where we understood how this tissue culture process flow is all about and what exactly tissue culture means and then there are subdivisions of the or some of the terms or terminologies that are used in tissue culture in the next module we will see the advantage limitation of tissue culture application of tissue culture and then we will see how a culture lab setup looks like and and so on and so forth all right so till then you just read once again understand this lecture once again and then I'll see you in the next module have fun right just don't keep on reading have something for yourself leave your life enjoy your life go out play something do executive activities don't be a bookworm right very important to keep your physical health intact along with our mental health alright so learn these things have fun I'll see you in the next module take care
