 [Music] my name is Caitlin I am currently a group leader at d23 Institue of Faculty of Medicine in UCL my interest of a research currently in a lab is to understand signaling regulation of stem cells in skin and also the developments of skin tumor Genesis and our goal of a research is mainly to know how least signaling regulation will impact on the stem cell function and if anything goes around from the signaling regulation in stem cells which may cause a tumor so we would like to further understand how the signaling pathway regulation who impacts on the normal homeostasis and also the tumor development the skin is the largest organ of a human body and if you know your skin is constantly turned over so it's constantly regenerates and this regeneration is highly restricted by the stem cells in the regulation of the signaling the signaling is like a molecule like you can think about the proteins in your cells that proteins much smaller than cells and those molecule will tell the cells what you should do you should be quiet or you should get activated and turnover is means cells die and a new cell phone so this balance it's very important you have a cell dying when you need a new cells to replace but sometimes you cannot have too many cells to replace otherwise you may become a tumor eventually so in this case this regulation this balance is important so we are looking at lost signaling which is proteins and not just one protein decide what cell to do is a one protein tell another and the other tell another that's a color signaling cascade or a signaling transduction and this it's important to regulate the cell the function how the self going to behave I was born in Taiwan and the 90 my study undergraduate study and master in Taiwan the first initial motivation to become a scientist was during my undergraduates I did a study and one of the professor which had a course called biotechnology and that is a time I start knowing wow the biology is not just about you know about animal about the plant which is also a part which is about the molecule biology about cellular biology and all this biology can be the knowledge II can be used to human apply to human to make a better life for example can help to develop all the drugs to against disease and cancers and that was my initial motivation and later I moved to the US for my PhD study and post our training and I was working as a technician for one year at Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle and the mental the pub I said man professor it's really encouraged me to study a PhD and then I started in University of Washington and after my PhD before become independent you always need to go on to do a postdoc trainee then I moved to New York and I spent four years in New York and I met that wonderful Kali's came from all over the world and they all has very strong motivation can to want to advance our knowledge in different field in cancer in understanding of obesity in biology and that is know all experience I had to become me right now as an independent researcher [Music] you need to be very motivated so you've patiently dit and safe driven and the other critical point is you have to be well better to be very well organized a person and a clear mind and also the good logic because that's it's really critical points and the final one I think what's a wee shoe and I'm still trying to do better is not afraid of unknown because if you want to be a creative scientist you couldn't just work on what's already known and just built a little bit further but if you really want to have brace fighting you really have to be brave and try something really unknown I would say for young students really should know it's as early as they can because once you get your master you get your PhD then the door for you for your career development getting narrower and narrower so I'd rather to say if you are hesitating go to try briefly give yourself one year to check whether that's what you want if you realize the lease is not what you want I think you should think about doing something else because I don't encourage you every student should go out in this path because Emma pass has its difficulty but these paths is really neat to have a high motivation and dedicate your life [Music]
