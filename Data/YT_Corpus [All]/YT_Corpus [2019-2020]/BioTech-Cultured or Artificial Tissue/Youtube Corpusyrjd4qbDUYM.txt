 biotechnology as the broad area of biology involving living systems and organisms to develop or make products or any technological application that uses biological systems living organisms or derivatives thereof to make or modify products or processes for specific use UN Convention on Biological Diversity art - depending on the tools and applications it often overlaps with the related fields of molecular biology bioengineering biomedical engineering bio manufacturing molecular engineering etc for thousands of years humankind has used biotechnology in agriculture food production and medicine the term is largely believed to have been coined in 1919 by Hungarian engineer Karolyi Araki in the late 20th and early 21st centuries biotechnology has expanded to include new and diverse Sciences such as genomics recombinant gene techniques applied immunology and development of pharmaceutical therapies and diagnostic tests topic definitions the wide concept of biotech or biotechnology encompasses a wide range of procedures for modifying living organisms according to human purposes going back to domestication of animals cultivation of the plants and improvements to these through breeding programs that employ artificial selection and hybridization modern usage also includes genetic engineering as well as cell in tissue culture technologies the American Chemical Society defines biotechnology as the application of biological organisms systems or processes by various industries to learning about the science of life and the improvement of the value of materials and organisms such as pharmaceuticals crops and livestock for the european federation of biotechnology biotechnology as the integration of natural science and organisms cells parts thereof and molecular analogues for products and services biotechnology is based on the basic biological sciences eg molecular biology biochemistry cell biology embryology genetics microbiology and conversely provides methods to support and perform basic research in biology biotechnology as the research and development in the laboratory using bioinformatics for exploration extraction exploitation and production from any living organisms and any source of biomass by means of biochemical engineering where high value-added products could be planned reproduced by biosynthesis for example for casted formulated developed manufactured and marketed for the purpose of sustainable operations for the return from bottomless initial investment on R&D and gaining durable patents rights for exclusives rights for sales and prior to this to receive national and international approval from the results on animal experiment and human experiment especially on the pharmaceutical branch of biotechnology to prevent undetected side-effects or safety concerns by using the products the utilization of biological processes organisms or systems to produce products that are anticipated to improve human lives as termed biotechnology by contrast bioengineering is generally thought of as a related field that more heavily emphasizes higher systems approaches not necessarily the altering or using of biological materials directly for interfacing with and utilizing living things bioengineering is the application of the principles of engineering and Natural Sciences to tissues cells and molecules this can be considered as the use of knowledge from working with and manipulating biology to achieve a result that can improve functions in plants and animals relatedly biomedical engineering as an overlapping field that often draws upon and applies biotechnology by various definitions especially in certain subfields of biomedical or chemical engineering such as tissue engineering biopharmaceutical engineering and genetic engineering you topic history although not normally what first comes to mind many forms of human derived agriculture clearly fits a broad definition of utilizing a bio technological system to make products indeed the cultivation of plants may be viewed as the earliest biotechnological enterprise agriculture has been theorized to have become the dominant way of producing food since the Neolithic Revolution through early biotechnology the earliest farmers selected and bred the best suited crops having the highest yields to produce enough food to support a growing population as crops and fields became increasingly large and difficult to maintain it was discovered that specific organisms and their byproducts could effectively fertilize restore nitrogen and control pests throughout the history of Agriculture farmers have inadvertently altered the genetics of their crops through introducing them to new environments and breeding them with other plants one of the first forms of biotechnology these processes also were included in early fermentation of beer these processes were introduced in early Mesopotamia Egypt China and India and still use the same basic biological methods in brewing malted grains containing enzymes convert starch from grains into sugar and then adding specific yeasts to produce beer in this process carbohydrates in the grains broke down into alcohols such as ethanol later other cultures produced the process of lactic acid fermentation which produced other preserved foods such as soy sauce fermentation was also used in this time period to produce leavened bread although the process of fermentation was not fully understood until Louis Pasteur's work in 1857 it is still the first use of biotechnology to convert a food source into another form before the time of Charles Darwin's work and life animal and plant tests had already used selective breeding Darwin added to that body of work with his scientific observations about the ability of science to change species these accounts contributed to Darwin's theory of natural selection for thousands of years humans have used selective breeding to improve production of crops and livestock to use them for food in selective breeding organisms with desirable characteristics are mated to produce offspring with the same characteristics for example this technique was used with corn to produce the largest and sweetest crops in the early 20th century scientists gained a greater understanding of microbiology and explored ways of manufacturing specific products in 1917 hi I'm wise men first used a pure microbiological culture in an industrial process that of manufacturing cornstarch using Clostridium Osito butyl acum to produce acetone which the United Kingdom desperately needed to manufacture explosives during World War one biotechnology has also led to the development of antibiotics in 1928 Alexander Fleming discovered the mold Penicillium his work led to the purification of the antibiotic compound formed by the mold by Howard Florey ernst boris chain and Norman Heatley to form what we today know as penicillin in 1940 penicillin became available for medicinal use to treat bacterial infections in humans the field of modern biotechnology as generally thought of as having been born in 1971 when Paul Berg's Stanford experiments in gene splicing had early success Herbert W Boyer Univ Calif at San Francisco and Stanley n Cowan Stanford significantly advanced the new technology in 1972 by transferring genetic material into a bacterium such that the imported material would be reproduced the commercial viability of a biotechnology in this was significantly expanded On June 16 1980 when the United States Supreme Court ruled that a genetically modified microorganism could be patented in the case of diamond V chakrabarti indian-born ananda chakrabarti working for General Electric had modified a bacterium of the genus Pseudomonas capable of breaking down crude oil which he proposed to use in treating oil spills chakra Bardis work did not involve gene manipulation but rather the transfer of entire organelles between strains of the Pseudomonas bacterium revenue in the industry is expected to grow by twelve point nine percent in 2008 another factor influencing the biotechnology sector's success as improved intellectual property rights legislation an enforcement worldwide as well as strengthened demand for medical and pharmaceutical products to cope with an aging and ailing US population rising demand for biofuels is expected to be good news for the biotechnology sector with the Department of Energy estimating ethanol usage could reduce US petroleum derived fuel consumption by up to 30 percent by 2030 the biotechnology sector has allowed the US farming industry to rapidly increase its supply of corn and soybeans the main inputs into biofuels by developing genetically modified seeds that resist pests and droughts by increasing farm productivity biotechnology boosts biofuel production topic examples biotechnology has applications in four major industrial areas including health care medical crop production and agriculture non-food industrial uses of crops and other products eg biodegradable plastics vegetable oil biofuels and environmental uses for example one application of biotechnology as the directed use of organisms for the manufacture of organic products examples include beer and milk products another example is using naturally present bacteria by the mining industry in bio leaching biotechnology is also used to recycle treat waste cleanup sites contaminated by industrial activities bio remediation and also to produce biological weapons a series of derived terms have been coined to identify several branches of biotechnology for example bioinformatics also called gold biotechnology is an interdisciplinary field that addresses biological problems using computational techniques and makes the rapid organization as well as analysis of biological data possible the field may also be referred to as computational biology and can be defined as conceptualizing biology in terms of molecules and then applying informatics techniques to understand and organize the information associated with these molecules on a large scale bioinformatics plays a key role in various areas such as functional genomics structural genomics and proteomics and forms a key component in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical sector blue biotechnology is based on the exploitation of sea resources to create products and industrial applications this branch of biotechnology is the most used for the industries of refining and combustion principally on the production of bio oil x' with photosynthetic mic Algie green biotechnology as biotechnology applied to agricultural processes an example would be the selection and domestication of plants via micropropagation another example as the designing of transgenic plants to grow under specific environments in the presence or absence of chemicals one hope is that green biotechnology might produce more environmentally friendly solutions than traditional industrial agriculture an example of this as the engineering of a plant to express a pesticide thereby ending the need of external application of pesticides an example of this would be BT corn whether or not green biotechnology products such as this are ultimately more environmentally friendly as a topic of considerable debate it is commonly considered as the next phase of Green Revolution which can be seen as a platform to eradicate world hunger by using technologies which enable the production of more fertile and resistant towards biotic and abiotic stress plants and ensures application of environmentally-friendly fertilizers than the use of bio pesticides it is mainly focused on the development of Agriculture on the other hand some of the uses of green biotechnology involve microorganisms to clean and reduce waste red biotechnology as the use of biotechnology in the medical and pharmaceutical industries and health preservation this branch involves the production of vaccines and antibiotics regenerative therapies creation of artificial organs and new diagnostics of diseases as well as the development of hormones stem cells antibodies Serna and diagnostic tests white biotechnology also known as industrial biotechnology is biotechnology applied to industrial processes an example as the designing of an organism to produce a useful chemical another example as the using of enzymes as industrial catalysts to either produce valuable chemicals or destroy hazardous polluting chemicals white biotechnology tends to consume less in resources than traditional processes used to produce industrial goods yellow biotechnology refers to the use of biotechnology in food production for example in making wine cheese and beer by fermentation it has also been used to refer to biotechnology applied to insects this includes biotechnology based approaches for the control of harmful insects the characterization and utilization of active ingredients or genes of insects for research or application in agriculture and medicine and various other approaches gray biotechnology is dedicated to environmental applications and focused on the maintenance of biodiversity and the remotion of pollutants Brown biotechnology is related to the management of arid lands and deserts one application as the creation of enhanced seeds that resist extreme environmental conditions of arid regions which is related to the innovation creation of agriculture techniques and management of resources violate biotechnology is related to law Ithaca land philosophical issues around biotechnology dark biotechnology as the color associated with bioterrorism or biological weapons and bio warfare which uses microorganisms and toxins to cause diseases and death in humans livestock and crops you topic medicine in medicine modern biotechnology has many applications in areas such as pharmaceutical drug discoveries and production pharmacogenomics and genetic testing or genetic screening pharmacogenomics a combination of pharmacology and genomics is the technology that analyses how genetic makeup affects an individual's response to drugs it deals with the influence of genetic variation on drug responses in patients by correlating gene expression or single nucleotide polymorphisms with a drugs efficacy or toxicity by doing so pharmacogenomics aims to develop rational means to optimize drug therapy with respect to the patient's genotype to ensure maximum efficacy with minimal adverse effects such approaches promise the advent of personalized medicine in which drugs and drug combinations are optimized for each individual's unique genetic makeup biotechnology has contributed to the discovery and manufacturing of traditional small molecule pharmaceutical drugs as well as drugs that are the product of biotechnology biopharmaceuticals modern biotechnology can be used to manufacture existing medicines relatively easily and cheaply the first genetically engineered products were medicines designed to treat human diseases to cite one example in 1978 Genentech developed synthetic humanized insulin by joining its gene with a plasmid vector inserted into the bacterium Escherichia coli insulin widely used for the treatment of diabetes was previously extracted from the pancreas of abattoir animals cattle or pigs the resulting genetically engineered bacterium in abled the production of vast quantities of synthetic human insulin at relatively low cost biotechnology has also enabled emerging therapeutics like gene therapy the application of biotechnology to basic science for example through the human genome project has also dramatically improved our understanding of biology and as our scientific knowledge of normal and disease biology has increased our ability to develop new medicines to treat previously untreatable diseases has increased as well genetic testing allows the genetic diagnosis of vulnerabilities to inherited diseases and can also be used to determine a child's parentage genetic mother and father or in general a person's ancestry in addition to studying chromosomes to the level of individual genes genetic testing in a broader sense includes biochemical tests for the possible presence of genetic diseases or mutant forms of genes associated with increased risk of developing genetic disorders genetic testing identifies changes in chromosomes genes or proteins most of the time testing is used to find changes that are associated with inherited disorders the results of a genetic test can confirm or rule out a suspected genetic condition or help determine a person's chance of developing or passing on a genetic disorder as of 2011 several hundred genetic tests were in use since genetic testing may open up ethical or psychological problems genetic testing is often accompanied by genetic counseling topic agriculture genetically modified crops GM crops or biotech crops our plants used in agriculture the DNA of which has been modified with genetic engineering techniques in most cases the main aim is to introduce a new trait that does not occur naturally in the species examples in food crops include resistance to certain pests diseases stressful environmental conditions resistance to chemical treatments eg resistance to a herbicide reduction of spoilage or improving the nutrient profile of the crop examples in non-food crops include production of pharmaceutical agents biofuels and other industrially useful goods as well as for bio remediation farmers have widely adopted GM technology between 1996 and 2011 the total surface area of land cultivated with GM crops had increased by a factor of 94 from 17,000 square kilometers four million two hundred thousand acres to 1 million six hundred thousand square kilometers 395 million acres 10% of the world's crop lands were planted with GM crops in 2010 as of 2011 11 different transgenic crops were grown commercially on 395 million acres 160 million hectares in 29 countries such as the u.s. Brazil Argentina India Canada China Paraguay Pakistan South Africa Uruguay Bolivia Australia Philippines Myanmar Burkina Faso Mexico and Spain genetically modified foods or foods produced from organisms that have had specific changes introduced into their DNA with the methods of genetic engineering these techniques have allowed for the introduction of new crop traits as well as a far greater control over a foods genetic structure than previously afforded by methods such as selective breeding and mutation breeding commercial sale of genetically modified foods began in 1994 when Calgene first marketed its flavor saver delayed ripening tomato to date most genetic modification of foods have primarily focused on cash crops in high demand by farmers such as soybean corn canola and cottonseed oil these have been engineered for resistance to pathogens and herbicides and better nutrient profiles GM livestock have also been experimentally developed in November 2013 none were available on the market but in 2015 the FDA approved the first GM salmon for commercial production and consumption there is a scientific consensus that currently available food derived from GM crops poses no greater risk to human health than conventional food but that each GM food must be tested on a case-by-case basis before introduction nonetheless members of the public are much less likely than scientists to perceive GM foods as safe the legal and regulatory status of GM foods varies by country with some nations banning or restricting them and others permitting them with widely differing degrees of regulation GM crops also provide a number of ecological benefits if not used in excess however opponents have objected to GM crops per se on several grounds including environmental concerns whether food produced from GM crops as safe whether GM crops are needed to address the world's food needs and economic concerns raised by the fact these organisms are subject to intellectual property law you topic industrial industrial biotechnology known mainly in Europe as white biotechnology is the application of biotechnology for industrial purposes including industrial fermentation it includes the practice of using cells such as microorganisms or components of cells like enzymes to generate industrially useful products in sectors such as chemicals food and feed detergents paper and pulp textiles and biofuels in the current decades significant progress has been done in creating genetically modified organisms GMOs that enhance the diversity of applications and economical viability of industrial biotechnology by using renewable raw materials to produce a variety of chemicals and fuels industrial biotechnology as actively advancing towards lowering greenhouse gas emissions and moving away from a petrochemical based economy topic environmental the environment can be affected by bio technologies both positively and adversely Valero and others have argued that the difference between beneficial biotechnology eg bioremediation as to clean up an oil spill or hazard chemical leak versus the adverse effect stemming from biotechnological enterprises eg flow of genetic material from transgenic organisms into wild strains can be seen as applications and implications respectively cleaning up environmental wastes as an example of an application of environmental biotechnology whereas loss of biodiversity or loss of containment of a harmful microbe are examples of environmental implications of biotechnology topic regulation the regulation of genetic engineering concerns approaches taken by governments to assess and manage the risks associated with the use of genetic engineering technology and the development and release of genetically modified organisms GMOs including genetically modified crops and genetically modified fish there are differences in the regulation of GMOs between countries with some of the most marked differences occurring between the USA in Europe regulation varies in a given country depending on the intended use of the products of the genetic engineering for example a crop not intended for food use as generally not reviewed by authorities responsible for food safety the European Union differentiates between approval for cultivation within the EU and approval for import and processing while only a few GMOs have been approved for cultivation in the EU a number of GMOs have been approved for import and processing the cultivation of GMOs has triggered a debate about coexistence of GM and non-gm crops depending on the coexistence regulations incentives for cultivation of GM crops differ you topic learning in 1988 after prompting from the United States Congress the National Institute of General Medical Sciences National Institutes of Health and I G MS instituted a funding mechanism for biotechnology training universities nationwide compete for these funds to establish biotechnology
