 on the HealthWatch tonight some concerning news when it comes to driving under the influence of marijuana a new study from the university of michigan finds a significant number of people who use medical marijuana say they have driven after using it dr. Malcolm Marshall is here to explain more all right so Michigan is second only to California when it comes to the number of people who use medical marijuana so researchers surveyed almost 800 of them and more than half of them admitted to driving while a little high 21 percent of them reported driving when they were very high 21 percent that's a lot it's like one in five right so you know many people sort of poopoo or downplay the effects of marijuana on driving go ahead it's not a big deal but it can impair your reaction time it can impair your coordination which could lead to car crashes and right now we don't have a really great way of determining when someone is impaired from marijuana and when they're not alcohol yes marijuana No so the experts are saying look you probably shouldn't be driving at all during the rest of the day or two to actually use marijuana but if you are at least wait a few hours before you get behind the wheel of a car it's interesting to think whether people who use it recreational would be just as willing to drive it or is it just people who use it medicinally do you not even like if you're using it medicinally maybe you think it's just a part of you well I think your judgment either way might be impaired so maybe they're just not thinking right most Americans don't get enough exercise but new research finds a common food additive could be to blame this preservative doctor is widespread in a typical Western diet yes you eat a lot of it I know you do yes you do and it's called inorganic phosphate delicious and it keeps foods fresher longer and it tends to enhance flavor and it's found in all kinds of foods like processed meats canned fish sodas a lot of baked goods and up to 25 percent of Americans actually eat three to four times what's recommended for a normal diet so researchers did a couple of studies the first one in mice they found that those who had a higher diet diet higher in phosphate were less likely to spend as much time on the treadmill and had a harder time metabolizing fat they also found in humans that those with higher a phosphate in their blood were less likely to engage in moderate to vigorous physical activity so you know more research needs to be done there's been sort of an association identified but in the meantime they're saying maybe it's time to identify which foods on food labels contain phosphates all right so say the name of it again inorganic phosphate it's not on the label apparently not so how do you find out if the food you're eating there honey you just need to do research like I just told you you need to ask the doctor on TV and say which foods and I just told you by the way all the foods you listed are not foods I eat really I don't eat nuts no I'm never baked never sooner really leave that I think from time to time mr. Wade has been known to have a good Lisa back to you
