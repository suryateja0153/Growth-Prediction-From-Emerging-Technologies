 electrophysiology from Greek electron-electron amber see the etymology of electron faziz fizzies nature origin and loggia loggia is the branch of physiology that studies the electrical properties of biological cells and tissues it involves measurements of voltage changes or electric current or manipulations on a wide variety of scales from single ion channel proteins to whole organs like the heart in neuroscience it includes measurements of the electrical activity of neurons and in particular action potential activity recordings of large scale electric signals from the nervous system such as electroencephalography may also be referred to as electrophysiological recordings they are useful for electro diagnosis and monitoring topic definition and scope topic classical electrophysiological techniques topic principle and mechanisms electrophysiology is the branch of physiology that pertains broadly to the flow of ions ion current in biological tissues and in particular to the electrical recording techniques that enable the measurement of this flow classical electrophysiology techniques involve placing electrodes into various preparations of biological tissue the principle types of electrodes are simple solid conductors such as disks and needles singles or arrays often insulated except for the tip tracings on printed circuit boards or flexible polymers also insulated except for the tip and hollow tubes filled with an electrolyte such as glass pipettes filled with potassium chloride solution or another electrolyte solution the principle preparations include living organisms excised tissue acute or cultured dissociated cells from excised tissue acute or cultured artificially grown cells or tissues or hybrids of the above if an electrode is small enough micrometers in diameter then the electrophysiologist may choose to insert the tip into a single cell such a configuration allows direct observation and recording of the intracellular electrical activity of a single cell however this invasive setup reduces the life of the cell and causes a leak of substances across the cell membrane intracellular activity may also be observed using a specially formed hollow glass pipette containing an electrolyte in this technique the microscopic pipette tip is pressed against the cell membrane to which it tightly adheres by an interaction between glass and lipids of the cell membrane the electrolyte within the pipette may be brought into fluid continuity with the cytoplasm by delivering a pulse of negative pressure to the pipette in order to rupture the small patch of membrane encircled by the pipette rim whole-cell recording alternatively ionic continuity may be established by perforating the patch by allowing exogenous pore forming agent within the electrolyte to insert themselves into the membrane patch perforated patch recording finally the patch may be left intact patch recording the electrophysiologist may choose not to insert the tip into a single cell instead the electrode tip may be left in continuity with the extracellular space if the tip is small enough such a configuration may allow in direct observation and recording of action potentials from a single cell term single unit recording depending on the preparation and precise placement and extracellular configuration may pick up the activity of several nearby cells simultaneously termed multi unit recording as electrode size increases the resolving power decreases larger electrodes are sensitive only to the net activity of many cells termed local field potentials still larger electrodes such as uninsulated needles and surface electrodes used by clinical and surgical neurophysiologists are sensitive only to certain types of synchronous activity within populations of cells numbering in the millions other classical electrophysiological techniques include single channel recording and AM parameter E topic electrographic modalities by body part electrophysiological recalling in general is sometimes called electrography from electro plus graphy electrical recording with the record thus produced being an electro gram however the word electrography has other sensors including electrophotography and the specific types of electrophysiological recording are usually called by specific names constructed on the pattern of electro + body-part combining form + graphi abbreviation exg relatedly the word electrogram not being needed for those other sensors often carries the specific meaning of intracardiac electrogram which is like an electrocardiogram but with some invasive leads inside the heart rather than only non-invasive leads on the skin electrophysiological recording for clinical diagnostic purposes is included within the category of electro diagnostic testing the various exg modes are as follows topic optical electrophysiological techniques optical electrophysiological techniques were created by scientists and engineers to overcome one of the main limitations of classical techniques classical techniques allow observation of electrical activity at approximately a single point within a volume of tissue essentially classical techniques singular eyes a distributed phenomenon interest in the spatial distribution of bioelectric activity prompted development of molecules capable of emitting light in response to their electrical or chemical environment examples of voltage sensitive dyes and fluorescent proteins after introducing one or more such compounds into tissue via perfusion injection or gene expression the one or two dimensional distribution of electrical activity may be observed and recorded topic intracellular recalling intracellular recording involves measuring voltage and/or current across the membrane of a cell to make an intracellular recording the tip of a fine sharp micro electrode must be inserted inside the cell so that the membrane potential can be measured typically the resting membrane potential of a healthy cell will be minus 60 to minus eighty millivolts and during an action potential the membrane potential might reach plus 400 mV in 1963 Alan Lloyd Hodgkin and Andrew fielding Huxley won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or medicine for their contribution to understanding the mechanisms underlying the generation of action potentials in neurons their experiments involved intracellular recordings from the giant axon of Atlantic squid Lally go P lay and were among the first applications of the voltage clamp technique today most micro electrodes used for intracellular recording a glass micro pipette with a tip diameter of topic voltage clamp the voltage clamp technique allows an experimenter to clamp the cell potential at a chosen value this makes it possible to measure how much ionic current crosses a cell's membrane at any given voltage this is important because many of the ion channels in the membrane of a neuron are voltage-gated ion channels which open only when the membrane voltage is within a certain range voltage clamp measurements of current are made possible by the near-simultaneous digital subtraction of transient capacitive currents that passes the recording electrode and cell membrane are charged to alter the cell's potential topic current clamp the current clamp technique records the membrane potential by injecting current into a cell through the recording electrode unlike in the voltage clamp mode where the membrane potential is held at a level determined by the experimenter in current clamp mode the membrane potential is free to vary and the amplifier records whatever voltage the cell generates on its own or as a result of stimulation this technique is used to study how a cell responds when electric current enters a cell this is important for instance for understanding how neurons respond to neurotransmitters that act by opening membrane ion channels most current clamp amplifiers provide little or no amplification of the voltage changes recorded from the cell the amplifier is actually an electronic sometimes referred to as a unity gain amplifier its main purpose is to reduce the electrical load on the small signals in the MV range produced by cells so that they can be accurately recorded by low impedance electronics the amplifier increases the current behind the signal while decreasing the resistance over which that current passes consider this example based on Ohm's law a voltage of 10 millivolts is generated by passing 10 nano amperes of current across 1 megaohm of resistance the electrometer changes this high impedance signal to a low impedance signal by using a voltage follower circuit a voltage follower reads the voltage on the input caused by a small current through a big resistor it then instructs a parallel circuit that has a large current source behind it the electrical mains and adjusts the resistance of that parallel circuit to give the same output voltage but across a lower resistance topic the patch clamp technique this technique was developed by and Bert Sackman who received the Nobel Prize in 1991 conventional intracellular recording involves impaling a cell with a fine electrode patch clamp recording takes a different approach a patch clamp micro electrode is a micro pipette with a relatively large tip diameter the micro electrode is placed next to a cell and gentle suction is applied through the micro electrode to draw a piece of the cell membrane the patch into the micro electrode tip the glass tip forms a high resistance seal with the cell membrane this configuration is the cell attached mode and it can be used for studying the activity of the ion channels that are present in the patch of membrane if more suction is now applied the small patch of membrane in the electrode tip can be displaced leaving the electrode sealed to the rest of the cell this whole cell mode allows very stable intracellular recording a disadvantage compared to conventional intracellular recording with sharp electrodes is that the intracellular fluid of the cell mixes with the solution inside the recording electrode and so some important components of the intracellular fluid can be diluted a variant of this technique be perforated patch technique tries to minimize these problems instead of applying suction to displace the membrane patch from the electrode tip it is also possible to make small holes on the patch with pore forming agents so that large molecules such as proteins can stay inside the cell and ions can pass through the holes freely also the patch of membrane can be pulled away from the rest of the cell this approach enables the membrane properties of the patch to be analyzed pharmacologically topic sharp electrode technique in situations where one wants to record the potential inside the cell membrane with minimal effect on the ionic constitution of the intracellular fluid a sharp electrode can be used these micropipettes electrodes are again like those for patch-clamp pulled from glass capillaries but the pore is much smaller so that there is very little ion exchange between the intracellular fluid and the electrolyte in the pipette the resistance of the micro pipette electrode is tens or hundreds of M Omega often the tip of the electrode is filled with various kinds of dyes like Lucifer yellow to fill the cells recorded from for later confirmation of their morphology under a microscope the dyes are injected by applying a positive or negative DC or pulsed voltage to the electrodes depending on the polarity of the diet topic extracellular recording topic single-unit recording an electrode introduced into the brain of a living animal will detect electrical activity that is generated by the neurons adjacent to the electrode tip if the electrode is a micro electrode with a tip size of about 1 micrometer the electrode will usually detect the activity of at most one neuron recalling in this way is in general called single unit recording the action potentials recorded are very much like the action potentials that are recorded intracellularly but the signals are very much smaller typically about 1 millivolt most recordings of the activity of single neurons in anesthetized and conscious animals are made in this way recordings of single neurons in living animals have provided important insights into how the brain processes information for example David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel recorded the activity of single neurons in the primary visual cortex of the anesthetized cat and showed how single neurons in this area respond to very specific features of a visual stimulus Hubal and Wiesel were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or medicine in 1981 topic multi-unit recording if the electrode tip is slightly larger then the electrode might record the activity generated by several neurons this type of recording is often called multi-unit recording and is often used in conscious animals to record changes in the activity in a discreet brain area during normal activity recordings from one or more such electrodes that are closely spaced can be used to identify the number of cells around it as well as which of the spikes come from which cell this process is called spike sorting and is suitable in areas where there are identified types of cells with well-defined spike characteristics if the electrode tip is bigger still in general the activity of individual neurons cannot be distinguished but the electrode will still be able to record a field potential generated by the activity of many cells topic field potentials extra-cellular field potentials are local current sinks or sources that are generated by the collective activity of many cells usually a field potential is generated by the simultaneous activation of many neurons by synaptic transmission the diagram to the right shows hippocampal synaptic field potentials at the right the lower trace shows a negative wave that corresponds to a current sync caused by positive charges entering cells through post synaptic glutamate receptors while the upper trace shows a positive wave that is generated by the current that leaves the cell at the cell body to complete the circuit for more information see local field potential topic Emperor Amma tree ampère ama tree uses a carbon electrode to record changes in the chemical composition of the oxidized components of a biological solution oxidation and reduction is accomplished by changing the voltage at the active surface of the recording electrode in a process known as scanning because certain brain chemicals lose or gain electrons at characteristic voltages individual species can be identified and pyrometry has been used for studying exocytosis in the nervous and endocrine systems many monoamine neurotransmitters eg norepinephrine noradrenaline dopamine and serotonin 5-ht are oxidizable the method can also be used with cells that do not secrete oxidizable neurotransmitters by loading them with 5ht or dopamine topic plane a patch clamp plane a patch clamp is a novel method developed for high throughput electrophysiology instead of positioning a pipette on an adherent cell cell suspension is prepared on a chip containing a micro structured aperture a single cell is then positioned on the hole by suction and a tight connection gigas ile is formed the planar geometry offers a variety of advantages compared to the classical experiment it allows for integration of micro fluidics which enables automatic compound application for ion channel screening the system is accessible for optical or scanning probe techniques perfusion of the intracellular side can be performed topic other methods topic solid supported membrane SSM based with this electrophysiological approach Protea lipice ohms membrane vesicles or membrane fragments containing the channel or transporter of interest are its org - a lipid monolayer painted over a functionalized electrode this electrode consists of a glass support a chromium layer a gold layer and an octet acyl mercaptan mono layer because the painted membrane is supported by the electrode it is called a solid supported membrane it is important to note that mechanical perturbations which usually destroy a biological liepard membrane do not influence the lifetime of an SSM the capacitive electrode composed of the SSM and the absorbed vesicles is so mechanically stable that solutions may be rapidly exchanged at its surface this property allows the application of rapid substrate ligand concentration jumps to investigate the electrogenic activity of the protein of interest measured via capacitive coupling between the vesicles and the electrode topic bioelectric recognition essay bearer the bioelectric recognition essay bearer is a novel method for determination of various chemical and biological molecules by measuring changes in the membrane potential of cells immobilized in a gel matrix apart from the increased stability of the electrode cell interface immobilization preserves the viability and physiological functions of the cells bearer is used primarily in bio sensor applications in order to assay analytes that can interact with the immobilized cells by changing the cell membrane potential in this way when a positive sample is added to the sensor a characteristic signature like change in electrical potential occurs bearer is the core technology behind the recently launched pan-european F ood s CA n project about pesticide and food risk assessment in Europe bearer has been used for the detection of human viruses hepatitis B and C viruses and herpes viruses veterinary disease agents foot-in-mouth disease virus prions and bluetongue virus and plant viruses tobacco and cucumber viruses in a specific rapid one to two minutes reproducible and cost-efficient fashion the method has also been used for the detection of environmental toxins such as pesticides and mycotoxins in food and to 4/6 require any soul in cork and wine as well as the determination of very low concentrations of the superoxide anion in clinical samples a bearer sensor has two parts the consumable bio recognition elements the electronic readout device with embedded artificial intelligence a recent advance is the development of a technique called molecular identification through membrane engineering mime this technique allows for building cells with defined specificity for virtually any molecule of interest by embedding thousands of artificial receptors into the cell membrane topic computational electrophysiology while not strictly constituting an experimental measurement methods have been developed to examine the conductive properties of proteins and bio membranes in silico these are mainly molecular dynamics simulations in which a model system like a lipid bilayer is subjected to an externally applied voltage studies using these setups have been able to study dynamical phenomena like electroporation of membranes and ion translocation by channels the benefit of such methods is the high level of detail of the active conduction mechanism given by the inherently high-resolution and data density that atomistic simulation affords there are significant drawbacks given by the uncertainty of the legitimacy of the model and the computational cost of modeling systems that are large enough and over sufficient timescales to be considered reproducing the macroscopic properties of the systems themselves while atomistic simulations may access timescales close to or into the microsecond domain this is still several orders of magnitude lower than even the resolution of experimental methods such as patch clamping topic clinical reporting guidelines minimum information me standards or reporting guidelines specify the minimum amount of metadata information and data required to meet a specific aim or aims in a clinical study the minimum information about a neuroscience investigation many family of reporting guideline documents aims to provide a consistent set of guidelines in order to report an electrophysiology experiment in practice a mini module comprises a checklist of information that should be provided for example about the protocols employed when a data set is described for publication topic see also topic clinical electrophysiology electrophysiology involves the study of how different medications can help treat
