 I want to welcome you all on behalf of the lemelson-mit program and the author's lecture series of MIT and the MIT press I want to welcome you to this launching of our book the inventing modern America from microwave to mouse I the book by the way was conceived by the staff of the lemelson-mit program for for several years ago well before I became associated with it my name is Merton Fleming's by the way on the faculty of MIT by the staff who was conceived by the staff of the program and Lester Thurow and finally brought to fruition recently with the support of the Lemelson Foundation and with the authorship of David Brown who is here David thank you very much I might mention a few other distinguished people here apart from the panel members there are several others associated with the with the book which brings us all together here dr. Stan of schinsky president and CEO of energy systems and mrs. Ethel gross here the wife of Al gross dr. Al gross mrs. grose reminded me today told me today that it was just a year ago today that her husband was taken ill and in the last few months of his life spent a great deal of time continuing to think inventive thoughts and I think continuing to tell people about the important prize he he won and I'm sure it was more than more than more than one the lemelson-mit program is one express thanks to that also not only for the support of the book in part but also for the support of our program at MIT of our work and raising published public consciousness of invention of rewarding inventors and now of our new program in focusing on promoting encouraging high school students to invent and in invention I'm happy to now introduce one of the sons of Jerry Levinson and a member of the board of the foundation of the the Lemelson foundation Rob Lemelson who will say just a word or two thank you thanks Mert I'm bi on behalf of the Lemelson foundation I'd like to start off by giving a deep note of gratitude appreciation for this project particular to Lester Thurow and Mert Flemming the new director Chris and Finn but particularly anne-marie Amparo who was the director and shepherded the program really from its inception I just want to mention a few things about the Lemelson foundation we were started by my dad in the early 90s with the sole purpose of promoting invention and innovation in America and to that end we have a National Center for the study of invention and innovation at the Smithsonian and I invite you all to go and and visit there we have the lemelson-mit program with our student prize $30,000 student prize and our half million dollar annual prize in our lifetime achievement award we have national collegiate inventors and innovators Alliance that we give numerous small grants to college inventors who otherwise wouldn't have the seed capital or ability to bring their inventions to market and a number of other programs our new orientation for the foundation or new direction is bringing invention and innovation to address basic human needs in the developing world and we're just getting that off the ground right now I'm so delighted to be here but this book really it's it celebrates human imagination an imagination can cut both ways but it's possible to an imagine a world without a world where our soldiers would be going to battle without the protection of Kevlar vests invented by stephanie kwok or the walkie-talkie invented by al gross it's it's possible to imagine a world where millions wouldn't have their disease diagnosed with an MRI invented by raid to mate in or would have died without the benefit of a cardiac pacemaker by Wilson Greatbatch or the balloon angioplasty by Thomas Fogarty where my favorite computer the Macintosh does not exist by Steve Wozniak and and powered by my favorite input device the mouse by Douglas Engelbart so that's the negative side now imagine a world where new polymers allow doctors to deliver chemotherapy more effectively with fewer side-effects and allow doctors to grow new bones or even internal organs by Rob Langer where computers can write poetry stories paint or perhaps one day even debate and probably win debates of whether they're conscious beings conceptualized by Ray Kurzweil or in the future nanotechnology devices that can construct new materials machines and medications on a molecule by molecule basis by Brian Hubert all of these inventors and their achievements have been honored through the awarding of the lemelson-mit prize either as grad students in the case of Brian or the inventor of the year in case of Bob Langer and Ray Kurzweil or our lifetime achievement award winner Douglas Engelbart all of whom are here today and will address you so I'm really delighted to be here and I'll turn it back to Mary well it wasn't easy but Rob and I have been our lips and kept our comments almost as short as we plan to and my happy job now is to turn the rest of the evening over to our host for the evening Chris Lydon founder and former host of Boston Public Radio's the connection thank you it's a great pleasure to be here and an extraordinary panel we have it seemed to me the beauty of this book or one of the many beauties of it is that it's so personal it's so biographical as opposed to technical much less ideological and I thought we would try to keep the evening in that spirit these are real people men of imagination and a certain poetry who have done these wonders and unlike unlike the deal with them in that fashion rather than introduce them all formally I'd like them to introduce themselves but with a specific little trick question on which they've all been forewarned I'd like each of them starting with Doug Engelbart to speak of their own kind of God as an inventor I mean who in in the world of inventors really has sort of Joe DiMaggio kind of standing for them in terms of achievement but in terms of a kind of emotional identity in example who's your Joe DiMaggio Doug Engelbart I'm slowly make up my mind so sometimes it's edison and sometimes it's galileo sometimes it's Ben Franklin and sometimes it's Aristotle so sorry say that those are for heavy hitters Edison Aristotle starting with eros and Edison anyways Aristotle but you had Galileo and Ben Franco that's fascinating okay that'll do Leonardo is yet to be claimed Brian it's your turn well I wondered frankly I was gonna get to this later how did this book leave out Edwin land but that's another matter I don't mean to lead the witness go ahead it's your turn Brian well if I may be so bold as to point out actually a fine gentleman actually sitting in the audience Standish rimsky who has had a very long career I'm still reading books that that deal with his work on the study and development of amorphous thin film materials that date back to nineteen nineteen fifty-five 1960s development of memory films and then switching over later on in in life to CD development so now these thin films are actually being used for mass storage and CD recording and then of course solar cells as well I'd like to point out another person which i think maybe people don't necessarily consider an inventor outright and that is a Frank Lloyd Wright an architect he was before the time of Frank Lloyd Wright many buildings and architecture consisted of closed rooms that were separated one to another with a central hallway and and today we live in buildings and homes that have this kind of a free-flowing architecture to them and in reality you know maybe it's not patentable but certainly makes a big influence on our lives thank you breaker as well well I mentioned to people who had some influence on me none becoming an inventor because I think I decided that before I had heard of either of these people but one is Edison who have learned something about later in life and have tried to emulate some of the approaches and methods he used he did have a specific discipline about inventing and saw him selves specifically as an invention to find himself that way and was one of the first to do that and he had a whole methodology which involved being a student of technology trends and trying to anticipate where technology was going the idea being that your invention has to make sense when you're finished with the project not when you start and the world will be a different place by the time you get the project done and so that's led me to be a student of technology trends and that kind of took on a life of its own so I began to anticipate trends going out some decades which enabled me as a writer to invent with the technology capabilities and computational resources of future times and Edison did that as well and he kept very detailed logs of where technology was going and what might be possible today but what which inventions you might have to wait until certain other materials were available he had a whole group process where he would actually a large part of being an inventor as being a teacher and a salesperson we try to inspire other people not only your investors but most particularly the other engineers and scientists that you're working with and he had a whole group process a whole laboratory devoted to invention so I I find his approach to be to be inspiring another person who's not really seen as inventor but Marvin Minsky actually was a mentor of mine going back quite early when I was in high school I corresponded with him and I came up here to Cambridge and met with him and he had this vision of ultimately making computers as intelligent as people and that fact that really turned me on it brought me here at MIT and I've kept up that dialogue with Marvin for almost 40 years now thank you Robert later well for me it's also a personal experience and the man I would give is dr. Judah Folkman who is a professor at Harvard Medical School he was my when I after I graduated from MIT he was the person I did my postdoctoral work with and what he has done as some people may have followed his career is a sort of invent a family of drugs that can stop how blood vessels grow which is I think one of our great hopes today for possibly preventing cancer but in addition to that he's done a lot of other interesting things over a wide area right spectrum even developed doing some of the early work that led to the noir plant as well as a number of other things but to me it was not just the specific inventions but more the attitude and more the way he looked at things like he wasn't afraid to see the future wasn't afraid to in fact was very interested in combining different disciplines and he believed I think that anything was possible and never gave up in the face of just enormous amounts of criticism I think these kinds of elements were wonderful for me as a young scientist to say and have really inspired me through throughout my life yes I think I'm back I think of a lot of people that were really more like scientists you know Galileo and Newton and Richard Fineman and all that and I don't really think of them in the in thinner category and if I had a hero in life I'd probably link back well God helped make me the way I am and probably Bob Dylan so I go back you know I have these all these things in me like I'm sure all of us did that we're like inventors you know very early in agent you know eight years old and on and it was really had to be my father who was an engineer who I wanted to be like and I told him in sixth grade I want to be an engineer like you and maybe second to that a teacher because they're important too and my father's always there helped me to teach me things to answer questions to inspire me to go a little further with my electronics work I also had books that inspire you when you're young you read a book and for some reason it grabs you and kind of takes you in that direction life and there might have been some technical TV shows on but for me it was books and I would always buy the Tom Swift junior books about this guy who was young with his friend and he was an engineer and he owned a company with his father and they just whenever there was a pro in the world he'd go into the lab for two weeks or two days and two days and nights and designed a solution to entrap the aliens to fly to win a spaceship race to to have a submarine to solve some problem and Swift that was my early hero another good example of the author was I read a book and it was just a bunch of people that had a little radial Club that sent signals to each other and a guy got kidnapped and he outsmarted the kidnappers by wiring their TV to send some signals to his friends and right after reading that book in fifth grade I went to school and said I'm gonna get a ham radio license because it said anybody if any age can get one and it was just that neat little sentence at the end of the book that real inspired me so I had to ham license by sixth grade and pretty much from then on I had an inventor's life he could build things and you know you never really have to worry about having some sort of job so [Applause] some of you touched on it already you're talking about Judah Bachmann's kind of courage about the future and a kind of can-do thing but in stirrup I'd like to ask anybody and plunge in is there an x-factor that separates you know a very good engineer from being an inventor or a very good biologist from being what what is the difference between just a first-class professional and then and and the kind of folk that invented modern America well I think there's probably a lot of answers to that I'm sure everybody you know obviously there's things like creativity and brilliant but I guess I go back to also thinking about you know a lot of time I'll just give one element I think that everybody can maybe give different ones I'm sure there's a lot I think one thing is andreas said this in different ways about learning how to deal with failure you know the way I look at it is you know most of the time when you do stuff when you try to invent when you try to do science you things won't work and so it's you know and so you can deal with that a lot of different ways but I think a lot of times people that are most successful are the ones that know how to deal with failure the best that just know you know aren't going to let that get the to them they'll just say okay I'm gonna get it the next time and eventually you do you know there's enormous amounts of perseverance no matter what anybody says no matter how hard something seems yeah well Edison tried out several hundred filaments before he got one that worked and usually I mean the only person who can declare failure is is yourself when you finally give up and decide that you haven't been able to get something at work but if you view failure it's just success to further than then you don't have to experience failure another aspect of the difference between a scientist and inventor and it's not really a value judgment the scientists values knowledge knowledge does end up being useful in the end but an inventor really speaking for myself takes great pleasure in seeing what I call the the leap from dry formulas on a blackboard to actual impact in people's lives so actually seeing people use your inventions and have a benefit and seeing it actually make a difference in the world in the real world that's what turns in an inventor on and usually an inventor is applying some scientific knowledge but that that's that's the sort of joy in inventing I bring in the strange word of a dreamer that that's what's driven me all the time and you sort of have dreams they're actually not have to be practical at all to be a dream that you think gee that would be really neat and so that's what's driven me all through the years is the dream about how much people can collectively improve their ability to do complex urgent sort of solutions and I remember how I bothered I was when at one time some guy who was in head of an ARPA division was quoted as saying oh angle Bart he's just a dreamer and thought it made me mad the word just it's that's serious hard work would you be more particular about you know particular dreams you said you know that would be neat I mean and broaden it past the mouse perhaps oh the mouse was just a little thing like a windshield wiper on a new brand of vehicles and no though the whole thing started out over fifty years ago and and realizing that the world is really getting more and more complex all the time and they're urging big problems that have to be dealt with collectively and urgency difficulties going up like this and our collective ability is inching if anything and so it'd be very very important to the world that that we really learn how to boost our collective IQ if we want to call it so I dream about it that's boy there really are opportunities to do that and you can go can I just say parent I like the Dreaming idea and it reminds me of a wonderful disturbing story that everybody should read called the dream of a ridiculous man and it's about a guy who is determined to kill himself on a particular night and he he has the revolver there and he but he falls into a dream of sort of redeemed humanity and an alternative earth and he spends the rest of his life preaching about it and he says people come up to me and say that's just that's just a dream you had and he said yeah but your reality maybe want to kill myself and it's the dream that told me the truth something related to dreams this is magic and I was actually one of the questions that I was prepared to answer although I like this format of just dialogue and better was how did you get interested in inventing and I was like thinking about that I got it interested in inventing before I was influenced by Edison or I've read any books or because I got I'm not actually sure entirely how I got interested in it but I did have an interest very early in life in magic magic tricks if you think about what magic is if you put certain materials and procedures in just the right sequence it creates a magical effect but ultimately ends up being fairly superficial because if you reveal some of the secrets behind the magic it wrecks the magic but inventions and technology and creating technology is a form of magic particularly if you master the art of the demo you give a demo of here it's kind of like a magic show that's supposed to have the same impact but revealing the methods behind technology does not wreck its effect and ultimately the more profound technologies have a real impact lasting impact on the world so there's a magic to it as a magic to any creation them you put sound in the right sequence it creates music so let me step back to the x-factor I think that the difference between an inventor and maybe this is just like an imagination that we have the way we perceive it inventor and a real top scientist or engineer is that the inventor still has like the child in him and still has just a lot of humor and fun is doing things for his own purposes and reasons and not necessarily for money in a business and I also think that inventors kind of have this ability to either forget that they know something in order to design it better or they don't know to begin with but they are very smart about taking components things are built out of and putting them together in a new way than that other people haven't considered since components have changed our trips have changed in a while and can kind of come up with a good solution when it's needed in effect teach themselves as science rather than having been taught it or learned it and just do it the way it's always been done and I also think that good that inventors tend to seek very high levels of quality in their work things that other human beings wouldn't do either because it's new or better and fewer pieces than anyone else would do and maybe they're competing with themselves instead of competing with other people or just trying to you know I think they'd like to sit down and invent something out of their head and make changes as they go and keep modifying it and not have the structure of defining exactly what they're going to do on a piece of paper and then doing exactly that can't vary from it and do anything different and I also agree with the comment that it should be practical I also think that inventors tend to have a broad range of interests as well and I think you will find that all of the gentlemen here have very inventions that cover things from you know biology to nanotechnology to computer chips and Mouse's and so on but also inventors feel at home in environments that you wouldn't necessarily think they would be so me myself as a mechanical engineer by training might feel actually quite at home dealing with a problem that might other people might think might not have anything to do with a mechanical engineering solution being able address problems in biology or this kind of thing and Brian that touches on multidisciplinary inventors tend to sit down and design something and do the drafting themselves and then put together the breadboard themselves and test it and modify it and rebuild it and layout the PC board they tend to do a lot of different tasks instead of just one small part of it see go ahead in terms of multiple tasks that I think it's worth noting that I mean it's a myth of an inventor who disappears into his or her basement and emerges years later from emergencies later with a breakthrough and actually it's a group of inventors of disappear into their basement because inventing is very much a group process or a few inventions certainly in today's world that that are done by a single person they tend to be multidisciplinary so you've got to gather people from different disciplines who don't share the same terminology so part of being an inventor is being is having leadership qualities I mentioned salesmanship before I think that's very important you have to have a vision and really believe in it with such passion that it makes it real and everybody just believes in it and makes it happen regardless of whether venture capital is up or down and and can gather people to go through the difficulty intellectual emotional otherwise to to bring something to fruition and then get a group to work effectively together generally of approach I use is to get everybody to throw away their terminology and we invent a new terminology certainly helps in intellectual property protection because of anybody over his or conversations they have no idea what we're talking about and then I'll try to assign and say a signal processing problem to the linguists or vice versa to try to get some creative new ways of approaching problems Steve you mentioned mm-hmm doing it for the money and not doing it for the money and I wasn't sure we'd ever get into the money question but I I'm just I have two general questions one is the world organized in such a way from your standpoint to to give inventors the right reward for their genius for their contribution for their work and secondly does the commercial organization of the world bend the ideal process of invention in other words looking at this country I mean we will probably invent a cure for baldness before we invent a cure for malaria in the third world and you wonder is that is that right and is it something that inventors worry about but go back to the first question you know own own work ownership your own work well first of all yeah the I thought it was about our rewards money or not money what's the first part yeah so the inventor of this person I think of is rewarded intrinsically in their own brain knowing what they're doing is valuable knowing that it's good knowing that it's something they wanted to do just like solving a crossword puzzle and it's not extrinsic where people can see where in some fancy clothes or you live in a nice house or you have a big salary or a big title in a company or you know you own a company it's it's not all this extrinsic rewards you get a grade for something and that's really motivating and I don't think the inventor really needs the money and it's doing it for the money not the pure inventor anyway I think maybe that comes later and you know eventually you get why you wind up with where well the the number one goal of any company has to be to make money if you have a good invention it gets being sold and so the money kind of determines what the company will pursue and its proper but what happens is if a company you know the way companies work in our world is they become monopolies they get control of some territory and then they keep fighting they're putting up the blocks to hold their territory rather than pursuing newer better technologies that will help people more so that's that's more where where the danger is rather than companies somehow are just evil and they want to pursue what's gonna make money instead of what's not know even things that make money they aren't going to pursue the best ones they're going to pursue whatever will hold their territory the best I'd like to add some things to that that in people have been telling me for years that the marketplace is going to take care of how you get organizations to be more effective collectively and I just point out two things like saying oh there's an interesting collective problem called the environment and it certainly seemed like the marketplace is taking care of it in the negative way and there really are they're there things that the marketplace isn't going to take care of and somebody with innovation etc has to start activity that that it will mean what if some inventor could figure out a way to leave the next generation a better environment then we came in sure I mean you can invent all kinds of things I have a response to both but was said I think the rewards are intrinsic but you need money as money to invent or is like clay to a sculpture I mean it's an S it's it's the necessary ingredient particularly with the complex projects we have today in terms of the environment I think a key issue is sort of the intertwined promise and peril of technology technology solves a lot of problems but it's its power that empowers both our creative and destructive sides and technology can be harnessed for destructive ends as well and I do think we need to apply more of our creative powers to ameliorating some of the vulnerabilities we have in some of the destructive sides of technology which have emerged well there's several different aspects I mean technology is power and I think spirit of this panel is very much is the book is the extent to which technology has empowered our lives and I think that's true if you go back several hundred years compare our lives today to then I mean most of this audience wouldn't even be here because the average life expectancy was 35 years and most human life was poverty failed disease prone labor intensive short cetera so we have liberated ourselves to a great extent through technology but technology also empowers our destructive sighs I mean the 20th century had two great world wars a hundred million people died certainly amplified and made feasible by technology in September 11th we saw technology commandeered technology of airplanes and skyscrapers not the most modern technology but still technology used for destructive purposes and there has been great concern that has emerged over the potential for technologies that are emerging in the 21st century which were vastly more powerful than the very powerful 20th century technologies to be used for destructive purposes I mean the same knowledge that that will I believe cure cancer and overcome many diseases can also be used by terrorists to create a bioengineered pathogen and some people have said well let's let's let's do the good technologies and avoid the dangerous ones unfortunately it's the same knowledge the same technology and I think the only answer really is I don't I think we need to continue technology development because there's a lot of suffering to be overcome and there's a lot of benefit to be gained and a lot of creative expression to be harnessed and I think we need to put a higher priority on addressing the vulnerabilities that some of these new technologies expose and they're very specific projects that need to be undertaken to do them you keep sending me to ask you like what what well I mean in the wake of September 11th we've we can list a hundred different ways in which society is vulnerable today and that's that itself is a dilemma because the press talks about this and if on the one hand we need that kind of discussion in order to in a democratic society to gather the will to do something about these vulnerabilities on the other hand if I were terrorists I would you know listen to NPR and read the New York Times and get a lot of great ideas on each one of these vulnerabilities are the things we can do and it's a long discussion to talk about each of them but even more importantly some of the new things I mean I mentioned the downsides of biotechnology but there's specific projects for example antiviral drugs that could protect against a bio engineered virus there's some very creative ideas that are emerging but they we need to put a higher priority on addressing the defensive needs of defensive reaction to some of these technology well I'd like to point out that you know there's no end of big problems and somehow getting our society oriented about how to deal how to focus on them which ones are important is a collective issue that just is falling behind and the United Nations University put together a project about six seven years ago and they'd publish annually something called the state of the future and they were oriented about at saying at the turn of the millennium what are going to be the major challenges to mankind and so what they published last year then was there's sort of final one with fifth listed 15 things that were large complex issues that basically aren't being centrally addressed by any part of our world yet but which any any of those could bring us down and so it's like saying okay invention and the marketplace does a certain amount of stuff for us but who's who's getting out there and being innovative in political social other kind of organizational ways that we start addressing these things in some coherent way yeah but I think I might be a little bit off topic rats going back to the inventors need money well it sort of seems like that but boy I wouldn't tell that to anyone because it's like saying there's no Santa Claus you know I would say there's a lot of people that went and they worked in the basement alone this incredible thing and their only purpose was to build something neat for their own farm or their own life and and just you know no motivation to sell it or have a company or make a bunch of money it was really just pure you know scientific challenge almost but to build something that works and there's a lot of cases of that I did want to put that point I'd like to ask everybody all the panelists and we do want to go to the audience too soon but you know in the in the ultimate basement here what and with young people in mind what should the next generation of inventors be targeting as as sort of doable dreams Doug Engelbart boy that that beats me I've been cemented into one set of large you got something there I really think there's a sort of a social reorientation that is be important to do about the kinds of issues that really need in important ways innovation and energy and commitments and you know money making isn't the one that's going to resolve most of those big ones so okay young kids you know I've said my wise thing now it's up to you invent a new social order in other words along those lines and they say war is too important to leave to the generals and technology is too important to leave to the technologists and more so today then existed some decades ago technology is permeates all of our lives and you don't need to be an engineer or a scientist to understand technology and its impact or to have a voice in in its direction I will give you a practical example in response to your question a few minutes ago most a lot of the danger of technology has to do with when it's concentrated so technologies like cities buildings nuclear power plants where you have a lot of power of one sort or another concentrated in a small place can be quite dangerous so in the area of energy we need to move from these very centralized you know liquid natural gas facilities and so forth to decentralized ones and there are quite a few innovative projects I've seen involved in and one of them to create decentralized energy like microscopic fuel cells that can be scaled for America everything from cell phone battery is up to powering your homes that are highly decentralized and general decentralized technology is safe rooms or communicating over the Internet is safer than communicating in the city for example Brian you are the next generation sure that's the agenda I think I think you know if I if you would indulge me I'll paint a little a little picture of the furniture here I think there are some important areas that the next-gen raishin should target and you know my specialty happens to be you know nanotechnology and I think that has a lot of promise in various fields but if one could imagine in the future going to a supermarket and loading up your shopping cart with all the different products soup cans and cereal boxes and you know spatulas if the store is is stocked that way and being able to basically walk out of the store you make no transaction with anybody at any counter don't stand in any line and you know basically each of these little products has a little intelligent tag a little bit of computer architecture built into it and allows you to basically walk through that door and the door knows what product that you've actually taken out of the store it the ducts automatically from your credit card and you get the statement at the end of the at the end of the month and this kind of thing is already happening in fact when you do this I pass for gasoline purchases at gas stations and so on so I think part of the dream is to have technology embedded everywhere and making it cheap enough so that you can afford to put it everywhere I'll give you one example a car today is manufactured with as many as twenty thousand different parts keeping track of all those different parts actually adds up to a large portion of the cost that you pay inventory management imagine if you had a little computer computer chip that cost some one fraction of a penny and embedded in every bolt and nail and superstructure and and hood and aluminum alloy wheel and that way you would be able to keep track of where all these different parts are at any point in time and be able to assemble them right on the spot so this what do you do in order to achieve this kind of a dream well you need some elements of nanotechnology how do you pattern things at very very very high volume very cheaply how do you make disposable cell phones that could be incorporated into credit cards you basically buy the credit card it has a cell phone embedded right in it you throw it away when you're done this this is I think some some of the dream that I see another is is that of you go the doctor's office and you have basically your genetic information read out in a few minutes on a disposable genetic gene chip then you get into some issues of well again technology and then information there can be a dangerous combination there but the benefits are that you would be able to have genetic diseases read out and diagnosed within a few minutes on the other hand that information could be used against you for insurance policies and so on so there needs to be a good balance I think great thank you because I mean these are the things for years I look at and say all these things you can picture the value of innovations in one hand but they all caused significant changes throughout society as that adapts to them and it's that you know different currents have changed like that that are going to come into conflict like the things you mentioned about are also going to be there so that everybody's what they what they're where they go and what they say and what they do etc can be open you know just easily tracked so privacy it can you know it's a very hard chance of surviving can we adapt our social political structures so that we can put up and maybe turn that to an advantage but the current current society just and have strong rebellion about that so can we get ready for that by the time the technology's got it got ready to use I don't the way we're going now where we're not getting ready for things well I think I mean Doug's question is a tough one to answer it's a very important one to yours I think the way I guess I've looked at that is you know I kind of think of inventions from the future in two categories one are the things that you sort of I don't want to say can predict today but I think sort of flow out of things that are happening and we'll certainly keep people busy for for many many years it's hard to be specific but if I kind of look at it and say the medical field you know I think that we will probably see in the next 3040 years you'll see what we call personalized medicines ways of absolutely diagnosing you know the genes of mapping of each individual and understanding what that means in terms of a medical regimen that they should get we'll see drugs I think that kind of effects on diseases you know including cancer that really don't exist today I think we'll see ways of as Rob was mentioning of delivering drugs you know right to whatever target we want and I think someday we will see ways of creating new tissues and organs for treat diseases like diabetes and new spinal cords for people who paralyzed I think we'll see those but at the same time I kind of and there's no particular direction I'm going when I say this but I think that some of the greatest inventions will be things that nobody here can foresee you know things that somebody will dream about maybe they'll answer dose questions or maybe they'll raise more but those will be inventions that you know somebody just totally thinks out of the box I mean if you went back you know to the turn of the last century 1900 you know would people ever dream that we'd have you know airplanes you know televisions mini computers all the kinds of things that we see I mean and I think that the same thing will continue to happen we just don't know where where those will come from you want to make a longshot prediction I thought I think it make many many unexpected innovation well pick one that we're looking at just for fun I mean which is something that I don't think most people would think about so are there ways to even have effects on the weather in other words would there be it's not well but maybe in a positive way right there are things like hurricanes that can cause enormous damage and can kill a lot of people you know earthquakes that can kill a lot of people if you could predict those in ways or if you could you know interfere with those not necessarily to change it but if you could if you could you know save you know many many lives I mean which would you want to do that ok so yeah that's all thanks Robert I was just a Polly ocula and I hope that lets do to blow so I hope you hurry up we're working at come from like the computer the personal computer rounds so I think in terms of that as far as future needs for invention directions and yeah there was a time where we came out with the first personal computers and we built the programming language in somebody could pull it out of the box and learn a few simple steps and solve any problem they had where the user was totally the master the Machine let them take themselves and gave them more abilities to go further in the world and then we started work on the computers the Lisa and then the Macintosh kind of followed on from that but it was a Lisa we had some very bright bright intellectuals at Apple that thought how do you make a machine that works the way a human wants to and one thing we did was we had just the blank room and a blank machine no instructions go in and see what you can do to it we would tell novitiates people that weren't computer experts and it had a mouse and it had different structures and we've watched them and learn whether one menu works better than multiple menus how the window should be shaped what side of the screen works out better for people what words and menus are most suggestive so they find the solutions with no instruction and we had this little window where the computer was just you know like working with the person like a person and then that window kind of went away and now we wind up with complicated programs it's hard to figure out where they are and you have to memorize a series of menu commands rather than just thinking the way a human would think which is usually Sarah Dennis Tuesday 2:00 p.m. write it down little products that do that sort of thing they kind of come and they go and they get lost and the technologies don't come back and we wind up with what we have today is error messages that you can't understand and other dialogues you can't understand and the check boxes are work like Brady a buttons and radio buttons work like checkboxes like nobody cares about consistency and you check a box and some words change somewhere to change a meaning and you never knew it would have happened and and you can see where you are but not where you came from and it's like we have this pretty much a mess and I keep thinking in terms of humanization it's always been important to me and a lot of what Ray did in his past you know I think I just try to solve some real human beand problems like even a piano sounding right you know or what do you need for a blind person to read a normal book and what technologies you have to invent to do it and it's like humans versus technology and the humans should be more important and it's like I feel like we're kind of losing out and we're not in as good of places will be someday so I think that now that we're getting kind of close to where people have the amount of computer in their homes and businesses that they need and we don't really need a lot of new computers and new devices don't seem to be coming out maybe after a period of stability we'll go back and reevaluate the human interface again and start going back and looking searching for these things where the computer is like a human and works with us that way artificial intelligence I hope be you know a little bit of the key to that so thanks great I'll mention a couple of things I I see happening starting with this decade one important phenomena is virtual reality now we we can have virtual meetings today on the Internet but they don't have the immediacy that we have here we can't look at each other's faces we don't have the ability to express ourselves video conferencing does a little bit of this but isn't you actually can't establish eye contact Indian conferencing and it doesn't have the resolution but by the end of this decade we will be able to meet very much like this with this sense of presence with with eye contact with three-dimensional full-immersion visual auditory virtual reality with images written on a retina directly from our eyeglasses and lenses these are technologies you can see today on this campus and other other campuses in prototype form they're not quite high enough resolution and not ready for primetime but by the end of this decade that will be a common way that we meet the telephone is auditory virtual reality we'll be adding the visual sense by the end of this decade interfaces will we'll have a lot more facility with human language which is how we like to communicate and we'd like to be able to just say what's on our mind and there are systems emerging they're not quite good enough yet but with it but they are within some domains beginning to were considered by the end of this decade systems will be able to understand what you want at least within limited domains they won't be passing the Turing test so we won't mistake them for human intelligence but they will understand what we want for an e-commerce transactions scheduling an appointment or reservation finding information if we go out past the end of this decade to 20 30 years from now the virtual reality systems will go inside our brains using nanotechnology all of this has already been demonstrated in prototype form the ability for electronics to interact actually non-invasively with our biological neurons and will ultimately be able to have full immersion virtual reality incorporating all the senses people can then beam their whole of sensory experiences on the internet and you can plug in experience what it's like to be someone else all of the plot concept of Being John Malkovich which most experiences I think are pretty boring but well the closest thing the closest thing to that happening that I know if is I've got this new arcade machine called police 9-1-1 and you sit there and somehow it senses where your body is you stand on this pad and as you move around the screen moves and you can duck behind cop car doors and things like that so what's coming I like to this is when you go to call simply say 1-800 and but also I was just thinking of the late great michael dertouzos of the computer lab at MIT in an office not far from here I mean he thought a lot about making computers and making technology more humane and more human centered and he in his office he could he could give a kind of spoken instruction to his curtains and they would open her clothes and he could he could ask his telephone what the traffic was like in Phoenix right now or the weather and in you know Bhutan or someplace but he thought a lot about making technology serve human beings rather than as Steve is saying you know put us all on these long lists of indecipherable instructions I'd love to know what the inventors but also what all of us think are they kind of human and what does that actually mean nowadays to make our technology more humane other inventors who want to sort of speak to that or some because I've been very very concerned and interested in I'm I'm not trying to stop the innovations of technology but two things one is the implications and the rest of our society for every one of these families of things that's brought out and installed they're going to make lots and lots of changes are we up you know I come around over and over again then to its collective smarts that that's one thing the technology can provide a lot of improvement but we don't get it by just plugging in smart machines we're going to get it by adapting and changing a lot about the way we think and collaborate and work together and that to me that's something extremely important to get going on to try to cope and there are lots of opportunities but I guess I do think you know some of the things you can do in medicine lots of people are doing you know some where again mentioned in the introduction by rob you know really I mean they they provide I think great things in terms of you see sometimes little children who would die before and now I think we're able to hopefully create things that will make people live longer and you know better lives so I think there's a lot of things that are going on that I think hopefully help I will say general there needs to be much more public education about science and technology and its impact so that we can make intelligent decisions technologies can have enormous an impact on our lives the next big revolution is in biotechnology with our harnessing information about the genome and proteomics and so on we're going to be able to stand human lifespan which has been the growing extend human aging overcome any diseases but there's also tremendous potential for for danger particularly in the of this kind of knowledge in the wrong hands and the things we can do about that I don't think we're defenseless I think we have to put resources into technological immune systems and safeguards and it requires really the public to guide these efforts here we are please you want to tell us who you are you don't have to hear here is is really classic technologists ventures of Technology talking about how to solve problems or problems that humans have but with my hats off to all of you and I use McIntosh I think the things the kinds of interventions that are really most important are the kind to be better mothers social inventions technical inventions we have ties up we understand how to mark tensions what we need now are social interventions and we have got flu that's been brining wilderness now for twenty thirty years about this and immediately start thinking well how can we use computer to do that or how can we build video conferencing where we've spent other that social construction together that says here we have things we need to do collectively how do we enhance the collective intellectual [Music] technology great dress isn't involving changing personalities of people to deal with each other differently and personalities are pretty you know pretty stable and transient from a certain age on so we've got to be talking properly about how we raise children or something or maybe school environments I think there is an interaction between technology and the kind of human values and social structures that you're talking about and I think you have to be mindful of them and we have to talk about improving political systems and social systems in in the context of the acceleration of Technology I had to get the acceleration in there if you take an example I think the Internet is a very profound an electronic decentralized electronic communication in general is a very profound has a very profound influence on the world both pods have a negative with the positive it's worth noting in that it is a very democratizing force because it keeps everybody informed I mean when during that 1991 coup against Gorbachev it really wasn't Yeltsin standing bravely on the tank that overturned the coup it was the clandestine decentralized electronic communications so that the totalitarian government couldn't just see is the TV and radio station and keep everyone in the dark everybody was communicating through early forms of email on teletype machines faxes and other other forms of decentralized electronic communication in the internet now is a very it's creating a global culture that is much more important than national boundaries and products information bounces around the internet instantly my kids have friends around the world and create these communities it is a very I think it's behind the trend towards democracy we saw in the 1990s there are a lot of negative aspects to it also spreads hatred can provide means for people to communicate in the clandestine ways to plan malicious projects and so I mean that there are there are privacy issues particularly as this technology becomes more pervasive it seems to me you're asking a somewhat different question which is what is what is the moral equivalent in the social realm of inventors in the technological realm and they're not the same thing I mean maybe what you're looking for is maybe the inventor you're looking for as a politician or psychologist revolutionist or is that we understand how to build and market things we don't understand a whole lot about building whatever else it is we need like but Marie is saying there is a cousin there is a connection to democracy it's very hard to explain and I like to hear I think I was gonna agree that you know I think inventors have a particular role to play and in many ways you know scientists and engineers have particular roles to play and I think the questions that you're addressing and the challenges that you've posed are such global nature and in fact our you know require the the you know a battalion of thousands if not millions to make it happen you know whole changes in psychology I think you know as Ray's mentioned you know the the broadband internet and so on will allow us to understand what people are thinking and talk with them on maybe on nearly a daily basis a world away that's that's tremendous but I think I think inventors have a particular role and our role is to look at the world and to say you know to wake up in the morning and say you know that's a really interesting reflection in the pool of water that's sitting outside my window is there any way that I can use that for telecommunications okay I mean it's an odd a combination of things but perhaps you know the invention of fiber-optic cable comes from from viewing this problem so I think inventors maybe are a little more specific and centralized in their thinking I mean my thinking is when when I take a shower and I'm staying at a four heartless force a four-star hotel thank you very much levels in program in Boston you know I expect all of the all the fine amenities and that's really wonderful of course I you know lived in a pretty crappy dorm here at MIT when I went to school so this is this is tremendous but you know I wake up in the morning and I try to shave and you know what the mirror is all fogged up and what's my inventive solution well I take a piece of Kleenex and clean all wipe off all of the the condensation why isn't there a defroster I mean they've got a heated towel rack okay why isn't there a defroster on my mirror so you know I don't I would I would love to address the big global problems but I think bit by bit if each inventor does his work and for that matter you know each scientist and engineer does their work for an inventor to feed off of realistically we're adding little pieces to the technological puzzle and I think those get put together with you know somebody with politics and companies and money and finances and and then we build a consensus about what we want to do about the big global questions well just a quick comment cuz we did talk about this at lunch we had lunch together and we I mean there's a difference between innovation and invention I mean invention harnesses innovation in the area of technology but this but innovation is something that pervades fields other than invention the arts politics psychology teaching can all be innovative and would I think your point is we need innovation in other other fields and the political and social fields we need more insight into human psychology and my point earlier was that this is even more important because of the profound and rapidly escalating impact that technology is having on on human issues well I just point out that that's the motivating thing starting me out 50 years ago with the complexity and urgency is going to grow and we only can deal with it collectively so there are things of changes in the way we think can work and collaborate and the computers and the communication can make big differences in that and that's you know constructive innovation is a lot of hands out here be as incisive and quick as you can please [Music] name a company and a kind of product in which there ought to be somebody to deal with the end product of the invention every invention coming sort of a clean up I think that's a good thought we have a little bit of that in terms of liability people certain types of damage they can be sued and there are regulations and in areas of impact on the environment but I think that's the direction we need to move into because technology does have a very pervasive effect and I proposed it's that we actually create specific programs to in a sense clean up some of the dangers that are created by new technologies you know we've suddenly woken up have a list of a hundred different vulnerabilities we have just with conventional technology and the new ones that emerging are also a double-edged sword so we need to we need to deal with it the car puts out pollution to the extent that we don't want pollution well somebody has to pay for it but it's really the person buying the car it has an extra cost it has the cost of the car and the cost of the cleanup and the price tag should be put on the car but if any one company tries to do that every other company's gonna sell cheaper cars so obviously the solution is somewhere above a company above an inventor it's like political or something please hi this is on another question that was asked earlier about the qualities to create an inventor what about the question of chaos I have found that inventors are willing to go into that realm of chaos they also think that the end result that we're talking about is also filled with a chaos that reverberates out you know into the when you have a new invention you say something about chaos sort of Pandora's box I mean yeah I think I think what inventors try to do is perhaps bring order to chaos an inventor might go into a conference on materials research or on nanotechnology or this or that and I think you know we'll be able to take various ideas that might not necessarily initially seem connected and put them together into a new way and bring order to this kind of chaos of ideas I think that's what you do anytime that you sit down with a bunch of people and basically brainstorm you're bringing in all these ideas from all these different directions creating something concrete and then you got to bring it to the next step and that's to ask the question okay this is interesting what are we going to do with it I think that the brightest most admirable inventors are the ones that invent things in a way that reduces the chaos instead of increasing it but gives you just as much capability another comment on casma my own technical field is something called pattern recognition which is really the study of chaos and finding patterns in very chaotic information like looking at in a scene and seeing seeing this very chaotic swirl of visual information but being able to make some sense out of it and that's actually the heart of human intelligence and probably the most profound new technological capability that will emerge in this century is machines with increasing amounts of of human-like intelligence which is based on this ability to find patterns in chaos please depart helping people deal with increasing complexity and at the time that he was beginning his work it seems like that was a much less obvious problem than it is now so I was wondering if there was anything specific that led him to take his research in that direction can you rephrase that what what was it about complexity that got you home fifty years ago why complexity if I tell you it'll reveal this very country boy naive yet that I started a couple of months before that I happened to get engaged at the weekend and driving to work on Monday I thought well I'm going to get married and have kids and live happily ever after and that's all very great and suddenly I started aligning myself to thinking about the work and for some strange reason all I saw was a empty hallway nicely lit going on down forever and I just realized with a real shock I didn't have any real professional goals and before the day was out I tried different goals and I latched on to one that I'm embarrassed to tell you about it's like saying oh why didn't I invest my career to maximize the return in benefits to mankind honest that's alright but I spent the next few months trying to figure out what kind of a crusade to go on and that's that's when I began to realize how complex the world is and you hear stories about saying oh boy here these natives are living in a way where the swamps get so much mosquitoes and malaria is crippling them and everything else will go in and will clear the swamps well great then 30 years later they've over populated the area and they've ruined the environment and they're worse off see so you say okay how do I design a crusade whose results have a chance of really helping rather than the secondary effects of it being worse or something and it's very complex organizing a crusade anyway you-you-you say well I need a business manager I go down the streets looking for business managers of Crusades and they don't seem so one Saturday I just thought oh you know it's just really very very complex and somehow that all came to get it pretty soon as yes complex the problems are getting more and more complex and urgent that have to be dealt with collectively and our ability to deal collectively with complex urgent problems isn't improving as fast as a complexity and urgency are so where is that going to leave us so the naive country boy says Oh that'll be what I'll commit a career to and one thing led to another so I get all this images about how we actually can change our way of thinking and interacting and vocabulary is going to change and the very symbols were used to portray those concepts are going to start evolving and changing because we can portray them in such different ways dynamically etc and the old-fashioned way of that that's that's the way you should get your knowledge is looking at a page and that's still out there and I says hey boy that's the result of a very old technology to have symbols put on there like that so how can I put them on dynamically in color and shift to view so how I want them so I just feel like there's a great deal to learn about how we can deal with all of that and improve our ability collectively to develop knowledge in ways in which we can really very rapidly put it together and we don't have to wait till you publish the next textbook etc anyway I mean that's been a debate recently one forum was kicked off by cover story that bill joy wrote in Wired magazine that some of you may have seen and he and I have been pair to serve optimist and pessimist around that issue which is probably an oversimplification but I think my point is not that we're embarked on a project specifically to create artificial intelligence but it's inevitable result of lots of little steps each of which is quite conservative and makes sense by itself a little bit faster computer software that's more responsive than the kind of frustrating software that that Steve was describing but the inevitable result of hundreds of these steps is artificial intelligence we're not specifically sitting down and creating nanotechnology nanotechnology is the inevitable end result of hundreds of projects which make things a little smaller with Shrinking technology at an exponential rate and the inevitable result of that is that 10 20 years from now most technology will be have its key features measured in nanometers and the inevitable end result of faster computers and more sophisticated software and software that understands language better motivated by wanting to have better user interfaces all of which are economic imperatives I mean if a company says well you know an AI might be dangerous therefore when I'm not gonna create more intelligent software we'll be out of business because there's an economic imperative to it and I pointed out that out to Bill joy I mean son is continued to create more intelligent software and faster computers and more powerful networks because it's an economic imperative [Music] economic imperative driven by business which is fine and good like that but it still is going to create real problems that today we wouldn't have a who us how we would cope with that so if you get more and more things that are being created that are smarter than people why why the hell should they pay much attention to us pretty soon if they're smart enough they'll get together and say who needs these creatures well I think it's a real issue if you describe today to people 200 years ago particularly if you emphasize some of the negatives enough explosive power to end all mammalian life and all the other dangers that we live with they would think it's crazy to to go down that path but we didn't get here by embarking on a single project to create the present world it it's done step at a time and there are profound benefits I had something to finish and I think this there is a moral imperative not just an economic imperative to continue technology development because they're still not millions but billions of people who are suffering from poverty and disease and other things other flexions which technology can and will overcome so there's there's plenty of moral reason to continue technology but the but and technology is a double-edged sword and the so we we do have to address this this negative sorry but I think it's unrealistic to think that we're not going to continue moving forward can I just get please that yes no us no one's saying stop it to do those cures the thing is people are saying well I'm not I'm just saying that if we don't get smarter about the how we handle it and the things you talk about about how the technology over the last two centuries has changed well all that change has happened at a very slow rate because technology evolved relatively very slowly and our society has a sort of a time constant about how it adjusts and adapts and everything like that the great answers that thought I want to change the subject [Music] surpasses human psychologically and socially to adjust and deal and question for example can you take what are the best examples [Music] we're abilities as forward quickly so have their department weeks as and [Music] I mean I would give the example of the Internet as the question was roughly examples where of speedy and and happy adaptation of technology to social order [Music] I think the Internet is a very profound development it's it emerges from the technological world but it's had profound impact on every other severe certainly education politics and it's it's a it's an enormous communication vehicle and it's not a static thing it's going to increase in its realism and it's it's fundamentally a communication medium where we can communicate with other people and our ability to do that over this worldwide network is going to increase it's creating communities that are global and it's creating kind of a global culture at society that has a lot of impacts that are not specifically technological and also while it's true the technology's accelerating a profound trend as a technology is becoming more human I mean the first computers were behind glass walls and then Steve helped out sherry in the personal computing revolution where computers none were sitting on our desks and then ultimately we were carrying them under our arms notebooks and now we're putting them in our pockets and ultimately they're going to be woven in our in our clothing and they're going to become more communicate more in human ways so it doesn't necessarily require humans to become more technologically savvy in order to use technology it's becoming more like us and becoming more into intertwined with our lives and allows us to do things that aren't specifically technological so when teenage kids are creating new music and sharing music using technology that's that's a non technological impact of sophisticated technology and we're going to see that more and more I'd say overall the the Internet has been a very positive sort of happily yeah I mean I'm younger than anybody here in the panel and may have a little bit of naivete but so I'm kind of an eternal optimist really about technology I have a much more rosy view on what can happen in the future simply by looking at what has happened in the past I mean I think anybody here in this audience would have you know a hard time arguing against the notion that your life today is much better than it then it could have been maybe you know only seventy or only fifty years ago again the example that Ray given you know two hundred years ago you might be dead already because the life spans were so short back then I think this is a trend that's going to continue on into the future I think you know we brought up the notion that perhaps the advances in technology will somehow outstrip our ability to control it or understand it or be able to use it in in good and you know wise ways but I think in the past we've seen that we've been able to overcome those problems I mean the development of the atomic bomb for gosh sakes you know in the end yes okay we got close to the edge perhaps one could say but in the end we've we've you know we're able to work out those differences those problems find technological solutions find political solutions find sociological solutions for this kind of this kind of thing so one example cars today okay it took 20 years to do it a car today puts out about 1/100 of the pollution that a car did only 20 years ago that has had a profound effect on atmospheres worldwide now of course we have many more cars that's a big problem okay but it's better but a two-cycle lawnmower puts out 200 times as much as one car this this is true this is true SST illuminated resource flag capacity wanna meet by that in order to amend new things to sell their product you have to be meeting some sort of need and for every need there this asymptotes like an endpoint that need I think not what I mean is character disease we care every possibility they master every biological process we could live forever if we create artificial intelligence that could translate any language for us we no longer need to learn any language aside from a basic set of commands activate this translate course these are waiting which technology is making us a and this is really from Western G point where you know we create more needs because Islands but I think technologies that that could be then if that would increase our cognitive abilities that would make us more human and we talked about how to get a better quality our small way of life are valid is your question that same order that we're running out of needs and necessity how's that making us think whether or not need human need is a finite resource and in my view the uniquely human thing is to seek broader horizons what need was Beethoven's Ryung to to fulfill and is that finite I mean ultimately our human civilizations creating knowledge and by knowledge I include art and music and invention and literature and human discourse and our political systems and human knowledge you can actually measure it is growing exponentially and I think as we overcome some of our afflictions people can become more creative there's no limit to the amount of knowledge we can seek the more we know the more we know we don't know he's the profits of inventing a gadget like that any picture the process of a new drug for cancer and talisman picture whether you're coming up with a gimmick or not I think I think the truly important and innovative the one the kinds of inventions that are really have impact okay probably it's not going to be the laser pen or the tickle-me-elmo for the following for the following reason I think truly innovative inventions take advantage of some effect some noticing of something happening in the environment around you often times it comes from the field of physics or that comes from the field of biology or neurobiology the noticing how drugs interact from each other so I think those are the kinds of inventions that will have true impact and eventually wind up being the foundations upon which we build gimmicks article The New Yorker careful world 1900 it was a very very different world born to that change suffered buildings huge societal Bob Langer surprised him with an answer yeah wish I had a good one uh yeah I kind of thought you know I think I know what you're saying I mean you're saying like the that in between 1900 and 1950 there was this you know giant thing and what's happened the last 50 years but uh but I I don't know I mean I think a lot an awful lot has happened the last 50 years - I don't I you know so it's hard for me to say I mean if I compared the last 50 years to any other 50 years I would think it would still be a pretty giant thing it's just that that particular 50 years at least as you know some of those events like you know cars and planes and all that was you know it's a pretty big deal III guess I still think there's gonna be an awful lot ahead of us as well I mean you know whether it'll do exactly those 50 years hard to know and that's kind of a dramatic thing sometimes you know the foundations are laid and those foundations are laid before and then all of a sudden these kind of spectacular things that you envision you know jump out at you but it's not necessarily because you know there's like they say this the science or the engineering may have happened even before that it's just that that's what we say I don't know if that makes sense right you want to give me acid that he knew you were gonna get yeah I'll give you the answer you expected but I mean car first of all cars have emerged before 1900 as did trains and I'm the world changed in between 1900 1950 but I don't know that it was that profound I think it's changed a lot more between 1915 and now I have studied this issue for four for quite some time and have measured quantitatively certain technological trends I mean if you look at certain measurements that you can do quantitatively like computational power communication speed our knowledge about the human brain and the ways of measuring that our biological knowledge the size of Technology all of these different facets are growing it remarkably smooth with exponential rates despite the chaos I mean I I have these various charts where you put these different projects and measure them in certain ways and they form these very smooth exponential curves despite the fact that each point on those curves is a function of tremendous chaos and competition and venture capital and human drama nonetheless the the powers of these technologies are growing exponentially if you look at what you're alluding to which is sort of the pace of technical change the rate of paradigm shift as I call it I've plotted that as well and that is also growing exponentially we're roughly doubling the paradigm shift rate every decade and that goes back to the dawn of technology where the first steps took thousands or tens of thousands of years like stone tools fire the wheel then a thousand years ago things like printing and chips took centuries to take hold and now we have paradigm shifts like the World Wide Web that take root in in just a few years time so we are there is a there is a an exponential growth to the pace of of Technology and which means the next 25 years will see a hundred years of change at today's rate of change which is why some of the social issues discussed here are are urgent because the pace of change is speeding up I think I think that's clear commercialization I want to postulate he said no invention gross [Music] [Music] [Music] the entrepreneurs can be considered the heroes of invention to point out maybe somewhat of a sobering fact for all you budding inventors out there something like only one out of 100 patents actually gets turned into something and maybe only 1/100 of those actually turns into something useful maybe one of those actually kind of useful used something useful that people want so in many ways I think you know we talked about cash as being the the commodity of necessity for for an inventor to take his idea to the next step I think a lot of credit does need to go in fact to to the entrepreneurs out there that are willing to risk their own capital their own reputations and so on to turn a very very risky idea into something new and novel and hopefully something that can change you know society please I have one wish that inventors would start instead of going more towards complexity that they would reverse and close to simplicity so anybody can hear somebody mention the car has so many thousand parts well why is it why wouldn't meet all those parts if if we could reverse it and use fewer parts and show the genius really in the making things simpler not anybody can put another button on a car and put ten more parts and so on so that's my wish you know I I think I think that can be addressed at least in some particular areas today I'll give you you know one example the fabrication of a computer chip today is unbelievably complex a typical plant like an intel plant to produce a typical pink pentium might run between one and two billion dollars for one factory and that's supposed to be three or four billion by two years from now and maybe ten billion by you know six years from now complexity upon complexity complexity in order to achieve the end result so you know one of the things that i've been working on is is how do you in fact make a computer chip but do it in 10 steps fabricate it in 45 minutes so there are people that are working on the simplification of things and when it comes to that you know the manufacturer of a car i think a lot of those innovations will come from material science a lot of the reasons why you need a lot of parts in a car is that steals and aluminum's aren't nearly as strong and robust and as rigid as they would need to be carbon nanotubes which are new materials development coming out and being discussed at various conferences worldwide you know offer the possibility for the first time you really could think of building an elevator between you know the earth and the moon and it would be you know structurally have great integrity so and you know the same kind of technology could be implemented for the building of you know maybe even injected molded airplanes or extruded cars fewer parts absolutely speak up Mary Howard comparative Media Studies is just a point of irony I've been a fan of dogs for a long time and I think it's incredibly ironic which maybe half the audience must realize maybe not that in fact he was introduced as the inventor of the mouse in this context which is maybe one of the most extreme examples of the context of it's more that would contextualize it's more important than mentioning something he's me I'd like to retroactively will introduce him as an inventor of argument nobody's actually said this but he invented and I think it was brought up a little bit earlier without specifically saying it by somebody who worked in the past but argument is about the idea of an invention in fact it's also behind the invention of the web and usually it's attributed to Ted Nelson in Vannevar bush and died but even beyond that his real point was how can we make a technological enhancement to human intelligence to let us cope better with everything that we've done is that the invention of the mouse is actually an ironic introduction I think in the context of the discussion that we've seen because he actually is best known for having in the entire text community invented a system for handling these issues of the escalation of knowledge in the management in fact using metric knowledge management in many ways I already noted thank you do you feel that today's intellectual property laws or hinder the development of new inventions in our in our technological society well I think it's a it's a very important issue and you need intellectual property to some extent to protect the creation so that you can attract the capital to create them in the first place on the other hand there is a real issue in patent law which has a fixed 20 years I mean it's it's bounced back in about 15 17 and 20 but it's approximately 20 years of protection and the significance of 20 years is changing profoundly 20 years 20 years ago was an interesting amount of time but today you're talking about being able to protect maybe some basic concept through many revolutions of technology as we go forward the significance of 20 years is going to become greater and greater so I do think we need to to revisit that and there's because of the complexity of technology a lot of patents get issued that aren't really don't deserve patent protection because someone has done something on a computer and then they say well I'm doing the same thing but on the web and then they create a patent and you probably couldn't contest that but because of the vagaries of jury trials where juries don't really understand the technology the patent has power anyway so I think there I think we need to revisit that some of the aspects of patent protection we mix 20 years despite the fact that the significance of time is changing you specifically do patenting in the medical world is too much stuff patentable well I think you know I think that that also is an evolving thing I think that I I think by and large what happens is pretty good in other words I think it's a somewhat self-correcting system but it takes time to correct itself so what happens is you know there may be things that you know and this is certainly cannot come up with the genome that gets patented or allows to get patented that maybe shouldn't but I think people start to realize what might have been obvious you know in other words what was obvious today is different you know ten years ago and it will be different ten years from now so it's a question of people catching up with that system and so I think in most cases things are pretty good in medicine but I think that there's got to be a continuing reexamination education for you know examiner's and so forth to really figure out what's obvious and and to really interpret that an intelligent way but I still feel overall it's reasonable can we take one more question and then quit while we're still hungry please we'll let you answer those other over here suggested that the mouse is an augmenting invention others may or may not be and I wonder if we're still as inventors have the ultimate goal of humanity or adulterate goal of humanity in mind or are we just looking more short-term each time we do it is basically the lifecycle of these inventions changes and what not are we just looking at how to make better Sall here or a better drug here as opposed to thinking more along lines of well what drugs in the world are needed to make many better well the ultimate goal humanity must be to smile more and frown less so we kind of aren't touching that I'm not sure I would agree with that I'm quite happy frowning sometimes and they're probably some drugs we could take where we'd smile all the time and I'm not sure that's the goal the thing the one thing that's I think the key thing that separates Homo sapiens from other species is our accumulating knowledge base other species communicates they do use tools but none of that evolves and they don't have a growing species wide shared knowledge base that evolves over time and reflects a dialogue among all the members of that species we're the only species that does that and that knowledge includes such grand things as music and art and as well as all the other kinds of conversations that we have and my mind that is the goal of humanities is to is to continue that species Y dialogue and create more profound knowledge well yeah just to deal with the medicine specifically but I think you know in a larger sense what I what I'll say I think it's true for most people here I'm not necessarily speaking for myself but more as an MIT professor who sees students come in and what drives in and I think what drives them isn't to make one new thing or you know I think it is to you know make the world a better place to make people healthier let's say if that's the area they choose to study it may come out that maybe they do one thing but I think the broad driving forces that I see so many students postdocs and scientists come in as they and I think that's what drives most inventors is that they want to see something good happen and I think they do have you know the long-term benefit in mind that may not be true for everybody but I think it's probably true for most people right good you know my dream I think is actually coming true to a large extent thanks to the internet and broadband people are talking and I think that's that's the foundation of how to solve a lot of these global worldwide problems people are talking and what language are they speaking well it is true that you can communicate across you know sociological and political and maybe even biological boundaries with for example music but there is another common language and I think there is one of that of invention you know you show some person invention one and then maybe a superior invention number two there may be some consensus that number two is actually better than number one and maybe we can create one that's a number three that's even better than number two so I think there is a common dialogue in the in the you know the languages invention the language is in engineering the language is science good you get the last word Wow I had one wife and three daughters and I was not used to having the last word [Applause] well I think while you're talking about about accumulating knowledge etc is is very much akin to what I feel is an important aspect it needs a lot more attention specifically for how we do develop our common knowledge and they're rated you know if the world knowledge doubles every six months what are our schools going to do and everybody that's out working in a job how are they going to get retreaded so you know the they're just huge changes that we they're coming about and we're not lining up is that the mission is to keep the conversation going with accumulating information all the time but then also to know when to stop I have to leave thank you very very much for your attention it's been an honor to be among you you
