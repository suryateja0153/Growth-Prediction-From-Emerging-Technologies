 welcome to the webinar pharmaceutical innovation and production in the edmonton metropolitan region hosted by edmonton global in collaboration with the trade commissioner services of canada in the hague and brussels good afternoon to our participants in europe and good morning to our panelists and participants here in canada welcome to everybody around the world who's joining us today my name is Stefan Scherer i'm part of the trade and investment team at edmonton global responsible for the life sciences sector and europe this is the first webinar in a series of webinars hosted by edmund and global in the coming months please note this webinar will be recorded and the recording will be available at the website of edmonton global later this week we are meaning maintaining physical distancing here in the theater just for your information the objective of our webinar today is to introduce the edmonton metropolitan region with regard to its pharmaceutical invasion and production opportunities as you have seen in the program of the webinar it is structured as follows we will start with a brief introduction from the partnering trade commissioner offices followed by some general information about the region then we will move to the presentations by our panelists michael overdune from the university of alberta andrew mcizak's applied pharmaceutical innovation and greg clark from gilead following these presentations we will have about 20 minutes for a question and answer period from the audience moderated by my colleague amanpreet questions can be submitted anytime during the presentations using the chat functions questions will be answered during the q a peer portion of the webinar please mention in the chat your name and affiliation and to whom your question is directed now i would like to introduce samina qureshi counselor commercial and senior trade commissioner in the netherlands at the canadian trade commissioner services in the hague and michelle gartland councillor commercial and senior trade commissioner in belgium and luxembourg at the canadian trade commissioner services hi everybody and greetings from the hague and thanks stefan for the opportunity to say a few words about the canadian trade commissioner service as an edmontonian it's a pleasure to collaborate with edmonton global on this webinar we're part of global affairs canada which is a federal department and this year we're 125 years old the first trade commissioner took up his posting in australia back in 1895 and since then we've evolved and we have both domestic and international networks of trade commissioners including in edmonton and in over 160 cities worldwide and our mandate is not only to support canadian exporters but also to assist companies interested in investing in canada and seeking a canadian innovation partner we can help you with your next investment decision by acting as your pathfinder to key contacts we work with federal provincial and municipal partners such as edmonton global we can provide you with sector specific market intelligence as well as information and advice on how to set up the business in canada as well we can help facilitate site visits to identify a strategic location so some of that that information is on the slide you see the place to start is in canada's branch office in the embassy near you where you can meet with us to discuss your plans there are great opportunities in the edmonton region that you'll hear about today enhanced with ceta the comprehensive economic and trade agreement we look forward to working with you and thank you so much and over to michelle garland thank you samina and edmonton global and welcome to this webinar i'm the senior trade commissioner at the canadian embassy to belgium in luxembourg and i am your canadian connection on the ground ready to work with you on everything from trade investment to innovation and okay particularly luxembourg and congratulations on luxembourg's recent ratification of sita sita paves the way for eu and canadian pharmaceutical firms who benefit from improved labor mobility expanded access to government procurement opportunities and mutual recognition of compliance certification processes for pharma manufacturing practices i invite you to connect with us your canadian partners on the ground here who work closely with our dutch and luxembourg counterparts who are with us on this call today to help our companies grow and go global on that note i turn it back to you edmonton global to start this webinar thank you samina thank you michelle at this point i will provide some general information about the edmonton metropolitan region edmonton is the capital of the province of alberta at the west of the canadian prairies and bordering to british columbia the edmonton metropolitan region is canada's fifth largest economy and the fastest growing region in the country over 1.5 million people and approximately 800 000 jobs are located in the greater edmonton region offering access to talent and diversity the region has significant expertise in engineering manufacturing nanotechnology and agriculture as well as offers world-class health research and expertise in computer science and of artificial intelligence it is also an energy-rich region at the center of the petrochemical development of western canada recently the alberta government has announced a job creation tax cut bringing the provincial corporate tax down to eight percent which is the lowest rate in canada by far young educated and growing these are the values of edmonton global and the region one of the youngest regions in canada and celebrated as a best community for use and use work the region is among the most educated in the world with more than 130 000 students enrolled in seven publicly funded post-secondary universities and at colleges this attracts a large number of foreign students and is recognized as the most entrepreneurial region in the country the edmonton metropolitan region has significant capacity in the field of life sciences and pharmaceutical innovation alberta health services is the largest integrated health system in canada with a budget exceeding 14 billion canadian dollars and with a digital health record for the province world-class research expertise with a number of post-secondary research institutes and the federal canada nanotechnology research center located in edmonton an extensive commercialization and innovation ecosystem exists as well to name a few applied pharmaceutical innovation we will have hear from them later take edmonton health accelerator health city bioalberta and gene gnome alberta to name a few node mercy also to mention edmonton is home to the alberta machine intelligence institute short amy one of the three major centers of the pan-canadian artificial intelligence strategic initiative which attracted offices like google brain google deep mind to the region in the past years biotechnology pharmaceuticals medical devices and research on the causes and treatment of diseases are all areas of innovation in the region nearly 70 percent of alberta's life science companies as well as close to 60 of alberta's biotech companies are based in the region the edmonton metropolitan region has recorded 200 growth in biotech research and development spending and the sector is contributing nearly 7.5 to the region's gdp the edmonton international airport is the first airport in canada and the most northern airport in the world to achieve certification from the international air transport association as a center of excellence in pharmaceutical logistics the airport offers direct flight connections to amsterdam with klm and both klm and schiphol airport in amsterdam are also pharma certified making it a natural connection point further the edmond international airport offers direct flights to asia and because of our northern routes we are the closest airport by flying time to most major centres in asia canada gives investors preferential market access through 14 trade agreements to 51 countries to mention a few cptpp with the trans-pacific partnerships the canada united states mexico agreement which was recently replacing nafta and sita mentioned by samina earlier i also want to mention port alberta a foreign trade zone where investors are eligible for duty and tax relief as well as value-added manufacturing to create canada-labeled products the region has an integrated supply chain and offers connections by rail road and air to the rest of the world a direct train link to port of prince rupert offers access by ship to asia three to four days faster compared to other pacific ports other features are the circumpolar air traffic routes to asia and europe as well as a 24-hour airport access now we are moving on to the panelists for the session and you can find more information on the speakers in the email you received with your registration first is dr michael overdune he's a professor in the department of biochemistry at the university of alberta founder and co-director of discovery lab among other positions he holds michael joins us remotely michael the floor is yours please thank you for the opportunity to speak today i'd like to give you my personal experience having moved to edmonton five years ago the primary reason i moved was because although i had a great research program in the uk i wanted to commercialize some of the outputs of that research and i thought that edmonton and alberta were very innovation friendly great blue sky thinking right open door and in fact they are very much i've really enjoyed my time here i came as a professor in the department of biochemistry and i lead nanuk which is a national facility uh that offers access to magnets to study protein structures uh metabolomics uh drug discovery lead generation hit identification and that's been really a remarkable journey it's been running as a facility since 1990 and we're currently expanding the infrastructure there one of the programs that we've spun out is tmic which is a international internationally recognized center for metabolomics both in the pharmaceutical space nutraceuticals of environmental metabolomics and it now also encompasses six different centers across canada but the node the lead node is in edmonton and so alberta has great infrastructure both the academic facilities and also the companies that we work with um there are many many small companies that engage with the university and i've really enjoyed that being a part of that ecosystem and watching the economy diversify one of the programs that i set up that has commercialization uh potential that we're currently pushing quite hard on is the styrene malay acid lipid particle project or schmalt for short where we're solubilizing membrane protein targets and this research is funded by a lot of great funding bodies in alberta also the walking trust which funds internationally and one of the projects that i've set up is discovery lab i'll walk you through some of these projects just briefly and i look forward to any questions so this is a project that we've been running with european collaborators for about 10 years we took a look at some of the understudied kinases you may know that there are about 500 kinases of which only about 90 have really been exploited for drug discovery and so we tackled some of the others and found camk1d which is a kinase in the human genome that's calcium activated to be one really terrific target by number of criteria it gave great spectra by nmr spectroscopy as shown at point two and so we pursued that further uh it was known at that point to be involved in cancer and we did the lead generation using nmr and other biophysical methods using funding from glaxosmithkline uh and also the walking trust to identify binding pockets for these small molecules both by nmr and also other facilities or to be a core facility down the hall as well so there's great biophysics and in the past uh a few months we've just got another 800 000 of equipment from the canadian government to get additional biophysical equipment to screen for ligands using um high throughput methods also for lipids which i'm particularly interested in and we've used all this data then to identify binding modes both nmr x-ray crystallography and there's of course the canadian light source is not far away so we have a synchrotron nearby um and then we've used structure based design to develop a library of inhibitors and there's a lot of great chemistry uh in edmonton in particular so there's rain pharmaceuticals that we collaborate with fedora pharmaceuticals chem roots alberta research chemicals incorporated these are all medicinal chemistry based companies that are happy to collaborate and uh and contract for a small molecule drug discovery projects and we've tested these these inhibitors and we just published our first paper in jmed chem looking at their efficacy and diabetes models take place in a large pharmaceutical company and do this in space because of the quality of the infrastructure and the collaborators uh including the structural genomics consortium which is both based here in canada and in frankfurt as well as companies um uh in in the uk signature discovery in particular and so this has really been an international collaborative effort and this is a project that i started 10 years ago and it's been great to see this carry forward and we're now looking also triple negative breast cancer and alzheimer's targets for these kinase inhibitors uh using funding from uh alberta funding bodies next slide so kinase as i've talked about briefly the critical targets for cancer in particular but even more valuable are the membrane protein targets including gpcrs and historically these have been expressed as recombinant proteins but we've taken a totally different approach expressing them or taking them from their natural hosts whether they're mice or or human tissue and we use a polymer known as thyromolec acid this is a polymer that was developed by a company polyscope which is based in the netherlands and we've really had a tremendously uh mutually beneficial partnership with them we're expanding the library of polymers and they've been developed by polyscope initially for industrial purposes and we are redeploying them for drug discovery and creating new polymers that have affinity tags fluorescent groups improved properties for in vivo utility and diagnostics as well as for high throughput screening and there's been over um 250 publications on this polymer technology we've patented and we're licensing the polyscope and so it's mutually beneficial and the researchers of course are benefiting for example structures of the glycine receptor or the alternative complex 3 that could never have been seen any other way because uh only with this technology can you see the bound lipids the post-translational modifications the weak complexes using methods including cryo-em x-ray crystallography and so working with polyscope a new company has been spun out called poly science we've attracted an industry club a consortia of international players that are very interested in this alternative to detergents to solubilizing and analyzing membrane protein targets which represent half of the drug discovery targets out there and again this technology it's coming uh into a new generation of polymers because of the work being carried out here in edmonton and our willingness to share openly with the community uh and in particular through polyscope to make these reagents and assays available globally um through this industry club and beyond next slide please and so i've really enjoyed the research here in edmonton uh and trying to take these these new ideas to market uh one of the things that i've also wanted to do to share these ideas these these pathways for commercialization in the uk i had begun an organization called science capital and i've grown that even further here under the name of discovery lab and we've had over 180 companies spin out uh talk about their new technologies and pitch their plans to investors and business mentors in the past few years um also about 150 advisors have come forward to volunteer their time just showing you what a collaborative and collegial environment edmonton is they offer their time to help these startups and small companies get to market whether they're local or global and raise funding in the past year about 150 million was raised by teams who pitched at discovery lab events in the past few years and so a lot of money is being raised and we have a within our panel of advisors investors it's about 3 billion dollars that is looking for investable projects and so there's a lot of cash both in edmonton alberta canada and beyond that's now looking at edmonton as a great place to invest and at the same time we're also aligning the university priorities and the facilities the transfer services so it becomes easy natural to spin out companies i've got five uh companies and projects that have commercialization potential that i'm currently pushing forwards and i'm just one person uh with a with a small lab so there's a lot of potential i think what really makes edmonton special is the culture everything is relatively easy here there isn't really barriers to innovation or collaboration it's very collegial and you just need to open a door and find someone willing to talk to you it's natural and that's been a lot of fun i've really enjoyed the commercialization of partnership potential and i'm looking forward to staying here for the long term i'd be happy to take any questions at any point and thanks for the opportunity to tell my short story thank you very much michael for sharing your thoughts and experiences in edmonton next speaker let's go ahead and questions being at the end being answered uh dr andrew mcizacs he is the ceo of applied pharmaceutical information innovation assistant dean in the faculty of pharmacy and for pharmaceutical science at the university of alberta andrew it's yours thank you so much and welcome everyone um so as my intro stated i'm the ceo of applied pharmaceutical innovation um what we are is a not-for-profit institute that spun out of the university um a few years ago to tackle some of the big challenges that exist in drug development and we've quickly made a name for ourselves in our unique model and its capacity that's establishing edmonton as a region for people to scale up uh their innovations so taking it from the place where michael would would basically be spinning out a company and providing the resources and infrastructure and ability for them to grow into a company here within within edmonton alberta so we work with a really unique model we looked at the space of support that pharma usually goes towards the the cros as well as the academic partnerships and we sort of developed a program where we do a hybrid model so typically if you went to a contract research organization you get professional industry level science that happened quickly but you'd miss out on some of the innovations that sometimes exist within academia whereas going to academia you know you get some of that innovative cutting edge research but you miss out on a little bit of the speed and a little bit of the industry focused lens that you find within a cro environment so we launched api as a model to provide a hybrid of the two of them in a way that builds uh teams that can work for companies within the life sciences space so our organization provides drug design medicinal chemistry and synthesis regulatory support a lot of the admin and bioanalytical work that companies need we provide a characterization in vivo and vitro studies clinical trial design population bk pharmacometrics and we tie in with groups like amy on artificial intelligence and machine learning and so the big the big thing that we're able to provide for companies within the region is the ability to grow teams with that specific expertise in our model we work with post-docs and grad students under pis within a university environment co-supervised with our industry staff and so the the postdocs that work on the projects with industry um are usually working on a project for a large pharma like you know a pfizer or a cicada at the same time they're also working for a spin-off or a startup and the idea with this system is that as these companies grow and scale within the edmonton region um they can recruit and hire out the postdocs who have been working for the the projects uh within the university environment and they've got that own capacity in-house um and they've got someone who really understands their program so the idea is to be able to enable companies to scale and grow we've actually worked quite uh quite well in this space even in incubating companies to start up as drug manufacturers um edmonton has you know thousands of graduates from top-ranked programs and institutions such as the u of a and nate we've got uh global top ten rankings in fields of engineering pharmacy and pharmaceutical sciences for research as well as really hands-on chemistry program as well as decades of regional experience as a petrochemical center with supply chain logistics support canada's most hands-on undergraduate programs and as mentioned before airport certifications that enable us to handle pharmaceuticals in cold chain supply so all of this and our location makes us a great uh destination for the um uh the building of a new industry um so one of the one of the projects we recently took on um is a security of supply chain within canada and a little bit more broadly when it relates to protocol and some of the other um medications that are in short supply uh here in canada um we have enabled a group of intermediate producers in the edmonton metro region who produced some of the ingredients that would go into some of these pharmaceutical products and have been in the process of establishing a facility to enable them to scale up at a gmp level for uh sort of a secondary supply system here in canada especially as cobit 19 tends to disrupt supply chains and there's a little bit of a question mark over the next two years as to some of the supply within uh within the world when it comes to these pharmaceutical products um so working in this in this space we've actually been quite successful in building a supply chain uh using some of these innovations that is lower cost and is enabling us to not to compete directly with the high volume low cost producers in areas like india or china but also you know the ability for us to produce a secondary supply to fill in gaps where where space is needed within the um within the supply chain and that's it for me in terms of time thank you very much andrew uh for sharing your experiences and your insights next one will be greg clark he is the vice president of operations and general manager of the gilead alberta manufacturing facility greg is also a member a board member of api and greg is also with us here live in alberta and the floor is craig clark is the next speaker so good afternoon everyone my name is greg clack i'm general manager of gilead alberta gillian barberta is a folio and subsidiary of gilead sciences inc which is a global pharmaceutical company located in foster city california just south of san francisco our mission as a site is to support the development and commercialization of innovative new medicines for unmet medical needs we do that in a number of ways the first is we develop synthetic processes to produce these apis or active pharmaceutical ingredients at both laboratory and plant scale second we develop appropriate analytical controls to ensure the quality of the compounds that we're manufacturing we are tasked with producing appropriate supplies of these clinical materials and commercial materials when necessary and we have to do this all under gmp or good manufacturing practices because these are going into people and finally we also work on next generation chemistry and support our outsourced cmo or contract manufacturing organization network so prior to becoming uh part of gilead in 2006 raylo acted as one of these cmo's contract manufacturing organization and we worked for a number of companies like gilead small companies that didn't own their own means of manufacturing or development and help them get their programs through clinical trials and ultimately through to commercialization at some point reylo was actually started in 1963 when professor ray lemieux who's a carbohydrate chemist at the university of alberta was approached by a pharmaceutical company to come do contract research for the united states professor lemieux countered at the proposal that let him stay in edmonton with his family and friends and r and l molecular research was formed which was ray and leo leo is his brother was a contractor and actually helped build the first lab building rnl became a reload chemical shortly after that so we started uh we started working for gilead in the early 1990s so by the time the company purchased us in 2006 we had already developed a strong business relationship with them and we worked on a number of their compounds and even taken some of them through to commercialization for them it was also a good cultural fit as we have a diverse workforce and a collaborative team oriented culture so one of the questions we often get is why edmonton of all places number one uh we really have uh a competitive cost environment within north america and and europe number two there's a very highly educated workforce available number three we have support of local governments we have proximity to excellent educational institutions which have been mentioned already today and uh last but not least we have proximity of the edmonton international airport which facilitates both receipt of raw materials and shipping of the final products that we make out at the end of the day another question we're often asked is what has changed for our site since becoming part of gilead and i'm pleased to say that the site has enjoyed quite a lot of growth when we first became gilead in 2006 we had approximately 160 employees we now have more than 370 staff members in 2014 we purchased four hectares of land uh in close proximity to our site what that we call the west campus and in 2015 and 2016 we built two lab buildings w1 and w2 to total more than 10 800 square meters and house 177 employees in 2019 we added a second process tower to our original east campus and uh added nine additional reaction vessels as well as associated uh filtration and uh drying equipment so this growth would would really not be possible unless there was an underlying business need which there was for gilead the site has to continue to execute and we've done our best to do that and you have to be in a supportive environment and we certainly have found out in edmonton and alberta thank you thank you very much greg for sharing your thoughts and your perspectives on that uh we are entering now the question and answer period uh for the next 15 minutes and i would like to introduce my colleague aman preet bhatti from the trade and investment team at edmonton global she will moderate the question and answer period and i invite both presenters on the stage here with us and we have michael uh remotely connected with us as well as the trade commissioner services in brussels and the hague for questions amanpreet please thank you stefan and thank you to all the attendees and panelists for joining our webinar this morning uh we look forward to having the panelists answer your questions and so far we've got some great ones and again please submit any questions you may have through the chat box uh indicating your name and who you'd like the question to go towards so just let's kick it off um i'll throw the first question off to andrew and maybe i'll have michael join in if he has anything to add so the first question is from keith growing with orca therapeuticals out of the netherlands and his question is does the edmonton metro region have specific regulations on clinical studies with genetically modified organisms and would it be an option to bring patients from europe into canada to participate in those clinical studies let's go ahead andrew awesome uh so that is a little bit technical um in terms of its uh in terms of its nature we do have uh standard ethics boards within um our post-secondary system here um the university of alberta handles uh most of the uh clinical trials from the uh sort of northern uh half of alberta uh with calgary in itself and handling uh the other trials um i'm not sure if michael can maybe weigh in a little bit on terms of the specific guidelines around uh genetic modification but um uh i found that the the environment here is quite um open to good science and health canada is a great regulator in that aspect as well too um they're more responsive especially in the early stage than some jurisdictions um around the world especially you know the fda and others where there's a little bit more of a scientific lens to what we're doing uh that that is a little bit more open perfect uh michael do you have anything to add to that sure i mean for um for clarity i i run annual events on various topics including agriculture and genetically modified organisms have been used in agriculture in canada for quite a while it is regulated and accepted here um so but that's in the crop sciences which is of course a huge area here in alberta in terms of um the economic impact as well um in terms of other uses are there more specifics that i could have from the speaker about what kind of organisms they're looking at uh unfortunately it was a question that came in so we'll uh we'll reach out to them and see if we can get more specifics and then have you connect with them directly yeah so basically in the crop area there is certainly a lot of openness and a lot of very advanced crop sciences here in alberta so definitely it's accepted and there's a large agricultural uh faculty at the university of alberta with lots of collaborations with local um companies uh that are trying to develop next generation crops perfect thank you michael so our next question i'm going to throw it over to you greg we have a question that came in from svetlana saplin cova from kmt hepata and the question is what is the main focus of gilead's facility in edmonton so we are an api facility or an active pharmaceutical ingredient facility most of the compounds we're working on are early stage compounds that are just going through clinical trials and as you know there's a very high attrition rate so the site has the capability to be involved with those compounds supply clinical trials all the way through to commercialization if required uh our our site then takes on the role of transferring those processes to cmo sites contract manufacturing organizations because gilead is very much an outsourced organization and we support those manufacturers those cmos throughout the life cycle of the product if they have a problem we help them solve it because in an outsourced organization their success is tied to our support does that answer the question great yeah absolutely thank you um all right the next one i'm gonna throw it to staphon and then of course any of you guys want to join in it's a more of a generic question if you guys want to share a little bit about building a talent pipeline for this industry in the region so go ahead stephan so the post-secondary educational institutions we have in this region are acute pipeline and we heard from andrew as well as from greg mentioning and michael as well the university and the colleges around provide the academic research part but also the technicians so there is a pipeline in all levels which are required for for manufacturing and then some supporting institutions is in the nanotechnology space i mentioned the national center for nanotechnology which is located here as well as api uh amy the alberta machine intelligence institute if you're looking for data and and artificial intelligence contributions but maybe andrew has something to add or greg for that sure absolutely um well alberta especially you know we we built our economy over the past you know 50 years or so as a petrochemical province where you know our oil and gas industry is very focused on the chemistry side so as a result we've got a excellent post-secondary system focused on grads from engineering and science who really can understand the sort of engineering you need to build manufacturing sites uh for chemistry which you know small molecule drug development that's that's exactly what you need as well as a very strong system of post-secondaries with students in a wide range of health sciences yeah our our group at the faculty pharmacy and pharmaceutical sciences is ranked top 13 in the world right now for a research output and a lot of that is the technical skills you need to to build successful companies in the pharmaceutical industry greg also has uh certainly we have you know we have a lot of u of a graduates who work at our site and we also have a lot of nate graduates so nate is the northern alberta institute of technology located here in the city and uh they come up with a two-year chemical technology diploma and that's an excellent basis for the training that we're going to give them when they arrive at the site it's a 24 7 manufacturing site these processes are very complex but they come with the the skill set and uh people who have spent time in edmonton if we're looking for more experienced people to come to the city people who have spent time in edmonton uh are happy to come here if they've done their education their postdoc here they have no uh reservations if you're living in the southern us and you you're a little afraid of snow it's a bit of a question mark for you but uh otherwise uh anybody who spent some time here is uh knows that it's a good place and are happy to return if i could just pipe in as well that with discoverylab what we try to do is link everybody who's part of that ecosystem so if you have a great idea that you're turning into a prototype you can tell your story link up with whether it's an investor an ip advisor uh someone who could provide space one of the local incubators to find a community of like-minded companies to to work uh within that environment um and we also find now companies increasingly moving to edmonton from the us especially because it is an attractive place for the the men uh some of the reasons mentioned uh for gilead as well but for small companies especially the cost base and the skill base is critical and we offer a great cost base and a lot of skills i was really really impressed when i came here with the number of projects that had strong commercialization potential and i was really blown away by the fact that within three years we had 180 people pitch business plans that had strong commercial potential some of them come back three four times and pitch and every time they get stronger closer to market and investment ready uh and and so it's very natural very easy here discovery lab is just one of those networks that links us together but it's it's very easy to join it's free simple and you can connect to a wide ecosystem here very quickly very efficiently and get high quality connections thank you guys um the next question i'm gonna throw it over to samina and michelle uh what role does logistics canada logistics and canada's trade agreements with europe asia and north america play in these decisions for pharmaceutical companies and of course everyone can chime in but i'll let samina and michelle go ahead well when it comes to logistics uh the netherlands is a real it's a real hub it's a real center and stefan had mentioned in his opening remarks uh that there's a link between klm the klm is a link between amsterdam and the edmonton airport but certainly part of the uh you know the opportunities that come with trade agreements are tariff eliminations etc and logistics plays a part in moving the goods moving the people um sita also facilitates the movement of intra-company transfer transferees so those are a few comments michelle do you have anything to add on that just similarly uh you know i think uh between ben alux you've uh you've hit a real uh distribution and logistics help here for europe and uh with the the free access and movement of goods it's just made it easier for our uh canadian and european counter companies to to get there to move their goods and we've seen a great uh increase both in belgium and luxembourg and i believe the netherlands as well samina of since sita has come into force so we know our companies are taking advantage of it and uh it's something that we will continue to promote uh in pharmaceutical and across many other sectors where it's benefiting greatly i would also add that it's a great gateway into the us and a lot of our small companies looking for a way to get into the u.s market and edmonton has has that gateway potential the us is complicated and expensive edmonton is simple and not that expensive and it has the the networks perfect um okay uh we'll do a couple of more questions so greg i'm going to throw this on to you uh unique site specific requirements for scalable pharmaceutical innovation production uh do you have any examples of what those specific requirements would be site-specific requirements yes so for existing assets infrastructure for a facility so uh obviously we were around since 1963 so we built up some of that infrastructure when you register a product with a regulatory body via the canadian government or the us government or the european uh european governments there's an expectation that you will file a change before you move that site so some of this production tends to be a little sticky if you start somewhere you're going to have to continue operating somewhere or you have to jump through some hoops to get the to make the changes but uh it's really basically just having trained people having the right uh infrastructure in it a successful operation doing mostly small volume and each type of products where you could have a lot larger equipment and focus on higher volume our site goes from 165 meters to 7600 meters and that's just in the plant we can also do things in 20 meters and smaller in the in the lab so the idea is we can make whatever we were the size of the trial a lot of these materials are very expensive to make the healing stuff you need 10 kilos you're not going to make 100 kilos you probably can't find a lot of chills so it's just building that equipment up having procedures in place standard operating sheet just making everything's clean making sure that it's documented it's a it's a real quality culture and it takes some time to establish what the infrastructure is not that hard it's worth noting too that there is a lot of uh space here in alberta um for the development towards some of this advanced manufacturing um you know you can be within 30 minutes of literally every community within the edmonton region with the site so you know the staff have the opportunity to live in the downtown core where things are um you know bustling and busy or in a beautiful suburb with you know big lawn and garage um you know we've got a lot of the the natural uh pieces that fit as well too like uh low humidity um a uh you know a real sort of uh strength in terms of stability of the region and the lack of adverse uh weather events that tend to gum things up um you know there's there's a lot of there's a lot of stuff that if you were looking for a site to do a greenfield uh expansion um you'd have a whole bunch to pick from here in edmonton i think andrea has a good point about the knowing our site probably drives much more than about 30 minutes and in some jurisdictions you know doing three times that much each way uh every day would not be uncommon and that's a big that's a big difference for people i might add that uh also the alberta heartland industry association which is part from edmonton global basic municipality it's one of the largest petrochemical complexes located in this jurisdiction just 20 minutes outside of the city perfect thank you uh so we have time for one more question and i think this is a great question for all of our our panelists to chime in on and it adds uh it's kind of connected to the last question as well but what is our regional strength when it comes to pharmaceutical product development so andrew i'll start with you sure yeah we have a lot of expertise in the health sciences groups like michael's as well as within the um the field of artificial intelligence and chemistry there is a real strong pharmacy faculty as i mentioned as well too we've come up with a lot of great ip and the unique thing about the edmonton region is we have the ability to commercialize it you know we we have all of the pieces that you need from that initial sort of discovery and lead selection but also the ability to you know begin doing the acme work run the clinical trials to analyze the data at a level that is you know uh world-class so there's the there's all the pieces here within this region that you can sort of assemble into a pharmaceutical company just sitting here and i think that that's probably one of our biggest strengths is the ability to scale up here both our own innovations as well as the uh innovations that uh that come from other jurisdictions to to where we are yeah i would add that our institutes are really strong both in diabetes cancer infectious diseases there's a lot of talent a lot of great molecules that have been developed here that are still being developed a lot of grain talent that comes with that um and companies to partner with to to do the chemistry it's a very strong region we don't talk about it enough we don't i think promote what we actually have here but come and visit it's a it's a very strong deep culture of science technology especially in the pharmaceutical space greg would you like to add anything to that i think uh i think andrew's actually done a pretty good job of of uh of covering it you know we can talk about julia times but we functioned and did that scale of work for many years before we cost something became and stephon you'd like to add lastly i think uh one thing um the region has the critical mass of different organizations which come together but it's not so big that you don't find the connection and the networking within the region that's something i observed and there are a number of complementary organizations and activities which are running which are helping each other and are easy accessible within to name health city as one initiative by city of edmonton and all the other activities which are going on perfect i think with that we are coming to the end of this webinar and i like to wrap up here we hope you found it useful
