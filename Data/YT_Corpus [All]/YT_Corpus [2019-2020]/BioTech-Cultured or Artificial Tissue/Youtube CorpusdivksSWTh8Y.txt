 [Music] [Music] folks my name is Doug Vincent chair of the tech day committee I'm really excited today it's a beautiful day outside there's not a lot of things that would draw me inside today but this the program we have for you today is one of those things we have had so much fun putting this program together working with these five outstanding faculty members couldn't be happier than to share that with you all today we have a little bit different format this year we've delayed lunch until after 12:45 so our five speakers will all be before lunch we'll hear from three of them have a break including some fruit and granola and rejoin here for the last two and at the end we'll have some some questions and answers the president Hockfield will moderate that we have live feed downstairs two little Kresge and we'll go through some more the details for questions and answers a little bit later in this program the goal of that is so this afternoon folks are free to explore the campus participate in other class activities and so forth so bear with us for a little bit lengthened morning program we think you'll find it worth the while I need to say thank you to the Alumni Association for the faith that they continue to have in the tech Day committee thank you to the committee outstanding year and of course thank you to lou alexander outstanding just a pleasure to work with you if folks would reach to wherever they have their cell phones right now and find the button on it that says off and turn that off I appreciate that thank you just like to introduce now Beth Garvin executive vice president and CEO of the MIT Alumni Association Beth good morning it's a pleasure to see so many familiar faces and even more exciting to see so many unfamiliar faces I hope I get a chance to say hello to each of you personally and welcome welcome you back to MIT Doug and I were just chatting before the program started and I said don't give me much of an introduction because nobody wants to hear from you or me Doug they're here to hear from the president and to hear from these marvelous faculty he noted however that yeah we're just the glue that holds it together and I'd like to acknowledge that glue in the Technology Day Committee in all the reunion committee volunteers the reunion gift committee volunteers reunion row volunteers Tech Challenge game volunteers all the hundreds of people who have helped make check reunions 2005 a fabulous success from all accounts it's been my joy this year to be able to introduce our 16th president Susan Hockfield to all of you and to introduce the Alumni to her it has been just a remarkable journey as we first announced Susan's naming and any of you with an email address that we know have heard from me multiple times about how I think this has been such a wonderful choice for MIT and what a wonderful fit dr. Hockfield is for MIT at this point in time so without any further ado all of the background is in your program book and I'm sure you've already read of Susan's remarkable accomplishments so I do nothing more than turn it over to president Hockfield thank you thank you please it's a great pleasure to be here this morning Thank You Beth it's been a real treat for me to travel the country with you and to have you by my side introducing me to alumni from coast to coast one of the things that has impressed me enormous ly about MIT is the kind of energy that just emanates from the place you walked down the corridor isn't the place of just bursting with energy but that energy is carried inside the people the place and so as I traveled the country with Beth and her band of just tireless troopers you know having them by my side and having them introduced me to many of you over the last what is it now almost six months has just been an incredible delight and a treat the MIT alumni are indeed a very special brunch special in so many ways especially that you could have finally brought spring to Cambridge we thank you for that it's been a grim spring but this weekend is the first you know real burst of sunshine that makes us feel optimistic that we actually might have a summer here it's just been wonderful to sample the treats of this reunion weekend my only regret people have asked me what I regret what are the what are the things I don't like about my job and my response is always the thing I don't like is only having 24 hours a day and that's the way I feel about these several days I mean I wish I could leave live every hour of these days three times over so that I could be at all of the events and meet more of you than I'm going to unfortunately have a chance to meet this weekend I hope I know I've met many of you and I will be meeting several more of you many more of you over the next several hours through the end of this reunion weekend but I promise you in the months and years to come I will be getting around to meeting all of you so it's great to be here this morning's program is wonderful I can take absolutely no credit for it there are many happy coincidences I've seen over the last six months and certainly the topic for this morning's program is a very happy coincidence those of you who read or heard my inauguration address know that one of the things I drew out among the very very many exciting opportunities and challenges for MIT going forward is fantastic convergence between the life sciences and engineering and this morning's program exemplifies that in just startling ways in addition the content of this program that you will hear exemplifies the intellectual rigor and the work at the frontiers of knowledge that really do define MIT as an institution I know that the devotion of alumni is one of our absolutely greatest strengths and keeping MIT strong and vibrant is a team effort that involves all of you as well as all of us on campus but this great community of MIT that reaches across the country across the world is perfectly in line with the Institute's fundamentally collaborative spirit at MIT something that I've learned is that we have a gift for learning from one another we excel at the kinds of intellectual interaction that pushed conventional boundaries and established new fields of study new industries and new ways of thinking about the world the collaborations that MIT Fosters depend on our remarkable culture of openness I've been struck by how the very architecture of the main group symbolizes this the main group was imagined and then constructed imagined by Bosworth as one huge but interconnected building with corridors that linked the entire expanse of these enormous buildings our historic campus embodies the vision of an institution without internal boundaries a place where people who are interested in similar problems can work together freely across what might otherwise be disciplinary divides in its design the main group has actually helped invent MIT and helped MIT invent the future in the years ahead we will continue to capitalize on our spirit of openness to create new partnerships across our own schools and departments and with other institutions in the public and private sectors collaboration is absolutely essential if we are to fulfill my tea's mission of bringing knowledge to bear on the world's great problems the challenges facing us today from climate change to the future of social security to the startling spread contagious diseases are inherently multidisciplinary now mi t--'s distinct ability to catalyze work at the interfaces of existing disciplines also depends on a single uniform standard of excellence over the course of this year I found in uncompromising dedication to excellence in all of our departments and schools we see it in the faculty and the students and also in the staff around the Institute I think this morning's program will demonstrate what I mean today's faculty presenters are absolutely stellar researchers but they're also stellar teachers and members devoted members generous members of the MIT community and they will be talking about some of our eras most exciting advances in science and technology this generation is bearing witness to a fascinating convergence of engineering and the life sciences this convergence holds the promise of transforming our lives but this kind of convergence is not unprecedented it's a convergence that we saw not so long ago and we know this precedent 70 years ago President Karl Compton insisted that the physical scientists physical sciences must play a critical role in education and research at MIT and the result of bringing in the physical sciences into conversation with engineering produced nothing less than a new era for engineering which MIT pioneered to appreciate the power of the kinds of collaborations that Compton helped spawn through the 20th century's big convergence you only have to think about the radiation lab that helped develop radar and helped us win World War two today engineering is making the same kind of fertile connections with life sciences and I believe we can expect equally revolutionary results combining MIT s historic strengths and engineering and our newer strengths and biology in the brain and cognitive sciences we're already opening up unprecedented opportunities for educational innovation for invention and for discovery we're pioneering new educational areas as well as new research directions we have biological variants of several of the engineering majors and next fall we're going to be initiating a new major in biological engineering I think this tech day program will show you how MIT is leading the way in this new field of all fields just as we have led the way in disciplines that define the information age I think it also demonstrates the tremendous contributions MIT can and will be making to this nation and the world I've been looking forward to hearing these faculty presenters talk about their research for months and I am delighted to have the luxury of sitting in the audience with all of you today I'm anticipating an exciting program and I'm sure that MIT will prove as it has done over the last several months that my anticipation cannot even come close to what we were actually going to experience so enjoy the afternoon and enjoy the morning and I will return I promise you it's only going to be the morning but I'm gonna return at the end to moderate the question period so enjoy this morning's presentations thank you [Applause] it's great every once in a while I think a group like the tech tech committee gets lucky and we selected last fall bioengineering and then to be honored with the president Hockfield first time presiding over today it's sometimes you get you get lucky and about that last fall when we were looking at this topic trying to understand what how do we construct this program we sat down with Professor Doug Lofton Berger and he just gave us an education and we were so thrilled and learned so much we said jeez what do you think can you can you do that on a broader scale he said absolutely remarkably he thanked us this morning for being a part of it when in fact really we think he and all the faculty for their time to put together today's program doug is the director of mi t--'s bioengineering division and at this point just turn it over to dark [Applause] thank you very much Doug and it's a privilege to be part of this day with all the alumni and Friends coming back we'll see if there's any continuing adjustment that needs to be done and I'll be darned it was what I'm going to give you is not the research excitement itself I have to lay out the context for what's happening at MIT and why it's happening why is happening now why it's happening here and that's the purpose of this talk so I talked about the landscape of bioengineering at MIT and how we're breaking new ground in this landscape now those of you who haven't been back for a while know that this landscape has been changing dramatically to breaking new ground all over the local blocks with new buildings and new excitement and so that's been changing as well but that's not the landscape that I mean I want to talk about the intellectual landscape of the interface between engineering and biology now there has been a traditional biomedical engineering landscape both at MIT and around the country and this has been around for about 40 years there's been a field known as biomedical engineering bioengineering medical engineering at many places and what it's been all about is essentially the marriage of the classical engineering disciplines in which students are trained in mathematics and physics and chemistry married with medicine to solve medical problems in ways there are technologies based on mathematics and physics and chemistry could now one important feature of this is that it's a multidisciplinary application field all the different engineering fields could bring what they had to bear in contact with medicine and solve problems from their own unique disciplinary backgrounds accordingly from the MIT point of view this was never appropriate as an undergraduate major degree of study because you were better off studying in any of the other classical engineering disciplines and applying your interests to medicine if you if you so wished at the graduate level of course since you were taking these other engineering disciplinary backgrounds and using them to solve medical problems that was a very appropriate type of graduate study to do with in any of the MIT engineering departments electrical engineering and computer science mechanical engineering material science Chemical Engineering and so forth and many of these programs benefited from interaction with the Health Sciences technology and it's connection to Harvard Medical School the other feature is that the bio in the bio engineering and biomedical engineering has for those 40 years in these programs essentially been organ level physiology which is of course crucial for medicine but is essentially descriptive that's not the mechanisms by which living systems operate so you could describe what was going on in engineering terms and try to work at it from the outside but you couldn't control the underlying mechanisms so that's what's been around for 40 years and it's very important had very valuable contributions and will continue to have variable valuable contributions and will continue at MIT with in all these other departments these kind of contributions have been manifested in a variety of career opportunities carried out by MIT alums and probably many of you have been working in these very fields medical devices of all sorts Diagnostics like imaging and prosthetics implants extracorporeal devices maybe the pharmaceuticals industry and processing manufacturing and delivery and in all these very important contributions of biomedical engineering careers the one interesting feature is that training of engineers in the actual bios biological science fundamentals really wasn't crucial you had to be really good at your math and your physics and your chemistry and interface with a physiological problem that was what was crucial rather than the biological science itself all right with that as a 40-year backdrop now what is new besides many buildings going up what is new in the bioengineering landscape well as president Hockfield told you we have now created something brand new and in fact I will assert unique a biology based engineering discipline that we call biological engineering instead of being an engineering discipline rooted solely in math and physics or math and physics and chemistry this one is rooted in the molecular life sciences what's at the core of it is genetics biochemistry molecular biology cell biology it's us this engineering discipline is rooted in the mechanisms by which living systems operate the very molecules and cells that make things happen for good or ill but these Sciences are fused with engineering and analysis and synthesis just like all the other engineering disciplines fused analysis and synthesis with physics and chemistry and so forth so it's focused on taking these life sciences and understanding them in a quantitative and systems oriented way and designing new technologies based on these biological molecular and cellular components and mechanisms so once you have a discipline now that's just like Electrical Engineering mechanical engineering Chemical Engineering but is now rooted in a different science now MIT has agreed that this is appropriate for standalone degree programs both a new ph.d program that we started in 1999 and what's quite exciting is a new bachelor's degree program that starts this very fall all right but why has this changed happened why was this traditional landscape for 40 years and now something very radically new is happening why is engineering and biology interaction changing so dramatically because the biological science itself has changed so dramatically the engineering can't change in a revolutionary way unless the science has changed in a revolutionary way and that's what's happened in the past 20 years there have been two major revolutions in biology the molecular revolution roughly in the 80s the genomic revolution rough in the 90s so if you took biological science before the 80s you did not learn these types of biological science this has all happened in the last 20 years I went to college in the 1970s and in the 1970s I did not learn this kind of biological science so what was the engineering biology interface quote then before these revolutions back when I took biological science in the 1970s it honestly was not amenable to engineering analysis and synthesis and design engineers could not access biology before these revolutions because biological science didn't understand the actual mechanisms few of the actual components the parts had been identified you could only quantify things at these higher organ levels of hierarchy which is why engineers worked at the organ physiology level you certainly couldn't manipulate any of the molecular components even if you identified them there was nothing you could do about them a gene was a gene and a protein was a protein I there wasn't enough data to build models and design and it was hard to generalize from humans to mice to rats to worms and so forth so the modern era of bioengineering really began with the molecular biology revolution in essentially the 1980s because that permitted mechanistic components to be identified and manipulated and you can't engineer anything unless you know what the components are and you can manipulate them I just show this for illustration this is a bone and for all the traditional years of biomedical engineering bone could be perceived and dealt with only on the basis of being this macroscopic load-bearing mechanical object for instance my mother has had six hip replacements many years ago she crushed her hip falling off a bicycle and what could biomedical engineers do about that well pre the revolution all they could do is replace that hip as say a mechanical load-bearing substitute first wood crutches then metals the implants became metals then plastics the in paints became plastics and none of them worked very long for variety reasons mainly that they really weren't bone they didn't interact with a surrounding tissue in the immune response they didn't respond properly the stress and so forth but with the molecular biology revolution now we know this isn't just some macroscopic load-bearing object what has been identified as cells that are dynamically breaking it down building it up the proteins by which the cells are stimulated to break down bone and build it up and the genes that encode for the proteins that tell the cells what to break down and to build up and so now we have the hope of regenerating not wood metal or plastic but regenerating living bone and you'll hear a little bit of that from Professor Griffith in a minute so the very fact of identifying what the mechanistic components are and being able to do something to manipulate them was crucial now this modern air has been catalyzed by the genomic biology revolution in which just depicted here are a large number of sequencers cranking out the identities of genes in your chromosomes and what kind of proteins they might get a code for and so forth because this has accelerated the rate at which molecular compounds can be identified instead of one by one in a hard slog we can now find tens and hundreds and thousands of them at once so this ability of finding the parts has just been dramatically accelerated the concomitant has been showing even how much more complex these mechanisms are than her previously appreciated people had hoped with the onset of molecular biology that if you could find maybe one gene or one protein you could just fix something in a disease would go away the genomic revolution looking at tens and hundreds of thousands of the components and their interactions at once now have made us realize that's going to be really difficult these are very complex networks and machines so these twenty years of to biology revolutions have led us to a now engineering biology interface that's just night and day different not only is biology amenable to engineering analysis and synthesis we have parts we can manipulate them but again I would assert that biology benefits from and maybe even requires the engineering analysis and synthesis approach now molecular complements are being identified the mechanisms involved in molecular and cell actions are being elucidated quantitative analysis is possible all the way from DNA structure protein DNA interactions up through molecular networks to cell functions of tissue functions you can quantitatively analyze every step along the way not just at the organ level and molecular components can now be easily manipulated it's very simple to go in and change a gene change a protein change any piece you want what's the hard part the hard part is to understand and predict what happens when you're gonna do that right now it's almost trial and error and that's what we've got to get beyond and that's where engineering comes in so we believe that this is the time for a new fusion of biology with engineering because of these two revolutions the molecular biology revolution finally first for the first time permitted engineers to access the science of biology and the genomic revolution now requires biology to be addressed by engineering so we now have the parts we can manipulate them and it's darn complex and engineers really can get involved and have to get involved just as a few illustrations if we think it's something like cells migrating the cells of your immune response seeking out cancer cells or viruses or healing a wound how would you make that happen how would you enhance the rate at which wounds were healed or immune response operated or if this is a tumor cell metastasizing to an improper organ how would you stop that well we have to understand how this cell migration works in terms of what's depicted here schematically it's a machine this is the cell and the membrane and it's connected molecular li to the extracellular matrix and allows the cells to crawl and pull their way through and the cell has motors inside that are generating the forces in just the right places it's an exquisite molecular machine and we need to understand it in terms of molecular structures and properties and biophysics in biomechanics and these machines aren't autonomous they're not spontaneous they're highly regulated the cells will migrate under some conditions and not other other conditions they'll proliferate under some conditions and not other other conditions what's regulating them well there's a fascinating set of biomolecular signal processing circuits that take information from the environment and say what should I do now should I migrate should I not should I proliferate should I not should I die I'm a stem cell should I differentiate into something else how do I decide so they take their information from their surroundings and process those signals and change their gene expression metabolism inside a scale and so forth and carry out different functions they do signal processing so we need to understand this regulation of the machines by these signal processing networks the way perhaps electrical engineers computer scientists and so forth might think about regulatory circuits in a fascinating thing that's really becoming like realistic to think about especially at MIT because we realistically think about things that most places really only will speculate about there's an opportunity of a field called synthetic biology where folks on this campus and others are trying to dizzy design these machines and networks from scratch instead of just intervening in them one molecule here or there they're saying can we design our own DNA sequences that will produce the right proteins that will interact in the right ways to build a network or a machine with the right sort of topology then that would carry out a dynamic function of one sort or another people are building their own machines and networks from designing their own DNA sequences from scratch a fascinating field and it's a it's starting here's a young professor named drew endy who's really the it's very interesting his assistant professor and he's known as the father of the field so that doesn't happen very often now at the same time we start with these mechanistic underpinnings we say to an end for an engineer to access biology you've got to have the parts gotta know what the parts are you got to be able to manipulate the parts but of course you don't do that in a vacuum you want to think about what higher level functions you're aiming at whether it's physiology pathology therapeutic interventions brand-new devices like I suggested on the previous slide brand-new materials professor Belcher will talk about brand new materials from bio molecular mechanisms rounds as the second round we'll talk about new types of therapeutics from these molecular mechanisms so you've got to think about the complexity of biology in one dimension which is many many components at once in another dimension of all the information you know about it sequence structure thermodynamics kinetics mechanics and in the other dimension of the physiological complexity individual cells cells and population cells and tissues and so forth so the underlying mechanisms govern the higher level functions and to an engineer if this is the way we think that you're thinking about higher level system function and how are you going to design that or how you gonna intervene in it from the molecular and cellular components so there is something that we call this discipline of biological engineering that is both the discipline important for science and for technology and it looks a lot in these first few bullets it should look just like any of the other engineering disciplines maybe you studied Chemical Engineering mechanical engineering Electrical Engineering and so forth because you and it will analyze complicated many component hierarchical systems you do that and all those other engineering disciplines you'll synthesize designed technologies not trial and error we don't build any other technologies by trial and error it's time that we really stopped doing medicine by trial and error and I think Martha Gray will talk about that as well and all engineers operate with this paradigm there's different ways to pose it but measure and model and manipulate with design principles and parameters computational models and so forth construct your own copy components to have the right properties it's the only difference between biological engineering and all the other engineering disciplines is what are our components and mechanisms in other cases it might be organic chemistry inorganic chemistry solid-state physics in our case it's biological molecules biological machines and networks and the cells that comprise essentially the organizing principles for these so just like any other engineer except the science is different but the science is still quantitative manipulable components so it's clear to us that this is time to have created a new biology based engineering discipline to sit alongside its sibling disciplines in the School of Engineering in the idea of creating a new engineering discipline isn't new mit does this every few decades okay Electrical Engineering mechanical engineering at one point in time didn't exist at one point in time they were established as now physics based engineering disciplines a hundred years ago Chemical Engineering didn't exist materials of Science and Engineering really didn't exist and they came into being as chemistry based engineering disciplines so now we are in the 21st century creating another one it just happens to be a biology based engineering discipline and the biology is molecular life sciences and it comprises both technology and science facets we are designing and developing biology based technologies as you'll see in the ensuing talks and at the same time I think we're facilitating the advance of the science itself turning engineering back to the science and how can we understand it better so it's a two-way street between the science and the technology as any good engineering discipline really is I won't go into this in much detail but we are very excited about the new biological engineering major that starts this fall professor Griffith who talks who speaks next was really the principal architect of this it's been an immense amount of time constructing this in partnership with many other departments and all I want to show you is the science core beyond the typical freshman year requires organic chemistry biochemistry molecular cell biology genetics just as I said along with the mathematics that one would require and then what's listed here our nine brand new courses we didn't just sort of cobble together oh let's borrow a course from let's borrow a subject from this department and the subject from that department a subject from that department these are nine new courses all designed from scratch saying if we're going to understand and manipulate this kind of biology of genetics and biochemistry and molecular and cell biology what is the way an engineer would do that what's the right thermodynamics to study this science what's the right mechanics to study this science what's the right signal processing or fields or control or computation you can't just borrow the same old and sew them together it's brand-new engineering because it's brand-new science so these are brand new subjects and a lot of faculty effort but the faculty are very enthusiastic about this what's the point of learning this new discipline we're very convinced and we have lots of a confident input likewise from our friends out in industry that there's going to be new types of places that engineers have never been hired before because engineers haven't been capable of knowing this kind of a science so yes medical devices but instead of building the boxes these folks are going to design a manipulate the interactions of these devices with their environment so maybe you still have a prosthetic hip maybe we can't quite generate my mother's hip from cells and genes and proteins quite yet but her hip may fail less if we can figure out how to eat interphase that synthetic material with the immune fly immune response the inflammatory response the surrounding tissue and so forth so that it doesn't fail there medical diagnostics but now will be in terms of these biological mechanisms analysis will be at the gene and molecule and cell levels the appropriate information technology we can imagine selling this tissue based therapeutics engineers will be involved in the pharmaceutical and biotech industries not just to manufacture and to deliver but to actually design and to develop to discover these kind of biological engines will help facilitate the discovery of ret the right targets should be what the right therapeutics should be because of their ability to think in a quantitative systems oriented manner about these very very complex systems and all the way along the way to predict pharmacology effects toxicology effects and so forth and finally but maybe even more importantly in terms of the scope biological engineers will not only contribute to medicine and human health in a very powerful new way they we believe will transform many of the other non health associated fields creating new types of materials and devices in perhaps environmentally benign manner with much more controlled properties things you'll hear from Professor Belcher understanding better toxicology environmental health the pathogens the toxins carcinogens in our environment National Defense new types of biological sensors and actuators that can carry out functions in far more exquisite ways then physics and chemistry might by themselves so let me end sort of pictorially the traditional bio a biology medicine engineering landscape looked something like this imagine problems driven by applications in health care maybe clinical hospital aerospace military maybe the pharmaceutical device Diagnostics industries and I'm speaking only about the engineering disciplines here certainly the science disciplines would be analogous situation you could take any one of these engineering disciplines Chemical Engineering Electrical Engineering mechanical engineering material science based on chemistry physics and math the way it has been for 40 years interface with medicine be a wonderful biomedical engineer in solve problems in the healthcare field that's been the traditional pathway and it's an important pathway you can also contribute to biotechnology perhaps in the processing manufacturing and delivering or so forth so what's new what's new and some of you over here won't be able to see this there will be something new showing up in the bottom left-hand corner which is the sibling discipline of biological engineering that according to the curriculum I just showed you a couple slides ago now takes as a central science base genetics biochemistry molecular biology cell biology and can very powerfully interface with medicine and solve biomedical engineering problems for the healthcare industry it can also be applied to novel types of bio technologies both for the healthcare industry in terms of therapeutics and in other types of device diverse industries as new materials the environment and so forth so we're just placing this new discipline alongside the old ones because it has a new science space you notice in parentheses in the middle I have bioengineering because at MIT what we've decided to do is call bioengineering the whole scope so biomedical engineering medical engineering can think about is the precise application regardless of the engineering discipline itself - medical problems biological engineering is this new biology based discipline and then bioengineering just covers the whole scope so you can major in electrical engineering minor in biomedical engineering you can major in biology minor in biomedical engineering or now you can major in biological engineering per se and have a whole world of applications open to you what I want to say about the landscape this is another landscape that's changed these are the faculty that are affiliated with the biological engineering department at this point in time and if you can see the colors you can see how the landscape has changed the names in blue many of them who might be familiar to you were members of the department when we started in 1998 the names in green have all been hired since then and to give great credit to the President and the provost and the deans of these last few years of investing in this brand new opportunity for MIT which I truly believe we're at the forefront of we're defining and the Institute has been investing in in terms of its most precious asset which is people finally let me say to go back to this landscape that it's crucial to emphasize that we do this in partnership with the Department of Biology we have a wonderful what's a unique but it's really unusual partnership between biological engineering in this School of Engineering and biology and the School of Science in terms of faculty members who have appointments in both courses we've co-developed and co-teach parts of the undergraduate curriculum that are now transparent research programs and so forth so biology is mainly located in this brown box biological engineering is mainly located in this blue box but we have this wonderful handshake partnership and I really think this could have happened only at MIT because of the world-class biology department because of its own role in defining the biology of the molecular biology revolution and the genomic biology revolution that they could appreciate what we wanted to do from the engineering school in having a similar revolution in biological engineering so I thank you for your patience with this overview the real excitements gonna come from the next few people because they're going to show you the fascinating things that were actually doing but I hope this painted you a picture of what is new why we're doing it how we got there and why this is really such an extraordinary point in time thank you very much [Applause] Wow that's pretty incredible what a remarkable turn of events these last few years and what a great setup thank you Doug for really teeing up the rest of the excitement this morning I mean it is a remarkable story about the courage the vision the leadership to look to do this and this is I think what I know I certainly loved about MIT and I hope this sort of thing continues next we're going to hear from professor Linda Griffith is that Doug talked about professor Griffith was instrumental in pulling together a new undergraduate major here bioengineering at MIT she's also going to share with us some of the really fascinating work in tissue engineering I've been giving a lot of talks at MIT in the past year mainly about our new education program and and it's really wonderful to be able to share with you some of the research that drove a lot of faculty at mighty to try to create the kind of student who could push these research frontiers forward I'd like to acknowledge at the beginning before I start the research talk the wonderful support we've gotten from the Alumni Association in helping develop our curriculum we several of the faculty received a class of 1960 teaching award for some of the very early ideas that we had in moving toward this kind of program that would bring biology and engineering together and it allowed us to work with students a lot more effectively and we're very very grateful for that that support for the education program what I'd like to do in describing a little view of the field of tissue engineering today is give you two sort of vignettes one is where the field is going in terms of what we classically think of of tissue engineering in building organs and tissues to treat patients and so that's the bench-to-bedside part of the talk and the second part of the talk I want to give you a glimpse into what may seem like a more mundane but ultimately I think is a far more powerful application of tissue engineering and that's coming back to the bench and using tissue engineering for a range of applications and drug development that will hopefully help us put all the surgeons who do organ transplants out of business someday except for course my postdoc mentor so - so to get us oriented let's think about the what generated enormous excitement in the field starting at almost a couple of decades ago now and I call this tissue engineering version one a common paradigm in the field is that we have some kind of source of cells that might be used to regrow a tissue and in this case we could imagine a patient who's lost the outer part of their ear could have some cells taken from their rib cartilage if only we could grow them into the proper shape to put in the patient so this is just an example of how you might do that make a scaffold that's made of a porous bio a gradable polymer actually common surgical polymer combine it with cells and here this is a demonstration that you can implant this kind of cell polymer scaffold beneath the skin and have the tissue grow from the cells that were implanted onto the polymer this was an experiment done using a mouse model and you can see the shape of the human ear growing on the back of this mouth after a couple of months and so this kind of application generated lots of excitement because it actually works and it works fairly well and so these kinds of things are now moving into the clinic we can ask the question to know if it works for an application like that which is fairly constrained in the number of patients will it work for applications where there are lots of patients and more serious problems so the answer happily is yes this shows a radiograph from the patient of one of my collaborators towards Marshall at the Cleveland Clinic this patient has a very large tumor in his bone you can see the diffuse area here is a cancer of the bone and it needs to be removed so what will happen in a patient like this had happened in this patient typically is this part of the bone gets cut out and what's done right now is because it's a very large defect in the bone a Kadapa piece of cadaver bone will be placed there in order to give the patient support following the surgery well we all can imagine that cadaver bone doesn't heal so well there are potential problems with infection it's not quite the same as having the real bone another application area what you that some of you may be facing arises from injuries to joints you can see perhaps pretty clearly that this soccer player here is experiencing an injury that will later lead to great problems with his joint and in fact people who experience injuries like this and even lesser ones will go on often to develop osteoarthritis that's a wearing away of the surface of the the cartilage that lines the joint in this case in the knee and osteoarthritis is a leading cause for hip implants so my my mother also just had a hip implant and it was due to the wearing away the cartilage in her knee so wouldn't it be better than having a joint replacement that goes on to lead to complications later and never works perfectly as the original joint wouldn't it be better if we could somehow repair this lesion and grow cartilage back and have it secured firmly to the underlying bone just as it is in the normal tissue so one of the great areas of activity at MIT and my lab and many others is trying to combine these concepts of understanding the facets that govern cell behavior the underlying molecular mechanisms that cause cells to migrate into a wound bed and cause say stem cells that are present there to proliferate and turn into bone or turn into cartilage we're trying now to combine these factors that govern the molecular the molecular factors that govern the properties of cells with engineering approaches that would create environments that cells could be transplanted into these sites and go on to form new tissues so in work in our lab we said okay what we really need are two aspects of this we need to be able to build a large scaffold that would be sort of like the house that these cells would live in and at the same time we need to be able to give those cells cues for what they should be doing when we put them in an implant site so a common situation in the clinic is an orthopedic surgeon would have available if he's doing a joint replace or wants to repair a joint or repair a bone he can harvest bone marrow from that patient and the bone marrow has in it stem cells that can go on to form bone so we ask the question can we build a scaffold that will help those cells go on to form bone and so let me just take you through one part of solving this problem in order to build a device that could be used to put the cells on we had to invent a whole new way to process materials that would be appropriate for implanting into people and so when I started out doing this materials processing wasn't my particular area of strength I knew a lot about the cells and how to design polymer to interact with cells but making those into a big device wasn't something that I was that talented at so it turns out is MIT as we all know as a place where you run into people all the time from different disciplines I ran into a mechanical engineer who had invented a process called three-dimensional printing and he had invented it to do rapid prototyping of airplane engine parts essentially so what we decided to do together is say gee when you're making airplane engine parts you need to make complicated shapes you need to build them from some kind of computer model it sounds like that's the same kind of challenge we face in building scaffolds for bone regeneration we might want to start with an MRI image of a patient's jaw for example build a new jaw just exactly to match the other half of the patient's jaw so can we take a process that's computer-controlled and that builds complex three-dimensional objects up from scratch can we take that and adapt it to tissue engineering so starting about ten years ago this is exactly what we did so we could start with an idea saying okay we have a computer model for what we want to build we want to build a scaffold that has lots of pores and channels that will facilitate tissue ingrowth and we want to build it in a particular shape okay and the way that we can do that is to build it up as a series of very thin two-dimensional layers step by steps so the three-dimensional printing process is one of many kinds of manufacturing and prototyping processes that are now endemic in many areas that are called solid freeform fabrication methods they build up complex objects as a series of thin two-dimensional slices so you start in this case by spreading a powder of an object of the material you want to build an object from in our case a biomaterial you spread a powder on to top of the piston and so you just roll out a very thin layer of powder into that powder you print using a computer model of what you want to build you print the binder or glue that holds the powder particles together everywhere you want a solid part of the object to be formed and so then you can build many many devices at once you drop the piston and you finish printing you drop the piston down and that gives you the chance then to roll out another layer of powder so one of the this has now been licensing is being commercialized there's actually some early-stage bone regeneration products and patients now but some of the frontiers are actually solving those extreme challenges such as joint repair so farik's one of the companies that licenses that technology teamed up with a tissue engineering company advanced tissue Sciences to design and test a scaffold for joint repair that takes into account the number of challenges you have in building a complex scaffold that will allow a region to have both bone grow and to have cartilage grows so the idea here is that we can at the top part of the scaffold build a region that will favour the seating of cartilage cells into the scaffold and their growth into cartilage tissue and we can do that by arranging the pores and channels in a way that let the cartilage cells easily get seated in here and then we can create a second region that has different materials and different structure that facilitates the end growth of bone so you can take these in the laminates quite straightforward actually to build these and this shows shows a joint in this case this was done in sheep as a test for how this process would work so the scaffold was seated in culture with cartilage cells implanted into the joint and you could later see that the cartilage formed in vitro and allowed the joint to move so these sorts of applications where we combine cells and scaffolds are really moving into the clinic now in somewhat incremental ways but you're still you're starting to see them appear in applications particularly in orthopedics and in places where we have connective tissue repair that are needed but you can imagine with the power of combining cells and scaffolds what if we could build organs that would replace much more life-threatening functions so if we can do this for tissues like bone and cartilage could we do it for diseases that are truly life-threatening so you could ask a question gee we have an incredible shortage of organs for heart transplants for liver transplants for kidney transplants can we take the same concept and maybe take one donor organ one liver and use it to cure a hundred patients who need an organ transplant could we do that by taking a tissue engineering approach and taking the cells from one donor organ and constructing a whole series of smaller organs that could be transplanted into patients so many people in the field have had a vision that since liver is such an amazingly regenerative organ I think some of you may remember from your high school mythology class the story of Prometheus and he stole fire from the God so he got chained to the rocks and the Eagle would come every day and eat his liver out and then it would grow back overnight and the whole process would repeat the next day so even long ago it was known that liber regenerates so all we need is the Eagle to come and have Prometheus chained to the rock and we can solve the organ transplant problem well maybe not know but that that makes people think with especially transplant surgeons who see organs grow back after you excise a tumor they ask the question could you then say okay maybe we could get regeneration and culture if we had a very complex scaffold that would let cells assemble into liver like structure with an artery and a vein maybe what we could do is take one organ and make a bunch of mini organs that we could then transplant into patients and so this captured the imagination of a lot of people and then it's something that I think is still envisioned as possibly one day coming to fruition but that one day is pretty far in the future I think saying ten years is incredibly optimistic 20 years is optimistic and it's you know keeping the attention of NIH and so forth to fund this kind of research for that long may be the biggest challenge so we can take a step back and say gee where will we be in a couple of decades with this kind of organ replacement an option one and one that certainly gets the attention of popular press is that we're going to be able to have more or transplants so all those people now who died because they don't get a transplant will be able to get liver in a box you know hopefully it won't be made in my lab but my MIT isn't a good manufacturing process approved place I don't think but but the idea is that you would have these organs available for transplants so that's one option and one that I think a lot of people get excited about it would certainly be very dramatic you get brought back from the brink of death by ordering your liver off of livers calm or whatever and there it is made just for you option two doesn't give the press to have so many dramatic life saving stories option two is that we just get rid of transplants all together and maybe only do them under unusual circumstances so that we put all those organ transplant surgeons out of work and now they get to do other things like golf or whatever they would maybe be doing if they had more time so we could ask ourselves you know I actually see a show hands who would prefer option one if you're the patient okay option two that we cure the disease much earlier so people actually never even maybe have to go to the hospital they may go to their doctor get diagnosed and take a drug and be able to cure the disease that would ultimately lead to the organ transplant so we can ask what are the bottlenecks in realizing option two why aren't we there with more diseases and more organs and I'll say that my own epiphany about this vision of white-white why aren't we pursuing option two harder was really brought about by the creation and biological engineering division in fact several faculty who became an integral part of the division were focused on the area of toxicology and when we think about toxicology a lot of us want to maybe yawn I certainly felt that way initially but then there was the aha moment preventing things is much better than fixing them later on when they're much more serious and so we really started to take a hard look at what it was that prevented us from going and preventing diseases we certainly do have a lot of disease models that we use very very productively to understand and help develop treatments for human disease so bob horvitz an MIT won the nobel prize in part for showing that C elegans a nematode worm could be used to understand some facets of cancer to understand how cells undergo programmed cell death and we certainly can use yeast to understand aspects of our own biology mice and all of these animals here can reveal different facets of human disease and help us enormous Lee in developing therapies and cures for these diseases but despite the utility of all these models we know that mice are not little people worms are certainly not little people mice are not little people and even chimpanzees and orangutangs are not people and what we would be really excited to have if you're excited the we being perhaps a drug company is a model of a human that could be used to really understand a complex disease or use to predict how a human will respond to a drug so we can do pretty good right now in looking at the individual molecular interactions that govern the cell behavior as Doug described earlier we're starting to put together the molecular interactions that transmit signals from outside the cell to inside the cell that govern gene regulation for example and we're somewhat good at understanding how different cell types interact with each other to create a more complex response but as we get up to the tissue level and certainly the Oregon level humans start to diverge enormous lis from animals and how they respond in most cases what we would love to do is have readily accessible models therefore of how human cells and tissues interact to come up with a complex response so about seven years ago we started to really refocus efforts in our lab toward this goal we still continue to develop some exciting approaches in treating connective tissue diseases by tissue engineering but we decided that trying to build models of humans so that we could study disease and hopefully cure it would be an enormous contribution to the ultimately to healthcare and certainly liver probably exemplifies the need for this approach more than any other organ so you I don't know an interview who know anyone who has hepatitis C it turns out hepatitis C was discovered around the same time as AIDS but there really aren't great therapies for hepatitis C right now there are therapies and there's some new ones coming out but it's been incredibly hard to study this disease because it only affects humans and chimps and it targets liver cells and it turns out that when you take liver cells out and put them in culture they become refractory to infection by hepatitis C so you can't really study the whole viral life cycle and culture and guess what hepatitis C is the single leading cause of liver transplants in the Western world so if you eliminate it hepatitis C you would have a lot more organs available for other people who need transplants and in fact if you take this approach and say gee what are some of the other causes of transplants well there's toxicity of drugs even tylenol kills about a hundred people a year in the US and right now one of the leading causes for drugs to fail and Phase one clinical trials is liver toxicity very difficult to predict liver toxicity because human livers metabolize drugs in most cases different than animals you use to test those drugs okay so there are all of these problems that we face for which there are no really good accessible models to study the human condition and so why is that we know we can take cells out and put them in culture and get them to behave in some cases like they do in the body and so with liver we can do that we can take liver tissue dissociate it down into the individual cells and put them in culture and get them to look very beautiful so this is just an example if we take in our lab we use rats for these kinds of studies because they're commonly used in toxicology so we can isolate the cells from a rat liver by digesting it with enzymes and put it in something that makes it think that it's a little bit that it's like it's back in the body we use an extracellular matrix and then we can take a picture of these cells a couple of days after they're and culture and they look very beautiful their nuclei are very round they have a cytoskeleton organized and they look quite happy but looks are deceiving when we go in and start to measure the level of functions that those cells have that our liver specific it turns out they really aren't acting like liver anymore so this just illustrates that so those same cells I just showed you if we go in now and take and break them open and get their message RNA out and do a microarray array analysis to look at all the levels of all there of most of their genes using a microarray experiment we see that the cells are losing function quickly so let me orient you so this is a scale that everything above the line means that the gene expression level has gone up everything below the line means that it's gone down relative to liver in the body and this is over a few days and culture so what you can see here is we're looking at the genes involved in drug metabolism so there's about a hundred or so of these probes on this particular microarray chip and what's really obvious is that really soon after cells are placed in culture they lose their liver specific gene expression and this is what bedevils the efforts of the drug industry to do a better job predicting toxicology its loss of these kinds of genes that the devil our efforts to culture hepatitis and culture and to study many facets of liver disease so what can we do we ask the question can we recapitulate function of liver by recapitulating the structure of liver instead of doing a 2d cell culture maybe what we should be doing is trying to create environment and culture through tissue engineering that really replicates this 3d microscopic environment so for example this is the liver capillary bed it's the business end of the liver it's about half a millimeter across and in that little environment hepatocyte s-- the cells that carry out most of the functions of liver are in constant communication with other cells and in fact there are mechanical forces on these cells arising from flow of blood that give rise to signals that tell the cells yes you're in the right place keep doing all the things that liver does and in fact David Darnell won a special Lasker Award for knowing that when you take cells out of this environment they lose their message level and all the things that make them like liver so I'm gonna fast-forward through all the development we did to come up with a design for how we could create this three-dimensional structure and show you what we're doing now in our efforts to build essentially liver on a chip and use it for a number of applications so what we reasoned is that if we could create a little micro environment that would give the cells some cues they could organize themselves into a capillary bed like structure and it turns out using silicon micro fabrication technology was a very rapid route to doing that we have a wonderful Microsystems technology lab at MIT that lets you prototype different designs so we went over there and in a period of about three years with a lot of support from DARPA who is interested in using little livers to detect virus to viruses that may be warfare agents what we did is we we came up with a design based on silicon chip technology that would foster the formation of three-dimensional tissue structure from isolated liver cells so what you see here is a chip that hasn't it bored into it a whole bunch of holes so this chip is about two tenths of a millimeter thick and when we take we bore holes in it and then into those holes we see liver cells and the dimension here is three tenths of a millimeter and so what happens is the liver cells attach to the walls of the holes in the chip now we've modified the walls of the holes in this chip with molecules that the liver cells recognize and they form these tissue like structures the structures are stained in green and that actually indicates the cells are healthy and viable and so what you see is formation of tissue like structures that happens very rapidly and then the tissue appears stable over time the whole thing lives in a bioreactor so we place that chip the scaffold with the cells in here and then we can flow fluid through the whole system so you can see a set of pumps here that are pumping fluid through and we essentially have liver on a chip now this kind of this kind of arrangement allows the cells to capture features of what liver architecture looks like so you can see vessel here endothelial and in fact we can follow this using what's called two-photon microscopy that lets us optically section throughout the tissue so what we're seeing here is sequential sections through the tissue over ten days and what's labeled here are just the blood vessel lining cells the blood vessel lining cells are green against the rest of the cells aren't labeled you can see that over a period of a couple of weeks they're forming vessel structures within this chip so that we truly are creating three-dimensional tissue that could be used for a lot of applications okay so now we've got this tissue and we've gone through a lot of different kinds of assays to show that it has a very high level of function what can we use it for well one for one thing we can use it to try to predict drug toxicity and in what Doug Laughlin Berger didn't show on his campus changes were the things associated with the MIT campus changes Novartis research headquarters Pfizer Research Technology Center all these pharmaceutical companies are looking to MIT for new methods that can help with drug development and in fact one of the huge applications of this is to build little livers that could be used in high-throughput screening of new drugs one other application or there are a number of applications listed here I'm just going to show you briefly some results from one that we're working on in the biotechnology process engineering Center and that is this issue of why gene therapy hasn't quite panned out as much as everyone hoped about ten years ago there was a little over five years ago a very significant event in the whole field of gene therapy and that was the death of a patient just Jessie gal senior at the University of Pennsylvania he was undergoing a trial to correct a genetic defect in liver and he died from the effects of the gene therapy vector which happened to be an adenovirus so one of the huge challenges in predicting how well these kinds of gene therapy vectors work is that what you see in a 2d culture then doesn't get replicated in animals very huge differences between what you see in mice and what you see in cell culture when you're designing these vectors and then huge differences between what you see in a mouse and what you see in a person when you go to use it clinically so we can now use this new tool of a three-dimensional liver to start asking questions on why these kind of gene therapy vectors are toxic and try to build in safeguards against that and address those as we design new vectors so just as an example we can use the classic adenoviral vector in fact this was is a vector we get from the University of Pennsylvania and monitor the whole process in a model way by having cells express a green fluorescent protein so just to give you an idea of how this pans out we can measure many many things about how these gene therapy vectors interact with real 3d tissues in this new system so here we're showing a 3d reconstruction of a single capillary bed in our little unit so again the dimensions here about three tenths of a millimeter and this is stained it's a 3d reconstructed image from optical sectioning so we've stained it so that cells expressing the gene that we've transfected in or green so these cells have taken up the gene are expressing it all of the cells are staying blue and cells that have been killed or stained red so now we can start to build quantitative models of how how we should design gene therapy vectors to be effective and actually also safe and we're working with a lot of other people in that project another application area that is hugely challenging is understanding how to stop cells at the very earliest stages of tumor metastasis so often we can't see a metastasis until it's about a centimeter in diameter the resolution methods are getting better but what we really would love to do is figure out if you remove a primary tumor how do you keep the cells that have moved to distant organs and our single cells invading the tissue from growing in to larger tumors so we can use this little micro reactor system because we control the fluid flow locally we can build a model of how that tumor cell actually grows into a tumor and we can watch the whole thing as it happens so this is just an example of putting prostate tumor cells into the liver and so this is the silicon chip this is the tissue and you can just kind of see it there and if we look a couple of week later we've just put a few tumour cells in they've grown into large tumors that we can see you can actually see them with your naked eye these little white areas or tumors and they've been growing very large because there's fluid flow through controlled at the microscale level and so I'll finish up here just showing this is again imaging to show the tumor taking over the liver starts out as green and you can see the tumor taking over in a period of a couple of weeks the tumor is red in this case and it's being invaded by connective tissue from the underlying cells so all of this is great we do I have a lot of graduate students in the lab who are working very hard with our prototype system but clearly what we need if we're going to move this into high-throughput assays is to adapt this design in these design concepts into a high-throughput format so we're working with the local pharmaceutical company to do exactly that and figure out how we can take this sort of concept and put it in a multi well plate format and this little movie just shows you how we can use micro fluidics now to replace that whole big reactor system now we've crunched it down actually this plate has 24 little reactors this one's got 5 and you can see the fluid being pumped through here using microfluidics and so we're trying to move this now out of the lab and actually have people use it so that we can have physiological models of humans and actually put those transplant surgeons out of business and even though it's not as exciting for the news media what we hope is that we'll be able to develop drugs better and faster and cure diseases that right now we really don't have a great handle on so the parting thoughts are that two big messages there are some great applications of tissue engineering moving into the clinic they mostly have to do with connective tissues there's very hard to move into the go from animals up to people but that the big future of tissue engineering though it's a lot sounds a lot more mundane not quite as scintillating is actually to have a human body on a chip so that we can ultimately predict how humans will respond and cure diseases so with that I'll close and I'll talk to you at the panel discussion [Applause] let's see I've used I've used Wow so I guess I'll go for spectacular this time just a terrific terrific stuff you guys having fun yeah this is neat neat stuff professor Angela Belcher is up up next now Angela the last fall it's one of mi t--'s newest MacArthur Foundation genius grant recipients pretty exciting news delighted to share that with you this morning and she's going to spend some time with us now as she's working to develop materials on a nano scale and how she's using nature as a guy Angela [Applause] well thank you very much I really appreciate the invitation to come here and speak to you today and tell you a little bit about what we're thinking about at the biological engineering interphase and as Professor Lawson Berger said in the in the first talk that this is a relatively new discipline so I came to MIT because I I thought this is the place where it's all going to happen and it's a really exciting place to be but one thing that I think is a little bit different is that I think that biological engineering has been around for quite a long time and I brought an example with me today this is an abalone shell that was a marine gastropod that was grown off the coast of Santa Barbara this is an organism that has an incredible ability to make materials at the nano scale what it does is it it uses materials from its environment it uses the the chemicals it has in the ocean to build this really exquisite structure the structure is very very tough and very strong it's 3,000 times tougher than its geological counterpart I didn't tell you it's made out of calcium carbonate which is basically chalk but the organism figured out how to make it in a way that was incredibly strong the organism also figured out a way to make it and using non-toxic processing and so I think that one of the keys is to look at nature and how nature is constructed materials over millions of years and see what we can learn from that and what can we apply it to what we like to say nature hasn't had the opportunity to work with yet during that the the Cambrian pre-pre cambium geological time period when the the ions in the ocean the chemicals in the ocean started changing the organisms had to learn how to deal with these the changes and the chemicals in the ocean and being clever they actually decided to use it to to make materials so the kinds of materials that Nature has worked with they're really limited to what's found in the ocean and we'll talk about that today these this structure also was built based on on millions of years of evolution we at MIT the the lifespan of a graduate student is about four to five years and so we have to figure out how to develop materials on the time scale not you logical timescale but the time scale of an MIT graduate student so starting with that I want to show my really incredible group that I have a at at MIT this is a really multidisciplinary group we have students from biological engineering biology chemistry Chemical Engineering material science and engineering and electrical engineering and physics we're all working together to see if we can understand how nature makes materials and convince organisms to work with materials that they haven't already worked with before so about a year ago I was asked by the National nanoscience initiative to say well I thought the biggest challenges in material science were today and I took this very seriously and so I put together a list of what what I thought the biggest challenges were maybe we can actually make that fit a little better I said I like a material that it can actually self assemble I like a material bit self-correcting so if you have a computer component and it breaks it can fix itself or self-healing I like to have a material that can grow its own template that can recycle its own template it only goes to a desired length in diameter and then stops I'll show you a little bit about how a Bologna's shells grow but the abalone shell the structure that makes this so exquisite and makes this color I can you can come see it afterwards this color so beautiful this is the same color of pearls is that the thickness of this inorganic material the thickness of this chalk is controlled at the genetic level to be precise and that precise control gives it many wonderful properties so I'd also like to have a material that's environmentally benign and uses environment I'm precocious and solvents be great to have a material that is grown at room temperature and pressure that generates little waste the organisms in the ocean they don't produce a lot of toxic waste because that would be you know bad for the organisms we'd like to span multiple linked scales for the most part I'm a self-assembling self organizing material that is it's organized from the nanoscale to the the macro length scale so we'd like to be able to take those kinds of properties and be able to apply to other kinds of materials interface organic and inter-gang interfaces interface with biology but my dream is to have a material that's genetically controllable and genetically tunable I'd like to have a DNA sequence that codes for the production of any kind of material you want you want a solar cell here's the DNA sequence for it you want a battery here's the DNA sequence for it I'd also like one that's responsible to external cues inexpensive of course and scalable so it's a pretty long list and your response is appropriate response but at the same time biology has already figured out how to master many of these properties and so us as material scientists and biological engineers we think it's our job to figure out how they solve these problems and guide them to work on other problems and so what we'd like to do is order with genetic control the atomic scale to the macroscopic scale to where we can control atoms and unit cells and lattices to basically self assemble devices and I'll show you a couple devices today I'll show you the first virus assembled nano electrode I'll show you the first virus assembled rechargeable battery as two examples so as I said before biologies already figured out how to do a lot of this they can communicate with innocent in a Cell they can correct themselves they have genetic code which codes for the synthesis of everything they need this is a eukaryotic cell and this is a prokaryotic cell we'd like to have the same kind of properties the way that we're gonna do this is we're gonna actually evolved organisms to work with materials we wanted to work with we're gonna force organisms to live with semiconductor materials and force them to live with electronic materials so that they can start to use them and process them but that's pretty challenging when you think about biological organisms which are soft and they're in aqueous conditions they're in water and they're basically squishy organisms how are you gonna think about integrated into a semiconductor fab line or something that that's that's done at a really controlled atmospheric conditions so there's robustness questions how robust is it you can you um you have to to work with the conditions under which organisms normally live and then if you want to evolve these organisms how far can you push them and where do you start when we first started thinking about this problem we thought about antibodies which are natural proteins in the body that bind small molecules these small molecules could be organic molecules or they could be other proteins and they do it with an incredible amount of specificity so these proteins that that in your body can recognize you know addition of a carbon to a molecule or they can recognize chirality of a molecule we said we want that we want a protein that can recognize an electronic component that can recognize a unit cell of an inorganic material here's another I never really knew snowflakes until I moved to to New England but this is an incredible self-assembling system you think of this really exquisite structure and in the middle it has a nucleus that allows for the nucleation of this really complex structure really exquisite structure so what we'd like to do is have a nucleus that that codes for or tells an electronic component how to grow this is a slide that that talks about about scale and so we're interested in in nano scale and I had a reporter asked me yesterday did you always know you wanted to be a nanotechnologist and and you know I I can tell you that I haven't thought a day about it what what I thought was biology makes incredible materials what what linked scale does biology choose to grow materials but for the most part it chooses Nana it chooses the nano scale so it's worked well for biology let's see if we can harness that and so here's it this is a length of a typical component here of a piece of your inside of your computer now here's a drawing a schematic link scale of certain biological molecules and so this is a DNA strand here this is a ribosome it's a a molecular machine that processes all the proteins in your body and here's some other kinds of proteins as well so we said if you want to make things small why don't you start with building blocks of biological molecules that can process these again the fact that there's these already naturally existing molecular machines that evolved to be be very specific this is a diagram of what a ribosome looks like basically a the the biological machine that reads messenger RNA and and builds proteins we said wouldn't it be great if as it's going along and reading its are its messenger RNA instead of building a protein why don't you have it build a semiconductor you know is that possible can you have each tRNA molecule that is specific for a amino acid have a codon that's specific for electronic material and we've recently accomplished that in relatively small way in the lab this year well there's many kinds of naturally occurring biomaterials this is a cockle at the forehead it's a unicellular algae that's made out of calcium carbonate this is an abalone shell like the one that I showed before this is a fracture of an abalone shell and looking at it in scanning electron micrograph you can see these tablets which were basically chalk tablets but they stack on top of each other to form this brick wall like structure no proteins that are coated at the DNA level decide what kind of material to grow what thermodynamic phase of this material to grow how thick it is and how it stacks up to make this really tough structure this is a diatom it's made out of all show you a little bit more about it's basically made out of glass and these are magnetotactic bacteria which have inside of them small single domain magnets which are used for navigation they make these really incredible magnets now all of these are processed in the ocean basically at ocean temperatures using non-toxic materials and and pressures in the ocean so what's the key how does this work well this is an this is a mantle epithelial basically epithelial tissue from the abalone shell and abalone is a gastropod it basically has a big foot and a big piece of tissue that comes across here these cells are the cells that are pushed right up against the abalone shell and their job is to secrete proteins and discrete ions it actually builds the shell so in between this tissue and the shell is basically a little reaction vessel that grows grows the shell and the key is is that these there's proteins in these cells that are pumped out into the space that guide the growth of the inorganic materials here's a diagram of how it works proteins are made out of amino acids amino acids differ from each other based on chemical functionality these particular proteins that are very negatively charged and their job is to grab calcium ions out of solution out of the ocean and and start to use them to build structures and so they do this in a very exquisite way the distance between the negative charges is very important it causes the distances between the the inorganic material the chalk basically it causes to grow up in this particular way this is just showing some more kind of pictures this is the abalone shell here these are individual tablets this is the top this is actually a part of a pearl that that it looks like it hasn't grown out to its full length but this was an organic component this is the protein that actually directs it and helps it grow these kinds of materials and this is a mechanism basically you have these proteins in solution they're binding calcium binding calcium carbonate starting to build these these nanostructured materials start to grow up to be a full shell or a full pearl and this is just kind of a fun picture because this down here is the the older shell and this is the new components that are just growing and haven't grown out to their full length yet these are diatoms made out of silica this is a scanning electron micrograph and this is on the micron scale but the reason I show you this is that diatoms are there's at least 10,000 different species of diatoms and they're the they're classified based on their morphology and you can see how different this morphology is these are made out of glass but there's there all this their different species and so what it says they also have all reaction vessel which is the ocean so it says that this overall macroscopic structure of these organisms is coded at the DNA level so if you look at the kinds of here's this periodic table if you if you look at the kinds of elements that nature has to work with it mostly is calcium the form of calcium carbonate like shells it has calcium phosphate like like bones it has a silicon that I showed you for silica and it has has iron but what about the rest of the periodic table why hasn't nature use the whole periodic table to build materials out of you know the answer to that in our group is it just haven't had the opportunity yet let's give the organisms opportunity to work in this part of the periodic table let's let's give them the opportunity to make semiconductors let's give them the opportunity to make materials for magnetic storage and materials for batteries so let's take the idea of protein-protein interaction or protein and antibody interaction and let's combine it with fabrication to make what we called evolved hybrid materials and the question is is how are you going to think about doing that if you you know we can take proteins from the shell and we can extract them out and we can start making synthetic shell and in the lab but how do you figure out what sequences to use to to grow a semiconductor okay so we don't have any data for that you could probably do modeling but professor Lofton Berger says you know they don't use a lot of trial and error we actually use sorry we use a lot a lot of trial and error to begin with and then we take what we learned from that and then we try to make it better and so we didn't know how to come up with these sequences so we decided to borrow an idea from the drug discovery industry that's called phage display which uses a virus this is a virus that is a non-toxic virus it actually has a bacterial host as a material scientist I look at this as an object that's about one micron long in this direction and about six six nanometers across in this direction and it only has a couple of of genes that cut the code for a couple of proteins so it's actually easy to manipulate we can put we can do additions in the DNA sequence that code for additions in the in the protein on one into the virus why we want to do this well we want to take a billion possibility simultaneously as a library we want to search through this library to see if we can find any chemical groups on on the protein that match the semiconductor of interest okay just like the abalone shell found a way to grow calcium carbonate we want to use a virus because it's quick and easy and takes only a couple of weeks to go through this whole process and use this in our lab so here's the idea the idea is now you have a library of viruses that are all genetically identical to each other they only differ from each other based on a small amino acid protein on a small protein on each end now in about a one microliter sample you can have a billion different viruses and you can force them to interact with a semiconductor wafer most of them won't have any chemical specificity and you wash those off some will have a chemical specificity and you want to keep those no they can't make copies of themselves and so you have to infect them into the bacterial host which now acts as a factory and makes a million copies for you and now you have a population of these proteins that have some affinity for the surface now we think of this as kind of a Darwinian process we want to take that population and force them to interact again and go through this process about five to seven times looking for the survival of the fittest the one that works best with a semiconductor and here's a movie that my students made that was on MSNBC where you have this population of viruses and you're throwing it out a semiconductor and you're looking for the ones that have a chemical functionality that matches the material most of them don't Mayer washed away this is also done to music but I didn't even play the music and then you can manipulate and change the the the surface charge on these and remove them from the surface and then you can infect them into their bacterial host the bacteria now makes a million copies for you and then gives them back again and so this is our amplification so now we've worked with about 40 different kinds of materials in my group and and it takes about two to three weeks to get to the answer get to the sequence that you can control the material so we look at a virus as just a material that has that has DNA that's easy to manipulate that you can actually change the DNA and change the coat of the virus the major major protein coat of the virus to to have it be specific for anything you want it to be specific for here's a list of the kinds of materials we've worked with in my group these are these are semiconductor materials over here that we're looking at for laser technology right now we're really interested in in gallium nitride a laser material that that might be a very efficient material for solar cells we've worked in this part of the periodic table here from magnetic storage I'll show you some materials over here that we're using to make rechargeable batteries and over here that we're using to make nano electrodes so this is just a this is the real data this is an example of how you can select a virus to be specific for something like like a gallium arsenide a semiconductor wafer what we did was through this process of throwing the viruses at the material and asking the deveined and getting rid of the ones that weren't specific we came up with some that bound this material gallium arsenide which is a semiconductor material that that biological organisms would have never had to come in contact with and learn to live with or or to use and then so this is a gallium arsenide wafer when these are 1 micron lines with 4 micron spaces and we basically use these these these viruses it's just a tag - we put a organic molecule dye molecule on it we dipped our wafer in the in a solution of the virus and we pulled it out and what you can see is that it pulled out just the gallium arsenide it didn't recognize the material that it wasn't evolved to recognize well we've been doing that work was was first published we first thought about this and in 2000 we published this what we've got we want to go down that rest of the list that I told you so we can get an organism to work with the material normally doesn't work with but so what you you know we want to grow the material we want to use it for some kind of important technology and this is work by a graduate student of mine Asher who had this very clever idea it was very bold idea which was we'd already shown that we can select viruses to be specific for different kinds of semiconductors but he said let's select viruses to find mistakes in semiconductors let's let's find him to find defects in semiconductors and so what he did was he took a population of viruses and forced them to interact with defects and semiconductors single atomic defects and semiconductors and then he negatively selected them to not recognize non defects and so then what he does is now he has a fluorescent signal where you can you can take a device you can take away fur and you can dip it in your virus and it can count the number of mistakes on that you can optically read it out which is which is pretty interesting but we're now we're looking at applying this to other materials we do a lot of work with the army we're looking at applying this to other materials where you might be able to find defects and in in instrumentation in the field so what we want to do is basically have a solution that you spray on to something like the wing of an airplane where the organism a virus or in this case is a yeast actually sticks to it and gives out an optical signal so if you if you're able to have a biological organism that recognizes a defect it'll light up and so you can just spray it on yes there's a defect in this you need to pull the plane over no there's not a defect in this you're okay to deploy so in addition we're looking at being able to grow things we so we can tag things we can look for defects but what if you want to to self assemble a battery from scratch okay how are you gonna do that this is some real sequence this is this is protein sequence that comes from third round fourth round and fifth round selection in inter and part of your evolutionary process and what you can see these are color coded for the functional groups what I hope you can see is that there's a lot of similarities in the colors of groups but eventually as you take it through additional rounds the sequences fall out they come to what's called a consensus sequence these are the best sequences to use so before we tag the material but we'd like to grow a material shells do it bones bones we do it magnet bacteria do it here's our cartoon of what it would look like if a virus could grow for semiconductor particles on its head this was our idea so our idea was to have the proteins on the tip of a virus have a sequence that allows him to grow a semiconductor and this is a low resolution TEM image of a virus that's that's grown a collection of semiconductor particles called quantum dots on its head and this is magnified about 800,000 times showing you the lattice showing you the atomic levels of that the atomic structure of that semiconductor so this is where we used a virus through genetic engineering and selection we convinced it to grow five semiconductor particles on its head so that I mean that was we thought that was very interesting but I'm not sure how practical that is and so we decided to go back into the genome of the virus and do more engineering so that now instead of growing things on just five copies on one end of the virus let's grow them all across the length of a virus so let's make viruses that are electronic components semiconductors and and in metal materials that can be used for wiring up a device and here's a picture so the idea now is to have the virus act as a scaffold to to grow lots of little semiconductor particles along its length like this picture and I forgot to mention to you that we lucked out when we picked this organism to work with because the the code of the virus the major body of the virus actually self-assembles itself okay and itself assembles itself in a crystalline manner so that all the proteins are all crystal graphically related to each other so we picked we picked a perfect scaffold already made by Nature and what we say is now let's manipulate it to do something we wanted to do let's have it grow semiconductor wires and this is a special kind of transmission electron micrograph this is a one micron scale bar here of the first virus grown semiconductor wires this is an element map that shows you that most of the wires that the the inorganic material is a zinc and the sulfur actually map back to this particular semiconductor so our idea was that if you could get a virus to grow lots of different particles and you could get it do it in high packing could you then get rid of the the biological organism and be left with with nice wires they're all the same length and all the same Y same diameter that could be used in electronics and here's some of our first examples of those these are very high quality semiconductor wires that are all grown based on on the genetic engineering of a virus this is a 200 nanometer link scale here we've been doing a lot of further engineering I'll show you the first virus based nanotube this is a silver base nanotube the this part here is all inorganic material it's all silver this part here this is where the DNA is in the virus and the virus actually has the code to build this this silver wire and we've been using this this technology this is worked by a very talented student of mine Keith am too to see if you can direct viruses to build a lot of electrodes for batteries and so this is going towards the first virus based battery the thing that we think is good about this is that we could try to grow it at room temperature we could try to use non-toxic materials we could make it flexible and we think that by adding the nano scale regularity that that nature already gives you that we could take advantage of that and so this was key taste dream about six months ago and this is the first virus based lithium ion rechargeable battery that was made in our group and this was done with in collaboration with Professor Paula Hammond and chemi and professor yet Ming Chang and in materials so over here you basically have a flask that has the the sequences encoded to grow the anode material the electrode for the battery you grow it up in the lab you pour in the pre the organism grows it you put it on a surface and we're able to actually reach the theoretical capacity for energy density based on this material and it's all made very rapidly it's made at room temperature the thing that's really nice is that the viruses actually self-organized themselves as well and so we're looking at this is a flexible high energy density battery that can be made very inexpensive we're also looking at actually integrated in it a textiles we do a lot of work with Natick soldier Center which actually tries to make textiles and better uniforms for for the soldiers in the field and a good portion of the the weight of a soldier is actually batteries and so we're seeing can we make these flexible batteries into textiles and weave them into into the soldiers uniform directly now you can do other fun things with viruses like you can engineer the head of a virus to binder the tail of a virus and make virus based nano rings that's mostly just for just for fun and we've been working on trying to assemble these into electronic components either nano electrodes that are self assembling we want to have a sequence it tells the electrode tells the electronic component where to sit what to grow and how to grow it back in case it gets damaged and this is a work by um Chang and you wanna pin trying to figure out new ways of engineering to have multiple kinds of functionalities and here are some examples of the first virus based nano electrodes growing in our lab we convinced the virus to buying gold on this side gold on this side so this is six nanometers Indra in this direction I covered up a scale bar but this must be 500 nanometers across and then we pour it in the solution and the viruses grew the gold wires these are very small wires actually which have ohmic contact and have some reasonable electronic properties they're definitely not not perfect yet but the organism has the ability to grow to bind the material on this side bind the material on this side and grow the material in between all coated at the DNA level this is going towards our first virus based transistor where we've we've encoded the organism to bind to to electro on each side and then encoded it to bind a semiconductor in between to connect these two electrodes so this is a semiconductor material grown between two gold electrodes I think I have a few more minutes here so I've reached some of those goals that I told you that that we'd like to be able to do but we have a we have a long way left to go but the other thing in picking this organism we again we were really lucky and the fact that biology chooses things to be actually of defined lengths if you have an enzyme in your body that's too short if an important part is cleaved off then it can be non-functional and you could have a disease well the same thing with viruses they always build their structures at the same length and so we can predict that we know how how they are but I think it's really nice about having materials all this at the same length is that they can assemble themselves and so think about taking a box with crayons and you you throw a couple of crayons in and you shake the box and they're kind of randomly oriented relative to each other but the more you throw in and and keep shaking it they actually start to self-assemble well viruses do this too and they actually make liquid crystals and so in this case what we've done is we've engineered our virus to grow a material of interest and in self-assemble itself into a liquid crystal for things like liquid crystal displays and so here's the movie for that so the idea is through this genetic selection you've selected these organisms to be specific to grow a semiconductor you put in the precursors just like happens in the ocean they grow the materials you keep adding more viruses and they actually start to assemble themselves into a very defined structures they line up so virus semiconductor virus semiconductor virus semiconductor and they form really exquisite patterns and if you look at them in a cross polarized microscopy you can see that they're actually liquid crystalline materials the thing that's really fascinating about these materials though if you take these liquid crystals these high concentrations of viruses and you basically played him out on a surface they actually form films this is a this is a structure that looks like a piece of tape you can pick it up with your foot with forceps and it's 99% virus 1% semiconductor and you can you can pick it up with forceps and you can move it around so we look at this as maybe having materials that are like tape rolls where you could actually roll out your electronic materials or roll out different kinds of materials based on this ability to to self assemble this is just showing you you know it's interesting to think of a virus as a unit cell and these are the unit cells that actually stack on top of each other they have really interesting interesting structures which will kind of skip over but you can actually engineer and put anything you want on I'm a gold enzyme an organic molecule and have them self assemble into these these film kind of structures I just want to introduce one more idea which is looking to nature again and thinking about how spiders spend silk silk silk is a material that's that's obviously naturally evolved what happens is that the organisms that the spiders take a high concentration of protein and that's that's a liquid crystal phase and they push it through a small hole basically called the spinner rat and they spin out silk fibers so our idea was well if you can make liquid crystals out of a lot of viruses and spiders spin silk out of liquid crystals maybe we can spend viruses and we were able to do that these are viruses that are you can grow from meters in length that are basically using the same principles of how how spiders spend silk but we spend viruses know we spend viruses that have optical materials in them and magnetic materials and semiconductor materials in them so they could be used for things like optical fibers we're using them for tags for integrating it into soldiers uniforms and we're using them for bio detectors as well and this shows you that you can actually make mats out of them and we're trying to use them for nonwoven fabrics there's other organisms you could use - we chose viruses yeast or incredible materials we like ease because we work with professor whit Tripp who's a yeast expert because we use the same yeast that you used to make beer and bread and we try to use them to make semiconductors and so we you know from the from the beer industry and that the beverage industry that yeast are scalable and so we look at yeast as factories as a possibility of growing growing materials and so instead of Budweiser we think of nano wiser you know factories okay so I'm out of time but I'll leave you with that and I thank you for your attention start it up here again thank you for for working quickly back back to your seats so you guys still still having fun you ready for to hear some to more of the outstanding faculty here at MIT you can't hear me let's see are we getting any better with the acoustics now we can get more volume they're saying they can't oh there we go hello okay I think we've got it we're gonna get going we have two more presentations and we may be a little bit late for lunch my my sense of the energy in the room is that folks will in fact want to have the panel QA will gauge that a little bit a little bit later but I'd like to do is get get moving with Professor ROM Saskia saccharine extraordinarily talented researchers that has has won numerous awards for his creative ways that he's had some innovation here in the life sciences going to talk a little bit about the emerging field of glycolics [Applause] thank you very much I'd like to begin with saying that it's really a pleasure and privilege to be here sharing with you some of our work here at MIT and I'd like to specifically say that the Alumni Association is one that I've paid attention to because one of the past president of the Alumni Association Brian Hughes actually did in part support some of the areas that I'm gonna briefly touch upon today so I really know how important it is in terms of how alumni Steve back to MIT but having said that the title of my talk today is glycomics the sweet science I know all of you took a break right now and you had some sugar and in this in the simplest form like omics is the study of sugars but not the sugars that you are I think are talking about right now in terms of the one that you put in your coffee now that's the energy level at MIT and so you know the fascinating thing is that life has exploited simple sugars in the most extraordinary way to generate energy that you and I know the reason why we take a break and get some carbs that's not what I'm talking about because I know there's good and bad things about carbs it's so it's not the low carb diet but I'm gonna tell you about how life systems have actually exploited carbohydrates going beyond the energy system in some fundamental ways that it's been both a challenge in many ways in terms of the science Doug talked about the two revolutions the molecular revolution in the genomic revolution the field of carbohydrate studying carbohydrates to understand its place in biology was a struggle but engineering in many ways with the help of technology has sort of demystified that and part of what I'm going to do today is to share with you some of those exciting technological innovations that have really opened up this field so it's not about Atkins diet so I'd like to connect to a point that Doug made earlier which is much of biology then focused on how you could look at herself how a cell regulates variety of cellular processes and it was driven by the central dogma the bible of life how the blueprint DNA makes RNA RNA makes protein and everything was beautiful at life and technology in terms of ability to sequence DNA and proteins and the recombinant DNA technology that you just heard Angie Belcher talk about how you can manipulate DNA to basically create any kinds of systems that will enable you to address in a Cell and historically everything outside the cell and you heard some of my colleagues refer to this word extracellular matrix you very simple terms you can do that as a junkyard at the back yard of the house you throw all the garbage you ignore it sometimes you have somebody come and take care of it the the outside of the cell is no different and a large part what it is made up of is actually these complex glycans complex carbohydrates where the simple sugars are taken further into much higher level of complexity that i'm going to get to and in anyways how the cells perceive its environment regulates signal so that the cells now know they need to divide migrate or die is is controlled by this extra environment and the biology then ignored this and many tools that were developed to study proteins in DNA actually we're developed in a way that you could butcher the sugars because that was the stuff that you wanted to get rid of because you wanna access things here things have changed now we're now into a very exciting area of how we're trying to take a more systems or an integrated view it's no longer the cell in isolation cells are in the context of this micro environment there's the cell the extracellular matrix how the cells come together to form a tissue so that you have a liver cell liberty the liver cell that's coming to the form of liver tissue or the lung cells coming to form as a lung tissue in each of these cells that package themselves in unique in different ways to give you the property associated with the tissue and in that is this very important space the extracellular environment that brings these pieces together and the polysaccharides or the carbohydrates hydrate this environment so liberalised variety of signaling molecules that come from the outside and then send signals to the cells and in many ways the reason why we're able to access these things are through several high put throughput technologies such as the genomics and proteomics it's not looking at one single component it's looking at the component in a concerted way so that you can orally understand how a cell behaves but how the cells behave in the context of the tissue and the micro environment to give you the property of the oregon or the organ system leading to the organisms and in many ways we did need the help of genetics the whole organism genetics once you knocked out a gene or knocked in a gene to really understand how that particular gene transmitted information not only the context of a cell but all the way into the tissue to the organism level so as to appreciate the complexity of biology with regard to glycomics of the study of sugar this became a very important piece because when you knocked out genes that made these carbohydrates at a single cellular level you could not really demystify that we needed whole organism genetics and what was very interesting historically is that when people study it whether it's a fly or a mouse or any other sort of animal model system that when they saw some very strange phenotypes the wings in the wrong place the eyes in the wrong place are the wrong kinds of limbs the length of the limb so on and so forth they eventually found out that several of the genes that we're affecting these processes going beyond the cell into the tissue level actually we're related to enzymes that made these sugars made these complex sugars so in very simple terms the way I'd look at it as you can view average every cell that is in our body has a sugar coat on them it's like the way we wear jackets and winter we wear a fur coat or a thick jacket in summer we got a t-shirt in simple way the way you could look at how a cell functions is that the sugar coat on the cell dramatically influences how the cell behaves and how the cellular processes are regulated hence so I want to be able to go back and put it in the context of the so sorry about that so I want to be able to go back to the molecular picture the the molecular revolution that dad talked about and put sugars in context and then take you through the journey of how it translates the Camorra complex systems as I said earlier the dogma was that DNA made RNA made proteins that truly big tended the principles of life we now know that's no longer this the only part of the story these proteins are seriously and heavily decorated by these sugars Arda like ants that dramatically influence the behavior and the properties of these proteins so in many ways what you can get is a huge amount of functional diversity in terms of this one gene to one protein and with this diversity you're able to take a small set of proteins and get an extraordinary amount of functional possibilities so if we take one particular protein system this is erythropoietin which is actually a very important biotech drug which is used for anemic patients this particular protein has sugars decorated on them so that one particular protein has greater than 150 unique sugar structures that can give you a plethora of biological properties and part of what we're trying to do is to truly demystify that understand how do these distinct sugar structures on this protein influence function and therefore get to the heart of what we call us structure function relationships so in many ways the dogma has been revisited because if you truly get to the G from the genotype to the phenotype we need to really understand what are the principles of these sugars in terms of how they regulate the functions of these proteins therefore we can understand biology in the truest sense so if I were to use one slide to drive home the point but importance of black hands it would be this where the only difference in many ways has been the kinds of sugars that are displayed on these cells that I talked about to just give you an office I mean opposite phenotype in terms of the same locus so this is a very important field as you can see but it has had its challenges in large part it's because of the fact that there have been lack of tools to study these molecules the point that I made several the tools that we're developers actually developed in terms of getting rid of sugars so in many ways sugars were a hassle to deal with they were more this inert material that was outside the cell probably was by and large useless but we now know that there are numerous functions in search of what I call a structure or sequence after the relationship and a large part it is because of the fact that there are these heterogeneous polydisperse but highly information content material that has released immediate and in very simple terms I can say that B come in two flavors there are these linear sugars and the sugars that branch and that structural diversity truly enables us to get this very diverse set of functions that are possible and I'll give you some specific examples to go through that another important point to put it in context with regard to DNA and proteins is that you can amplify DNA you can act amplify proteins you saw my colleague dr. Belcher talk about how you can basically take a virus and get the bacteria to copy many numbers but that's not the case of sugars you cannot amplify them so what you isolate them from these cells or tissues is what you have so you really need innovation that enables you to access this kind of low amounts of material and keep in mind they're not only low amounts but you have all this poly dispersed highly complex set of structures another thing that complicates the analysis is that unlike DNA and proteins where there's a template there's a there's a reading frame that enables you to make these copies there are non template complex biosynthesis a bunch of enzymes come together and decorate the cells are the proteins with these sugars so in many ways it complicates our ability to understand how some of the structure activity relationship truly Drive the biological processes and if I were to sort of step back and put it in the context of a broader framework you can view sugars regulating function in an analogue fashion that is it's not a switch of a turn on and off of a light it's like a rheostat it's like a dimmer where there's a plethora of structures that give you a diversity of functions and when I go through these examples I'll illustrate what that analog function means but the important thing is the fact that with the complexity and the way they are made the lack of the but for biosynthesis you truly need a more complex sort of a systems approach because it's right at the cell tissue interface it's not one structure it's a set of structures or an ensemble of structures that I'll come to in a minute so it is a challenging problem but nonetheless an exciting one from the point of view of how a technologist or an engineer will look at so I just would like to very quickly introduce the the two sort of families at a higher level the branch sugars they're very bad complex structures with the core with several radiating chains virtually all therapeutic proteins about 80 to 90 percent of them have sugars attached to them several proteins in our body the by and large the reason is that you can do this as the most extensive post translation modification that protein undergoes and in many ways they perform the function of recognition how two proteins can interact the way the sugars regulate that the way the proteins fold the way you target proteins how does an e PO know once it's made in the bone marrow to go to the brain or how do proteins know where they need to go what kinds of information are there there's a lot of information that's coded in the glycans that tell them how they get targeted a very important part when you move away from a cell and look at in the context of an organism is the half-life how long is the blood is a drug in the blood how long is the particular protein in the blood the half-life that life of these molecules are very dramatically regulated by the sugars that are attached to them and obviously so on and so forth in terms of stability and specificity so I'd like to very quickly introduce using this schema the other family of sugars which are the linear sugars these are the sugars that virtually code every eukaryotic human cell and here's a schema for cell these ant like structures are the proteins to which the sugar chains radiate our own president has worked on some of these proteins in the nervous system in terms of how the neurons grow these are fundamental protein molecules as I said that regulate how extracellular molecules are signaling molecules bind to cognate receptors on the cell surface so that they get the necessary information in terms of well what happens so in many ways you could view them as they're found of the cell ECM inter they act as a reservoir to store sequester and present several of these signaling molecules of the cell so that the cells know what to do and also when you zoom in do these ant like structures here are the preferred chains that are attached they modulate the signaling molecules in a very specific way in other words you can have these long chains to which proteins attached and that's presented to a surface receptor on the cell to initiate signals or not and what's fascinating is a point that I've come back to is several pathogens viruses bacteria protozoans use these glycans on the cell surface in our bodies as a way to infect and achieve these tropism how a flu virus infects in a very specific way it affects the upper Airways as against hepatitis which affects the liver cells for instance so I'll touch upon that briefly but this is sort of a high-level introduction to how the linear sugars look like and if you actually zoom in the way it's able to perform this diverse functions in terms of regulating how a signaling molecule binds to these sugars to be presented to a cognate receptor is the fact that there's numerous sequences that are possible for an example when you have four bases that make DNA in 20 amino acids that make proteins there are about 48 different building blocks that gets made in a linear fashion to give you this complexity therefore you can get the diversity that you need to bind to a whole host of proteins to mediate the signaling processes so what I'm going to do is to through an example give you the idea of when you look at these structures I said there are these ensembles of structures that are present how do you look at this problem and how do you demystify the sugar structure sequence to the function and I'd like to use one specific example that's relevant that's that's going to be relevant but then I'll go through a variety of applications so with regard to the technologies to understand how sugars look if you will on the surface of a protein or a cell first you need to understand what does ensembl means and how do you go about doing that and there's one particularly very relevant practical problem that basically frames this question which is several biotech drugs I mean after the sort of the small molecule pharmaceutical drugs as the sat statins which are about lemon angstroms in size several of the protein based drugs like area through appointment insulin human growth hormone and so on which have been a product of the biotech revolutions are pretty complex proteins but what's fascinating is that when you look at the top ten proteins that are used taraf Utica Li in the clinic nine of the ten are glycosylated proteins so the sugars on these molecules dramatically influence the biological properties of these and it's expected that these protein based therapeutics are going to be the mainstay of the sort of in sort of the pharmaceutical biotech kinds of drugs that are going to come out so to name a few such as Epogen and factor eight and so on and part of the challenge that we took on was to try to understand how do we take this to the next level we looked at the proteins now these glycoproteins on sugars and how do they affect the biological functions of these molecules and I just want to put it in the context of the story that I made said earlier is that troopers have been around and historically people have viewed it as something that should say Salta deal with get rid of it in fact one of the reasons that I stayed on here at MIT actually graduated from the Harvard MIT division of Health Sciences and technology program with the energy level that was there at MIT Iowa spend I was basically told not to work in this area they said this is carbohydrates this is the last thing you want to touch it's the most difficult things to do but a point that I'll come back to I drew upon the energy that was in this environment actually played tennis with the chemical engineer and it's sort of the fusion of the biology and engineering in terms of the way we're thinking about the problem that enabled us to tackle up out of sequence sugars in a way that people were able to sequence DNA in proteins so that we could really open the Pandora's box if you will and try and understand what sugars do so with proteins of the mindset that people had when I started working in this area is forget it just get rid of it it's not important because it's useless but now we know that they're not impurities they affect several important properties particularly the way these drugs behave so the question to me then was this is very fascinating look at the system how do you look at this ensemble of structures because it is the poly dispersed heterogeneous ensemble of structures that we need to visualize we can visualize DNA we can visualize proteins but how do you look at the sugar code on a protein or in a cell to really understand what's going on and I'd like to use this sort of analogy to illustrate the idea in many ways looking at sugars on a protein or on a cell it's like looking at image processing it's looking at how do you look at an image and to me these the analogy that I've used is sort of the six blind men and the elephant everybody was trying to figure out what this was each person got it wrong but the idea was you really need to understand what that whole picture looked like and here is the elephant so what we did was we brought me several different orthogonal analytical techniques each technique had its strengths but there are limitations or weaknesses that in terms of studying sugar because you're looking as I said as an ensemble or a set of structures then we make measurements associated with these then if you do not link these measurements in a meaningful way and I love this to just slapping on raw data during image processing if the data doesn't talk to each other you get a blurry picture the more you're able to integrate the various measurements you're able to then get this entire picture this is sort of a concept behind it what would we really do is we took a variety of different analytical techniques mass spectrometry NMR and different kinds of other analytical techniques exploited the strengths of these techniques understood the limitations and weaknesses of those in such a fashion that we then developed a number based approach to code information associated at the various building blocks why is this important the point that I made earlier I really needed an electrical engineer a chemical engineer a biologist a carbohydrate chemist as a team to really take on this problem in a very interdisciplinary fashion and what we were then able to do is you know solve this as a puzzle where we were able to look at not just one structure but a set of structures that existed either on a protein or in a cell and we were able to build build beyond that and once we got the the sugar structures we have actually linked to to a sort of the genome and the proteome database so what we're now able to do at the example that I used earlier about Ipoh here's the Ipoh molecule with the for sugar sites in it and I said earlier that the effect folding the effect the way you look at the half-life of it what's also interesting is if you let these cells group which re commenting Ipoh the human cells that make even process condition dramatically affect the kinds of sugars that the Ipoh molecules display on their surface so part of our approach is to take a very integrated way of understanding what are the different sugars are attached to what sites of these proteins how much are they present is that is their abundance and their location so you can begin to see one Apryl molecule now has been translated into these 150 different unique structures with the sugars that are attached and what they do so the next question obviously is going to be once you have this information what are you going to do how do you understand the biology now we'll come back to that in a minute so this is giving you a flavor with regard to how we did this the branch sugars then we also took on the problem of trying to demystify existing sugar drugs in the market one that you might know heparin and low molecular weight heparin it's the drug of choice as an anticoagulant especially for things like deep vein thrombosis which is DVT but you want to make sure that you don't clot but what's also interesting is this is the drug that's used as sort of the mainstay for anybody who goes into the hospital with a chest pain anything to do with acute coronary syndrome in terms of ACS but what's fascinating is that this drug though it's been around for the last eighty five years it's the gimmick essentially it's a complex mixture that's been so poorly characterized it's sort of Li it's like it's the analogy it's like what was the case with insulin in the early 30s when insulin was isolated from the from the pancreatic you know organ from a pig it was always used as as a mixture then people saw this beneficial effect and it was a sort of a serendipitous discovery the story with heparin and low molecular ate heparins is no different and what's fascinating is I flew we approached this problem in using the technologies we said it was still viewed as this complex mixture it had these very interesting set of biological activities but the fact remained that this is you know a big product in the pharmaceutical industry with the poor understanding the FDA really did not know how to look at the system and how to really understand the complex set of structures correlating to its function and again to put it into context here's a small molecule drug like your statins or your cox-2 inhibitors and so on just to put it in context here is your heparin Sonoma like the way it happens there thousands of chains with many many structures and sequences that really pose this challenge in terms of how you understand that so part of what we did was sort of the proof of the pudding was in the inking in the sense of could we take the technology that we develop do the so-called image processing and try to be able to give you a picture of what this complex mixture looked like therefore you can begin to understand how these structures correlate to functions so what I'm now going to do is change gears and walk you through some applications we took these set of different technologies we develop I'm going to walk you through a hand full of very specific examples of what we did and to put it in context with regard to why sugars are important going beyond the energy molecule that is that I talked about so one interesting thing we found was once we could start sequencing these sugars we could understand what was going on with regard to the sugar structures is that tumor cells on their surface contains sugar sequences that either kept the shirt the tumors dormant so that they were not rapidly dividing the point that I'd made earlier that how they respond to the environment with regard to signaling or they could display sugar structures that actually enhance that ability to respond to growth signals and they'd rapidly start dividing and it was in balance so the red sugar sequences kept these cells quiet and would not permit signals to go into the cells but the blue sequences could activate signals and enable these tumor cells to rapidly divide and this balance was critical and then what happens is that during the process of tumor progression you get more of the green stuff growing going on these cells so that they can more rapidly respond to these signaling molecules and take off in terms of their growth so part of what we then began doing is once we began to understand the biology behind it we began generating various of these sugar fragments to try to really understand could we then take these red guys give them we understand them in terms of mechanisms not really the cellular level but in terms of animal models and we have generated various different kinds of sugar compounds and a lot of the studies one of them which is actually plant arrived that I talked about Brian's use being very excited to support and the other ones are in the general heparin families and they're going under phase one kind of testing right now the fact that sugars change on these cells and begs the question could this be a marker for distinct states that a particular cell type isn't so here's a set of healthy cells but then as you progress towards the disease in this case it's cancer we now know a simple example I can give you is PSA for prostate cancer we all know that it's a very controversial thing just looking at the protein levels of PSA doesn't really tell you what stage you're you are in in this cancer progression what we found at B in others did was the fact that the sugars on PSA actually subtly change and give you a better handle or a signature to the distinct state that you are in during the progression of prostate cancer so what we're now doing is we're dealing with several human samples to really try to translate what we found in the lab there's something clinically meaningful in the sort of a whole diagnostic platform that's being developed to really sort of harness or leverage and understand good sugars be a better market because there are enough you know evidence is to support that the sugar structures change much more subtly than sort of this analogue regulation of function that I talked about earlier one of the fascinating things is the point that I made earlier about how pathogens infect so if you look at epithelial cells these are the cell lines that line our upper Airways our gut the blood-brain barrier these are the cells that are exposed to the outside and the way the body sees the outside and here's a typical epithelial cell it's polarized it has a head in the tail very simply it's an apical site at a base or lateral side and here's the blood vessel normally molecules are transported across in an active way there's a receptor that binds and that things are you know transported through what's called as a trans cellular transport what's fascinating is that several normal biological processes exploit what's called as a para cellular transport between cells there are these junctions that hold these cells together and then solutes and proteins and others from this side go in to the other side and there's a way that there's a gatekeeping mechanism going on what we found is the fact that the the apical glycans in very specific way regulate whether these junctions open or shut and therefore what goes in or what does it in many ways the the analogy is like the Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves you need the right card to swipe and if you do that you have access in and what's even fascinating is the fact that these black hands can be used as ways to open and to close these junctions but pathogens several of these not only bind to these glycans but use it as a way to mimic the system and and open these junctions as a way to get into the system if you will so we're beginning to see several bacterial and virus species actually use the sugars on these cell surface as a way to get entry into distinct cellular compartments and you can begin to see that then you have these glycans which are different for the upper Airways and the blood-brain barrier and the low gut the kinds of sugars that are there in these cells uniquely regulate what gets accessed in there not and and and how the access is regulated this is a pretty exciting area so the point that I made earlier that when you have these sugars that regulate proteins on the outside they store them they release them the kinetics become important what we began to do is to address the issue of combination therapy we said you know when you look at a cell here's a tumor cell there's the blood vessels at around them the endothelial cells grows in one way the tumor cells grow in one this the sugars are different the way they regulate these compartment is different so if you really want to Stan what's going on as tumors growth with regard to the blood vessels then you need to understand how these two compartments relate to each other and if you take off-the-shelf drugs off to the shelf chemotherapy drugs off the shelf sort of engine anti-angiogenesis drug and so just combining them the standard way of mixing a and B together part of our thinking was if there is a very important component of how these sugar molecules regulate the entire micro environment in very distinct ways then drugs need to be delivered or drugs act in similar ways to cut a long story short what we then decided to do was took off-the-shelf drugs and decided to develop two compartments we call this delivery device a nano cell there's an inner core an outer core the inner core has the chemo therapeutic drug the outer core has the anti-angiogenesis drug in many ways sort of like a smart bomb approach where you want to put the chemo therapeutic agent inside so that it doesn't escape and the anti-angiogenesis and the most important thing is the fact that you need to regulate the kinetics of the release of these two compartments in distinct ways which reflect back again the way these cells grow in terms of how the tumor cells grow and the endothelial cells grow so putting a long story short and I don't want to sort of give you too much of sort of data dump here but what we found is when we come when he looked at the ability for these tumors to grow in animals and the number of days here and explore compared with not only the controls but the various just physically mixed combination therapy you know it's like taking just a chemotherapy and anti-angiogenesis as two different regiments but then doing it in this controlled release fashion so that you're affecting the kinetics really what we found with some great dramatic effects in terms of the survival outcomes this is the the normal so the controls drop dead in 20 days the the combination the standard current combination therapies of taking combined effects you know give you a little bit extra survival but a strategy where you're beginning to look at the spatial temporal release kinetics in the way cells come together to form tissues and organs and how these black hands conceptually play a role you can then begin to really not only tease apart the system in a you know in an integrated way but you could leverage it in terms of these kinds of drug delivery strategies and we're basically taking this is trying to figure out how we can use combination therapy in the area of treating stroke in the interest of time I'm not going to go through that but what I wanted to show you is the fact that we are really leveraging this to the extent that we possibly can in terms of novel approaches to you know treatment of diseases the last point that I want to quickly touch upon is how this field has integrated itself to the genomics and proteomics area as I said since glycans are very important we now have a large high throughput data in the area of glycomics MIT is one of the Centers for an international effort for consortium it's called Consortium for functional glycomics where we basically house the largest data sets that's there this field we have all the different like hand structures we go all the way from the molecule to the mouse of a molecule to the human and correlate the link between the genome proteome into glycome and generate different kinds of data whether it's data from the cells to the target organ systems and then our goal was to really be able to use relational databases and use a simple porca like a molecule page that truly integrates these diverse kinds of information so I think this field this is emerging to be an important one where it has had its challenges from the molecular evolution the genomic revolution has been possible because of the technology and the way that we have looked at this the more systems fashion but it has begun to address some of the several complex and challenging issues that we've had to summary it's an emerging field fundamental tools and by a large roles in biological processes be limited by several tools that were really needed to kinds of branched inch and the linear complex and information dense and we've developed several different tools to address at the end of the day how structure correlated activity and function with many different expecting applications and last but not the least funding from NIH and this is my group several different members of my group we're obviously responsible for this but I need to touch upon some of the collaborators that we have had and the question of soul wad could we really take this and go beyond what we were able to do was really leverage there's different technologies that were developed at MIT and take on looking at these glycoproteins and low molecular weight heparin and a company has been spun off that has really taken this problem and in terms of kind of really translated into the real world thank you very much I think I think you guys can see why we had so much fun putting this this panel together I'm running out of adjectives holy cats something like that this is not science fiction this is just hardcore science and engineering taking place right here I'd like to introduce to you Martha Gray Martha is the director of the HST program the health science and technology program at Joint Alliance has existed for the last 35 years between Harvard and MIT in that role as director she is part of and helped guiding some the marvelous research that's taking place there to take much of what we've we've seen here today and to help translate that into medical practice so Martha he's just fiddling with my mic is it can you hear me sound all right so this is most likely what George's coronary artery looked like when he was admitted to the hospital and when you consider that where that dotted line is is where the edge of the artery normally should be I think you can appreciate that this extra tissue inside there most likely caused a reduction in the amount of blood that could flow through that artery I can figure out how to turn this on and and that was the ultimate cause of his symptoms now what I remember most about George is not what his disease coronary artery look like and it's not even that both his father and his elder brother died of sudden cardiac death what I remember is this big almost jolly guy with a very deep booming voice who was willing excited even to be a guinea pig for me while I was learning to do a history and physical now I remember that history and physical so well it took me more than two hours I'd like to think it's not because I was new and slow but because he was so busy asking me questions but I met him when I was doing my clinical experience at Mount Auburn Hospital while I was a graduate student at MIT I went to see George the day he left the hospital and he handed me a card with his address on it and said you need to let me know what happens over the years he was very taken with the idea of putting engineers in a clinical setting having them have hands-on experience in medicine and he thought that you techies you guys at MIT will figure out what to do for guys with hearts like his now I'm embarrassed to say I have no idea where that card is now and it's also the case that I haven't done anything directly to help guys with hearts like his but many of our faculty and students have and I wanted to share some of those stories with you as well as some other stories and I'll dedicate these to George and finding where he was he could come this would be the card so the therapeutic concept in his case is really conceptually straightforward you removed the blockage and the blood flows now in practice it doesn't work like that and I got to figure out how to use this pointer somebody help me well I'm sure there's a button here somewhere ah here it is my day of sitting here I found it the nerves get you everywhere okay so you probably have the idea by now there's a catheter to thread up through the goring to the heart and in the region of the lesion or of the blockage which you can see there in yellow a balloon is expanded and in this particular instance there's a metal casing a wire mesh around that balloon it's called a stent and that holds the vessel open in georgia's era actually was before the days of these stents and it was in the early days of what's called balloon angioplasty we're just the balloon was put in place though sometimes there was the problem of it reeked elapsing on itself now the good news is that this rhoda rooder approach works pretty well initially because of that collapse the balloon would fail you know under 10% of the time with stents it's really relatively rare the bad news is in about 1 to 6 months these things both fail you and what by failure here mean needs another angioplasty or needs coronary artery bypass graft so some of the work I'm going to describe his work of Professor Eleazar Edelman who is an alum and he focused on why is it that those vessels become blocked again after they're opened and can the procedure and the devices be improved now if you look at a vessel after this six-month period this is one such example this is the edge of the artery these little black marks in this example or where the stent was and you can see there's this massive regrowth into the lumen and that again blocks blocks blood vessels the thinking at the time was this response was really due to the fact you've taken this diseased artery blown it open all kinds of biological things happen and that's it he said well that's probably all true but what about the stent itself and could that play a role in why these things fail so these are the first generation stents and so-called slotted tube or that's his name for them and if you put those in an artery and look at the lining of the vessel 60% of the cells that line that vessel were scraped off if you will nuded from the vessel wall so that can't be good and the possible reasons for them that are things like this stent is it expanded the way it was constructed it would shorten and you can see it buckles a bit here and also there's balloon contact with the vessel vessel wall and any of those and perhaps more things could cause the the induced the biological response that that led to restenosis fast-forward some years with some new designs that were developed based on some data I won't show you the corrugated ring design differs and that there is no shortening no buckling or at least not measurable buckling and much much less balloon contact though it has exactly the same amount of wire now the biological measures are sort of the what you need to look at and if you compare if he compared the slotted tent a tube to the corrugated ring on every measure and these are four of them there was a market improvement with the corrugated ring like the denudation the clotting and so forth these were the first data to show that the stent design itself nevermind the disease and everything else a stent design itself played an important role in the response to this therapy it also changed the intellectual property or commercial landscape because knowing that the stent design mattered gave companies a different axis with which to compete now you've probably heard recently and hopefully not experienced directly drug eluting stents and there the concept is well one another way in which you could prevent this regrowth is to put a drug on the stent use a drug that prevents the proliferation of those that grow in and looking at some clinical data people have tried this now for a number of drugs and without naming the drugs if you look at clinical data and compare the restenosis rate relative to a Bair stent you can see that some drugs work and some don't the thought is well this is the difference in biological activity it's the difference in what happens in in clearance in the bloodstream and so forth these three drugs are equally effective in vitro in that in the test tube if you will improve preventing proliferation again now is our challenge the paradigm said well that might be true but we should look at really where does that drug go what's it interacting with and maybe we can get some insight into how to best both build these things and tell a priori whether these devices will work and so this is one example of one drug that's fluorescently labeled and you can see at this time point that that the drug is very close to where the stent is and I'm not showing you can also look in the depths of the tissue and it turns out if you look at all this data and again I'm collapsing many years that there's a good correspondence between the properties of the drug and it's interaction with extracellular matrix that stuff that ron was talking about and the transport of that drug into the depth of the tissue that corresponds very well with a clinical outcome so over the past 20 years 30 years since George there's been a dramatic improvement in in therapies that really came about from challenging the paradigm and understanding the tissue device and drug interaction that's restoring blood flow another in the sort of realm of treating cardiac problems another basic therapeutic concept is maintaining electrical signaling or restoring electrical signaling and one sort of exemplar of this issue is the problem of sudden cardiac death out of every seven if you one will die of sudden cardiac death that's more than will die of cancer and the cause of that death is arrhythmia in the ventricles you might have underlying cardiac disease but what kills you is the the meeow that prevents the heart from beating properly there is a treatment that's extraordinarily effective an implantable defibrillator the problem is who do you give the defibrillator to if you gave it to everybody who had cardiac risk only four percent or so would actually need it and that's a very invasive therapy for that kind of population and I should say that the is as the slide says the sometimes the first indication of cardiac disease is sudden death and obviously it's too late by then so I'm sharing a little bit of the work of Professor Richard Cohen who's been thinking about this issue in various dimensions for several decades he's also an alum of MIT and he's looked at stochastic behavior of heart muscle and experimental models and has really focused on strategies for predicting the risk of arrhythmia now what you can actually measure at the surface of the body as an electrocardiogram and what that's detecting is a whole collection of a whole bunch of small currents within the heart muscle itself and if you were to be able to visualize current in a working muscle if there's a very coordinated pattern that allows this heart to beat effectively and the question is can you extract from this information something that tells you there's a little blip over here and the answer is you can I wouldn't show the example if it weren't that true and at a microvolt level at a level that you can't even see here it turns out that there's something called T wave alternans that can show up a micro volt change if your heart rate is reasonably high and this has been tested in a number of clinical trials and this is one and in this group of patient those that had a negative T wave alternans test in the 18 months had no significant cardiac event whereas a quarter of those with a positive test had a significant cardiac event and this is the only statistically significant risk predictor of of of a risk of sudden cardiac death and this is this technology has been commercialized to by MIT to a company called Cambridge heart it's been recently approved for Medicare funding and I would point out that this is sort of one early example of the idea of being able to predict who you should treat when the population is very large it's the personalized medicine problem how do you know how to give a very effective treatment which people should receive it the third fundamental therapeutic concept if you if blood flow isn't the problem or electrical isn't the problem or you can't do anything about it restoring muscle function and that's the third example I want to give and it's work of Gordana banyak Novakovich and lisa freed and they're in the tissue engineering area and a focused on principle design of tissue engineering along the lines that linda was talking about earlier and here's the met the conceptual concept there's an area of the heart that's damaged and not functioning properly could you actually put a patch on there that's works and restore function that way and the idea was to take a polymer seed it within the experiment I'm going to show you rat heart cells they penetrate the polymer you let it/them seed and take hold for a few days and then put in a dish and stimulated with a pacemaker actually a real pacemaker and so that during the time is developing its contracting in a way that's sort of analogous to a heart and after eight days in culture you actually get a tissue that's beating these are silicon spacers here is the electrode can't see the other electrode very well you can get individual muscle cells they'll contract spontaneously this is the first time anybody's been able to put create a tissue to compete in an organized way and so this there's millions of cells cutting across there and if you look at the ultra structure the engineered tissue both an electron microscope level and a light microscope level look very similar to native tissue so these have really been transforming advances in technology improved therapy for blood flow that came about from understanding cell tissue interaction trying to predict a risk for electro cardiac events and at least as a potential restoring muscle function and this was on the MIT website this February so if I saw George now and I had his address I'd send him a Valentine's Day card with this on it and try to describe what I've just described to you now what I have worked on if not the heart but on problems related to our thright Asst and I've the work I'll describe for you as work I've done with another alum professor Burstein arthritis is according the Arthritis Foundation the leading cause of disability in the United States one in three of you probably have it so very very common and the treatment is really one of two things one is pain relief either by over-the-counter or by prescription kinds of drugs and then finally the last resort treatment is replacing the joint now it's easy to sort of say off what a crude treatment but this was invented only in the late 60s and this has kept many many people out of wheelchairs now they last about 20 years so this has been an extraordinarily high-impact innovation but again as linda noted the ideal would be to try to prevent this from happening so you didn't even get to that stage and there are several new therapies on the horizon some are nutraceuticals virtually every drug company I'm aware of is has a program and trying to develop arthritis riddick therapies there's new surgical strategies coming down the pike and that have been suggested and used and the challenges so you've got this thing that works in an animal or works in a test tube or petri dish how do you really know if they work particularly in humans in the current way you can look at either development of disease or progression or if efficacy of a treatment is x-ray so this is an x-ray of one of my students patients knee joints and this is the thigh bone the femur the tibia the calf bone and you can see the space between the joints and if you're used to looking at x-rays you'd say this space is - is narrower than usual now you can't actually see cartilage by x-ray so the fact that this is narrow means that the cartilage that would normally be between the joints must be missing and in fact this is the knee of this patient and this yellow stuff should be covering the whole joint you can see it's been completely stripped of its of its cartilage and I think you can appreciate how insensitive this kind of approaches magnetic resonance imaging has been a dramatic improvement in first in the first instance because you can actually now see the cartilage tissue you're not just looking at space between bone and what's been emerging is actually molecular imaging of cartilage looking at as I'll describe briefly in a second protocol a sugar x' that are it really am functionally very important inside the cartilage and it gives you information that you can't visualize on an anatomic measure and so if you can actually see very early stage changes then you have the potential to ask questions like does the treatment work who gets away how fast does it happen and so forth and I wanted to give an example one example autologous chondrocyte transplantation popularized in this country by Genzyme and the idea is that if you have a local defect in your cartilage you go in surgically clean it out remove it fill it with cartilage cells and then cover it with a piece of tissue now how do you know if this idea works what did genzyme have to do for the FDA well they had to ask subjects to agree to a second what's called a second look biopsy second look arthroscopy which means they make an incision in your knee joint put a light tube in and actually put a device in and remove a small piece of your your cartilage then they stain it histological you've taken out of the body you slice it very thin six microns then you stain it in this purple color the more darker the purple the better the cartilage this is much bigger than a biopsy it would be much smaller here's bone here's cartilage the biopsy wouldn't go down to the bone normally it would just be a small piece here this has at least two problems one is if you're doing well as a patient the last thing you want to somebody to go in and take a piece of cartilage out that you've just tried to fix and the second thing is is the sampling problem where it's let's say this were it where exactly do you sample and how do you interpret that single sample from something that's a very heterogeneous piece so it has all kinds of problems but that's the best that it had been available and what we can do now for the very first time is take not using the same example using imaging you can actually get a surrogate for this this histology where the blue darker blue is like dark blue here and light purple turns red on this in this diagram you can see there's good correspondence between this yet this did not require that you take it and slice it into six micron thick sections this is a you know this block is a few centimeters by a few centimeters and this is a thin imaging and Mar slice so you can do this in vitro it turns out you can also do this in vivo and this is one of the first images showing that you can make these measurements in vivo this is from somebody who had the autologous chondrocyte transplantation in this region of the tissue and two months after she had had that operation you can see that there's tissue there but it's colored red and here's the scale red means there's not much of that important molecule yellow and blue means there's more and so this region is filled but presumably not functional yet and the x-ray and the M are other M ours for this you could not distinguish those patterns for a different patient one and a half years after the operation this was the region of her transplant and you can't distinguish the transplant region from the rest of the tissue now this isn't to say that autologous chondrocyte transplantation works the study wasn't designed to in a randomized way to follow people over time that's ongoing but what it does say is that this measurement is actually sensitive to the kinds of changes you'd want to be able to detect and a number of drug companies have now begun to adopt this for their arthritis clinical trials and a number of groups have begun to adopt it to begin to ask some of the more fundamental physiology and biology questions like who gets arthritis how does it develop and I wanted to share one of those with you from Leif dahlberg's group in Sweden who adopted this technique about six years ago and he looked at subjects who had complaints of knee pain but had normal x-rays normal in every other regard so each of these bars is a think of them as a person and they're just ranked according to the molecular index to that color that I was showing you and you can see there's a broad distribution it's now six years later and he's gone back to them and they've had repeat x-rays and seven of them actually have evidence on the x-ray of osteoarthritis of and one of them has already had a total joint replacement and they tend to be bunched towards the low end so this is early indication that this may be have some predictive value about what what might happen in arthritis so one of the things that was you know eye opening if you will about the imaging things I just showed you it just allows you to see things you couldn't see before which allows you to ask questions you couldn't ask before and I wanted to highlight one last set of stories the Avenue lay Martino Center for biomedical imaging that was established in about five years ago in 1999 and their work in brain imaging and Bruce Rosen is the director of the Center Greg Sorensen the associate director and George Bush is one of the faculty there now about 20 years ago if you were to look at 25 years ago brain images again this is this was transformative in its time you could see the outline of the brain this is a cross-section taken if you will that way you can sort of get a sense of structures but I'm sure you can immediately discern how much more detail in the kinds of images that we can get today and just from that kind of images and the kinds of Technology computational technologies around a sequence of images taken through the brain you can get a three-dimensional representation and what our pioneering advances you can take this very convoluted structure blow it up sort of like a raisin turning into a grape and begin to see what anatomic structures might be next to one another and again so you can begin to ask physiological questions or where do the different pathways in the brain go and I'm not going to talk about any use of these for any medical application or neuroscience application but I think you can appreciate the the kinds of questions you could ask that you simply couldn't ask before that was focusing on measuring structures in anatomy what you'd really love to be able to do in addition is to be able to tell where the brain is activated and this is one of the pioneering images of called functional magnetic resonance imaging that Bruce Rosen was one of the first inventors of and this little dot here shows that there's a difference after a particular task in blood oxygenation and blood oxygenation is used as a surrogate for electrical function so presumably and you think you use an energy source and it reduces the amount of oxygen in the blood that's the concept so I want to show you how an F functional magnetic resonance fMRI study is done running an experiment with you on the next series of slides you're going to see a word it's going to be written in a font and that font is colored and what I want you to do is yell out as fast as you can and your time to lunch depends on this as fast as you can what color the font is you got it okay so with practice you get better and I didn't get you give you a chance to practice that's called a strop test and it's one of the tests that's done in looking at people with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder I know my friends tell me that should be prevalent here I didn't want to use that joke you obviously thought of it yourself so as you can quite obviously from this picture if you say the rich regions of the brain light up it's very very different in in kids with ADHD and so again we're opening up a whole new Vista who knows what that means biologically or diagnostically is early data but it's you can see how it's just opening up the door to all kinds of different questions now I said that measured brain activity you can do em through measuring blood oxygenation now brain activity really happens on a millisecond timescale not on a second timescale of mr magneto encephalography is a technique allows you to measure electrical activity of the brain the problem is you can't localize it you can't tell when you measure it surface of the brain exactly where it came from and the folks at the Martino Center said well what if we combine the best of both worlds use the MRI to constrain the inverse problem and then if you will make a movie of activation and this is one example of that again in this case they're reading novel words and when you see the thing restart you'll see it starts at the posterior of the brain and it moves itself up to the frontal lobe back and forth so you can see this fleeting thought is very complicated in terms of going back to front to back to front and it gives you a whole new appreciation for the complexities of what systems neuroscience is likely to mean when think about what does it mean to read a word and remember it so I've given you a number of vignettes you know heart mine arthritis and of of things that have really over the past 20 years gone if you will from bench to bedside they've all been things that I think every single person that list has gotten a grant proposal back saying it's impossible it will never work and I've showed you that these things in fact have worked and had had tremendous impact the and each of them these advances was enabled by a true advance in technology another important sort of common theme is though I told you the sort of head investigator in fact if you were to go into any of their laboratories or talk to them about the work though no they won't say oh it was just my engineering background that did it actually they had teams of people within the labs that include physical scientists and engineers biologists physicians and so forth so that's the case for all of the stories I told you and they really attribute the advances I've shown you to the ability to create that integration and the ratcheting that you get by having the multiple disciplines talking to one another the theme you've heard I think throughout this morning which brings me to Health Sciences and Technology that a number of people is mentioned I just wanted to give you a sense of the landscape in 1970 and sort of to fill out what's here at MIT now Health Science and Technology was established in 1970 it's a if you will a joint department that's owned by Harvard and MIT it's it's done interdisciplinary education and research programs and it really focuses on the integration the translation from bench to bedside and of course as everybody at MIT innovation and we use this to talk about equal footing of the different disciplines and really integrating the different professions so we can move both identify the critical unmet medical NEADS and bring them bring the solutions to the bedside and industry is an important player in all of that we've just passed a thousand alums and we have 450 students enrolled including PhD students MD students MS MBA students and so forth and we have 50 primary and joint faculty like Doug the mentioned in the biological engineering this group has grown in recent years I put this up here to say I've selected a very small set of what's happening here I said ok well for tech they wanted I picked the alums who are faculty who are doing something that's already reached the clinic ok so that means that I haven't been able to talk to you about the genomics or the viola informatics or the stuff that's dealing with predicting outcome in space through our active active work with NASA about quantum dots to do to bring molecules target molecules for cancer and on and on so hopefully this will intrigue you and you can come visit us sometime Doug Doug talked about the map and I think one of the things HST does is bring under the MIT umbrella the hospitals and Harvard Medical School so that the landscape for bio and medical engineering at MIT actually brings in the local very Brent teaching hospitals in medical school and industry which leads me to my closing point which is we are extraordinarily well positioned I think at MIT to have just a huge impact over the next decades and advancing human health around the world and when you think about the number of disciplines such as biological engineering that starting in the fall through biology which has been here for a long time the number of centers that have formed plus the fact that with HST we've sort of got Harvard sort of under the same umbrella there is no other institution that I'm aware of in the world that has the strength the collection that we have here here at MIT so we're delighted that that Susan's excited about this as a as an area and I think we hopefully come back in 35 years for the next tech day and have equally transformative advances thank you okay yeah I think we're gonna still have some questions but a little bit abbreviated time so a professor Hawk field and and professors if you can join up here on stage there are two microphones in the aisles folks downstairs and little Kresge you'll need to come up we'll try to get up holidays we don't have the full half hour if we can line up questions at those microphones and we'll get our faculty ready to go one thing well while we're getting set here hopefully all of you collected blank surveys as you came in the door if you would be so kind to complete those surveys and leave them as as you exit they're very important for the tech day committee that's if you've enjoyed what's happened here today very much so it's a result of feedback that we've gotten on those surveys so please please in fact do do take the moment to complete those it's very helpful to us and thanks to for all the patience as we we run a little bit over we'll get you to lunch in time we promise they told me that nobody's going to eat the food until we get there okay yes I think we're good thank you since sugars have such an important influence on operation of the body what sort of risks are you taking when you eat a bar of candy two unrelated events but I think we're trying to really get to the heart of how what sugar we take eventually is used in the synthesis of these more complex sugars but I think the short answer is I think you shouldn't worry about it except your diet hi um with the brain imaging and all what impact does that have on mental health like schizophrenia all right Angela's so there are a number of emerging analysis techniques the schizophrenia is an extraordinarily difficult problem there does look like there's some anatomic differences that you can see between schizophrenics and non schizophrenic I'm not aware of yet anything that's showing the kind of functional differences though I there are groups looking at that but if you're interested offline I could give you the names of some people to talk to yeah I'm like am I on okay what can you hear me yes terrific many of you have seen the new building going up just across the street from the new Stata Center the brain and cognitive science project which is going to be the new home for all of our neuro scientists there is tremendous interest among the neuro scientists to make the kinds of connections that we believe can be made almost nowhere except at MIT between the basic biology the great engineering and the implications for not just neurological disease but also psychiatric disease so a lot of people interested in it working with the Martino's Center we really think we're gonna be able to open up this area ways that have never could open up the floor I used to do cardiac tissue culture and you showed something that I thought was impossible you showed cells that had differentiated into mature cardiac myocytes where they're myofilaments all lined up parallel from cell to cell and they seem to have grown that way in vitro how did you do that was that just the electrical stimulation or did you add some magic growth factors well first of all I want to make it clear that I didn't do it Lisa free2go Donovan yak Nabokov it's it did that but I can't speak to the any magic formulation growth factors but they explored in some empirical way in some strategic ways what population of cells it turns out just using Maya sites alone didn't work very well you had to have a spectrum of myocytes and that they had to wait three days before stimulating otherwise the stimulation itself would prevent the right connections from happening between the different cell that you need to create that kind of organized structure that you see I don't know how many days out what what it would look like if you had looked after two days of stimulation versus the eight days that I showed you but I believe they explored that and they also looked at the kind of stimulation they were doing not an exhaustive search but they were wanted to find something that would work that you could imagine could work in vivo so using that's one of the reasons they used a pacemaker you talked about autologous chondrocyte transplants for putting cartilage in knees is canet also be used for cartilage in vertebrae for people with back problems no probably not at this point in in back problem there's a number of issues and if you're referring to disc disease there are people that have artificial discs that are I don't know if anything's been FDA approved but it is FDA approved so Linda may have have more information no I just read The Wall Street Journal and remembers but the the problem with using that technique and putting it between a load-bearing joint like you might have there is is you usually you in the distant you'd have to remove most of the discs in this case they take advantage of fact that most of the cartilage is there and replace the defect but the properties of that defect could never support your body weight and so trying to imagine a little hole in a disk is not really the way the disc degenerates okay thank you you know we saw that you know this looking at things from the engineering perspective all of a sudden we start realizing wait a minute we need to do glycomics and as I understand it if we start at the cell level than the glycomics are sort of getting immediate interconnection between the cells but then there's still quite a distance between there even to the organ level and I'm wondering is there something similar that appears to be interesting as a possible additional discipline that's like just above the level of glycomics at the next level of interconnection about that I can't imagine another discipline there because to form a new engineering discipline you have to have I think a new science quite honestly and I think what you're talking about with that is just a an extension of the sciences as the things Rama was working on integrate things from the molecular cell level and are able to then explain what happens when they come together and operate as a tissue so I think it's a natural extension of our discipline based on the molecular and cellular sciences dr. Griffith and dr. Belcher both talked a lot about structure creating function and how to really create something new I'd like to have you just have a chance to expand having heard some of the more practical things of the second half where you think some of the future design products will actually evolve into what you think will actually hit the marketplace to help people themselves well I think probably you're directing that more to Angie but I can save for what we're doing we have defined some approaches that would potentially greatly speed the drug development process and make it much safer we're in the process of translating those into pharmaceutical companies right now and so we just got interviewed on NPR last week and they wanted to know the same thing when it's going to be in the market not by Christmas so you can't get this but but we're really trying to get it in in a research way into some pharmaceutical company laboratories and I think this idea of having sort of the human body on a chip where you have these things that can screen against how humans really respond will be trickling into pharmaceutical research labs over the next five years and more pervasively maybe in ten years we have been focusing that much on medical applications but more for electronics applications and the applications that we're most interested in are are making efficient solar cells large area solar cells we're very interested in energy we're interested in in batteries and different kinds of alternative energy sources some of the first things that I have a company based on this technology they're looking at or or processing things like large area displays where you wouldn't make the whole display biologically but you would make certain components of it in a self-assembling way so I think this technology has the the possibility to reach many different kinds of applications we're talking to people about medical applications as well but we're really we're interested in disruptive technology so we're interested in in trying to figure out ways that that you may not be able to make make a material in the other way how to make inexpensive large-area self-assembling solar cells and such question I was just wondering even though you might be developing this in one particular area like in health or an energy I could see it being translated into clothing where you know you want to change your outfit you just change the charge on your clothing and you've got a whole different display going on or make it invisible if you wanted to do something else we're looking into textiles but mostly for for army applications but also you know interesting to have paints that are reversible paints as well so you could change the color of your car with with regard to glycosylation issues that we had just heard about earlier it does measured immuno activity where you're actually just measuring levels of peptide ever give you a correlation an exact correlation with bioactivity i mean if you're really with absolute peptide levels if you're not necessarily for example with with in in endocrinology CSH producing tumours with relatively low levels of TSH you get a tremendous stimulation of the thyroid apparently in association with very low levels of like oscillation of pirate rope and so the question is is what's the purpose of measuring immuno activity of bio activity is so with that specific point I think one thing that we've begun to understand is that by removing glycosylation you actually affect protein folding that leads to immunogenic response one of the interesting thing is carbohydrate bile by enlarge generally have not been immunogenic in the sense you can't really raise antibodies and things like that that effectively there's some sort of a biological mechanism by which they're selected out yes i want to ask professor Belcher um in organic and traditional organic chemistry same parts tend to work all the time biological organisms viruses and bacteria as wastewater treatment plants and Brewers know are not really very stable and can reject their you know diet after a while do you have you know I wouldn't like to spray an airplane and then you know wonder did the yeast go bad today do you have some experience working with that that's a really good a good point for the most part with we're looking at just display and so these are short peptides that are actually relative that are actually very stable that we've shown that like our virus films and I showed you I carried those around in my briefcase for about two years and I could read uh solve it and it still had greater than ninety of its function its that was partly because of of the way itself assembled itself in a way that that made it just really really stable so you can you can store it as a solid but it's an important point and I think that you know we've never had any problems with you know mutations that that no longer worked anymore but it's something you'd have to you'd have to test fortunately it's a relatively easy test and then you can keep amplifying that back up so we don't have any data that extends probably beyond beyond two years but I think it's an important thing to think about a political minefield the intersection of science religion and politics is of course stem-cell research which is getting a tremendous play in the press a lot of interesting things happening I was wondering what MIT is doing and thinking along these lines and in particular beyond that what other options such as use of somatic stem cells and growth factors for achieving some of the same promise what's happening I'll start with that one a lot of the work I showed you we use adult somatic stem cells to achieve tissue regeneration somatic stem cells are used every day in the operating room in the form of marrow and bone transplants and other things there's an awful lot of activity at MIT in the area of stem cells in my lab and several labs here a lot of us work with adult stem cells simply because they probably have the greatest promise to be used for a lot of things both clinically as well as technologies like the ones I talked about tomorrow there are also faculty who work on embryonic stem cells and I think a lot of the effort goes into understanding how humans develop so embryonic stem cells in addition to what all gets in the press are fantastic tools for understanding developmental biology and so I I think we have a very pragmatic approach at MIT as you might imagine that there is work across the board we certainly queue to the the regulations that are imposed by the government but we also don't issue the practical implications of a source of potentially new technologies and new therapies and I would only add that there are there's a lot of stem cell research going on outside of biological engineering the Whitehead Institute has a new stem cell initiative we have some of I think the world leaders say the world leaders in stem cell biology who are currently working on our campus and you know walking this you know narrow line between federally approved and federally non-approved lines is tricky and we are talking about establishing a place at MIT at the Whitehead where it would be funded not by federal funds so that some of this work could go forward I think as Linda points out if you had a choice of getting stem cells for your own therapy that came from someone else or you know some other work in ism or cells of your own that had been modified to do what you want obviously we prefer to get our own cells because then you avoid the complications of the immune response but understanding what a cell actually has to put in place to be a toady potent cell is a kind of understanding that is likely only to come out of research on embryonic stem cells so even to realize the full potential of adult stem cells we're gonna have to have the better knowledge of these embryonic stem cells you're touching on the question I was gonna ask but put aside stem cell research as a way of reproducing tissue and organs how about you know I've been making parts and maybe many of the my colleagues here have made mechanical parts for all of our lifetime how about taking the individual structure and the elements that you're learning so much about and making tissue from that and organs eventually is that being actively done to create manufactured parts if you will okay so I think both Martha and I spoke two aspects of that what I tried to convey in my talk is certainly that is being done and you saw examples of we're trying to do that I think there's also a very forward-looking vision of the future that yes we will continue to get an accident so I Drive a motorcycle trauma might need to have a knee replaced but you'd love to get away from having to have replacement parts put in because you got a disease it'd be much better you'd be much better off getting cured the disease very early in the disease process so that you never have to go in the hospital and have surgery anyone who's had surgery knows it's not a pleasant experience to go in and get sedated and have things done to you thank you we'd like to eat some more lunch so or eat lunch so thank you thank you
