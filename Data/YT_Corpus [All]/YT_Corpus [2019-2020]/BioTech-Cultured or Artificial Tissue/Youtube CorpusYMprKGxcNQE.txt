 one of the central ideas of our manuscript is can we repurpose drugs on the shelf that target human proteins and take them and use them to fight infection use drugs to interfere with the functions of those human proteins and in doing so attempt to inhibit virus infection which ultimately we had a few examples of success in doing that hello and welcome to first person science giving scientists a platform to control the scientific narrative and to dispel misinformation surrounding their science i'm your host roger hudson and today we're here with dr david gordon associate researcher at the university of california san francisco or ucsf and soon to be assistant professor so david you are the first author out of a paper that includes more than 100 different authors it's a recent i would say bombshell of a publication entitled a sars cov2 or covid protein interaction map reveals targets for drug repurposing and is published in the journal nature very timely and i guess for lack of a better word detailed analysis of the covid to human or the virus to host protein interactions or the interactions between these two virus and host proteins that facilitate the viral replication in the cell so i suppose you've been extremely busy since the kovic shutdown david how have things changed in the lab is social distancing taking a toll on productivity or i guess the way of life in the lab at all well the lab is very quiet everybody who can work remotely is working remotely and there's only a few of us currently working there ucsf just like most employers in town has instituted certain safeguards to make sure that staff are safe and that means if you do have to come into work it's extremely important to practice social distancing wear face coverings and to abide by other regulations in regards to density of people who are permitted to work yeah i think that's been very much a universal theme throughout the research world universal shutdowns except for covid related research and you have been one of the individuals on those front lines in the lab conducting this research and this is a in-depth publication that includes several different labs across several different sectors both biotechnology or the industry sectors and academia and across i guess several different institutions so how does such a large project a large collaboration come to fruition and is there anything that we can learn as scientists and in the science world from this collaboration moving forward i guess i could tell you the story of how this started it wasn't a huge collaboration to begin um it started in mid to late january when evan reached out and he wanted someone to begin studying this this virus and i had been following it in the news and i said absolutely i think this is extremely important and so i set out to clone all the genes i reached out to some colleagues in the group two specialists gwen yang who's second author as well as jeff guo who is my technician and together uh we cloned all of these uh sars kobe 2 proteins at least almost all of them for technical reasons there were just a few that didn't make it into the manuscript but subsequently those are still being analyzed by us in the lab and so it started with um just me and nevin conceiving the study i reached out to some folks in the lab and we worked together to start building a proteomics map of this pathogen as that work progressed um the situation in the world changed and as time went on and the project progressed it became increasingly apparent of the time-sensitive nature of the research as days went by i as the coronavirus the lead coronavirus researcher in the group at the time i organized uh presentations with first uh senior folks in the lab and then i just as a coincidence i had a lab meeting on uh on a very auspicious day when when it really became apparent that we might actually have to shut down in the group and or at least institute um social distancing measures and and to send non-key personnel home and on that day i just happened to have lab meeting scheduled so i um over the course of these weeks where we were doing this work i'd been preparing a large and larger slide deck trying to amass an amount of information to brief everybody on the virus and um what we were doing to study it and other facts about the the virus that we could glean from sars and then from that point on it really became a huge team effort we continued to gather the proteomics data that was a huge team effort we analyzed the network which was a huge team effort and uh shortly after finishing acquisition of the data we were forced into quarantine and so then we were working extraordinarily late hours uh under pretty intense conditions isolated in our own separate apartments and homes to write this manuscript we communicated through zoom through slack and through common uh documents and uh there were several times when documents crashed because too many people were working at the same time wow yeah so it was it was uh intense and um you know i'm proud to uh have had a leadership role there and and also but really i was really proud to have been a member of uh what became a very large and incredible team effort that um you know i i think we all knew how remarkable it was at the time and and i think i'm i'm really pleased to see that the team it continues to be extremely productive um not just throughout uh pushing through on this interactum study which has become the nucleus of an immense number of other follow-up uh studies both in our consortia and throughout the world just a seed that can just elaborate on so much more research for decades to come yeah those the and people continue to validate um the observations we made uh the proteomics observations so um we have a lot of confidence in that data set um i think it's it's quite high quality and and the results are absolutely striking in terms of the the types of interactions we're seeing um it it strikes home for me in a number of ways because i studied cell biology during my phd and there are a number of vesicle trafficking genes in there which are very interesting which i i really enjoy thinking about um but um but not only not only do we have this large interaction that we produce but now we have this large consortium we're calling the uh qbi covet 19 research group and he's composed of over 20 labs and we continue to work together um on a number of different areas of exploration in terms of the interactome and other other studies truly an extraordinary set of results and probably only attainable from the collaboration that was achieved like you said over 20 different groups so in terms of the process you went through in order to achieve these results you mentioned that you actually had cloned copies of covid in the lab and that you went through and cloned individual components or individual sequences the genome which can encode the proteins from the virus is that the general sense of it or are there certain pieces there that i'm missing so when we started working on this we utilized the wa1 sequence which was an isolate in washington that was released um i think on january 24th we downloaded it but at that time we did not have a copy of sarsko v2 in the lab the virus but what we could do is we could synthesize the gene de novo and so that's what we did we we designed what's called human codon optimized versions of each protein and the reason we did that is because sometimes the way a virus gene is expressed in the cell in that context the virus may have rewired the way the cell reads proteins and expresses them and so what we wanted to do was change the codon so that they suited the typical human protein production machinery even the concept of a normal functioning cell and really the purpose of that was to make sure we could express the proteins quickly even back then we knew it was a time-sensitive project normally these projects take years and that's the striking thing about what we were able to accomplish um the cloning uh i remember very distinctly um being very very late to a date um january 25th very late and i think that got me in trouble um but i knew i had to start doing this and from from the outset we knew it we had to go fast and so uh we made the decision to human code on optimize all the proteins which isn't always necessary but i think ultimately a wise decision considering the timing i see okay so in a sense then you cloned each of these individual proteins that make up the virus the covet virus were was there ever a time when because i i understand that you also do the in vitro studies in the petri dishes was there ever a time when you actually had the live the live virus or was it simply the individual proteins that compile the virus and if it was just the proteins are there certain limitations that we need to take into account from these results given that it's not an entire virus in a sense together so there's a few questions there and i'll i'll answer them individually um at the time the study began very very few labs in the world had this virus in culture over the subsequent it's been four months there's been a huge amount of work done to understand what cells are permissive and i think a lot of the information we had a good night we had a good idea of it based on what sars infects sars and sars cov2 are very similar and so based on what sars infects we can we inferred what cell types we could infect with stars too but um you know a lot of the people who had to grow this virus hadn't worked with sars before sars2 was brand new um and so not only did we need an aerosol contained the sl3 which is a relatively high uh safety barrier to achieve um a specialized facility to grow the virus and use it but people had to learn how to infect with it and how to culture it and how to handle it and so um there were very few labs in the world that could do it back in january february uh march when we were performing the study uh we reached out to two groups who were close collaborators of ours uh one of them is at mount sinai in new york and the other is at the pasteur institute in paris and these two groups we collaborated on on downstream virology studies the purpose of the protein interaction map was to gather the global information about what the viral proteins were binding inside of our human cells and then the second another portion of the study was to try and derive actionable data from that information really to identify drug targets among the human proteins that interact with the virus and then try to use drugs to interfere with the functions of those human proteins and in doing so attempt to inhibit virus infection which ultimately we had a few examples of success in doing that um to your other question about whether or not there's a caveat regarding expressing the proteins individually you know our lab has been doing this for a long time and we've done it in a wide range of viruses and pathogens there have been examples where we have performed this type of study using an intact virus versus the isolated proteins and in those examples we've seen a large degree of overlap between what the isolated viral proteins will bind in a cell when expressed individually and what the prot what that same protein will bind in the context of a full infection so we have we have confidence that that these results are transferable to the viral infected context and in terms of the actual i guess cell type that you express this virus within in terms of the introduction you write that they were primarily expressed within hex cells human embryonic kidney cells essentially developmental kidney-derived cells but we obviously know that covid infects the mucous membranes and makes its way actually much deeper than most other viruses into the lungs and other tissue there so to what extent can we make that generalization based off of the current findings and i know that you also in one of the later figures show that the expression is much greater in terms of the viral protein expression within lung tissue so so was that a algorithmic derived result or how did you come to these conclusions one of the things i realized early on based on the sars literature is that sars can disseminate that happens with other respiratory viruses as well i study a number of respiratory viruses in the group and so that was something i um i was aware of and and i i realized sars in literature as well does this does the same thing i would direct your intention to a manuscript that was published on may 13th in the new england journal of medicine where they looked at 27 divers who were covered patients and they see that there is virus detected in a number of tissues cardiac tissue liver tissue kidney tissue lung tissue and others now striated among the different patients uh they had different readouts among each and it seems like lung of course is the primary side of infection but that um i think based on that data and and all other earlier data about core morbidities and risk factors related to cardiovascular syndromes and cardiovascular disease uh or diabetes um and based on the knowledge that sars can disseminate and additionally based on the knowledge that uh the surface receptor of sars cov2 uh ace2 is expressed in a number of tissues um all of that information adds up to the idea that this virus can likely disseminate um and it can infect other tissues probably so there is reason to believe that these results can be extended upon in order to say that yes these protein of protein interactions that you identify are indeed among the protein protein interactions that are involved in covid actually infecting an individual from the outset well we have we use kidney cells because these are workhorse proteomic cells they have a large uh amount of protein that they generate uh and they express our our individual protein constructs um reliably and so this is often a go-to cell type what they call hek293 or 295d and so if we want to get this done fast we do it with that cell type that that was the determination made but we also knew that or at least subsequently it was it came to light that kidney cells are permissive in the lab in fact those particular kidney cells are permissive to infection in the lab they're not the most permissive they're not as permissive as certain lung cell types or um or vero cells which are green monkey kidney cells which are particularly well suited for biopropagation now that said of course doing this in lung cells is very important that's something we're doing right now individuals can like you said they've already started to validate many of the findings that you've identified here but they can be extended on and further refined in order to come to greater conclusions about the drugs that would best target these protein protein interactions to hopefully uh abate the infection or to avoid it altogether that's the hope and i think it's important to keep in context what a typical antiviral does target usually antivirals target viral proteins viral enzymes so an example of hiv hiv antivirals typically target three hiv enzymes the hiv reverse transcriptase the hiv integrase or the hiv protease and these drugs are remarkably good uh they have very good safety profiles um and very successful but of course it takes a long time to develop drugs like that and what we have on our hands is a pandemic where we need to respond fast one of the central ideas of our manuscript is can we repurpose drugs on the shelf that target human proteins and take them and use them to fight infection and the hope is that in targeting these human proteins that are bound by the virus we will find specific key pathways molecular pathways that the virus needs and that we can interfere with a drug on hand or drugs on hand so that was the major goal from the outset of the study was to identify these already existing drugs fda approved or in pre-clinical development that are already created hopefully to lean on those fda approved with a greater degree of safety guidelines that are already in widespread use so in terms of your results here now moving into some of the figures it seems that you identify primarily sigma 1 and sigma 2 or sigma receptor based ligands that when bound to these protein protein interactions between covid and human cells that they are best able to or the most effective in reducing that viral replicability or the viral load i also find it very interesting that many of these drugs that you identified in your study are already pre-existing in in common use of course you identify 69 different already existing drugs and many of them as a neuroscientist i took particular notice to the antipsychotic agents that that are present in the study the haloperidol and other antipsychotic agents that have efficacy in reducing that viral replicability so do you think at some point in time in the future when epidemi when large scale epidemiological studies are able to be conducted that we may see a lower set rate of infection among individuals that are already taking or already prescribed these medications that you identify in your study that's a really intriguing question and um i'd love to see data which explores that so what pathways are you most interested in personally further exploring moving forward so one of the um i think key tenants of our group is that we like to be unbiased in what we explore further i think going forwards with this data set our exploration of it will be unbiased so we'd like to look at all of these interactions and i think the number 332 is going to grow as i mentioned there are a few genes that didn't make it into the initial data set um which subsequently we are working on i think soon we'll be able to report that information and so that 332 will grow um we'll need to investigate which of these just what are the functional repercussions of of interfering with these human proteins that bind the virus and there are a large number of ways to do that and so that's an avenue of active investigation of our group in figure 6h you go over the affinity of the sigma receptor 1 and sigma receptor 2 binding relative to the drug's efficacy in reducing sars cov2 viral load and in terms of the cell viability so can you speak at all to the if the affinity to the drug or if the affinity of a specific drug to the sigma 1 or sigma 2 receptors has any relation to its efficacy in terms of reducing the virus or fighting the virus i think what i can say about the drug data and what struck me about the the sigma receptor story that that developed out of all this is that i was just awestruck by the way our our chemist team our chemistry team drew this overlapping figure where they they look at all of these different molecules and they say boom they all overlap right on that and um i guess i i'm a cell biologist i'm a virologist i'm a geneticist i do proteomics work um i i guess chemistry on that on that kind of precision is just it's just something i find so impressive that that they know boom that's what's in common they know the targets of these these these compounds so well they can tell where they overlap i i was really impressed by that and it just goes to show how important the teamwork is in making sure these these studies get done quickly and and comprehensively i couldn't agree more and it's it's striking that you know the drugs that they identify as being you know bound to these receptors are also many many of the drugs that you identify in your study are already being hypothesized or in current use for the treatment of covit uh the chloroquine chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine you also mention remdestivar and other anti-antiretrovirals in your study and you also identify several drugs that are obviously already in use but have not even been considered as potential useful treatments for covit such as pb28 a very selective cancer or anti-cancer drug do you have any idea as to why some of these compounds haven't been previously identified or if we should have if we should be applying these types of protein-wide interaction studies to other viruses and other human diseases so we can more more effectively or in a better way identify treatments i think this is a sign of things to come i do and um i think that by identifying this this network of human proteins that the virus interacts with what you're selecting is a functionally enriched set of factors that the virus is utilizing and so in in just focusing your attention there you can look at um in in greater detail in terms of let's say compound uh concentrations or you could look at not just an fda approved library of compounds but you can start to look at preclinical or compounds that are in clinical trials there's the idea of doing a large-scale compound screen just a whole ton of compounds either either all fda approved or random compounds that chemists have mixed and matched components of that you just look for a phenotype and that's a that's a very successful approach for identifying uh actionable therapies right or at least the beginnings of them absolutely the issue there is you don't really understand right away what the mechanism of action is so you have to then go in and you have to say all right what is this binding to and then you have to go through a whole bunch of other studies and and um whereas the approach we've taken i think has a few uh real um significant benefits one of them is that rather it restricts this the size of your screen of compounds and so arguably in certain contexts that can be faster it allows you to focus on and because you're focused you can look at a greater range of compounds in terms of preclinical clinical face in some phase of clinical trials to mirror off of some of the points that you made there's been a lot of talk in the media and popular culture and even from the scientists themselves that there is large potential for covid to mutate in the coming months or years as it reemerges or as infections re-emerge new waves move across do you think that the drug or the drug interaction targets that you identify in your current study will be still relevant years from now or in the coming months as the virus continues to mutate so that's a really interesting question um we've discussed before what a typical antiviral is and um what a repurposed human directed drug would look like in terms of antiviral effect and a downstream implication of that difference is is exactly what you're asking so typical antivirals which are commonly prescribed for for example hiv therapy hiv suppression of the hiv virus to take a prominent example those are all directed against viral proteins and because of that because of hiv's propensity to mutate hiv can escape the antiviral effect of these compounds in order to help prevent hiv from escaping from that through mutation of these proteins uh you often give these proteins in cocktails of of multiple antiviral compounds keep the virus on its toes can't adapt the idea is that maybe one portion of the virus can mutate away from this compound but the likelihood of two mutations happening or three in key places all at once to completely escape this antiviral effect that's quite low and so that's how people get around the idea of um mutations of the virus to escape antiviral effect an antiviral compound let's say you have a drug that instead of exerting its antiviral effect by binding a viral protein it actually binds one of our host proteins something that we don't necessarily need ourselves but the virus needs desperately yep we don't mutate that fast at all um our you know the idea that our body is going to mutate and somehow that would result in the loss of binding of an antiviral compound that's very unlikely and so our hope is that by identifying these key human proteins that the virus needs but that perhaps on some level we don't we can do without if we inhibit it then we specifically hit something that a virus life cycle needs and we can use it as a treatment in the past you've largely focused on retroviruses such as hiv and the protein or genome-wide interactions that govern the infections you've spoken to the mutation that's or the mutations that are so common and prevalent in hiv for can we use the same anti-viral drugs that we use for hiv which is a i guess a retrovirus for coronaviruses in that sense or would the mechanisms be similar in that sense there was some work done to determine if we could repurpose hiv drugs to inhibit chronovirus infection i don't believe that those showed efficacy in general hiv and stars cov2 which is the causative virus of covin-19 hiv and sars cov2 are very different viruses very very very different um one is a retrovirus hiv and stars cov2 is a beta coronavirus and their genomic structure is fundamentally different the the the proteins they encode uh are dramatically different they use different strategies to hijack the cell so the treatments just by nature of the virus viruses being different needs to be different as well yeah they do you know sometimes with um there are certain antivirals that can be used across many uh viruses so one example is what we call a nucleotide analog something that mimics the building blocks of dna and rna and what we can design through and this is decades of of fantastic work by just enormous numbers of people um we've become as scientists very good at designing these nucleotide analogs that will specifically bind to viral polymerases a polymerase polymerase being an enzyme that replicates the virus genome somehow okay so a lot of times viruses will encode their own uh genomic replication machinery and we can use this modified piece of dna or rna to jam up that machine and what we can do is design that piece of dna rna so that it doesn't really impact our own polymerases our own genome replication machine or our nucleotide machinery in general because humans obviously have the dna and we use messenger rna in order to encode these proteins but viruses and especially i guess it can go both ways some viruses are dna based but beta coronaviruses specifically they are strands of rna and they need a host in order to for the initial protein or that genetic machinery that they need in order to further replicate and express themselves right right that so these are rna viruses and they have a very um interesting way of replicating their genome actually and there's a i think there's a lot more to learn there as well but thanks to uh the efforts of a large number of labs studying chronoviruses for for a long time i think we we know a great deal about them probably more more to learn but um back to the idea of whether an antiviral can impact multiple viruses i think the example of nucleotide analogues are is a very important one to discuss because what we're seeing with ram deserver is an antiviral that was uh used was attempted to be used for ebola and now they're trying to use it for coronavirus and they think that that nucleotide analog from what they understand about it and based on laboratory results and now clinical results they think that that's also going to inhibit um sars cov2 infection and we've seen that for other nucleotide analogues before as well that they'll work for multiple viruses i work for nevin krogen and um for a long time this this uh our group has been looking at the proteomes of a number of viruses and so one of the questions uh we have going forward is um can this uh this type of data when gathered across multiple viruses identify key nodes that many viruses use in in terms of our machinery and can we by targeting those key nodes identify a host directed broad spectrum antiviral some piece of us that lots of viruses seem to love grabbing and then we inhibit that and maybe that will work across multiple pathogens so so you can think about the question of broad spectrum antivirals is something that's really interesting and important right you think about this is coveted 19 what about covet 22. cover 25 you know absolutely what if that what if this happens again you know we've had um coronaviruses before 2000 chronoviruses were essentially um a cold or or or something akin to a cold yeah um and now uh we have had the sars outbreak in 2002 2003 we've had and that was a case mortality rate of around 10 percent we had mers murs murse cases since then as well middle east respiratory syndrome um and that's also quite deadly um and now we have sars kobe 2. so i think the idea of looking at least at coronaviruses and trying to understand whether there's a broad spectrum antiviral strategy we could develop i think that's something that we really ought to look at very very closely and in that same context um i think just being aware of uh other possible threats in terms of pathogens that may emerge in the world extraordinarily important for humanity to keep a very close eye on it may not be uh drugs that could be or drugs that you could that can be designed across several different classes of viruses but even if they can't be hopefully the hope would be that that drug or that treatment would be applicable across for example the coronavirus spectrum there's all sorts of ways we can think about this right we can think about spectrum virus-directed antivirals we can think of broad spectrum hostilities antivirals um and and and i think we have to do it all of course you know what we focused on is we focused on um systematically mapping the protein interactions of sars cov2 we wanted to understand from a global perspective systematically what human proteins this thing was binding and then go in and try and inhibit that to contribute to uh this huge worldwide crisis and mobilization of scientists and virologists and and researchers and doctors to to try and figure out how to treat this quickly with hopefully with something we've got on hand at least at least to give us some time to to develop other therapies also um something to something impactful to to help people who are stricken by the disease that was our main goal but i think there's of course much more much more work that needs to be done um from our perspective um and and from my perspective i think that um studying this pathogens like stars kobe 2 on a systematic level is extraordinarily important work not just from a basic research standpoint but also from a clinical standpoint 100 i could not agree more now now you mentioned earlier that hiv and coronaviruses are obviously very different viruses different structure the treatments for hiv can't be universally applied and in most cases can't be applied at all in terms of as cov2 infection however you also mentioned sars the initial sars outbreak in 2002 2003 mers which you mentioned stars have a 10 mortality rate i've heard um statistics that mers or middle east respiratory syndrome is up to a 30 percent uh mortality rate once an individual gets infected but what makes sars co v2 so different from other coronaviruses i guess specifically sars the original sars i think more work is required to understand those differences on a systematic level but in terms of the genetic sequence and the the the protein coding sequences in these viruses sars cov2 and sars are very similar and so they're i think they're they're we already we've learned a great deal about stars cov2 just by comparing it to sars we have 17 years of data on sars and so um some of these proteins are 80 90 similar um the nsp5 which is one of the proteases is something like 98.7 similar so it's pretty much an identical protein um and so one of the things that really helped us in interpreting our data set and and i think in terms of even mapping what the genome looks like and how to map out what the coding regions are in the genome sequence i think one of the things that's helped us is all of the coronavirus research that's already out there and are all the data we had on sars one and the especially the functional data on what these proteins do in their encoded versions in stars one now there are several differences between stars cov2 and sars one um and so that's not going to apply to every single protein in stars kovi 2 but it's it's similar enough that there's an awful lot that we could get a head start on and so that was i think fortunate and i think it also speaks to the importance of a good healthy basic research infrastructure for uh preparing us for um you know situations like this where we really need that knowledge you know you mentioned that many of the proteins between sars and sarsko v2 are very similar 80 up to 98.6 or similarity in terms of their protein but the differences then lie because clearly only 800 deaths are 800 or so deaths worldwide from sars one whereas sars cov2 is having exponentially higher rates on a daily basis so would it be with the differences in the death rate and the infection likelihood lie in those proteins that aren't as similar or in those minute differences in the similar proteins will we be able to predict what mutations will emerge or what other viruses the damage of other coronal viruses may be based on the knowledge of the human proteins that the cov2 interacts with in order to have its effects are these potentially generalizable to on a widespread scale other viruses in terms of the impact of mutations i think surveillance is key um and so there's there's an awful lot of sequencing being done on viral islands when we published our study i think it stood around two or three thousand sequences i'm sure it's grown um i'd say that that's really crucial work to to understand the track of the evolution of the virus and um our molecular biology tools now today are better than they ever have been so i think we're in a very good position to uh track that pretty much in real time and so that's um i think that's something i'm quite interested in keeping an eye on and i think as we all watch that um and and compare it to how people do who are infected by these viruses that's probably going to be really important information to keep an eye on i forget the actual sequence that you mentioned but it ended in an a if i'm not mistaken there's and i just came across this study earlier today speak on it if you'd like there's three different subtypes of sars cov2 would be i guess type a type b and type c and these have migrated throughout populations in different countries a different patterns throughout the globe if this is correct did you study the a type and because this was the one that was earliest available back in january whereas i at least to my knowledge b and c types have emerged only more recently and would your study findings apply to the other subtypes of the virus that already exist so the when when when i looked up and downloaded our first sequence the wa1 sequence which is split in washington there was something like 20 isolates that have been sequenced almost all of them were identical in terms of protein coding sequence our r isolate has three mutations nucleotide mutations versus the first published sequence uh which was gathered in wuhan in china um i think only one of our muta only one mutation in in our virus causes a protein coding change i see and so uh what we're working with and um and there's also live virus derived from this isolate that that people and the research community use um what that what that is is more or less the original version and i think what's so remarkable about this is the molecular biology sequencing uh the body of sequencing information that's available is you can really see on the molecular level how it just started just one sequence they're all the same all of them are just almost completely the same and then it fans out and and and you can really see evolution unfold right in front of your eyes um and so so it truly was an outbreak and and it's very clear based on the the the genetic data that started from just this one little outbreak and then boom and then it's been mutating so so uh to answer your question that the version we have is just more or less the original and uh what's happened since is um i think um that's that's that's another topic on a couple of side notes here r because we mentioned the dna versus rna viral i guess structure obviously sars cov2 being a beta coronavirus being an rna specific virus are viruses alive or dead do we have like you're obviously an expert in in viruses what what's your opinion on that i i think a virus is a virus in the sense that it can't replicate itself and that's part of what makes it a virus it's part of the definition and so a virus needs to utilize our proteins to replicate itself um and so that's it is what it is fair enough then so and obviously they don't move around by themselves so i guess it really depends on your definition of what is living it's a bit of a philosophical question i think it's interesting to to ponder the utility of viruses in terms of evolution um you know we have silent retroviruses inside of our genomes this is this is something that and that this is different there's a separate conversation as far as kovi too i also study hiv which is a retrovirus but if if we want to wax philosophical um you know we can consider what what what viruses mean to us and how how how this coevolution between our ancestors and and the viruses they they encountered how that has developed over time and their evolutionary marks in our in our genomes uh indicating uh or or dating back to those battles um and so uh there's all sorts of really fascinating questions in terms of evolution our evolution the development of certain genetic elements um just how how how influential has this uh this virus host interplay been over time and throughout our evolution so i think it's a really fascinating thing to think about i just want to bring it back to the whole collaboration that you it obviously put together it started off as a very i wouldn't i wouldn't say a small project but as a small piece of your ongoing research and clearly it's uh just uh amassed into such a large uh project involving you know several different countries have all different institutions 20 different 22 different labs and growing and i'm curious can this type of research this exponential growth that we're seeing typically this type of research as you mentioned would take years to come to fruition to get the type of knowledge and the data and the information that you have gotten out in just a couple of short months and that's including the peer review process which of course was probably expedited but doesn't take away from the fact this is a tremendous amount of work in such a small period of time can this process that you have brought up from the ground up can it be applied to research on a grander scale can other researchers learn from your experience here and your collaboration just as i guess an extension of that i have been involved in the past with a collaboration known as the canadian brain institute for the neurobiological study of depression or can bind and they have an extension of that known as the ontario brain institute they also include the public as a i guess you could me you could say that the public is a collaborator of them because to their conferences or their annual meetings they will have members of the public that represent the patient populations that they're hoping to serve with their research do you think that there's anything that can be gained by having individuals that have lived through covid infection be involved in terms of a voice for covid patients in terms of helping to guide your research moving forward well i can tell you that um i think there is there is a ban there is a boundary between what the first what the frontline clinicians are doing and what the researchers are aware of now at a place like ucsf we we are a medical school so we do have doctors working alongside us and a lot of us are we're phds remedies and we're md phds and as well as other health care disciplines um but um but i think in terms of the literature and and from it from a from the bench as we'd say from from the research bench perspective it can be difficult to know exactly what the frontline clinicians are thinking and what they're doing in terms of what are the what are the best treatments and and um i think that resources such as bioarchive and med archive are really important have been extremely useful towards um towards getting that that information for us for me at least bridging that bench to bedside connection yeah exactly um and so i think in as far as as far as um any any sort of effort that helps us communicate from because we we have it takes all of our time just to get our research done and and how do we even get in if it's a outbreak what are we going to do going to the hospital like we having these conversations is really crucial and um and i think that is a really important conversation um in terms of patient advocacy i think one of the most important things for to one of the most important pieces of information from patients is whether we can identify risk factors genetic risk factors comorbidities as much information as we can get from people who are susceptible as well as the people who fight the disease off to understand what are the underlying molecular reasons why some people you know succumb to this and other people shrug it off that is from my perspective extremely important information and i think um i think that's the first thing that comes to mind to answer your question i guess as an extension of that it seems that these apps or the the technology as it uh continues to develop these for the ability for people in the general public to report their symptoms or their trajectory throughout not only covid but mental health disorders the entire spectrum of human health that that will help guide the research moving forward and i think this also ties into a very important point that you touched on is that the patients themselves obviously there's this disconnect between the scientists that are on the bench conducting the research and the caregivers or the clinicians the the bedside individuals that are largely having their decisions and their treatment decisions guided by the patient experience the patient that's sitting in front of them so there really does need to be this holistic connection and communication between a bench bedside and patients in order to really push things forward at the greatest extent possible has there ever been a time when your research area has been so heavily politicized oh god in terms of the politics i think our focus is just to understand the virus and understand how to treat it and um i think people are scared and i think people uh are really hungry for information i think it's why that we've had this outpouring of of inquiry and support um following through throughout publishing our manuscript on on prepress by archive and then through and through the the final publication um people want to understand the virus and they want to know when they can go back to having their normal daily lives and yeah i completely understand and sympathize and and you know most of us are in the same position um people who can't who don't need to be in the lab right now are not and all of our support staff uh who are extremely hardworking they're all they're all in their little apartments isolated and so i think the the best thing i can say to is this been politicized and i think working on infectious disease and and having worked on hiv i'm i'm aware that what i say to the public has to be uh communicated in a very considerate and thoughtful way um and people are uh people do get concerned rightfully so and um i guess what i would say to your viewers is um that we're all working really hard to try and help even the researchers that aren't able to physically be in the lab and myself as a mental health researcher i can't really speak to the same thing but i think david you have you hit the you hit the nail on the head the public and people all throughout the world they're starving for information they're starting for accurate information and i really want to thank you i really appreciate your time coming on and speaking the truth and speaking uh your platform speaking to the the knowledge that emerges from your study and to covenant so just thank you very very much for your
