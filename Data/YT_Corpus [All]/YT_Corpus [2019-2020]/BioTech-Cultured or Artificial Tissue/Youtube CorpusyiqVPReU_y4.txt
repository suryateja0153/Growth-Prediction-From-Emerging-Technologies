 fine chemicals are complex single pure chemical substances produced in limited quantities in multi-purpose plants by multi-step batch chemical or biotechnological processes they are described by exacting specifications used for further processing within the chemical industry and sold for more than $10 per kilogram see the comparison of fine chemicals commodities and specialties the class of fine chemicals is subdivided either on the basis of the added value building blocks advanced intermediates or active ingredients or the type of business transaction namely standard or exclusive products fine chemicals are produced in limited volumes $10 per kilogram according to exacting specifications mainly by traditional organic synthesis in multi-purpose chemical plants biotechnical processes are gaining ground the global production value is about eighty-five billion dollars fine chemicals are used as starting materials for specialty chemicals particularly pharmaceuticals biopharmaceuticals and agro chemicals custom manufacturing for the life science industry plays a big role however a significant portion of the fine chemicals total production volume is manufactured in-house by large users the industry is fragmented and extends from small privately owned companies to divisions of big diversified chemical enterprises the term fine chemicals is used in distinction to heavy chemicals which are produced and handled in large lots and are often in a crude state since their inception in the late 1970s fine chemicals have become an important part of the chemical industry the total production value of 85 billion dollars is split about sixty fortieths among in-house production by the main consumers the life science industry on the one hand and the fine chemicals industry on the other hand the latter pursues both a supply push strategy whereby standard products are developed in-house and offered ubiquitously and a demand pull strategy whereby products or services determined by the customer are provided exclusively on a 1 customer 1 supplier base the products are mainly used as building blocks for proprietary products the hardware of the top-tier fine chemical companies has become almost identical the design layout and equipment of the plants and laboratories has become practically the same all over the world most chemical reactions perform go back to the days of the dyestuff industry numerous regulations determine the way labs and plants have to be operated thereby contributing to the uniformity topic history the term fine chemicals was in use as early as 1908 the emergence of the fine chemical industry as a distinct entity dates back to the late 1970s when the overwhelming success of the histamine h2-receptor antagonist tagamet cimetidine and zantac ranitidine hydrochloride created a strong demand for advanced organic chemicals used in their manufacturing processes as the in-house production capacities of the originators the pharmaceutical companies Smith Kline and French in black so could not keep pace with the rapidly increasing requirements both companies now merged as GlaxoSmithKline outsource part of the manufacturing to chemical companies experienced in producing relatively sophisticated organic molecules lanza Switzerland which already had supplied an early intermediate ethyl acetoacetate during drug development soon became the main supplier of more and more advanced precursors the signature of a first simple supply contract is generally acknowledged as the historical document marking the beginning of the fine chemical industry in the subsequent years the business developed favorably in lanza was the first fine Chemical Company entering in a strategic partnership with SKF in a similar way fine organics UK became the supplier of the thio ethylene methyl to nutria 1:1 ethany diamine moiety of ranitidine ii h2 receptor antagonists marketed as zantac by Glaxo other pharmaceutical and agrochemical companies gradually followed suit and also started outsourcing the procurement of fine chemicals an example in case is FIS it which partnered with rush Switzerland for custom manufacturing precursors of the benzodiazepine class of tranquilizers such as Librium chlordiazepoxide HCl and valium diazepam the growing complexity and potency of new pharmaceuticals and agro chemicals requiring production in multi-purpose instead of dedicated plants and more recently the advent of biopharmaceuticals had a major impact on the demand for fine chemicals in the evolution of the fine chemical industry as a distinct entity for many years however the life science industry continued considering captive production of the active ingredients of their drugs and agro chemicals is a core competency outsourcing was recurred to only in exceptional cases such as capacity shortfalls processes requiring hazardous chemistry or new products where uncertainties existed about the chance of a successful launch topic products in terms of molecular structure one distinguishes first between low molecular weight lm/w and high molecular weight hmw products the generally accepted threshold between lm/w and hmw is a molecular weight of about 700 lm/w fine chemicals also designated as small molecules are produced by traditional chemical synthesis by microorganisms fermentation or bio transformation or by extraction from plants and animals in the production of modern life science products total synthesis from petrochemicals prevails the hmw products respectively large molecules are obtained mainly through biotechnology processes within lm/w s the n heterocyclic compounds are the most important category within HM w's they are the peptides and proteins topic small molecules as aromatic compounds have been exhausted to a large extent as building blocks for life science products and hetero cyclic structures prevail nowadays they are found in many natural products such as chlorophyll hemoglobin and the vitamins biotin folic acid niacin pipi pyridoxine vitamin b6 riboflavin vitamin b2 and thiamine vitamin b1 in synthetic life science products and heterocyclic moieties are widely diffuses both pharmaceuticals and agro chemicals thus beta lactams are structural elements of penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics imidazole czar found both in modern herbicides eg arsenal Amma's appear and pharmaceuticals eg the anti-ulcer and stagger met cimetidine see above and nexium omeprazole the anti my Kotik stacked aren mechanism fungi risk ketoconazole and travellin isoko nasal tetras all's in tetris ala Dean's are pivotal parts of the certain class of hypertensives eg candesartan celexa teal candesartan a ver pro herb a certain Kosar losartan and diovan valsartan a vast array of pharmaceuticals and agro chemicals are based on pyrimidines such as vitamin b1 thiamine the sulfonamide antibiotics eg mad Robin sulfadimethoxine and half a century later the sulfonylurea herbicides eg Eagle amido sulfur on and lond acts pencil fur on methyl benzodiazepine derivatives are the pivotal structural elements of breakthrough CNS drugs such as Librium chlordiazepoxide and valium diazepam pyridine derivatives are found in both well-known dicot and chlorpyrifos herbicides and in modern Nikita noid insecticides such as immer dayglo prett even modern pigments such as diphenyl Firoz olopa resolves quinacridone z' and engineering plastics such as polybenzimidazole ease polyamide ease and triazine resins exhibit an n heterocyclic structure topic big molecules big molecules also called high-molecular-weight hmw molecules are mostly oligomers or polymers of small molecules or chains of amino acids thus within Pharma sciences peptides proteins and oligonucleotides constitute the major categories peptides and proteins are oligomers or poly condensates of amino acids linked together by a carboxamide group the threshold between the two is is at about 50 amino acids because of their unique biological functions a significant and growing part of new drug discovery and development is focused on this class of biomolecules their biological functions are determined by the exact arrangement or sequence of different amino acids in their makeup for the synthesis of peptides four categories of fine chemicals commonly referred to as peptide building blocks ppb's a key namely amino acids equals starting materials protected amino acids peptide fragments and peptides themselves along the way the molecular weights increase from about 102 up to 104 in the unit prices from about 100 dollars up to 105 dollars per kilogram however only a small part of the total amino acid production is used for peptide synthesis in fact L glutamic acid d l methionine l aspartic acid and l-phenylalanine are used in large quantities as food and feed additives about 50 peptide drugs are commercialized the number of amino acids that make up a specific peptide varies widely at the low end of the dip eped hides the most important drugs with a DES peptide l alumel L prolene moiety of Aprill cardiovascular drugs such as a liberal lisinopril cap trill captopril novolac amide a perl and rena tech enalapril also the artificial sweetener aspartame NL alpha aspartyl l-phenylalanine 1 methyl ester is a depicted at the high end there is the anticoagulant he redeem MW approximately equals 7,000 which is composed of 65 amino acids apart from pharmaceuticals peptides are also used for diagnostics and vaccines the total production volume excl aspartame of chemically synthesized pure peptides is about 1,500 kilograms and sales approach 500 million dollars on the active pharmaceutical API level in 10 billion dollars on the finished drug level respectively the bulk of the production of peptide drugs which comprise also the first generation anti AIDS drugs the novice is outsourced to a few specialized contract manufacturers such as batch M Switzerland Changu GT biochem China Chinese peptide company China Lanza Switzerland and polypeptide Denmark proteins are very high molecular weight MW greater than 100,000 organic compounds consisting of amino acid sequences linked by peptide bonds they are essential to the structure and function of all living cells and viruses and are among the most actively studied molecules in biochemistry they can be made only by advanced biotechnological processes primarily mammalian cell cultures monoclonal antibodies may prevail among human-made proteins about a dozen of them are approved as pharmaceuticals important modern products are Ipoh panic rate near a common erythropoietin Enbrel etanercept Remicade infliximab map therap Rituxan rituximab and Herceptin trust a zoom Abbe peg elation is a big step forward regarding administration of peptide and protein drugs the method offers the twofold advantage of substituting injection by oral administration and reducing the dosage and therefore the cost of the treatment the pioneer company in this field is prolong pharmaceuticals which has developed a pegylated erythropoietin peggy poe oligonucleotides are a third category of big molecules they are oligomers of nucleotides which in turn are composed of a five carbon sugar either ribose or deoxyribose and nitrogenous base either a pyrimidine or a purine and one two three phosphate it's the best known representative of a nucleotide is the co enzyme ATP equals adenosine triphosphate MW 507 point 2 oligonucleotides are chemically synthesized from protected phosphoramidites of natural or chemically modified nucleosides the oligonucleotide chain assembly proceeds in the direction from 3 to 5 terminus by following a procedure referred to as at synthetic cycle completion of a single synthetic cycle results in the addition of one nucleotide residue to the growing chain the maximum length of synthetic oligonucleotides hardly exceeds 200 nucleotide components from its current range of applications in basic research as well as in drug target validation drug discovery and therapeutic development the potential use of oligonucleotides is foreseen in gene therapy anti sense drugs disease prevention and agriculture antibody drug conjugates ADC constitute a combination between small and big molecules for small molecule parts up to four different APIs are highly potent cytotoxic drugs they are linked with a monoclonal antibody a big molecule which is of little or no therapeutic value in itself but extremely discriminating for its targets the cancer cells the first commercialized adc's were Isis's form of virus in and more recently thises formerly Wyeth my little gem to zoomable saga missin examples of AD C's in Phase three of development of Abbott's Isis's aleca force in an Eli Lilly's apron o Carson topic Technologies several key technologies are used for the production of fine chemicals including chemical synthesis either from petrochemical starting materials or from natural products extracts biotechnology for small molecules biocatalysis enzymatic methods biosynthesis fermentation and for big molecules cell culture technology extraction from animals microorganisms or plants isolation and purification used for example for alkaloids antibacterials especially penicillins and steroids hydrolysis of proteins especially when combined with ion exchange chromatography used for instance for amino acids chemical synthesis and biotechnology are most frequently used sometimes also in combination topic traditional chemical synthesis are large toolbox of chemical reactions is available for each step of the synthesis of a fine chemical the reactions have been developed on laboratory scale by academia over the last two centuries and subsequently adapted to industrial scale for instance for the manufacture of dyestuffs and pigments the most comprehensive hand books describing organic synthetic methods is methods of molecular transformations about 10% of the 26,000 synthetic methods described therein are currently used on an industrial scale for fine chemicals production amination condensation esterification friedel-crafts grignard halogenation especially chlorination and hydrogenation respectively reduction both catalytic and chemical are most frequently mentioned on the websites of individual companies optically active cyanohydrin cyclo polymerization ionic liquids nitrones oligonucleotides peptide both liquid and solid phase electrochemical reactions eg per fluorination and steroid synthesis are promoted by only a limited number of companies with the exception of some stereospecific reactions particularly biotechnology mustering these technologies does not represent a distinct competitive advantage most reactions can be carried out in standard multi-purpose plants the very versatile organometallic reactions eg conversions with lithium aluminum hydride boronic acids may require temperatures as low as minus 100 degrees Celsius which can be achieved only in special cryogenic reaction units either by using liquefied nitrogen as coolant or by installing a low temperature unit other reaction specific equipment such as filters for the separation of catalysts ozone or phosgene generators can be purchased in many different sizes the installation of special equipment generally is not a critical path on the overall project for developing an industrial scale process of a new molecule since the mid-1990s the commercial importance of single enantiomer fine chemicals has increased steadily they constitute about half of both existing and developmental drug APIs in this context the ability to synthesize chiral molecules has become an important competency two types of processes are used namely the physical separation of the enantiomers in the stereospecific synthesis using chiral catalysts among the latter enzymes and synthetic bind up to two this diphenyl phosphine o- one one bin of file types are used most frequently large volume greater than 103 m TPA processes using chiral catalysts include the manufacture of the perfume ingredient l menthol and Syngenta's jewel metallic law as well as BASF Outlook diethylamide P herbicides examples of originator drugs which apply asymmetric technology are Astra Zeneca nexium Isom appraisal and Merkin Coast januvia sittig Lipton the physical separation of chiral mixtures and purification of the desired enantiomer can be achieved either by classical fractional crystallization having a low-tech image but still widely used carried out in standard multi-purpose equipment or by various types of chromatographic 'el separation such as standard column simulated moving bed SMB or supercritical fluid SCF techniques for peptide three main types of methods are used namely chemical synthesis extraction from natural substances and biosynthesis chemical synthesis is used for smaller peptides made of up to 30 to 40 amino acids one distinguishes between liquid phase and solid phase synthesis in the latter reagents are incorporated in a resin that is contained in a reactor or column the synthesis sequence starts by attaching the first amino acid to the reactive group of the resin and then adding the remaining amino acids one after the other in order to ascertain a full selectivity the amino groups have to be protected in advance most developmental peptides are synthesized by this method which lends itself to automation as the intermediate products resulting from individual synthetic steps cannot be purified a selectivity of effectively 100 percent is essential for the synthesis of larger peptide molecules even at a selectivity of 99% per reaction step the purity will drop to less than 75 percent for a deca peptide 30 steps therefore for industrial quantities of peptides not more than 10 to 15 amino acid peptides can be made using the solid phase method for laboratory quantities up to 40 are possible in order to prepare larger peptides individual fragments are first produced purified and then combined to the final molecule by liquid phase synthesis thus for the production of Rush's anti-aids drug fuse on in fervor tied three fragments of 10 to 12 amino acids are first made by solid phase synthesis and then linked together by liquid phase synthesis the preparation of the whole 35 amino acid peptide requires more than 130 individual steps micro reactor technology MRT making part of process intensification is a relatively new tool that is being developed at several universities as well as leading fine chemical companies such as biotechnology services Germany Clariant Switzerland ever Nick Degussa Germany DSM the Netherlands Lanza Switzer PCAs France and sigma-aldrich us the latter company produces about 50 fine chemicals up to multi kilogram quantities in micro reactors from a technological point of view MRT aka continuous flow reactors represents the first breakthrough development in reactor design since the introduction of the stirred tank reactor which was used by Perkin & Sons when they set up a factory on the banks of what was then the Grand Junction Canal in London in 1857 to produce more vein the first-ever synthetic purple dye for a comprehensive coverage of the subject see micro process engineering examples for reactions that have worked in micro reactors include aromatics oxidations diazomethane conversions grain yards halogenation x' hydrogenation x' nitration x' and suzuki coupling x' according to experts in the field 70% of all chemical reactions could be done in micro reactors however only 10 to 15% are economically justified with the exception of some stereospecific reactions particularly biotechnology mastering these technologies does not represent a distinct competitive advantage most reactions can be carried out in standard multi purpose plants reactions specific equipment such as ozone or phosgene generators is readily available the installation generally is not a critical path on the overall project for developing an industrial scale process of a new molecule whereas the overall demand for outsourced pharmaceutical fine chemicals is expected to increase moderately see chapter 8 the estimated annual growth rates for the above-mentioned niche technologies are much higher Micro reactors in the SMB separation technology are expected to grow at a rate of even 50 to 100 percent per year however the total size of the accessible market typically does not exceed a few hundred tonnes per year at best topic biotech industrial biotechnology also called white biotechnology is increasingly impacting the chemical industry enabling both the conversion of renewable resources such as sugar or vegetable oils and the more efficient transformation of conventional raw materials into a wide range of commodities eg cellulose ethanol in six-inch acid fine chemicals eg six amino penicillin each acid and specialties eg food and feed additives as opposed to green and red biotechnology which relate to agriculture and medicine respectively white biotechnology enables the production of existing products in a more economic and sustainable fashion on the one hand and provides access to new products especially biopharmaceuticals on the other hand it is expected that revenues from white biotechnology will account for 10 percent or 250 billion dollars of the global chemical market of two thousand five hundred billion dollars by 2013 in 10 to 15 years it is expected that most amino acids and vitamins and many specialty chemicals will be produced by means of biotechnology three very different process technologies biocatalysis biosynthesis microbial fermentation and cell cultures are used biocatalysis aka bio transformation and bio conversion makes use of natural or modified isolated enzymes enzyme extracts or whole cell systems for enhancing the production of small molecules it has much to offer compared to traditional organic synthesis the synthesis are shorter less energy intensive and generate less waste and hence are both environmentally and economically more attractive about two-thirds of chiral products produced on large industrial scale are already made using bio catalysis in the manufacture of fine chemicals enzymes represent the single most important technology for radical cost reductions this is particularly the case in the synthesis of molecules with chiral centers here it is possible to substitute the formation of assault with a chiral compound eg plus alpha phenyl ethyl amine crystallization salt breaking and recycling of the Kiril auxilary resulting in a theoretical yield of not more than 50% with a one-step high-yield reaction under mild conditions and resulting in a product with a very high N entire marek excess e an example is Astra Zeneca blockbuster drug crest or rosuvastatin C chemical enzymatic synthesis of crest or further examples of modern drugs where enzymes are used in the synthesis of Pfizer's lipitor atorvastatin where the pivotal intermediate our 3 hydroxy 4 cyano butyrate is now made with a nitrile assay and Merkin co singular montelukast where the reduction of a ketone to s alcohol which had required stoichiometric amounts of expensive and moisture sensitive dip chloride is now replaced by a keto reductase enzyme catalyst step similar rewarding switches from chemical steps to enzymatic ones have also been achieved in steroid synthesis thus it has been possible to reduce the number of steps required for the synthesis of dexamethasone from bile from 28 to 15 enzymes differ from chemical catalysts particularly with regard to stereo selectivity regio selectivity and chemo selectivity they can also be modified reshuffled for specific reactions for use in chemical synthesis immobilized enzymes are those fixed on solid supports they can be recovered by filtration after completion of the reaction conventional plant equipment can be used with no or only modest adaptations the International Union of biochemistry and molecular biology IU BMB has developed a classification for enzymes the main categories are oxidoreductases transferases hydrolases lee possess subcategory lysis isomerases and ligases companies specializing in making enzymes are Novozymes danesco Jenin core code exes is the leader in modifying enzymes to specific chemical reactions the highest volume chemicals made by biocatalysis are bio ethanol 70 million metric tons high fructose corn syrup 2 million metric tons acrylamide 6m no penicillin each acid ARPA l-lysine and other amino acids citric acid and niacinamide all more than 10,000 metric tons biosynthesis ie the conversion of organic materials into fine chemicals by microorganisms is used for the production of both small molecules using enzymes in whole cell systems and less complex non glycosylated big molecules including peptides and simpler proteins the technology has been used for ten thousand years to produce food products like alcoholic beverages cheese yogurt and vinegar in contrast to biocatalysis a biosynthetic process does not depend on chemicals as starting materials but only on cheap natural feedstock such as glucose to serve as nutrient for the cells the enzyme systems triggered in the particular microorganism strain lead to the excretion of the desired product into the medium or in the case of hmw peptides and proteins to the accumulation within so called inclusion bodies in the cells the key elements of fermentation development a strain selection and optimization as well as media and process development dedicated plants are used for large-scale industrial production as the volume productivity is low the bio reactors called fermenters are large with volumes that can exceed 250 cubic meters product isolation was previously based on large volume extraction of the medium containing the product modern isolation and membrane technologies like reverse osmosis ultra and nano filtration or affinity chromatography can help to remove salts and byproducts and to concentrate the solution efficiently and in an environmentally friendly manner under mild conditions the final purification is often achieved by conventional chemical crystallization processes in contrast to the isolation of small molecules the isolation and purification of microbial proteins is tedious and often involves a number of expensive large-scale chromatographic operations examples of large volume lm/w products made by modern industrial microbial bio synthetic process monosodium glutamate MSG vitamin b2 riboflavin and vitamin C ascorbic acid in vitamin b2 riboflavin the original six to eight step synthetic process starting from barber Turek acid has been substituted completely by a microbial one-step process allowing a 95 percent waste reduction in an approximately 50 percent manufacturing cost reduction in ascorbic acid the five step process yield approximately equals eighty five percent starting from d-glucose originally invented by today's Reich Stein in 1933 is being gradually substituted by a more straightforward fermentative process with two keto gluconic acid as pivotal intermediate after the discovery of penicillin in 1928 by Sir Alexander Fleming from colonies of the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus it took more than a decade before a powdery form of the medicine was developed since then many more antibiotics and other secondary metabolites have been isolated and manufactured by microbial fermentation on a large scale some important antibiotics besides penicillin Assefa low spore UNS as if from Ison bacitracin gentamicin rifamycin streptomycin tetracycline and vancomycin cell cultures animal or plant cells removed from tissues will continue to grow if cultivated under the appropriate nutrients and conditions when carried out outside the natural habitat the process is called cell culture mammalian cell culture fermentation also known as recombinant DNA technology is used mainly for the production of complex big molecule therapeutic proteins aka biopharmaceuticals the first products made were interferon discovered in 1957 insulin and Soumitra pen commonly used cell lines are chinese hamster ovary cho cells or plant cell cultures the production volumes are very small they exceed 100 kilograms per year for only three products Rituxan russia non-tech enbrel and Gen and Merck & Co formerly Wyeth and Remicade Johnson & Johnson fine chemical production by mammalian cell culture is a much more demanding operation than conventional biocatalysis and synthesis the bioreactor batch requires more stringent controls of operating parameters since mammalian cells are heat and shear sensitive in addition the growth rate of mammalian cells is very slow lasting from days to several months while there are substantial differences between microbial and mammalian technologies eg the volume value relationships at $10 per kilogram and 100 tons for microbial 1 million dollars per kilogram and 10 kilograms for mammalian technology the cycle times are 2 to 4 and 10 to 20 days respectively they are even more pronounced between mammalian and synthetic chemical technology see table 1 the mammalian cell production process as used for most biopharmaceuticals is divided into the four main steps 1 cultivation ie reproduction of the cells to fermentation ie the actual production of the protein typically in 10,000 liter or multiples bioreactors 3 purification ie separation of the cells from the culture medium and purification mostly by chromatography for formulation ie conversion of the sensitive proteins to a stable form all steps are fully automated the low productivity of the animal culture makes the technology expensive and vulnerable to contamination actually as a small number of bacteria would soon outgrow a larger population of animal cells its main disadvantage is a low volume productivity in the animal provenance it is conceivable that other technologies particularly plant cell production will gain importance in future given the fundamental differences between the two process technologies plants for mammalian cell culture technologies have to be built ex novo the pros and cons of an involvement of a fine chemical company in cell culture technology are listed below pros strong growth of demand today biopharmaceuticals account for about $55 to $80 billion or 15% of the total pharmaceutical market they are growing by 15% per year ie three times faster than lm/w drugs and are expected to pass the 150 billion dollars per year threshold by 2015 whereas just one out of the world's top ten drugs was a biopharmaceutical in 2001 the number went up to five in 2010 see table six and is expected to increase further to eight by 2016 see table two the likelihood of developing a new biopharmaceutical successfully is significantly greater than in traditional drug development 25% of biopharmaceuticals that enter phase one of the regulatory process eventually are granted approval the corresponding figure for conventional drugs is less than six percent the traditionally large share of outsourcing small number of custom manufacturers with industrial scale manufacturing capabilities in this demanding technology in the Western Hemisphere primarily bearing or Ingelheim of Germany and Lanza of Switzerland in the eastern hemisphere Nicolas Pye Rimmel of India through the acquisition of a former Avatar operation and the joint ventures between now tech Bo and Beijing e-town harvest international in China in between Biocon in India and celltrion in South Korea same customer category life science especially the pharmaceutical industry similar business types custom manufacturing of proprietary drugs opportunities for generic versions called biosimilars similar regulatory environment FDA regulations especially GMP existing infrastructure utilities etc can be used cons high entry barriers because of demanding technology the construction of a large-scale plant for the production of biopharmaceuticals by cell culture fermentation costs around 500 million dollars and takes four to six years as the specifications of the plant and process types for biopharmaceuticals differ substantially from traditional chemical synthesis they cannot be produced in conventional multi-purpose fine chemical plants high financial exposure one high capital intensity massive in assessments are needed at a time when chances of success are still very low and to risk of batch failures contamination unlike the biopharmaceutical startups the emerging big biopharmaceutical companies are adopting the same opportunistic outsourcing policy as larger pharmaceutical companies thus Amgen Biogen I Dec li Lilly Johnson and Johnson J&J MedImmune Novartis rush Genentech and Pfizer are investing heavily in in-house manufacturing capacity with three plants in the u.s. two in Japan and one each in Germany in Switzerland Rush has the largest production capacity new developments in expression systems for mammalian and plant cell technology could reduce capacity requirements substantially actually the tighter in large-scale mammalian production actually 2 to 3 grams per liter is expected to double to 5 to 7 by 2015 and once more to 10 by 2020 furthermore the widespread application of single-use disposable bio processing technology considered by experts as the hottest buzz in town it advantageous Lee substitutes for stainless steel production trains at least for short production campaigns new transgenic production systems are emerging they eg transgenic Moss Lemna fungal or yeast expression systems transgenic animals and plants such as tobacco plants possess the potential to become economically and industrially successful legislation and regulation of biotechnology is not well defined yet and leads to differences in interpretation and other uncertainties in the US legislation is not yet in place for biosimilars the generic counterpart of generics in small molecule pharmaceuticals the inherent risks of the mammalian cell technology led several companies to opt out of mammalian cell technology or to substantially reduce the stake examples are cambrics and dow farmer in the u.s. avichai DSM and siegfried in europe and wishy Aptech in china in conclusion biocatalysis should be or become part of the technology toolbox of any fine Chemical Company mammalian cell culture fermentation on the other hand should be considered only by large fine chemical companies with a full warchest in a long-term strategic orientation topic the industry within the chemical universe the fine chemical industry is positioned between the commodity their suppliers and specialty chemical industries their customers depending on the services offered there are two types of fine chemical companies the fine chemical companies are active in industrial scale production both of standard and exclusive products if the latter prevails they are referred to as fine chemical custom manufacturing organizations seamos the main assets of the contract research organizations croix are their research laboratories crams contract research and manufacturing organizations are hybrids see section 4.2 topic fine chemical custom manufacturing companies find chemical custom manufacturing companies in the narrower sense are active in process scale-up pilot plant trial production industrial scale exclusive and non exclusive manufacture and marketing their product portfolios comprise exclusive products produced by custom manufacturing as main activity non exclusive products eg API for generics and standard products characteristics are high asset intensity batch production in campaigns in multi-purpose plants above industry average R&D expenditures and close multi-level and multifunctional relationships with industrial customers the industry is very fragmented 2000 to 3000 fine chemical companies exist globally extending from small garage type outfits in China making just one product all the way to the big diversified enterprises RESP units the main reason for the fragmentation is the lack of economy of scale see below the industry is subject to a high degree of regulation even more so than the chemical industry as a whole particularly if pharmaceutical fine chemical production is involved the most important regulatory authorities are the US Food and Drug Administration FDA and Chinese State Food and Drug Administration s FDA respectively their main responsibilities prai's formulating comprehensive supervision policies good manufacturing practice and control the implementation to be in charge of drug registration draw up criteria for marketing authorization and formulate national essential medicines lists the European correspondent is the European Medicines Agency EMEA which is mainly responsible for the scientific evaluation of medicines developed by pharmaceutical companies for use in the European Union the role of reach registration evaluation authorisation and restriction of chemicals is self-explanatory the US pharmacopoeia codifies quality standards for active pharmaceutical ingredients as these standards are observed worldwide they contribute also to the emergence of a uniform worldwide set-up of the top tier fine chemical companies in terms of size resources and complexity of the chemical process technologies mastered the fine chemical companies can be broadly divided into three segments each of them accounting for approximately the same turnover namely about 10 billion dollars the top tier about 20 has sales in excess of 250 million dollars per year see table 3 most are not pure players but divisions or B use of large multinational companies their share varies between 1% or less for BASF and Pfizer all the way to 100% for cambrics USA Divis laboratories India and FIS Italy all have extensive resources in terms of chemists and other specialists plants process knowledge backwards integration international presence etc the combined revenues of the top 25 chemical companies amounted to 10 billion dollars in 2009 representing about 30 percent of the figure for the whole industry the leading companies are typically divisions of large diversified chemical companies in terms of geography nine of the top 20 are located in Europe which is recognized as the cradle of the fine chemical industry this is eg the case for the world's number-one company loans headquartered in Basel Switzerland custom manufacturing prevails in Northern Europe the manufacture of active substances for generics in southern Europe the second largest geographic area is Asia housing seven of the top 20 with four large companies the US ranked last whereas the European and US farmer industry constitutes the main customer base for most fine chemical companies some have a significant share of products and services for the agrochemical industry examples are ARCA mica C ABB salty go all Germany DSM the Netherlands and Heikal India several large pharmaceutical companies market fine chemicals is subsidiary activity to the production for captive use eg Abbott USA by a sharing farmer purring or Ingelheim Germany by Sankyo after the takeover of Ranbaxy Japan Johnson & Johnson USA Merck KGaA Germany Pfizer formerly Upjohn u.s. large fine chemical companies in contrast to mid-sized and small ones are characterized by a lack of economy in size as most fine chemicals are produced in quantities of not more than a few 10 tonnes per year in multi-purpose plants there is little or no economy of size the reactor trains of these plants are similar throughout the industry see production train of a multi-purpose plant regardless of the size of the companies their main constituents the reaction vessels have a median size of the four to six cubic meters various products are made throughout a year in campaigns therefore the unit cost per cubic meter per hour does practically not vary with the size of the company a dichotomy between ownership and management the company's shares are listed on stock exchanges and their performance is scrutinized by the financial community postponement of a single important shipment can affect a quarterly result in the small and mid-sized companies the owners typically are the major shareholders often members of the same family their shares are not traded public fluctuations in their financial performance are more easily coped with complicated business processes flexibility and responsiveness are in jeopardy customer complaints for instance are difficult to resolve in a straightforward manner a heterogeneous portfolio of small companies accumulated over time through M&A activities their key functions such as production R&D and M&S are located on different sites often in different countries a cohabitation with other units a comprehensive list of about 1,400 fine chemical companies including traders can be found in the event catalog of the CPH I exhibition the second tier consists of several dozens of mid-sized companies with sales in the range of $100 to two hundred and $50 million per year their portfolios comprise both custom manufacturing and API for generics they include both independents and subsidiaries of major companies a number of these companies are privately owned and have grown mainly by reinvesting the profits examples are batch 'm switzerland Dishman india FIS and poly industria Tomica italy heikal india and ho v oni portugal customers prefer to do business with mid-sized companies because communications are easier they typically deal directly with the decision-maker and they can better leverage their purchasing power the third tier includes thousands of small independence with sales below 100 million dollars per year most of them are located in Asia they often specialize in niche technologies the minimum economical size of a fine chemical company depends on the availability of infrastructure if a company is located in an industrial park where analytical services utilities safety health and environmental sheet services and warehousing are readily available there is practically no lower limit new fine chemical plants have come on stream mostly in Far East countries over the past few years their annual turnover rate rarely exceeds 25 million dollars all big and medium-sized fine chemical companies have cGMP compliant plants that are suitable for the production of pharmaceutical fine chemicals with the exception of bio pharmaceuticals which are manufactured by only a few selected fine chemical companies c-section 3.2.2 the technology toolboxes of all these companies are similar this means that they can carry out practically all types of chemical reactions they differentiate on the basis of the breadth and quality of the service offering topic contract research organizations contract research organizations croix provide services to the life science industries along product development there are more than 2,000 croix operating worldwide representing revenues of more than 20 billion dollars one distinguishes between product and patient croix whereas the production sites of Somoza multipurpose plants allowing for the production of tens to hundreds of tons of fine chemicals the workplaces of patient Croix sure the test persons volunteers for the clinical trials and those of the product croix sure the laboratory benches major customers for CRO services are the large global pharmaceutical companies half a dozen companies Pfizer GlaxoSmithKline sanofi-aventis Astra Zeneca Johnson & Johnson and Merck & Co alone absorb about one-third of all CRO spending as for CMAs also for croix biotech startup companies with their dichotomy between ambitious drug development programs and limited resources are the second most promising prospects product croix chemical croix are providing primarily sample preparation process

Croatian seamos their history is either a forward integration of acro which adds industrial scale capabilities or backwards integration of a CMO as there are only limited synergies eg greater than 90 percent of the projects end at the sample preparation stage it is questionable though whether one-stop shops really fulfill a need actually the large fine chemical companies consider the preparation of samples more as marketing tool and expense rather than a profit contributor the offerings of patient croix clinical croix comprise more than 30 tasks addressing the clinical part of pharmaceutical development at the interface between drugs physicians hospitals and patients such as the clinical development and selection of lead new drug compounds as clinical trials represent the largest expense in pharmaceutical research the market for patient crew is larger than for their product counterparts thus sales of the top tier firms Charles River Laboratories Co Vance / Excel PPD quintiles transnational all USA and TCG life science India are in the $1 to $2 billion range whereas the largest product crews have revenues of a few 100 million dollars topic research and development the overall emphasis of fine chemical R&D is more on development than on research the main tasks are one designing respectively duplicating and adapting in case of custom manufacture and developing laboratory procedures for new products or processes to transferring the processes from the laboratory via pilot plant to the industrial scale the scale-up factor from a 10 gram sample to a one-ton batch is one hundred thousand and three to optimize existing processes at all times during this course of action it has to be ensured that the four critical constraints namely economics timing safety ecology and sustainability are observed R&D expenditures in the fine chemical industry are higher than in the commodities industry they represent around five to ten percent versus two to five percent of sales on the business side product innovation must proceed at a more rapid pace because life cycles of fine chemicals are shorter than those of commodities therefore there is an ongoing need for substitution of obsolete products on the technical side the higher complexity of the products and the more stringent regulatory requirements absorb more resources many economic and technical parameters have been proposed to enable a meaningful assessment of single projects and project portfolios examples are attractiveness strategic fit innovation gross net present value expected profits R&D expenditures development stage probability of success technology fit potential conflicts with other activities of the company in realization time most of these parameters cannot be determined quantitatively at least during the early phases of a project the best way to take advantage of a project portfolio is to develop a new in an iterative way by comparing the entries at regular intervals for instance every three months the directions that the projects take can be visualized if a negative trend persists with one particular project the project should be put on the watch list topic objectives R and D has to manage the following functions in order to deliver the requested services literature and patent research provisions have to be made for a periodic examination of all acquired research results to safeguard intellectual property rights IPR and to determine whether patent applications are indicated patent research is particularly important for evaluation of the feasibility of taking APAR in D for new apis for generics process research has to design new synthetic routes and sequences two approaches are feasible for simple molecules the bottom-up approach is the method of choice the researcher converts a commercially available starting material and sequentially adds more reagents until the target molecule is synthesized for more complex molecules a top-down approach also known as retrosynthesis order construction is chosen key fragments of the target molecule are first identified then synthesized individually and finally combined to form the desired molecule through convergent synthesis process development focuses on the design of new efficient stable safe and scalable synthetic routes to a target fine chemical it represents an essential link between process research and commercial production the resulting base process description provides the necessary data for the determination of preliminary raw material and product specifications the manufacture of semi commercial quantities in the pilot plant the assessment of the ecological impact the regulatory submissions and technology transfer to manufacture at industrial scale and an estimate of the manufacturing costs in an industrial scale plant if the base process is provided by the customer as part of the technology transfer process research has to optimize it so that it can be transferred to the bench gaile laboratory or pilot plant furthermore it has to be adapted to the specific characteristics of available production trains bench scale laboratory kilogram lab and pilot plant development depending on the volume requirements three different types of equipment are used for process research development and optimization namely bench scale Laboratories for gram - 100 gram kilo labs for kilogram - 10 kilograms and pilot plants for 100 kilograms - tongue quantities particularity zuv laboratory processes that have to be eliminated include the use of large numbers of unit operations dilute reaction mixtures vast quantities of solvents for extraction evaporation - dryness drying of solutions with hygroscopic salts although modern reaction calorimeter is consent to foresee the effects of these different conditions to a certain extent a direct transfer of a process from the laboratory to the industrial scale is not recommended because of the inherent safety environmental and economic risks in development the viability of the process on a semi commercial scale has to be demonstrated trial quantities of the new fine chemical have to be manufactured for market development clinical tests and other requirements the necessary data have to be generated to enable the engineering department to plan the modifications of the industrial scale plant and in order to calculate production costs for the expected large volume requirements both equipment and plant layout of the pilot plant reflect those of an industrial multi-purpose plant except for the size of reaction vessels bench scale laboratory approximately 10 to 60 liters pilot plant approximately one hundred to two thousand five hundred liters and the degree of process automation before the process is ready for transfer to the industrial scale plant the following activities have to be completed adaptation of the laboratory process to the constraints of a pilot plant hazard and operability haz AP analysis execution of demonstration batches the main differences between laboratory synthesis and industrial scale production as shown in Table four in case of cGMP fine chemicals also a process validation is required it consists of the three elements process design process qualification and continued process verification process optimization once a new chemical process has been introduced successfully on an industrial scale process optimization is called upon to improve the economics as a rule of thumb it should be attempted to reduce the costs of goods sold cogs by 10 to 20 percent every time the yearly production quantity has doubled the task extends from fine-tuning the currently used synthetic method all the way to the search for an entirely different second-generation process specific provisions of the increase of overall yield the reduction of the number of steps raw material cost solvent catalyst enzyme consumption environmental impact topic project management there are two main sources of new research projects namely ideas originating from the researchers themselves supply push and those coming from customers demand pull ideas for new processes typically originate from researchers ideas for new products from customers respectively customer contacts particularly in custom manufacturing demand-pull prevails industrial reality the new product committee is the body of choice for evaluating new and monitoring ongoing research activities it has the assignment to evaluate all new product ideas it decides whether a new product ideas should be taken up in research reassesses a project at regular intervals and last but not least decides also about the abandonment of a project once it becomes evident that the objectives cannot be reached in a typical project the overall responsibility for the economic and technical success lies with the project champion he is assisted by the project manager who is responsible for the technical success in custom manufacturing a typical project starts with the acceptance of the product idea which originates mainly from business development buy the new product committee followed by the preparation of a laboratory process and ends with the successful completion of demonstration runs on industrial scale in the signature of a multi-year supply contract respectively the input from the customer is contained in the technology package its main constituents are one reaction scheme to target of project and deliverables product quantity required dates specifications three lists of analytical methods for process development opportunities stepwise assessment 5 list of required reports 6 safety Health and Environment XI issues 7 materials to be supplied by customer and 8 packaging and shipping information the technical part of a project usually determines its duration depending on the quality of the information contained in the technology package received from the customer and the complexity of the project as such particularly the number of steps that have to be performed it can be anytime between 12 and 24 months depending on the number of researchers involved the total budget easily amounts to several million US dollars Topic markets fine chemicals are used as starting materials for specialty chemicals the latter are obtained either by direct formulation or after chemical biochemical transformation of intermediates to active substances life sciences primarily pharmaceutical agro chemical and food and feed industries are the main consumers of fine chemicals topic market size fine chemicals account for about 4 percent of the universe of chemicals the latter valued at 2,500 billion dollars is dominated mainly by oil gas and mineral derived commodities approximately 40% on one hand and a large variety of specialty chemicals at the interface between industry and the public on the other hand approximately 55% the global production value of fine chemicals is estimated at 85 billion dollars of which about two-thirds or 55 billion dollars are produced captive ly in 30 billion dollars represent the global revenues of the fine chemical industry the corresponding figures for the major user the pharmaceutical industry are thirty two billion dollars in twenty three billion dollars respectively for a number of reasons such as the lack of statistical data in the somewhat equivocal definition it is not possible to exactly determine the size of the fine chemical market in Table five the approximately eighty-five billion dollars fine chemical market is subdivided into major applications according to their relevance namely fine chemicals for pharmaceuticals agro chemicals and specialty chemicals outside life sciences furthermore a distinction is made between captive in-house production and merchant market pharmaceutical fine chemicals PFCs account for two-thirds of the total out of the PFC value of fifty five billion dollars about twenty three billion dollars approximately forty percent are traded and thirty two billion dollars approximately sixty percent are the production value of the pharma industries in-house production within life science products fine chemicals for agro and at a distance for veterinary drugs follow in importance the production value for fine chemicals used for specialty chemicals other than pharmaceuticals and agro chemicals is estimated at fifteen billion dollars as the leading specialty chemical companies Akzo Nobel Dow DuPont ever Nick tempera and Mitsubishi a backward integrated the share of in-house production is estimated at seventy five percent leaving a merchant market of approximately five billion dollars topic target markets topic pharmaceuticals the pharmaceutical industry constitutes the most important customer base for the fine chemical industry see table for the largest companies are Pfizer USA rosh switzerland black so SmithKline UK sanofi-aventis France and Novartis Switzerland all are active in R&D manufacturing and marketing pharmaceuticals containing more than two thousand different active ingredients are in commerce today a sizeable number of them are sourced from the fine chemical industry the industry also has a track record of above-average growth the fine chemical industry has a keen interest in the top-selling or blockbuster drugs ie those with worldwide annual sales in excess of 1 billion dollars their number has increased steadily from 27 in 1999 to 51 in 2001 76 in 2003 and then levelled off sales of the top 20 blockbuster drugs are reported in table 6 the APIs of 12 of them are small lm/w molecules averaging our MW of 477 they have quite complex structures they typically show three cyclic moieties ten of them exhibit at least one n heterocyclic moiety 5 of the top 10 up from none in 2005 our biopharmaceuticals the largest selling non proprietary drugs are paracetamol omeprazole ethanol estradiol amoxicillin pyridoxine and ascorbic acid the innovator pharma companies require mainly custom manufacturing services for their proprietary drug substances the demand is driven primarily by the number of new drug launches the volume requirements and the industries make or buy strategy a summary of the pros and cons for outsourcing from the farmer industry's perspective is given in table 7 as extended studies at the stern Business School of the New York City University have shown financial considerations clearly favored thee by option TAVR and Sandoz are by far the largest generics companies see also chapter 6 three-point-two they differ from their competitors not only in sales revenues but also because they are strongly backwards integrated and have proprietary drugs in their portfolios they also vie for the promising biosimilars market several thousand small or virtual farmer companies focus on R&D albeit on just a few lead compounds they typically originate mostly from academia therefore their R&D strategy is more focused on the elucidation of the biological roots of diseases rather than developing synthesis methods topic agrochemicals agrochemical companies are the second largest users of fine chemicals most products have a pharmaceutical heritage as a consequence of an intensive M&A activity over the past 10 to 20 years the industry now is more consolidated than the pharmaceutical industry the top 10 companies led by Syngenta Switzerland via crop sciences Germany Monsanto USA BASF crop protection Germany and Dow AgroSciences USA have a share of almost 95% of the total 2 million tonnes forty eight point five billion dollars pesticide output in 2010 since the 1990s the R&D effort is focused mainly on gene modified GM seeds at both Monsanto and DuPont seed subsidiary pioneer hi-bred GMC businesses already account for more than 50% of total sales 100 new lm/w agrochemicals have been launched in the period 2000 to 2009 however only eight products achieved sales in excess of 100 million dollars per year generics play a bigger role in the agro than in the pharma industry they represent some 70 percent of the global market China National Chemical Corp aka gem China group is the world's largest supplier of generic farm chemicals Marc Tasha McGann Israel and kam ANOVA denmark follow on the ranks two and three apart from these multi-billion dollar companies there are hundreds of smaller firms with sales of less than fifty million dollars per year mainly in India and China the incidence of the cost of the active ingredient is about 33% ie much higher than in drugs depending on the climatic conditions affecting crop yields consumption and prices of agrochemicals are subject to wide fluctuations from year to year impacting also the suppliers for molecular structures of modern agrochemicals are much more complex than in older products but lower than of their farmer counterparts the average molecular weight of the top 10 is 330 as compared with 477 for the top 10 in comparison to reagents used in pharmaceutical fine chemical syntheses hazardous chemicals eg sodium azide halogens methyl sulfide phosgene phosphorus chlorides are more frequently used agrochemical companies sometimes outsource just these steps which require specialized equipment on toll conversion deals with exception of the pyrethroids which of photostable modifications of naturally occurring pyrethrins active ingredients of agrochemicals rarely a chiral examples within herbicides of the world's long-standing top-selling product Monsanto's Roundup glyphosate Syngenta's cyclohexyl die only type meso trio knee and paraquat dichloride within insecticides the traditional organophosphates like malathion and pyrethroids such as gamma sila turin are being substituted for by neonicotinoids like bay as imidacloprid and Syngenta's fire methoxy manned parasols such as the ASF fipronil florence Anila pralay is the most important representative of du Pont's award-winning Antron Ilic die amide family of broad-spectrum insecticides within fungicides the strobilurin x' a new class are growing rapidly and already have captured more than 30% of the $10,000,000,000 global fungicide market Syngenta's azoxystrobin was the first product launched also BASF SF 500 series AO Pyrrhic lost ribbon and press oxen methyl via crops and Monsanto are developing new compounds in this glass combination pesticides such as Monsanto's January and smart stacks are more and more frequently used topic other specialty chemical industries apart from Life Sciences specialty chemicals and therefore also their active ingredients commodities or fine chemicals as the case may be a used ubiquitously in both industrial applications such as biocides and corrosion inhibitors in cooling water towers and consumer applications such as personal care and household products the active ingredients extend from high price low volume fine chemicals used for liquid crystal displays to large volume low price amino acids used as feed additives asterisk fine chemicals merchant market size growth potential examples of applications in eight areas ranging from adhesives to specialty polymers are listed in table 8 overall the attractiveness for the fine chemical industry is smaller than the life science industry the total market expressed in finished product sales amounts to 150 dollars - 200 billion or about 1/4 of the farmer market the embedded fine chemicals account for an estimated 15 billion dollars see table 5 further disadvantages are the backward integration of the big players eg AkzoNobel Netherlands ajinomoto Japan Dannan France ever light chemical industrial Corp Taiwan ever Nick Degussa Germany Givaudan and Nestle Switzerland Novozymes Denmark Procter & Gamble and Unilever USA last but not least innovation is rather based on new formulations of existing products rather than the development of new fine chemicals it is most likely to happen in application areas unrelated to human health where NCES are subject to very extensive testing topic target products and services global sales of proprietary drugs are estimated seven hundred and thirty five billion dollars in 2010 or almost ninety percent of the total farmer market global sales of generics are about 100 billion dollars or just over 10% of the total farmer market due to the much lower unit price their market share will be close to 30 percent on an API volume volume basis topic custom manufacturing the products and services offered by the fine chemical industry fall into two broad categories one exclusives aka custom manufacturing CM and two standard or catalog products exclusives provided mostly under contract research or custom manufacturing arrangements prevail in business with life science companies standards prevail in other target markets service intense custom manufacturing CM constitutes the most prominent activity of the fine chemical industry CM is the antonym of outsourcing in custom manufacturing our specialty chemicals company outsources the process development pilot plant and finally industrial scale production of an active ingredient or a predecessor thereof to one or a few fine chemical companies the intellectual property of the product and generally also the manufacturing process stay with the customer the customer supplier relationship is governed by an exclusive supply agreement at the beginning of cooperation the customer provides a tech package which in its simplest version includes a laboratory synthesis description and she recommendations in this case the whole scale up which comprises a factor of about 1 million 10-gram 10 ton quantities is done by the fine chemical company topic standard products nonexclusive standard or catalog products constitute the second most important outlet for fine chemicals after custom manufacturing api for generics are the most important subcategory because of patent expiry x' greater than 60 top 200 drugs alone representing aggregated sales of 140 billion dollars are expected to fall into the public domain within by 2015 dot and government incentives global sales of generics are increasing rapidly Asian companies dominate the API for generics business they have the triple advantage of their low cost basis their big home markets and previous manufacturing experience in producing for their domestic and other non regulated markets topic financials topic investment costs investment costs for multipurpose plants are high in comparison with product output however they vary considerably depending on the location size of equipment and degree of sophistication eg automation containment quality of equipment complexity of infrastructure an example for a cgmp multipurpose plant built in the US is shown in table 9 the investment cost of 21 million dollars comprises just the equipment and installation the building property and external services are excluded for comparison purposes the investment cost per cubic meter reactor volume is used in this case it is 0.9 million dollars the amount includes the cost of the reaction vessel itself plus an equitable part of the ancillary equipment like feeding tanks piping pumps and process control if larger or smaller reactors were installed the unit cost per cubic meter would decrease or decrease with the exponent 0.5 respectively hence by increasing the equipment size manufacturing costs on a per kilogram kilogram minus 1 basis typically decrease substantially also costs for a plant that is used for the production of non-regulated intermediates only would be substantially lower pharma companies tend to spend up to 10 times more for a plant with the same capacity in contrast investment costs in developing countries particularly in India or China are considerably lower topic manufacturing costs the raw material consumption and the conversion costs other two elements that establish the manufacturing cost for a particular fine chemical the former is determined primarily by the unit consumption and the purchasing cost of the materials used the latter by the throughput in kilograms per day in a given production Bay a precise calculation of the conversion cost is a demanding task different products with widely differing throughputs are produced in campaigns in multi-purpose plants occupying the equipment to different extents therefore both the production capacity in the equipment utilization for a specific fine chemical are difficult to determine moreover cost elements such as labor capital utilities maintenance waste disposal and quality control cannot be allocated unambiguously an approximative calculation can be done by an experienced process development or pilot plant chemist on the basis of one the laboratory synthesis procedure in two by breaking down the process into unit operations the standard costs of which have been determined previously controlling has to be involved for a more in-depth costing the problems it has to address a how to fairly allocate costs for production capacity which is not used this can be due to the fact that part of a production bay is idle because of lack of demand or because eg a reactor is not required for a particular process manufacturing costs usually are reported on a per kilogram product basis for the purpose of benchmarking both internal and external the volume x time output VTO as mentioned above is a useful aid an indicative cost structure for a fine chemical company is shown in table 10 nowadays a full 7 day per week operation consisting of four or five shift teams each working 8h per day has become the standard in terms of production costs this is the most advantageous scheme higher salaries for night work are more than offset by better fixed cost absorption as part of the budgeting process standard costs for a production campaign of a particular fie chemical are determined on the basis of past experience the actual results of the campaign are then compared with the standard the capability of a fine chemical company to make dependable manufacturing cost forecasts is a distinct competitive advantage topic profitability the fine chemical industry has undergone several boom and bust phases during its almost 30 years of existence the biggest boom took place in the late 1990s when high dosage high volume anti AIDS drugs and cox-2 inhibitors gave a big boost to custom manufacturing after the end of the irrational exuberance in 2000 the industry suffered a first bust in 2003 as a result of capacity expansions the advent of Asian competitors in a ruinous M&A activity several billion dollars of shareholder value were destroyed the most recent minor boom is associated with stockpiling of black so Smith blinds Relenza zanamivir and Russia's Tamiflu assault am Evo phosphate by many countries in order to prepare for a possible avian flu epidemic surprisingly the main cause for the 2009 slump had not been the general recession but slowdowns of the growth and even more so inventory adjustments by the pharma industry they resulted in postponements or cancellations of orders the unfavorable development was in sharp contrast to the very optimistic growth forecasts which many fine chemical companies had announced they had been based on equally promising sector reports from investment banks which in turn had evolved from forward projections of the preceding boom period in most cases these projections have been missed by a large margin at the end of the irrational exuberance at the turn of the millennium and again in 2009 almost half of the industry achieved a return on sales raus of more than 10 percent in less than 10% in Ross below 5% in the worst years 2003 in 2009 almost half of the companies suffered from in Ross of less than 5% whereas during the period under of 2000 to 2009 the average EBITDA sales and EBIT sales ratios of representative companies rest divisions were fifteen percent and seven and a half percent respectively in the period 2000 to 2009 the numbers were twenty percent in ten to thirteen percent in the boom and ten percent and 5 percent in the bust phases the factor - between the high and low numbers reflects the volatility of the industry's profitability all in all the average Western fine chemical firms have been making a return below the cost of capital ie they are not reinvestment grade topic outlook two main trends impinge on the industry on the supply side biotechnology is rapidly gaining importance in the synthesis of small molecule fine chemicals the use of bio catalysts and microbial fermentation enabled both a more sustainable in economic production than conventional organic chemistry in the synthesis of big molecules such as bio pharmaceuticals it is the method of choice biopharmaceuticals are expected to grow 15% per year three times as fast as small molecule drugs five of the top 10 drugs were biopharmaceuticals in 2010 see table 6 and this is expected to grow to 8 by 2016 see table 2 on the demand side the main customer base for fine chemicals the pharmaceutical industry is faced with slow growth of demand patent expirations of many lucrative blockbuster drugs and stalling new product launches in order to restrain these challenges the leading companies are implementing restructuring programs they comprise a reduction of in-house chemical manufacturing and plant eliminations outsourcing is moving up from a purely opportunistic to a strategic approach it is difficult to make a judgement whether the positive or negative effects of these initiatives will prevail in a worst-case scenario the condition could develop whereby even top tier mid-sized family-owned fine chemical companies with state-of-the-art plants and processes could be relegated to producing small quantities of fine chemicals for new life science products in late stage of development in a grow fine chemicals the active ingredients become more sophisticated and performing therefore they require multi purpose instead of dedicated plants prevailing in the industry so far at the same token outsourcing is gaining ground globalization results in a shift of fine chemical production from the industrialized to developing countries the latter benefit not only from a low-cost high-skill advantage but also from a rapidly rising domestic demand for Western medicine despite the mantras of Western industry leaders the cost advantage of the Asian producers is going to persist as the farm emerging countries mainly use generics their market share continues to grow to the detriment of originator pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals this is also the case for biosimilars the generic versions of biopharmaceuticals as a consequence of the harsh business climate many Western fine chemical companies or divisions created during the irrational exuberance at the end of the 20th century already have exited from the sector others will follow suit or will be acquired by private equity firms survival strategies include implementation of lean production principles originally developed by the automotive industry and extending the business model to include also contract research at the beginning and active drug formulation towards the end of the added value chain this latter strategy however is not finding unanimous approval by industry experts although the demand for fine chemicals on the merchant market has not grown to the extent originally anticipated fine chemicals still provide attractive opportunities for well-run companies which are fostering the critical success factors namely running fine chemicals as a core business pursuing niche technologies primarily biotechnology and taking advantage of the opportunities offered by the Asian market topic bibliography Pollock Peter 2011 fine chemicals the industry and the business second rev edy J Wiley & Sons
