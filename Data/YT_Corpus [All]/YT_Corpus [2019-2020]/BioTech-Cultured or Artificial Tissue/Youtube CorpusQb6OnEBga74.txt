 cloning is the process of producing genetically identical individuals of an organism either naturally or artificially in nature many organisms produce clones through asexual reproduction cloning in biotechnology refers to the process of creating clones of organisms or copies of cells or DNA fragments Molecular cloning beyond biology the term refers to the production of multiple copies of digital media or software the term clone invented by JBS Haldane is derived from the ancient Greek word con con twig referring to the process whereby a new plant can be created from a twig in botany the term lusus was traditionally used in horticulture the spelling clone was used until the 20th century the final II came into use to indicate the vowel as a long o instead of a short o since the term entered the popular lexicon in a more general context the spelling clone has been used exclusively you topic natural cloning cloning is a natural form of reproduction that has allowed life-forms to spread for hundreds of millions of years it is the reproduction method used by plants fungi and bacteria and is also the way that clonal colonies reproduce themselves examples of these organisms include blueberry plants hazel trees the pondok trees the kentucky coffee tree miracles and the american sweet gum you topic molecular cloning molecular cloning refers to the process of making multiple molecules cloning is commonly used to amplify DNA fragments containing whole genes but it can also be used to amplify any DNA sequence such as promoters non-coding sequences and randomly fragmented DNA it is used in a wide array of biological experiments and practical applications ranging from genetic fingerprinting to large-scale protein production occasionally the term cloning is misleadingly used to refer to the identification of the chromosomal location of a gene associated with a particular phenotype of interest such as in positional cloning in practice localization of the gene to a chromosome or genomic region does not necessarily enable one to isolate or amplify the relevant genomic sequence to amplify any DNA sequence in a living organism that sequence must be linked to an origin of replication which is a sequence of DNA capable of directing the propagation of itself in any linked sequence however a number of other features are needed and a variety of specialized cloning vectors small piece of DNA into which a foreign DNA fragment can be inserted exist that allow protein production affinity tagging single-stranded RNA or DNA production and a host of other molecular biology tools cloning of any DNA fragment essentially involves four steps fragmentation breaking a part of strand of DNA ligation gluing together pieces of DNA in a desired sequence transfection inserting the newly formed pieces of DNA into cells screening selection selecting out the cells that were successfully transfected with the new dnal though these steps are invariable among cloning procedures a number of alternative routes can be selected these are summarized as a cloning strategy initially the DNA of interest needs to be isolated to provide a DNA segment of suitable size subsequently a ligation procedure is used where the amplified fragment is inserted into a vector piece of DNA the vector which is frequently circular is linearis using restriction enzymes and incubated with the fragment of interest under appropriate conditions with an enzyme called DNA ligase following ligation the vector with the insert of interest is transfected into cells a number of alternative techniques are available such as chemical sensitive ation of cells electroporation optical injection and bio listings the transfected cells are cultured as the aforementioned procedures are of particularly low efficiency there is a need to identify the cells that have been successfully transferred with the vector construct containing the desired insertion sequence in the required orientation modern cloning vectors include selectable antibiotic resistance markers which allow only cells in which the vector has been transferred to grow additionally the cloning vectors may contain color selection markers which provide blue white screening alpha factor complementation on x-gal medium nevertheless these selection steps do not absolutely guarantee that the DNA insert is present in the cells obtained further investigation of the resulting colonies must be required to confirm that cloning was successful this may be accomplished by means of PCR restriction fragment analysis and/or DNA sequencing you topic cell cloning you topic cloning unicellular organisms cloning a cell means to derive a population of cells from a single cell in the case of unicellular organisms such as bacteria and yeast this process is remarkably simple and essentially only requires the inoculation of the appropriate medium however in the case of cell cultures from multicellular organisms cell cloning is an arduous task as these cells will not readily grow in standard media a useful tissue culture technique used to clone distinct lineages of cell lines involves the use of cloning rings cylinders in this technique a single cell suspension of cells that have been exposed to a mutagenic agent or drug used to drive selection is plated at high dilution to create isolated colonies each arising from a single and potentially clonal distinct cell at an early growth stage when colonies consist of only a few cells sterile polystyrene rings cloning rings which have been dipped in grease are placed over an individual colony and a small amount of trypsin is added clone cells are collected from inside the ring and transferred to a new vessel for further growth topic cloning stem cells somatic cell nuclear transfer known as SC NT can also be used to create embryos for research or therapeutic purposes the most likely purpose for this is to produce embryos for use in stem cell research this process is also called research cloning or therapeutic cloning the goal is not to create cloned human beings called reproductive cloning but rather to harvest stem cells that can be used to study human development and to potentially treat disease while a clonal human blastocyst has been created stem cell lines are yet to be isolated from a clonal source therapeutic cloning is achieved by creating embryonic stem cells in the hopes of treating diseases such as diabetes and Alzheimer's the process begins by removing the nucleus containing the DNA from an egg cell and inserting a nucleus from the adult cell to be cloned in the case of someone with Alzheimer's disease the nucleus from a skin cell of that patient is placed into an empty egg the reprogrammed cell begins to develop into an embryo because the egg reacts with the transferred nucleus the embryo will become genetically identical to the patient the embryo will then form a blastocyst which has the potential to form become any cell in the body the reason why a CNT is used for cloning is because somatic cells can be easily acquired and cultured in the lab this process can either add or delete specific genomes of farm animals a key point to remember as that cloning is achieved when the OSI Taine's its normal functions and instead of using sperm and egg genomes to replicate the OA site is inserted into the donors somatic cell nucleus the OE site will react on the somatic cell nucleus the same way it would on sperm cells the process of cloning a particular farm animal using SC NT is relatively the same for all animals the first step is to collect the somatic cells from the animal that will be cloned the somatic cells could be used immediately or stored in the laboratory for later use the hardest part of SC NT is removing maternal DNA from an OA site at metaphase - once this has been done the somatic nucleus can be inserted into an egg cytoplasm this creates a one cell embryo the grouped somatic cell an egg cytoplasm are then introduced to an electrical current this energy will hopefully allow the cloned embryo to begin development the successfully developed embryos are then placed in surrogate recipients such as a cow or sheep in the case of farm animals SC NT is seen as a good method for producing agriculture animals for food consumption it's successfully cloned sheep cattle goats and pigs another benefit as SC NT is seen as a solution to clone endangered species that are on the verge of going extinct however stress is placed on both the egg cell and the introduced nucleus can be enormous which led to a high loss in resulting cells in early research for example the cloned sheep Dolly was born after 277 eggs were used for SC NT which created 29 viable embryos only three of these embryos survived until birth and only one survived to adulthood as the procedure could not be automated and had to be performed manually under a microscope SC NT was very resource intensive the biochemistry involved in reprogramming the differentiated somatic cell nucleus and activating the recipient egg was also far from being well understood however by 2014 researchers were reporting cloning success rates of seven to eight out of ten and in 2016 a Korean company soem biotech was reported to be producing 500 cloned embryos per day in SC NT not all of the donor cells genetic information is transferred as the donor cells mitochondria that contained their own mitochondrial DNA are left behind the resulting hybrid cells retain those mitochondrial structures which originally belonged to the egg as a consequence clones such as Dali that are born from SC NT are not perfect copies of the donor of the nucleus you you topic organism cloning organism cloning also called reproductive cloning refers to the procedure of creating a new multicellular organism genetically identical to another in essence this form of cloning is an asexual method of reproduction where fertilization or inter gamete contact does not take place asexual reproduction is a naturally occurring phenomenon in many species including most plants and some insects scientists have made some major achievements with cloning including the asexual reproduction of sheep and cows there is a lot of ethical debate over whether or not cloning should be used however cloning or asexual propagation has been common practice in the horticultural world for hundreds of years you topic Horticultural the term clone is used in horticulture to refer to descendents of a single plant which were produced by vegetative reproduction or a pea mixes many horticultural plant cultivars are clones having been derived from a single individual multiplied by some process other than sexual reproduction as an example some European cultivars of grapes represent clones that have been propagated for over two millennia other examples are potato and banana grafting can be regarded as cloning since all the chutes and branches coming from the graft are genetically a clone of a single individual but this particular kind of cloning has not come under ethical scrutiny and is generally treated as an entirely different kind of operation many trees shrubs vines ferns and other herbaceous perennials form clonal colonies naturally parts of an individual plant may become detached by fragmentation and grow on to become separate clonal individuals a common example is in the vegetative reproduction of moss and liver where gametophyte clones by means of gem a some vascular plants eg dandelion and certain viviparous grasses also form seeds a sexually term DAPA mixes resulting in clonal populations of genetically identical individuals topic parthenogenesis clonal derivation exists in nature in some animal species and is referred to as parthenogenesis reproduction of an organism by itself without a mate this is an asexual form of reproduction that is only found in females of some insects crustaceans nematodes fish for example the hammerhead shark the Komodo dragon and lizards the growth and development occurs without fertilization by a male in plants parthenogenesis means the development of an embryo from an unfertilized egg cell and is a component process of a Pyxis in species that use the XY sex determination system the offspring will always be female an example is the little fire ant wasps Mannie aura Punk Tata which is native to Central and South America but has spread throughout many tropical environments topic artificial cloning of organisms artificial cloning of organisms may also be called reproductive cloning topic first steps honks femin a german embryologist was awarded a Nobel Prize in Physiology or medicine in 1935 for his discovery of the effect now known as embryonic induction exercised by various parts of the embryo that directs the development of groups of cells into particular tissues and organs in 1928 he and his student Hilde Mangold were the first to perform somatic cell nuclear transfer using amphibian embryos one of the first steps towards cloning topic methods reproductive cloning generally uses somatic cell nuclear transfer SCM T to create animals that are genetically identical this process entails the transfer of a nucleus from a donor adult cell somatic cell to an egg from which the nucleus has been removed or to a cell from a blastocyst from which the nucleus has been removed if the egg begins to divide normally it is transferred into the uterus of the surrogate mother such clones are not strictly identical since the somatic cells may contain mutations in their nuclear DNA additionally the mitochondria in the cytoplasm also contains DNA and during SC NT this mitochondrial DNA is wholly from the cytoplasmic donors egg thus the mitochondrial genome is not the same as that of the nucleus donor cell from which it was produced this may have important implications for cross species nuclear transfer in which nuclear mitochondrial incompatibilities may lead to death artificial embryo splitting or embryo twinning a technique that creates monozygotic twins from a single embryo is not considered in the same fashion as other methods of cloning during that procedure a donor embryo is split in two distinct embryos that can then be transferred via embryo transfer it is optimally performed at the six to eight cell stage where it can be used as an expansion of IVF to increase the number of available embryos if both embryos are successful it gives rise to monozygotic identical twins topic Dolly the sheep dollie a Finn Dorset you was the first mammal to have been successfully cloned from an adult somatic cell Dolly was formed by taking a cell from the utter of her six year old biological mother Dolly's embryo was created by taking the cell and inserting it into a sheep ovum it took 434 attempts before an embryo was successful the embryo was then placed inside a female sheep that went through a normal pregnancy she was cloned at the Roslin Institute in Scotland by British scientist Sir Ian wilmut and keith campbell and lived there from her birth in 1996 until her death in 2003 when she was 6 she was born on the 5th of july 1996 but not announced to the world until the 22nd of february 1997 her stuffed remains were placed at edinburgh oil museum part of the national museums of scotland dolly was publicly significant because the effort showed that genetic material from a specific adult cell programmed to express only a distinct subset of its genes can be reprogrammed to grow an entirely new organism before this demonstration it had been shown by John Gordon that nuclei from differentiated cells could give rise to an entire organism after transplantation into an enucleated egg however this concept was not yet demonstrated in a mammalian system the first mammalian cloning resulting in Dolly the sheep had a success rate of 29 embryos per 277 fertilized eggs which produced three Lambs at birth one of which lived in a bovine experiment involving 70 cloned calves one third of the calves died young the first successfully cloned horse prompt II took 814 attempts notably although the first clones were frogs no adult cloned frog has yet been produced from a somatic adult nucleus donor cell there were early claims that Dolly the sheep had pathologies resembling accelerated aging scientists speculated that Dolly's death in 2003 was related to the shortening of telomeres DNA protein complexes that protect the end of linear chromosomes however other researchers including Ian wilmut who led the team that successfully cloned Dolly argued that Dolly's early death due to respiratory infection was unrelated to deficiencies with the cloning process this idea that the nuclei have not irreversibly aged was shown in 2013 to be true for mice Dolly was named after performer Dolly Parton because the cells cloned to make her were from a mammary gland cell and Parton is known for her ample cleavage topic species cloned the modern cloning techniques involving nuclear transfer have been successfully performed on several species notable experiments include tadpole 1952 Robert Briggs and Thomas J King had successfully cloned northern leopard frogs 35 complete embryos and 27 tadpoles from 104 successful nuclear transfers carp 1963 in China embryologist tong d jo produced the world's first cloned fish by inserting the DNA from a cell of a male carp into an egg from a female carp he published the findings in a Chinese science journal mice 1986 a mouse was successfully cloned from an early embryonic cell Soviet scientists chaley Qian the print czev ver diva and Niketan had the mouse Masha cloned research was published in the magazine by physique a' volume 2 issue 5 of 1987 sheep marked the first mammal being cloned 1984 from early embryonic cells by steam Willardson Megan and more egg cloned from differentiated embryonic cells in June 1995 and Dolly the sheep from a somatic cell in 1996 rhesus monkey tetra January 2000 from embryo splitting and not nuclear transfer more akin to artificial formation of twins Pig the first cloned pigs March 2000 by 2014 BGI in China was producing 500 cloned pigs a year to test new medicines gower 2001 was the first endangered species cloned cattle alpha and beta males 2001 and 2005 brazil cat copy cat CC female late 2001 Little Nicky 2004 was the first cat cloned for commercial reasons rat Ralph the first cloned rat 2003 mule Idaho gem a John mule the 4th of May 2003 was the first horse family clone horse Prohm T 1/2 linger female born the 28th of May 2003 was the first horse clone dog Snuppy a male Afghan hound was the first cloned dog 2005 wolf snow wolf and Snoopy the first two cloned female wolves 2005 water buffalo Sam Roopa was the first cloned water buffalo it was born on the 6th of February 2009 at India's carnal national diary Research Institute but died five days later due to lung infection Pyrenean ibex 2009 was the first extinct animal to be cloned back to life the clone lived for seven minutes before dying of lung defects camel 2009 in jazz is the first cloned camel pashmina goat 2012 nuri is the first cloned pashmina goat scientists at the Faculty of veterinary sciences and animal husbandry of sherry cashmere university of agricultural sciences and technology of cashmere successfully cloned the first pashmina goat nuri using the Advanced reproductive techniques under the leadership of Ria's ahmad shah goat 2001 scientists of northwest a and F university successfully cloned the first goat which used the adult female cell gastric brooding frog 2013 the gastric brooding frog real butt track is Silas thought to have been extinct since 1983 was cloned in Australia although the embryos died after a few days macaque monkey 2017 first successful cloning of a primate species using nuclear transfer with the birth of to live clones named Zhang Zhang and wah wah conducted in China in 2017 and reported in January 2018 in January 2019 scientists in China reported the creation of five identical clone gene edited monkeys using the same cloning technique that was used with Zhang Zhang and wah wah the first-ever cloned monkeys and Dolly the sheep and the same gene editing CRISPR cas9 technique allegedly used by hee Jun GUI in creating the first-ever gene modified human babies Lulu and Nana the monkey clones were made in order to study several medical diseases you topic human cloning you human cloning is the creation of a genetically identical copy of a human the term is generally used to refer to artificial human cloning which is the reproduction of human cells and tissues it does not refer to the natural conception and delivery of identical twins the possibility of human cloning has raised controversies these ethical concerns have prompted several nations to pass legislation regarding human cloning and its legality as of right now scientists have no intention of trying to clone people and they believe their results should spark a wider discussion about the laws and regulations the world needs to regulate cloning two commonly discussed types of theoretical human cloning or therapeutic cloning and reproductive cloning therapeutic cloning would involve cloning cells from a human for use in medicine and transplants and as an active area of research but is not in medical practice anywhere in the world as of 2014 two common methods of therapeutic cloning that are being researched are somatic cell nuclear transfer and more recently pluripotent stem cell induction reproductive cloning would involve making an entire cloned human instead of just specific cells or tissues topic ethical issues of cloning there are a variety of ethical positions regarding the possibilities of cloning especially human cloning while many of these views are religious in origin the questions raised by cloning are faced by secular perspectives as well perspectives on human cloning are theoretical as human therapeutic and reproductive cloning are not commercially used animals are currently cloned in laboratories and in livestock production advocates support development of therapeutic cloning in order to generate tissues and whole organs to treat patients who otherwise cannot obtain transplants to avoid the need for immunosuppressive drugs and to stave off the effects of aging advocates for reproductive cloning believe that parents who cannot otherwise procreate should have access to the technology opponents of cloning have concerns that technology has not yet developed enough to be safe and that it could be prone to abuse leading to the generation of humans from whom organs and tissues would be harvested as well as concerns about how cloned individuals could integrate with families and with society at large religious groups are divided with some opposing the technology as usurping God's place and to the extent embryos are used destroying a human life others support therapeutic cloning potential life-saving benefits cloning of animals as opposed by animal groups due to the number of cloned animals that suffer from malformations before they die and while food from cloned animals has been approved by the US FDA its uses opposed by groups concerned about food safety topic cloning extinct and endangered species cloning or more precisely the reconstruction of functional DNA from extinct species has for decades been a dream possible implications of this were dramatized in the 1984 novel karna soar in the 1990 novel Jurassic Park the best current cloning techniques have an average success rate of nine point four percent and as high as twenty five percent when working with familiar species such as mice while cloning wild animals is usually less than one percent successful several tissue banks have come into existence including the frozen zoo at the San Diego Zoo to store frozen tissue from the world's rarest and most endangered species in 2001 a cow named Bessie gave birth to a cloned Asian Gower an endangered species but the calf died after two days in 2003 a Banting was successfully cloned followed by three African Wildcats from a thawed frozen embryo these successes provided hope that similar techniques using surrogate mothers of another species might be used to clone extinct species anticipating this possibility tissue samples from the last bucardo Pyrenean ibex were frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately after it died in 2000 researchers are also considering cloning endangered species such as the giant panda and cheetah in 2002 geneticists at the australian museum announced that they had replicated DNA of the thylacine tasmanian tiger at the time extinct for about 65 years using polymerase chain reaction however on the 15th of February 2005 the museum announced that it was stopping the project after tests showed the specimens DNA had been too badly degraded by the ethanol preservative on the 15th of May 2005 it was announced that the thylacine project would be revived with new participation from researchers in New South Wales and Victoria in 2003 for the first time an extinct animal the Pyrenean ibex mentioned above was cloned at the centre of food technology and research of Eragon using the preserved frozen cell nucleus of the skin samples from 2001 domestic goat egg sells the ibex died shortly after birth due to physical defects in its lungs one of the most anticipated targets for cloning was once the woolly mammoth but attempts to extract DNA from frozen mammoths have been unsuccessful though a joint russo-japanese team is currently working toward this goal in January 2011 it was reported by yomiuri shimbun that a team of scientists headed by akira IRRI Thani of Kyoto University had built upon research by dr. Wakayama saying that they will extract DNA from a mammoth carcass that had been preserved in a Russian laboratory and inserted into the egg cells of an African elephant in hopes of producing a mammoth embryo the researchers said they hoped to produce a baby mammoth within six years it was noted however that the result if possible would be an elephant mammoth hybrid rather than a true mammoth another problem as the survival of the reconstructed mammoth ruminants rely on a symbiosis with specific microbiota in their stomachs for digestion scientists at the University of Newcastle and University of New South Wales announced in March 2013 that the very recently extinct gastric brooding frog would be the subject of a cloning attempt to resurrect the species many such de-extinction projects are described in the long now foundation z' revive and restore project topic lifespan after an eight year project involving the use of a pioneering cloning technique Japanese researchers created 25 generations of healthy cloned mice with normal lifespans demonstrating that clones are not intrinsically shorter-lived than naturally born animals other sources have noted that the offspring of clones tend to be healthier than the original clones and indistinguishable from animals produced naturally Dolly the sheep was cloned from a six year old cell sample from a mammary gland because of this some posited she may have aged more quickly than other naturally born animals as she died relatively early for a sheep at the age of six ultimately her death was attributed to a respiratory illness enough advanced aging the areas disputed a detailed study released in 2016 and less detailed studies by others suggest that once cloned animals get past the first month or two of life they are generally healthy however early pregnancy loss and neonatal losses are still greater with cloning the natural conception or assisted reproduction IVF current research is attempting to overcome these problems topic in popular culture discussion of cloning in the popular media often presents the subject negatively in an article in the 8th of November 1993 article of time cloning was portrayed in a negative way modifying Michelangelo's Creation of Adam to depict Adam with five identical hands Newsweek's the 10th of March 1997 issue also critiqued the ethics of human cloning and included a graphic depicting identical babies and beakers the concept of cloning particularly human cloning has featured a wide variety of science fiction works an early fictional depiction of cloning is bacon off Sookie's process which features in Aldous Huxley's 1931 dystopian novel brave new world the process is applied to fertilized human eggs in vitro causing them to split into identical genetic copies of the original following renewed interest in cloning in the 1950s the subject was explored further in works such as Poole Anderson's 1953 story un Mann which describes a technology called EXO Genesis and Gordon Rattray Taylor's book the biological time bomb which popularized the term cloning in 1963 cloning is a recurring theme in a number of contemporary science fiction films ranging from action films such as Jurassic Park 1993 Alien Resurrection 1997 the sixth day 2000 Resident Evil 2002 Star Wars Episode 2 2002 in the island 2005 two comedies such as Woody Allen's 1973 film sleeper the process of cloning is represented variously in fiction many works depict the artificial creation of humans by a method of growing cells from a tissue or DNA sample the replication may be instantaneous or take place through slow growth of human embryos in artificial wounds in the long-running British television series Doctor Who the Fourth Doctor and his companion Leela were cloned in a matter of seconds from DNA samples the invisible enemy 1977 and then in an apparent homage to the 1966 film Fantastic Voyage shrunk to microscopic size in order to enter the doctor's body to combat an alien virus the clones in this story are short-lived and can only survive a matter of minutes before they expire science fiction films such as The Matrix and Star Wars Episode two attack of the clones have featured scenes of human fetuses being cultured on an industrial scale in mechanical tanks cloning humans from body parts is also a common theme in science fiction cloning features strongly among the science fiction conventions parodied in Woody Allen's sleeper the plot of which centers around an attempt to clone an assassinated dictator from his disembodied nose in the 2008 Doctor Who story journey's end a duplicate version of the Tenth Doctor spontaneously grows from his severed hand which had been cut off in a sword fight during an earlier episode after the death of her beloved fourteen-year-old coton de Tulear named Samantha in late 2017 barbra streisand announced that she had cloned the dog and was now waiting for the two cloned pups to get older so she can see if they have Samantha's brown eyes and her seriousness the operation cost $50,000 through the pet cloning company vegan topic cloning and identity science fiction has used cloning most commonly and specifically human cloning to raise the controversial questions of identity a number as a 2002 play by English playwright Carol Churchill which addresses the subject of human cloning and identity especially nature and nurture the story said in the near future is structured around the conflict between a father solder and his sons Bernard one Bernard two and Michael black two of whom are clones of the first one a number was adapted by Caryl Churchill for television in a co-production between the BBC and HBO films in 2012 a Japanese television series named bündchen was created the story's main character ma Rico is a woman studying child welfare in Hokkaido she grew up always doubtful about the love from her mother who looked nothing like her and who died nine years before one day she finds some of her mother's belongings at a relative's house and heads to Tokyo to seek out the truth behind her birth she later discovered that she was a clone in the 2013 television series orphan black cloning is used as a scientific study on the behavioural adaptation of the clones in a similar vein the book the double by Nobel Prize winner josé Saramago explores the emotional experience of a man who discovers that he is a clone you topic cloning as resurrection cloning has been used in fiction as a way of recreating historical figures in the 1976 Ira Levin novel the boys from Brazil and its 1978 film adaptation Josef Mengele uses cloning to create copies of Adolf Hitler in Michael Crichton's 1990 novel Jurassic Park which spawned a series of Jurassic Park feature films a bioengineering company develops a technique to resurrect extinct species of dinosaurs by creating cloned creatures using DNA extracted from fossils the cloned dinosaurs are used to populate the Jurassic Park wildlife park for the entertainment of visitors the scheme goes disastrously wrong when the dinosaurs escaped their enclosures despite being selectively cloned as females to prevent them from breeding the dinosaurs developed the ability to reproduce through parthenogenesis topic cloning for warfare you the use of cloning for military purposes has also been explored in several fictional works in Doctor Who an alien race of armor-clad warlike beings called Sontarans was introduced in the 1973 serial the time warrior Sontarans are depicted as squat bald creatures who have been genetically engineered for combat their weak spot as a probic vent a small socket at the back of their neck which is associated with the cloning process the concept of clone soldiers being bred for combat was revisited in the doctor's daughter 2008 when the doctors DNA is used to create a female warrior called Jenny the 1977 film Star Wars was set against the backdrop of a historical conflict called the Clone Wars the events of this war were not fully explored until the prequel films Attack of the Clones 2002 and Revenge of the Sith 2005 which depict a space war waged by a massive army of heavily armored clone troopers that leads to the foundation of the Galactic Empire clone soldiers are manufactured on an industrial scale genetically conditioned for obedience and combat effectiveness it is also revealed that the popular character boba fett originated as a clone of Jango Fett a mercenary who served as the genetic template for the clone troopers topic cloning for exploitation a recurring sub-theme of cloning fiction as the use of clones as a supply of organs for transplantation the 2005 Kazuo Ishiguro novel never let me go and the 2010 film adaption are set in an alternate history in which cloned humans are created for the sole purpose of providing organ donations to naturally born humans despite the fact that they are fully sentient and self-aware the 2005 film the island revolves around a similar plot with the exception that the clones are unaware of the reason for their existence the exploitation of human clones for dangerous and undesirable work was examined in the 2009 British science fiction film moon in the futuristic novel Cloud Atlas and subsequent film one of the storylines focuses on the genetically engineered fabric and clone named Sunmi approximately 450 won one of millions raised in an artificial womb' tank destined to serve from birth she is one of thousands created for manual and emotional labour sonmi herself works as a server in a restaurant she later discovers that the sole source of food for clones called soap is manufactured from the clones themselves topic see also the President's Council on bioethics the frozen ark
