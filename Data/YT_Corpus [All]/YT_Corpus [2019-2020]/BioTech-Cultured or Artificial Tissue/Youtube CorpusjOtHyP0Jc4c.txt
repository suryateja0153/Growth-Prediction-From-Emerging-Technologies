 Algie singular alga is an informal term for a large diverse group of photosynthetic eukaryotic organisms that are not necessarily closely related and as thus polyphyletic including organisms ranging from unicellular microalgae genera such as chlorella and the diatoms to multicellular forms such as the giant kelp a large brown alga which may grow up to 50 meters in length most are aquatic and autotrophic and lack many of the distinct cell and tissue types such as stomata xylem and phloem which are found in land plants the largest and most complex marine algae are called seaweeds while the most complex freshwater forms are the care of a de a division of green algae which includes for example spirogyra and the Stoneworks no definition of algae as generally accepted one definition is that algae have chlorophyll as their primary photosynthetic pigment and lack a sterile covering of cells around their reproductive cells although cyanobacteria are often referred to as blue-green algae most authorities exclude all prokaryotes from the definition of algae algae constitute a polyphyletic group since they do not include a common ancestor and although their plastics seem to have a single origin from cyanobacteria they were acquired in different ways green algae are examples of algae that have primary chloroplasts derived from endosymbiotic cyanobacteria diatoms and brown algae are examples of algae with secondary chloroplasts derived from an endosymbiotic red alga algae exhibit a wide range of reproductive strategies from simple asexual cell division to complex forms of sexual reproduction algae lack the various structures that characterize land plants such as the phillyd structures of bryophytes rhizoids in nonvascular plants and the roots leaves and other organs found in trachea fights vascular plants most are phototrophic although some are mix atrophic deriving energy both from photosynthesis and uptake of organic carbon either by ozma trophy meisa trophy or Rafi some unicellular species of green algae many golden algae Euglena Dee's dinoflagellates and other algae have become heterotrophs also called colourless or apple or attached algae sometimes parasitic relying entirely on external energy sources and have limited or no photosynthetic apparatus some other heterotrophic organisms such as the apicomplexa ng's are also derived from cells whose ancestors possessed plastids but are not traditionally considered as algae algae have photosynthetic machinery ultimately derived from cyanobacteria that produced oxide as a by-product of photosynthesis unlike other photosynthetic bacteria such as purple and green sulfur bacteria fossilized filamentous algae from the Vindhya basin have been dated back to 1.6 to 1.7 billion years ago topic etymology and study the singular alga as the Latin word for seaweed and retains that meaning in English the etymology as obscure although some speculate that it is related to Latin algier be cold no reason as known to associate seaweed with temperature a more likely source as a lega binding in twining the ancient Greek word for seaweed was ficus Sycho which could mean either the seaweed probably red algae or a red dye derived from it the Latinization fucus meant primarily the cosmetic Rouge the etymology is uncertain but a strong candidate has long been some word related to the biblical Pope poop paint if not that word itself a cosmetic eyeshadow used by the ancient Egyptians and other inhabitants of the eastern Mediterranean it could be any color black red green or blue accordingly the modern study of marine and freshwater algae is called either phycology or algal OG depending on whether the Greek or Latin root is used the name fucus appears in a number of taxa topic classification the algae contain chloroplasts that are similar in structure to cyanobacteria chloroplasts contain circular DNA like that in cyanobacteria and are interpreted as representing reduced endosymbiotic cyanobacteria however the exact origin of the chloroplasts as different among separate lineages of algae reflecting their acquisition during different and those symbiotic events the table below describes the composition of the three major groups of algae their lineage relationships are shown in the figure in the upper right many of these groups contain some members that are no longer photosynthetic some retain plastids but not chloroplasts while others have lost plastids entirely phylogeny based on plastid not nucleo cytoplasmic genealogy Linnaeus in species plantarum 1753 the starting point for modern botanical nomenclature recognized 14 general of algae of which only four are currently considered among algae in Systema naturae Linnaeus described the general Vacco and coralina and a species of acetabular ria as madra pora among the animals in 1768 samuel Gottlieb gamelon 1740 for to 1774 published the historian quorum the first work dedicated to marine algae and the first book on marine biology to use the then-new binomial nomenclature of Linnaeus it included elaborate illustrations of seaweed and marine algae unfolded leaves wh harvey 1811 to 1866 and lamoureux 1813 were the first to divide macroscopic algae into four divisions based on their pigmentation this is the first use of a biochemical criterion in plant systematics Harvey's four divisions are red algae Rhoda sperm a brown algae Milano sperm a green algae cloris Burma and diatom ACI at this time microscopic algae were discovered and reported by a different group of workers EG of' muller and Arenberg studying the infusoria microscopic organisms unlike macro algae which were clearly viewed as plants microalgae were frequently considered animals because they are often modal even the non motile Co coid microalgae were sometimes merely seen as stages of the life cycle of plants macro algae or animals although used as a taxonomic category in some pre-darwinian classifications eg linnaeus 1758 Jesse you 1789 Haruna now 1843 a gases 1859 Wilson and Cass in 1864 in further classifications the algae are seen as an artificial polyphyletic group throughout the 20th century most classifications treated the following groups as divisions or classes of algae scion of fights roto fights cry so fights xanthe effects bissell area fights via fights pura fights Krypto fights and Dyna fights euglena fights and clora fights later many new groups were discovered eg bully defy CA and others were splintered from older groups Kara fights and glocca fights from clora fights many hetero canta fights eg senora fights from crisis fights or you stigmata fights from xantho fights HAP - fights from cry so fights and chloracne o fights from xantho fights with the abandonment of plant animal dichotomous classification most groups of algae sometimes all were included in Protista later also abandoned in favor of eukaryota however as a legacy of the older plant life scheme some groups that were also treated as protozoans in the past still have duplicated classifications CMB regional protists some parasitic algae eg the green algae pro 2 theta and helico spore Adium parasites of metazoans or SEF alura's parasites of plants were originally classified as fungi spores Owen's or Protestants of incerti cities while others eg the green algae fillo siphon and Road acai trium parasites of plants or the red algae tarik lady affiliative collects mama lattice parasites of other red algae or the dinoflagellates sudonym parasites of fish had their relationship with algae conjectured early in other cases some groups were originally characterized as parasitic algae eg chloric atrium but later were seen as endo FIDIC algae some filamentous bacteria eg Peggy Ottawa were originally seen as algae furthermore groups like the apicomplexa pne's are also parasites derived from ancestors that possessed plastids but are not included in any group traditionally seen as algae topic relationship to land plants the first land plants probably evolved from shallow freshwater kara fight algae much like Chara almost 500 million years ago these probably had an isomorphic alternation of generations and were probably filamentous fossils of isolated land plant spores suggest land plants may have been around as long as 475 million years ago topic morphology a range of algal morphologies as exhibited and convergence of features in unrelated groups as common the only groups to exhibit three-dimensional multicellular thali are the reds and browns and some chlorophyta apical growth is constrained to subsets of these groups the flora D of fight breads various Browns and the kara fights the form of Kara fights is quite different from those of reds and browns because they have distinct nodes separated by internode stems whirls of branches reminiscent of the horse tails occur at the nodes consept achill czar another polyphyletic trait they appear in the coralline algae and the Hilden brandy Alice as well as the Browns most of the simpler algae are unicellular flagellates or amoeboid but colonial and non-modal forms have developed independently among several of the groups some of the more common organizational levels more than one of which may occur in the life cycle of a species are colonial small regular groups of modal cells caps oi individual non-modal cells embedded in Musil edge Cocco individual non-modal cells with cell walls Palma Lloyd non-modal cells embedded in Musil edge filamentous a string of non-modal cells connected together sometimes branching parenchyma dhis cells forming a phallus with partial differentiation of tissues and three lines even higher levels of organization have been reached with full tissue differentiation these are the brown algae some of which may reach 50 meters in length helps the red algae and the green algae the most complex forms are found among the kara fight algae see Charles and Kara fighter in a lineage that eventually led to the higher land plants the innovation that defines these non algal plants as the presence of female reproductive organs with protective cell layers that protect the zygote and developing embryo hence the land plants are referred to as the embryo fights topic physiology many algae particularly members of the Shiraishi i have served as model experimental organisms to understand the mechanisms of the water permeability of membranes osmoregulation turgor regulation salt tolerance cytoplasmic streaming and the generation of action potentials phyto hormones are found not only in higher plants but in algae too topic symbiotic algae some species of algae form symbiotic relationships with other organisms in these symbiosis the algae supply photosynthate organic substances to the host organism providing protection to the algal cells the host organism derives some or all of its energy requirements from the algae examples are topic likens lichens are defined by the International Association for legend ology to be an association of a fungus and a photosynthetic Symbian resulting in a stable vegetative body having a specific structure the fungi or my Kobe uns are mainly from the ascomycota with a few from the basidiomycota in nature they do not occur separate from lichens it is unknown when they began to associate one might go beyond associates with the same fico beyond species rarely - from the green algae except that alternatively the Maiko beyond may associate with a species of cyanobacteria hence photo B and is the more accurate term a photo be associated with many different my Cobian soar may live independently accordingly lichens are named and classified as fungal species the Association has termed a morphogenesis because the lichen has a form and capabilities not possessed by the symbionts species alone they can be experimentally isolated the photo bein possibly triggers otherwise latent genes in the Maiko beyond Trento polio as an example of a common green alga genus worldwide that can grow on its own or be lichen eyes lichen thus share some of the habitat and often similar appearance with specialized species of algae aro fights growing on exposed surfaces such as tree trunks and rocks and sometimes discoloring them topic coral reefs coral reefs are accumulated from the calcareous exoskeletons of marine invertebrates of the order Sclerotinia stony corals these animals metabolize sugar and oxygen to obtain energy for their cell building processes including secretion of the exoskeleton with water and carbon dioxide as byproducts dinoflagellates algal protists are often endosymbionts in the cells of the coral forming marine invertebrates where they accelerate host cell metabolism by generating sugar and oxygen immediately available through photosynthesis using incident light and the carbon dioxide produced by the host reef building stony corals hermit epic corals require endosymbiotic algae from the genus symbiodinium to be in a healthy condition the loss of symbiodinium from the host as known as coral bleaching a condition which leads to the deterioration of a reef topic see sponges endosymbiotic green algae live close to the surface of some sponges for example breadcrumb sponges Halleck Andreea panacea the alga is thus protected from predators the sponge is provided with oxygen and sugars which can account for 50 to 80 percent of sponge growth in some species topic lifecycle you Rodo Fida chlorophyta and hetero quantify de the three main algal divisions have life cycles which show considerable variation and complexity in general an asexual phase exists where the seaweeds cells are diploid a sexual phase where the cells are haploid followed by fusion of the male and female gametes asexual reproduction permit sufficient population increases but less variation is possible commonly in sexual reproduction of unicellular and colonial algae two specialized sexually compatible haploid gametes make physical contact and fuse to form a zygote to ensure a successful mating the development and release of gametes is highly synchronized and regulated pheromones may play a key role in these processes sexual reproduction allows for more variation and provides the benefit of efficient recombinational repair of DNA damages during meiosis a key stage of the sexual cycle however sexual reproduction is more costly than asexual reproduction meiosis has been shown to occur in many different species of algae topic numbers the algal collection of the u.s. national herbarium located in the National Museum of Natural History consists of approximately 320 thousand five hundred dried specimens which although not exhaustive no exhaustive collection exists gives an idea of the order of magnitude of the number of algal species that number remains unknown estimates vary widely for example according to one standard textbook in the British Isles the UK biodiversity steering group report estimated there to be 25,000 species regarding the difference of about 15,000 species the text concludes it will require many detailed field surveys before it is possible to provide a reliable estimate of the total number of species regional and group estimates have been made as well 5000 to 5500 species of red algae worldwide some 1,300 in Australian seas 400 seaweed species for the western coastline of South Africa and 212 species from the coast of kwazulu-natal some of these are duplicates as the range extends across both coasts and the total recorded is probably about 500 species most of these are listed in list of seaweeds of South Africa these exclude phytoplankton and crusts escora lines 669 marine species from California u.s. 642 in the checklist of Britain and Ireland on so on but lacking any scientific basis or reliable sources these numbers have no more credibility than the British ones mentioned above most estimates also omit microscopic algae such as phytoplankton the most recent estimate suggests 72,500 algal species worldwide topic distribution the distribution of algal species has been fairly well studied since the founding of phyto geography in the mid 19th century algae spread mainly by the dispersal of spores analogously to the dispersal of plenty by seeds and spores this dispersal can be accomplished by air water or other organisms due to this spores can be found in a variety of environments fresh and marine waters air soil and in or on other organisms whether a spore as to grow into an organism depends on the combination of the species and the environmental conditions where the spore lands the spores of freshwater algae are dispersed mainly by running water and wind as well as by living carriers however not all bodies of water can carry all species of algae as the chemical composition of certain water bodies limits the algae that can survive within them marine spores are often spread by ocean currents ocean water presents many vastly different habitats based on temperature and nutrient availability resulting in phyto Geographic zones regions and provinces to some degree the distribution of algae as subject to floristic discontinuities caused by geographical features such as Antarctica long distances of ocean or general land masses it is therefore possible to identify species occurring by locality such as pacific algae or north sea algae when they occur out of their localities hypothesizing a transport mechanism as usually possible such as the hulls of ships for example Ulva reticulata and u fachada traveled from the mainland to Hawaii in this manner mapping is possible for select species only there are many valid examples of confined distribution patterns for example classroom or foam as an Arctic genus and as not mapped far south of there however scientists regard the overall data as insufficient due to the difficulties of undertaking such studies topic ecology Algie are prominent in bodies of water common in terrestrial environments and are found in unusual environments such as on snow and ice seaweeds grow mostly in shallow marine waters under 100 metres 330 feet deep however some such as navicular Penida have been recorded to a depth of 360 metres 1180 feet the various sorts of algae play significant roles in aquatic ecology microscopic forms that live suspended in the water column phytoplankton provide the food base for most marine food chains in very high densities algal blooms these algae may discolor the water and out-compete poison or asphyxiate other life forms algae can be used as indicator organisms to monitor pollution in various aquatic systems in many cases algal metabolism as sensitive to various pollutants due to this the species composition of algal populations may shift in the presence of chemical pollutants to detect these changes algae can be sampled from the environment and maintained in laboratories with relative ease on the basis of their habitats algae can be categorized as aquatic planktonic benthic marine freshwater lentil low-tech terrestrial aerial subbarao Litha FIDIC Halla FIDIC or your ahey line salmon thermophilic cryo philic epopee and epiphytic epazote endosymbiont endo FIDIC endows oeq parasitic kalsa philic or like anak fico beyond topic cultural associations in classical Chinese the word Zhou is used both for algae and in the modest tradition of the Imperial scholars for literary talent the third island in kunming lake beside the Summer Palace in Beijing is known as the Zhou Jie and Tang Dao which thus simultaneously means island of the algae viewing hall and island of the hall for reflecting on literary talent topic uses topic ager Eggar a gelatinous substance derived from red algae has a number of commercial uses it is a good medium on which to grow bacteria and fungi as most microorganisms cannot digest agar topic alginates elgyn ik acid or alginate is extracted from brown algae its uses range from gelling agents in food to medical dressings alginic acid also has been used in the field of biotechnology as a biocompatible medium for cell encapsulation and cell immobilization molecular cuisine is also a user of the substance for its gelling properties by which it becomes a delivery vehicle for flavours between 100,000 and 170,000 wet tons of macrocystis are harvested annually in New Mexico for alginate extraction and abalone feed topic energy source to be competitive and independent from fluctuating support from local policy on the long run biofuels should equal or beat the cost level of fossil fuels here algae-based fuels hold great promise directly related to the potential to produce more biomass per unit area in a year than any other form of biomass the break-even point for algae-based biofuels as estimated to occur by 2025 topic fertilizer for centuries seaweed has been used as a fertilizer George Owen of Henley's writing in the 16th century referring to drift weed in South Wales this kind of or they often gather and lay on great heaps where it had a thin rod a--the and will have a strong and loathsome smell when being Sir Robin they cast on the land as they do their muck and there of spring earth good corn especially barley after spring tides are great rigs of the sea they fetch it in sacks on horseback as' and carry the same tree four or five miles and cast it on the land which does very much better the ground for corn and grass today algae are used by humans in many ways for example as fertilizers soil conditioners and livestock feed aquatic and microscopic species are cultured in clear tanks or ponds and are either harvested or used to treat effluent pumped through the ponds alga culture on a large scale as an important type of aquaculture in some places maril is commonly used as a soil conditioner topic nutrition naturally growing seaweeds are an important source of food especially in Asia they provide many vitamins including A b1 b2 b6 niacin and C and are rich in iodine potassium iron magnesium and calcium in addition commercially cultivated microalgae including both algae and cyanobacteria are marketed as nutritional supplements such as spirulina chlorella and the vitamin C supplement from dunno Leola high in beta-carotene algae are national foods of many nations China consumes more than 70 species including fat choy a cyanobacterium considered a vegetable Japan over 20 species such as nori and aonori Ireland dulse Chile Kochi yo yo lava is used to make lover bread in Wales where it is known as bara lawr in Korea Jim it is also used along the west coast of North America from California to British Columbia in Hawaii and by the Maori of New Zealand sea lettuce and batter locks are salad ingredients in Scotland Ireland Greenland and Iceland algae is being considered a potential solution for world hunger problem the oils from some algae have high levels of unsaturated fatty acids for example parietal orison size' is very high in arachidonic acid where it reaches up to 47% of the triglyceride pool some varieties of algae favored by vegetarianism and veganism contain the long-chain essential omega-3 fatty acids docosahexaenoic acid DHA and eicosapentaenoic acid epa fish oil contains the omega-3 fatty acids but the original source as algae microalgae in particular which are eaten by marine life such as co pods and are passed up the food chain algae have emerged in recent years as a popular source of omega-3 fatty acids for vegetarians who cannot get long-chain epa and DHA from other vegetarian sources such as flaxseed oil which only contains the short chain alpha linolenic acid ala topic Pollution Control sewage can be treated with algae reducing the use of large amounts of toxic chemicals that would otherwise be needed algae can be used to capture fertilizers in runoff from farms when subsequently harvested the enriched algae can be used as fertilizer aquaria and ponds can be filtered using algae which absorb nutrients from the water in a device called an algae scrubber also known as an algae turf scrubber agricultural research service scientists found that sixty to ninety percent of nitrogen runoff and seventy to one hundred percent of phosphorus runoff can be captured from manure effluence using a horizontal algae scrubber also called an algal turfs scrubber ATS scientists developed the ATS which consists of shallow 100-foot raceways of nylon netting where algae colonies can form and studied its efficacy for three years they found that algae can readily be used to reduce the nutrient runoff from agricultural fields and increase the quality of water flowing into rivers streams and oceans researchers collected and dried the nutrient-rich algae from the 80s and studied its potential as an organic fertilizer they found that cucumber and corn seedlings grew just as well using ATS organic fertilizer as they did with commercial fertilizers algae scrubbers using bubbling up flow or vertical waterfall versions are now also being used to filter aquaria and ponds topic polymers various polymers can be created from algae which can be especially useful in the creation of bio plastics these include hybrid plastics cellulose based plastics poly lactic acid and bio polyethylene several companies have begun to produce algae polymers commercially including for use in flip-flops and in surfboards topic bioremediation the alga stitch Akaka spackle Aras has been seen to colonize silicon resins used at archaeological sites biodegrading the synthetic substance topic pigments the natural pigments carotenoids and chlorophyll x' produced by algae can be used as alternatives to chemical dyes and coloring agents the presence of some individual algal pigments together with specific pigment concentration ratios artax and specific analysis of their concentrations with various analytical methods particularly high-performance liquid chromatography can therefore offer deep insight into the taxonomic composition and relative abundance of natural algae populations in seawater samples topic stabilizing substances carrageenan from the
