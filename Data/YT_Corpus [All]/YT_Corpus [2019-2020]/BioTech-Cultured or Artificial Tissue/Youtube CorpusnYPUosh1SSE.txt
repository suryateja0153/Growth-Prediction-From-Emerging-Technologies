crop and livestock production biofuel cells and biomolecular Diagnostics the thermodynamics and kinetics of molecular recognition in enzymes antibodies DNA hybridization bio conjugation bio immobilization and bio separations are studied attention is also given to the rudiments of engineered biomolecules in cell signaling cell growth kinetics biochemical pathway engineering and bioreactor engineering topic timeline you topic history during World War two the need for large quantities of penicillin of acceptable quality brought together chemical engineers and microbiologists to focus on penicillin production this created the right conditions to start a chain of reactions that lead to the creation of the field of biomolecular engineering biomolecular engineering was first defined in 1992 by the US National Institutes of Health as research at the interface of chemical engineering and biology with an emphasis at the molecular level although first defined as research biomolecular engineering has since become an academic discipline and a field of engineering practice Herceptin a humanized mAb for breast cancer treatment became the first drug designed by a biomolecular engineering approach and was approved by the US FDA also biomolecular engineering was a former name of the journal new biotechnology topic future bio-inspired technologies of the future can help explain biomolecular engineering looking at the Moore's law prediction in the future quantum and biology based processors are big technologies with the use of biomolecular engineering the way our processors work can be manipulated in order to function in the same sense a biological cell work biomolecular engineering has the potential to become one of the most important scientific disciplines because of its advancements in the analyses of gene expression patterns as well as the purposeful manipulation of many important biomolecules to improve functionality research in this field may lead to new drug discoveries improved therapies and advancement in new bioprocess technology with the increasing knowledge of biomolecules the rate of finding new high-value molecules including but not limited to antibodies enzymes vaccines and therapeutic peptides will continue to accelerate biomolecular engineering will produce new designs for therapeutic drugs and high-value biomolecules for treatment or prevention of cancers genetic diseases and other types of metabolic diseases also there is anticipation of industrial enzymes that are engineered to have desirable properties for process improvement as well the manufacturing of high-value biomolecular products at a much lower production cost using recombinant technology new antibiotics that are active against resistant strains will also be produced you topic basic biomolecules biomolecular engineering deals with the manipulation of many key biomolecules these include but are not limited to proteins carbohydrates nucleic acids and lipids these molecules are the basic building blocks of life and by controlling creating and manipulating their form and function there are many new avenues and advantages available to society since every biomolecule is different there are a number of techniques used to manipulate each one respectively topic proteins proteins are polymers that are made up of amino acid chains linked with peptide bonds they have four distinct levels of structure primary secondary tertiary and quaternary primary structure refers to the amino acid backbone sequence secondary structure focuses on minor confirmations that develop as a result of the hydrogen bonding between the amino acid chain if most of the protein contains intermolecular hydrogen bonds it is said to be fibrillar and the majority of its secondary structure will be beta sheets however if the majority of the orientation contains intermolecular hydrogen bonds then the protein is referred to as globular and mostly consists of alpha helices there are also confirmations that consist of a mix of alpha helices and beta sheets as well as a beta helixes with an alpha sheets the tertiary structure of proteins deal with their folding process and how the overall molecule is arranged finally a quaternary structure is a group of tertiary proteins coming together and binding with all of these levels proteins have a wide variety of places in which they can be manipulated and adjusted techniques are used to affect the amino acid sequence of the protein site-directed mutagenesis the folding and conformation of the protein or the folding of a single tertiary protein within a quaternary protein matrix proteins that are the main focus of manipulation are typically enzymes these are proteins that act as catalysts for biochemical reactions by manipulating these catalysts the reaction rates products and effects can be controlled enzymes and proteins are important to the biological field and research that there are specific divisions of engineering focusing only on proteins and enzymes topic carbohydrates carbohydrates are another important biomolecule these are polymers called polysaccharides which are made up of chains of simple sugars connected via glycosidic bonds these monosaccharides consist of a five to six carbon ring that contains carbon hydrogen and oxygen typically in a one two to one ratio respectively common monosaccharides are glucose fructose and ribose when linked together monosaccharides can form disaccharides oligosaccharides and polysaccharides the nomenclature is dependent on the number of monosaccharides linked together common disaccharides to monosaccharides joined together are sucrose maltose and lactose important polysaccharides links of many monosaccharides are cellulose starch and chitin cellulose as a polysaccharide made up of beta one to four linkages between repeat glucose monomers it is the most abundant source of sugar in nature and as a major part of the paper industry starch is also a polysaccharide made up of glucose monomers however they are connected via an alpha 1 to 4 linkage instead of beta starches particularly amylase are important in many industries including the paper cosmetic and food chitin as a derivation of cellulose possessing an acetamide group instead of an O on one of its carbons acid amide group as deacetylated the polymer chain is then called chitosan both of these cellulose derivatives are a major source of research for the biomedical and food industries they have been shown to assist with blood clotting have antimicrobial properties and dietary applications a lot of engineering and research is focusing on the degree of deacetylation that provides the most effective result for specific applications topic nucleic acids nucleic acids are macromolecules that consists of DNA and RNA which are biopolymers consisting of chains of biomolecules these two molecules are the genetic code and template that make life possible manipulation of these molecules and structures causes major changes in function and expression of other macromolecules nucleosides are glycosyl amines containing a nucleobase bound to either ribose or deoxyribose sugar via a beta glycosidic linkage the sequence of the bases determine the genetic code nucleotides are nucleosides that are phosphorylated by specific kinases via phosphodiester bond nucleotides are the repeating structural units of nucleic acids the nucleotides are made of a nitrogenous base a pentose ribose for RNA or deoxyribose for DNA and three phosphate groups see site-directed mutagenesis recombinant DNA and elisa's topic lipids lipids are biomolecules that are made up of glycerol derivatives bonded with fatty acid chains glycerol is a simple polyol that has a formula of c3 hydrogen hydroxide fatty acids are long carbon chains that have a carboxylic acid group at the end the carbon chains can be either saturated with hydrogen every carbon bond is occupied by a hydrogen atom or a single bond to another carbon in the carbon chain or they can be unsaturated namely there are double bonds between the carbon atoms in the chain common fatty acids include lauric acid stearic acid and oleic acid the study and engineering of lipids typically focuses on the manipulation of lipid membranes and encapsulation cellular membranes and other biological membranes typically consist of a phospholipid bilayer membrane or a derivative thereof along with the study of cellular membranes lipids are also important molecules for energy storage by utilizing encapsulation properties and thermodynamic characteristics lipids become significant assets in structure and energy control when engineering molecules topic of molecules you topic recombinant DNA recombinant DNA our DNA biomolecules that contain genetic sequences that are not native to the organism's genome using recombinant techniques it is possible to insert delete or alter a DNA sequence precisely without depending on the location of restriction sites recombinant DNA is used for a wide range of applications topic method the traditional method for creating recombinant DNA typically involves the use of plasmids in the host bacteria the plasmid contains a genetic sequence corresponding to the recognition site of a restriction endonuclease such as ecor1 after foreign DNA fragments which have also been cut with the same restriction endonuclease have been inserted into host cell the restriction endonuclease gene as expressed by applying heat or by introducing a biomolecule such as arabinose upon expression the enzyme will cleave the plasmid at its corresponding recognition site creating sticky ends on the plasmid ligases then joins the sticky ends to the corresponding sticky ends of the foreign DNA fragments creating a recombinant DNA plasmid advances in genetic engineering have made the modification of genes in microbes quite efficient allowing constructs to be made in about a week's worth of time it has also made it possible to modify the organism's genome itself specifically use of the genes from the bacteria phage lambda are used in recombination this mechanism known as recombination utilizes the three proteins EXO beta and gamma which are created by the genes EXO that and gam respectively EXO as a double-stranded DNA exonuclease with five feet to 3 feet activity it cuts the double-stranded DNA leaving three feet overhangs beta as a protein that binds to single-stranded DNA and assists homologous recombination by promoting annealing between the homology regions of the inserted DNA and the chromosomal DNA gamma functions to protect the DNA insert from being destroyed by native nucleases within the cell you topic applications recombinant DNA can be engineered for a wide variety of purposes the techniques utilized allow for specific modification of genes making it possible to modify any biomolecule it can be engineered for laboratory purposes where it can be used to analyze genes in a given organism in the pharmaceutical industry proteins can be modified using recombination techniques some of these proteins include human insulin recombinant insulin is synthesized by inserting the human insulin gene into e.coli which then produces insulin for human use other proteins such as human growth hormone factor 8 and hepatitis B vaccine are produced using similar means recombinant DNA can also be used for diagnostic methods involving the use of the elisa method this makes it possible to engineer antigens as well as the enzymes attached to recognize different substrates or be modified for bio immobilization recombinant DNA is also responsible for many products found in the agricultural industry genetically modified food such as Golden Rice has been engineered to have increased production of vitamin A for use in societies and cultures where dietary vitamin a is scarce other properties that have been engineered into crops include herbicide resistance and insect resistance topic site-directed mutagenesis site-directed mutagenesis as a technique that has been around since the 1970s the early days of research in this field yielded discoveries about the potential of certain chemicals such as bisulfite and amina purine to change certain bases in a gene this research continued and other processes were developed to create certain nucleotide sequences on a gene such as the use of restriction enzymes to fragment certain viral strands and use them as primers for bacterial plasmids the modern method developed by Michael Smith in 1978 uses an oligonucleotide that is complementary to a bacterial plasmid with a single base pair mismatch or a series of mismatches topic general procedure site-directed mutagenesis as a valuable technique that allows for the replacement of a single base in an oligonucleotide or gene the basics of this technique involve the preparation of the primer that will be a complimentary strand to a wild-type bacterial plasmid this primer will have a base pair mismatch at the site where the replacement is desired the primer must also be long enough such that the primer will anneal to the wild-type plasmid after the primer anneals a DNA polymerase will complete the primer when the bacterial plasmid is replicated the mutated strand will be replicated as well the same technique can be used to create a gene insertion or deletion often an antibiotic resistant gene as inserted along with the modification of interest and the bacteria are cultured on an antibiotic medium the bacteria that were not successfully mutated will not survive on this medium and the mutated bacteria can easily be cultured topic applications site-directed mutagenesis can be useful for many different reasons a single base pair replacement could change a codon and thus replace an amino acid in a protein this is useful for studying the way certain proteins behave it is also useful because enzymes can be purposefully manipulated by changing certain amino acids if an amino acid has changed that is in close proximity to the active site the kinetic parameters may change drastically or the enzyme might behave in a different way another application of site-directed mutagenesis is exchanging an amino acid residue far from the active site with a lysine residue or cysteine residue these amino acids make it easier to covalently bond the enzyme to a solid surface which allows for enzyme reuse in use of enzymes in continuous processes sometimes amino acids with non-natural functional groups such as ketones and as IDEs are added to proteins these additions may be for ease of bio conjugation or to study the effects of amino acid changes on the form and function of the proteins the coupling of site-directed mutagenesis and PCR are being utilized to reduce interleukin 6 activity in cancerous cells the bacteria bacillus subtilis is often used in site-directed mutagenesis the bacteria secretes an enzyme called subtle isin through the cell wall biomolecular engineers can purposely manipulate this gene to essentially make the cell a factory for producing whatever protein the insertion in the gene codes you topic bio immobilization and bio conjugation bio immobilization and bio conjugation as the purposeful manipulation of the biomolecules mobility by chemical or physical means to obtain a desired property immobilization of biomolecules allows exploiting characteristics of the molecule under controlled environments for example the immobilization of glucose oxidase on calcium alginate gel beads can be used in a bioreactor the resulting product will not need purification to remove the enzyme because it will remain linked to the beads in the column examples of types of biomolecules that are immobilized are enzymes organelles and complete cells biomolecules can be immobilized using a range of techniques the most popular are physical entrapment adsorption and covalent modification physical entrapment the use of a polymer to contain the biomolecule in a matrix without chemical modification entrapment can be between lattices of polymer known as gel entrapment or within micro cavities of synthetic fibers known as fiber entrapment examples include entrapment of enzymes such as glucose oxidase in gel column for use as a bioreactor important characteristic with entrapment as bio catalyst remains structurally unchanged but creates large diffusion barriers for substrates adsorption immobilization of biomolecules due to interaction between the biomolecule and groups on support can be physical adsorption ionic bonding or metal binding chelation such techniques can be performed under mild conditions and relatively simple although the linkages are highly dependent upon pH solvent and temperature examples include enzyme linked immunosorbent assay x' covalent modification involves chemical reactions between certain functional groups and matrix this method forms stable complex between biomolecule and matrix and is suited for mass production due to the formation of chemical bond to functional groups loss of activity can occur examples of chemistries used are DCC coupling PDC coupling and EDC NHS coupling all of which take advantage of the reactive amines on the biomolecule surface because immobilization restricts the biomolecule care must be given to ensure that functionality is not entirely lost variables to consider our pH temperature solvent choice ionic strength orientation of active sites due to conjugation for enzymes the conjugation will lower the kinetic rate due to a change in the three-dimensional structure so care must be taken to ensure functionality is not lost bio immobilization as used in technologies such as diagnostic bioassays biosensors elisa and bio separations interleukin l6 can also be bio immobilized on biosensors the ability to observe these changes in ill 6 levels as important in diagnosing an illness a cancer patient will have elevated ill 6 level and monitoring those levels will allow the physician to watch the disease progress a direct immobilization of ill 6 on the surface of a biosensor offers a fast alternative to elisa topic polymerase chain reaction the polymerase chain reaction PCR is a scientific technique that is used to replicate a piece of a DNA molecule by several orders of magnitude PCR implements a cycle of repeated heated and cooling known as thermal cycling along with the addition of DNA primers and DNA polymerases to selectively replicate the DNA fragment of interest the technique was developed by Kary Mullis in 1983 while working for the cedis corporation Mullis would go on to win the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1993 as a result of the impact that PCR had in many areas such as DNA cloning DNA sequencing and gene analysis topic biomolecular engineering techniques involved in PCR a number of biomolecular engineering strategies have played a very important role in the development and practice of PCR for instance a crucial step in ensuring the accurate replication of the desired DNA fragment as the creation of the correct DNA primer the most common method of primer synthesis is by the phosphoramidite method this method includes the biomolecular engineering of a number of molecules to attain the desired primer sequence the most prominent biomolecular engineering technique seen in this primer design method as the initial bio immobilization of a nucleotide to a solid support this step is commonly done via the formation of a covalent bond between the three hydroxy group of the first nucleotide of the primer and the solid support material furthermore as the DNA primer has created certain functional groups of nucleotides to be added to the growing primer require blocking to prevent undesired side reactions this blocking of functional groups as well as the subsequent de blocking of the groups coupling of subsequent nucleotides and eventual cleaving from the solid support are all methods of manipulation of biomolecules that can be attributed to biomolecular engineering the increase in interleukin levels is directly proportional to the increased death rate in breast cancer patients PCR paired with Western blotting and elisa help define the relationship between cancer cells and l6 topic enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ELISA enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as an assay that utilizes the principle of antibody antigen recognition to test for the presence of certain substances the three main types of elisa tests which are indirect ELISA sandwich Eliza and competitive Eliza all rely on the fact that antibodies have an affinity for only one specific antigen furthermore these antigens or antibodies can be attached to enzymes which can react to create a colorimetric result indicating the presence of the antibody or antigen of interest enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ZAR used most commonly as diagnostic tests to detect HIV antibodies in blood samples to test for HIV human chorionic gonadotropin molecules in urine to indicate pregnancy and Mycobacterium tuberculosis antibodies in blood to test patients for tuberculosis furthermore ELISA is also widely used as a toxicology screen to test people serum for the presence of illegal drugs topic techniques involved in ELISA although there are three different types of solid state enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay x' all three types begin with the bio immobilization of either an antibody or antigen to a surface this bio immobilization as the first instance of biomolecular engineering that can be seen in elisa implementation this step can be performed in a number of ways including a covalent linkage to a surface which may be coated with protein or another substance the bio immobilization can also be performed via hydrophobic interactions between the molecule and the surface because there are many different types of Alisa's used for many different purposes the biomolecular engineering that this step requires varies depending on the specific purpose of the elisa another biomolecular engineering technique that is used in elisa development as the bio conjugation of an enzyme to either an antibody or antigen depending on the type of ELISA there is much to consider in this enzyme bio conjugation such as avoiding interference with the active site of the enzyme as well as the antibody binding site in the case that the antibody is conjugated with enzyme this bio conjugation is commonly performed by creating cross links between the two molecules of interest and can require a wide variety of different reagents depending on the nature of the specific molecules interleukin l6 is a signaling protein that has been known to be present during an immune response the use of the sandwich type elisa quantifies the presence of this cytokine within spinal fluid or bone marrow samples topic applications and fields you topic in industry biomolecular engineering as an extensive discipline with applications in many different industries and fields as such it is difficult to pinpoint a general perspective on the biomolecular engineering profession the biotechnology industry however provides an adequate representation the biotechnology industry or biotech industry encompasses all firms that use biotechnology to produce goods or services or to perform biotechnology research and development in this way it encompasses many of the industrial applications of the biomolecular engineering discipline by examination of the biotech industry it can be gathered that the principal leader of the industry as the United States followed by France and Spain it is also true that the focus of the biotechnology industry and the application of biomolecular engineering is primarily clinical and medical people are willing to pay for good health so most of the money directed towards the biotech industry stays in health related ventures topic scale up scaling up a process involves using data from an experimental scale operation model or pilot plant for the design of a large scaled up unit of commercial size scaling up as a crucial part of commercializing a process for example insulin produced by genetically modified Escherichia coli bacteria was initialized on a lab scale but to be made commercially viable had to be scaled up to an industrial level in order to achieve this scale up a lot of lab data had to be used to design commercial sized units for example one of the steps in insulin production involves the crystallization of high purity glargine insulin in order to achieve this process on a large scale we want to keep the power volume ratio of both the lab scale and large scale crystallizer is the same in order to achieve homogeneous mixing we also assume the lab scale crystallizer has geometric similarity to the large-scale crystallizer therefore P V alpha nee 3 D 3
