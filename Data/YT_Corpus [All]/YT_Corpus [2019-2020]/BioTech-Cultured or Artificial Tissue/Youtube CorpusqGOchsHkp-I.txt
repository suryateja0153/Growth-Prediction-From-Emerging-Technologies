 and welcome to this year's what the math Center my name is Jeremiah Kassar artist residency condition or science or MCM course the Massey family attorneys co-hosted by Sen and Pia grace minds and machines the courses are contacted by area of agreement and the people all forces are we also very grateful to the family of other Massey generously sponsors signatures community please in order to use this year's lecturer how little dentistry in non-misleading last pregnancy in Germany which by many is considered as the birthplace or 7.x after 70 years MIT result to the fact opposition attacks in 1986 we say hero became the founding director of diversity now mr. president and she is of ice cube or any search resources are very broad and is well recognized for many contributions interview include the I mean work in collaboration with best quick the the basis of consciousness Bissell also played a major role in fostering the development of the vo-tech Alice cultivation on sighs ever since the spacing section well thank you really know that he was co-founder of the axiom course in 1988 here we are over you know the last three decades this course is very attractive in Germany people in Israel as the region of the ICU Chrissa pushed for new ways of osteology brain research which I think we mark initiate the last thing on Saturday so please and he was our first student in 1988 in the methods computational neuroscience and he survived in you did well I'm I'm greatly pleased to speaking to both of you the minds brains machine and the methods computational neuroscience since those topics are obviously very close to my long-term interest so today I'm gonna talk not about computation not about consciousness but the other good interesting thing was seen in me cell and cell types and I'll focus early on talk a little bit about the types of cells in the mouse but then the bulk of the talk will be about human and and the basic messages that we're doing and people can now do human level systems neuroscience at the cells level where you can record from neurons identify them do the transcriptomics do their morphology do the electrophysiology but not on a model system anymore be there the mouse or monkey but actually on the on the real thing and for many things it's absolutely crucial to work on humans thank you much all right so first just to briefly introduce us so just because we do differ in terms of the Sociology so we an independent not-for-profit research organization started in 2003 so I'm not the foundational the vector there were people before me and what we do is support basics basic research in their brain scientists we've now become larger there's now an institute with various subunits and and its focus is all of all of biology not just brain science but the Institute I lead is is for brain science so mine students roughly fina 30 people and the culture is somewhere between a university in a sense that most of us like myself from you know from universities clearly there Steven Smith a lot of people that you recognize have been here for many years and taught here that have now joined us but then we also have a DNA from from biotech we have a bunch of people that come from biotech we have what's called project management and we have something that probably most of you are blissfully an ignorant of called smart goals how many of you know what a smart goal is one person two three okay well smart goal exists because it has a Wikipedia entry it's my definition of existence and the SMART goal stands for specific measurable actionable realistic timely so typical SMART goal that we may have says for instance by q3 of 2020 2020 make a go/no-go decision whether we can do a complete cubic millimeter reconstruction electron microscopic reconstruction of a human piece of cortex a complete current you know doing connectomics in human am so it means we it's specific it's measurable it has a specific timeline so we have to make a determination but you'll see whether or not we're going to do it and then of course we then we say okay now that we think we can do it we're going to have milestone how quickly we can do it and so this is one of the biggest difference between us and and and the university we only take on a few big projects that that that require scale and and we we work in large teams so the the the papers are talking about today is a bunch of nature papers and paper tomorrow in the talk and brain observatory typically involve 50 60 70 80 90 people so it's a very different sociology but I would submit that the field of neuroscience is an armature enough and it's getting big enough funding in this country ten billion dollars alone a year that it people want to turn on their money politicians in IH want return on their money and so ultimately if we want to sort of transition from the romantic phase of neuroscience to more mature phase a phase transition that physics has already undergone in their large accelerator and in particle physics and in astronomy we certain projects at least need to be done at scale and in in this way all right so we initiated when when I came were talking with Paul Allen we had this plan for roughly for these people for 10 years for billion dollars and we actually on that so that's our current budget and it's all due to the generosity of one individual who have cause has passed away but has left us his legacy so we are here to stay I'd so what we do we really we may take on these large projects that help that we believe help all of new your science at least that those aspects of new science that relate to the mammalian brain particularly the mouse brain the monkey brain and the human brain also the the systems we focus on so over the years we've released all this is a timeline of all the various projects we have done and in with each one each one they're certainly and unique aspects to it that makes it different from a typical folk some of what I did for 25 years at Cal Tech so typically these are large projects we release we make all the data all the metadata available including Jupiter notebooks and white papers about the protocols the data the metadata as much as we can we can put down on papers or notebooks we make available accessible and we make and you can doubt right now you can go to brain a - map thought organ can download all the data I'm gonna talk about there's no login there's no there's no restriction you can download everything we do and once it passes internal quality control stage and then the the papers typically they're large papers they only typically become available two or three years later because it's you know what but of course we all know there's a difference between producing the data and then evaluating it and getting into a peer review but we've never had a problem I think this problem that many people believe being paranoid you can't share your data and nothing archive shows that you can share your data perfectly well without being scooped all right so today I'm just going to talk to uniquely about cell types so we know roughly pretty much exactly for 200 years now since the early 19th century that all biological organism consists of one or more of different cells I'd sell us a basic unit of it's a basic unit in biology and we know that cell to get other cells and then of course we realized in the 19th century that the different types of cells their brain cells are kidney cells heart cells and then with a big the the chemical industry that give rise to dyes Golgi and Corral and others showed a great variety of different types of neurons by their mythology alright so this of course has evolved over the last hundred fifty years so where what what the feel is trying to do and what we are heavily involved in probably two-thirds or three-quarters of our Institute's involved in this is to come up with a classification how many different types of cells are there and can we classify them of course the mother of all traffic ation system in biology is of course the periodic table and so that's a difficult problem people have addressed this problem before in sorry in other fields particularly in the field of trying to classify all biological organisms you know a dog is different from a cat and how are they related to each other and how do they differ from a lion and so people have these you know they're the entire tree of life with its kingdoms and its various levels and so there's a lot of knowledge about classify classification and taxonomy and how to name them ontology this all feels that that we're dealing now on a day to day basis and so we know from from from those types of classification of species one has to be very flexible you can't be rigid you have to use continuous parameters so we typically you all know this textbook knowledge classify let's say neurons in the brain as non yawns and neurons and then their classes of excited inhibitory neurons their subclasses their tides and their subtypes and ultimately we want to get to this level and I'll come back at the end whether this is useful or how useful it is or what youth for what usages can we put this knowledge and the question is how many different subtypes are there how many different leaves are there on this tree and by what criteria so in in speak classifying species it was morphology in embryology and then of course everything changed with molecular biology in genomes so same thing here is storica lee the most to classify neurons al-ahram alcohol is morphology then now we have electrophysiology but now of course we have Connecticut omics the genes that are expressed inside the cell or inside the nucleus we do all of these methods this is all just two species mouse and human so it's almost exactly a factor of thousand in terms of mass is 0.6 grams is 1400 grams in terms of surface area it's 1200 square centimeters whether compared to a little bit under one square centimeter it's a factor thousand in terms of neurons 86 billion versus 74 million it's a factor thousand terms of cortical neon sixteen billion cortical neurons and 14 million cortical neurons in in mouse and so we can ask the question and I will ask you as well where's the difference why we the dominant species are not not mice is it just because we have a thousand times more all right and people say well obviously there can't be but if you if you look at your computers in your in your pockets today you can talk to them 20 years ago when there were thousand times fewer transistor you couldn't talk to them yet there's no fundamental difference in terms of the architecture between computers 20 years ago and computers today alright so I said we operate in a large team these are sort of their the senior scientists I'm not going to go through them all it's really led by ethylene at the human cell type program and honk we the the who's in charge of the structured science who's in charge of the mouse and who's in charge of transgenic animals that many of you at least if your experimental scientists will use alright so we have these flexible guide to how we classify things and we use by large three mythology and three modalities not going to forth one we use the mythology particularly classification of dendrites and axons local if it's in slice and digital projection if we do whole brain a whole brain reconstruction that we do now increasingly in the mouse we can't do that at least in humans we do elect large-scale electrophysiology in both human and human neurons and Mouse neurons this is all in slice this is not in vivo so this is in a comatose piece of brain tissue and then we use the technique that many people use today and probably it's so it's a question of the drunkard who's looking for his keys and you know he looked for his keys under the streetlight because that's where the light is so we using transcriptomics in other words where we're looking we're doing RNAi in them a diverse transcribing the anime sequence sequences that we find inside the nucleus either inside the nucleus for human or inside the cell for the mouse brain we typically get between eight and ten thousand different species of RNA that are being expressed and then we do clap we can do classification in these very high dimensional spaces that's that it's getting to be expensive so we used most of this paper these papers I'm reporting use a technology called smarter smartsheet version fourth of it's a technique that allows you to go very deep but it's very expensive it's like thirty dollars per cell if you do 100,000 a million cells that's expensive and then some of the later result we now use 10x which uses drop seek which is roughly a factor 50 50 times cheaper okay so so our messages are in the following so we define types using different criteria so when I refer to a type I mean electrophysiological types well we do therefore we take out a little piece of prey in human and mouse brain we put it in a dish so now it's cut off from its input and its output it's it's it's really in a piece of comatose brain we put an electrode inside the cell body and we inject current random steps steps random noise hosing noise pulses all sorts of all sorts of different stimuli to try to evoke a very diverse response and then we classify based on we do unsupervised classification based on those criteria or we do the same thing where we where we go inside a slice we record from the cell but then we inject bio seitan and we recover the morphology of the cell whether it's human or Mouse and we can see it's dendritic it's complete pretty much completed in Aqaba and its local axon and we do classification based on that unsupervised this has a drawback that it's a comatose brain you don't have background activity this has a drawback that you're cutting off everything in you know you have these slices seen at 50 micrometer thin so you don't see the distal acts the distal axons there now this technique we have called ëthe most where we can do much better where we can reconstruct neurons and the axon projection across entire brain but we can't do that in humans all right so doing this for instance that we've done this this came out a couple of months ago Nature Neuroscience well we do this exhaustively in primary visual cortex we chose for very idiosyncratic reason which shows most of our tools are concentrated on on primary visual cortex in the mouse all of our brain Observatory I'll speak tomorrow will be all in in in Mouse visual cortex so we go very deep in one area and we classify and I'm not going to go into the detail we've classified this mouse according to the Paramus l primarily that their dendrites and the position of the cell bodies whether they only are two three so in the mouse you don't different you can't differentiate lured layer two and three that's one layer yearly or for layer five layer six and inter neurons that of course can be found in layer 1 to layer six and then also using electrophysiology whether they you know they work them in response to step they fire a few discharge and then they shut up or whether they stutter or whether they adapt or whether they're high frequency firing whether they burst etc and using this classification we can identify 46 different morphological and electrophysiological types so different types at cluster in these are spaces that have on the order of several hundred dimensions and of course as you all know if you've done clustering unsupervised it really depends a lot on the detail so I don't so there's nothing particular magic about forty six in the first paper that we published two years earlier we gotten 42 and I knew that was the answer but unfortunately looking more using a different clustering algorithm it's now 46 in may well be 47 the exact numbers aren't so important and depend on on the on the various details of your of your of your learning algorithm alright so quite a few cells more than just regular spiking cells and fast-spiking inter neurons and then we do automatic you know I used to do this for my PhD and it took me like you know six months by the program to do that we now if I automatic a code that can do some of you you give it the morphology of a cell you give it the electrophysiology and then it using genetic algorithm it it finds the best distribution of currents in the soma and in dendrites it's active models so each one of those cells you can download and if you want to do neuron models you can you can get all that data yeah so I said all this data whether it's human or Mouse it's available at that website okay so but what we've those techniques they don't scale very well so electrophysiology and morphology for those you've done it is what remains very laborious you know we have various robotic helps we can now do automatic recording from 8 cells simultaneously but still it's very it's it's very challenging and also by citing reconstructions are really difficult to automate so we have an entire group that does computational anatomy and it's it's it's been challenging and not as far as for everybody in the field if you use gia fluorescent signals they're much did they have certain advantages there but this the advantage of transcriptomics you can easily scale it up to thousand ten thousand hundred thousand or million so we do this technique and we have this pipeline that we built where you can either put in human tissue or you can put in Mouse tissue in fact you can put in any tissue doesn t matter so here we put in either mouse or a human tissue we dissect for example only layer one or only layer for a particular part of the brain then we do all the magic of cut script omics we may pick certain types of cells so for example we may pick cells that are marked with new end which is a mark of neurons because we are primarily interested in new yawns and less interested in microglia cells for instance and then we do this cases and said smarter seek for or now the 10x and we get our typical read level if you know 8000 9000 for some of the big pyramidal cells as human pyramidal cells we may get 10,000 genes that are expressed so quite high between five and ten thousand it's lower Foglia its lower for inter neurons its highest for parameter cells biggest for the layer 2 3 in the layer 5 gigantic pyramidal cells like nano grams of stuff all right so here the idea is quite simple you know we have this diversity of cell and then we use various clustering algorithms unsupervised clustering algorithm to get different types of cells parley we do this because then with the magic of biotechnology we can convert each one of these cells either into transgenic animal or into virus that only expresses in this subset of cells we can then build the Potter for example right where all the cells that have this particular these particular genes Express they light up or you can put a channelrhodopsin in and turn them off or turn them on right so independent of the epistemic value of of cell types which I think remains unclear they have great practical value because they allow us to go into the system and break open the system in very deliberate ways all right so this came out last year so here we we do it did a deep dive in primary visual cortex this is the back of the brain this is the pond it's a mouse plane of course this is a secondary motor area which we were interested in for various reasons we pick two areas because that are quite away apart on the on the dorsal surface one visual primary sensory the other one secondary motor because we wanted to count compare and contrast alright so in the meantime we've done several hundred thousand in the result still holds this what it was published with twenty one thousand cells we find 116 clusters and once again the exact number is 816 112 120 will depend on the various details we do debt we do at least two different clustering algorithms independently and now we work with others in the field to have as many clustering algorithms available to use as many clustering algorithms as possible and everybody comes up with a different number but the taxonomy remains pretty much the same okay so there are two really interesting insights here so these are all so all the cells divided into two big branches one is muons and the other branch is non neurons so non we have many fewer non neurons then we have neurons we did that by design as I said we use three lines and we use new end because we're primarily interested in those less interest and those so with their only thought in cell clusters here within the nuance there two broad classes of course excitatory inhibitory and within the inhibitory they are four subclasses the lam five the VIP is about to start in PvE and SC ng parley they come from different developmental origins they come from two different parts of the of the of the medial eminence so that's why they fall into different clusters and then we have all the excitatory ones now this is incredible interesting this graph here what what does it say well it says of all this the cells expressed which fraction did we find in this motor area and which fraction did we find in visual areas in v1 so the inter neurons almost was out of fail we find in both areas so all these lump 5 or via P or s s T or P V we find same cell types transcriptional defined in these two different areas while excitatory cells they're either 0 or 1 so either they're found in one area or the other they don't seem to mix again transcriptional defiant ok so the bottom line is they're roughly hundred different cell types transcriptional defined different cell types in these two different brain areas the inhibitory ones identical or very similar and the excitatory ones are different now why might that be well you can think it may well be that these high transcriptional space is really subdivide into two orthogonal spaces one is a space that defines the function of the neuron itself and its input and the other one is the set of genes that defines where it goes for output and of course the output from layer 5 so these are node you have very few cell types in layer 2 3 & 4 very few remarkable view in either v1 or an in the motor areas you have a very large number of cells in layer five and layer six of course those are all the output cells and they project to a very different area so in v1 layer five you're going to go for instance to the superior colliculus because you need to send the information to the visual tectum there is no projection in our motor cortex from from layer five into the colliculus instead it protects you the pawns down to the spinal cord etcetera so I suspect because these have to carry the zip code for a distal area outside their local area well these are just addressed locally or with one exception and SST subtypes that actually does have a long distant projection all of these local inter neurons that don't go outside the area so all they need to know it's while I'm sitting in layer two and I have a dendrite dendritic tree into layer one and I extend a basal dendrite into layer three and I can code that in the same way in v1 as in SN motor cortex okay so that's Mouse yes I said we we say some of the different class we can explain by the developmental different origin from the central or the medial ganglionic eminence and where now we just finish this it's not we haven't put it online yet because we we aren't still fully done with the the quality control and we're probably a year two away from publishing any of this so we've done this now in a very large number of cells I think the total now is half a million across the entire a cortex and hippocampus and we're getting ready by the end of the year to have done this in an entire mouse brain and where you can see so these are the so-called tiers in a plot where you can sort of differentiate the cell types so at the Barna we find roughly the same rules that interneuron spine large are shared while pyramidal excitatory cells differ across cortex we find that true across the cortical mantle the final bottom line will be that a brain like their mouse has on the order of a thousand cell types again this knowledge is really useful because you can focus on but I'm not going to talk about it you can use this in all to build tools like viral tools or transgenic tools that Express let's say a promoter or reporter in a specific part of them which you can then use to study so here we study the the hierarchy that we find we can precisely define a hierarchy in the villain cut in all of cortex and all of Palermo Salama cortical cortical thalamic in the mouth using such using such tools and of course he can also do Kavli experiments where you perturb the system ok now let's switch to humans so when I came from Caltech to Seattle like I just finished a long collaboration with it's like freed where we record together with Gabriel crimen here there was his PhD where we recorded from the human brain single neurons you know the the Jennifer Hamson and neurons and so I was really gung-ho and I believe that the field was ready to work with neurosurgeons at a large scale to really move to go beyond a mouse and monkey because everybody I said now you can to humans you have to study monkey and I didn't want to study monkey it's nothing wrong with studying monkeys but then you get stuck for your entire life studying monkeys and I didn't want that alright so how do you get access to this thing how do you get access to the human brain this is the brain tattoo all right well you can do what many of us times you can do focus on what Nancy kanwisher does to perfection you can do all sorts of sophisticated imaging scans where you can get ever smaller brain areas in a magnetic scan of volunteers it's very cool because you knew it reliably and safely and over and over again but you know the smallest box are there as we're talking about you know two by two by one millimeter of something like that that's half a million neurons and I'm interested in understanding those half a million neurons are probably four hundred different types and so you have to go inside the skull you can work in dead brain so that's what we do that's what we've done in the past and that's what we continue to do well we work with closely with coroner's office it's a very elaborate procedure and you have to have lots of patience because you have a very long list of exclusionary teria that you can screen until you get patients that donor brains that have died from non brain related diseases that weren't involved in a potential crime they have to be a certain age etc etc and people don't necessarily donate these days anymore because they're more skeptical it's not a long-term endeavor but we're doing it since many years and so we have quite a few clean brains in our freezers the other way you can do fetal tissue unfortunately due to our our administration just keep it at that and our administration washing that path is almost impossible it's it's very very difficult and of course there you're studying a very young brain so typically we're talking about aborted fetuses which is the first trimester so there's already they are put a new as their progenitor muons there but it's not really you know developed into neurons yet you can do neurosurgery tissue and we'll do that I'll explain that that's what we choose or you can also you can do brain organoids you know using induced pluripotent stem cell very cool very exciting but still very very immature both as the fields only 10 years old as well as these new ones you wait nine months and then you get neurons that transcription of the transcriptional about Express transcription factor you can sort of equate to end a first-term progenitor neurons they don't really have action potential yet they don't really have apical dendrites they don't have you know the stuff that we associate the machinery of neurons yet and people haven't really been able to difficult to terminal differentiate these into what you and I would call a let's say a spiking pyramidal cell all right so what we do we either do work with a post-mortem brain or we work with your surgical brain so that's very simple every major in your surgical practice will do one of two operations will either do have to remove two more so let's see it's a deep tissue tumor let's see in the amygdala hippocampus so depending on the exact approach and different clinics and different surgeons have different approaches but typically it involves going so one of the temple your temporal gyrus and so that in order to get to the deep tissue tumor that surgeon has to tunnel through the overlying piece of brain and that brain a little bit is snipped off and given to the pathologist most of that piece of brain in most hospitals on the planet is discarded as medical waste all right this is really shocking this is some of the most precious tissue says because it comes from an from an individual who lived with this brain until they're 30 40 50 60 whatever most of their brain we've done detailed histology is normal because it's it's the centimeter two centimeters away not always but most of the time you cannot distinguish it from from from healthy post-mortem tissue but most of the time it's it's thrown away as medical waste so we filled up this pipeline to work with lots of neurosurgeons to to retrieve that it was in a few minutes typically two or three minutes we have a special way to transport it and to perfumes it was carboxyl and two so we have this optimal way where was in twenty to thirty minutes literally let's here we try to keep upper bound thirty minutes after it was cut from the human brain it sits in our lap and and we cut it in slices and do experiments with it you got to remember half an hour God was part of somebody's memory of their first kiss or whatever all right the other the other major source of tissue is epileptic surgery same thing you have very often seventy percent of the time you have off temporal lobe epileptic seizures they originate let's say in the hippocampus associated structure and then the surgeon has to cut through the overlying piece of middle temporal gyrus so about two-thirds to three-quarters of our teaching comes from middle temporal gyrus most of the other one comes from anterior cingulate and other frontal areas and then we found it out with optimize this now we do array tomography we're now starting to do and your pixel recording this is in the patient with I won't talk about that now we do single-celled transcriptomics I'll talk about this clear it is getting ready they've done already some samplings and we're getting ready to do full connectomics of a cortical column every human we're doing slight physiology I'll talk about that we're doing synaptic physiology we won't talk about that and we doing vital tools so you can import a lot of the vital tools because you can't build transgenic lines but you can use ABV so you can use a lot of the machinery and the enhancers etc and the attack sequence all that knowledge imported from the mouse and you can partially test it in a in a monkey and then take it into into human so this holds immense therapeutic promise yeah and so we work with a variety of surgeons at all the local clinics and it it really works great they all work with each other it's it's a great thing like on this paper so we have a big nature paper coming out in two weeks from now these surgeons are all co-authors so as I said we do pretty much the same pipeline for the mousers for the human we do again new end because we're more interested in neurons and in non neurons that study I'm gonna talk about here which we finished like a year ago or so we have eight donors for a foreman neurosurgery and forum from post-mortem sixteen thousand cells it's all from the middle temporal gyrus we fact saw them yeah so we do eight yeah I talked about all of this already okay so this is what we find so if we do clustering and then we derive the taxonomy this is what we find in the human MTG now here we're using nuclear RNA seek so typically the tissue comes from people who are 40 50 60 70 unlike all of our mouse which is almost which are all P 56 they're 56 days old I believe everything optimized for P 56 c57 black 6 J so mice are highly inbred and you know they're all sacrificed in the same day etc that's of course not the case so we have asking more diversity that that's just the nature of the game so and also we can't so because at issue has been like this for sixty years disassociating and without breaking it up is very difficult but it's easy to get there the nucleus that's why we're doing nuclear army and we've done in the mouse detail comparison where we compare the sequencing we get from in from intranuclear reads versus reads outside the nucleus and there's some interesting differences alright but so here again we have two families non neurons and neurons the neurons divided into inhibitory GABAergic glutamatergic the glutamatergic divide very similar so here they have sometimes different molecular marker genes but it's the same family lamb v VI psst piano beam and then the excitatory classes again we find few classes in the superficial layer the Markel few two three and four so both in the mouse and in a human which is sort of amazing we find effectively only one or two cell types in layer four but we find like ten or twelve excited resulted in layer five the output and we find again lots of them in the in layer five in layer six once again we believe that these different branches reflect the different embryologic origin in in the medial and central ganglionic eminences but now what we can do we can co cluster we can now establish really good evolutionary relationship between the mouse and there and there and the human alright to answer this question well how many cell types is human half right so many people certainly when I give talks and I ask members of the audience many people would assume or do assume that the human obviously because we have so much more complex as many more cells that the cells are much more complex than than the mouse cells but of course we've got a remember people also thought that in the 1980s when they found 20,000 genes first in their mouths and then people said well obviously they're going to be hundred or two nine thousand genes in the human because we're after all Homo sapiens but it turned out embarrassing deflationary for us their same genes as in the mouse and the same tourist story appears to be true here so here when we so this is Clark these are these clustering player plots is T at EC as a need is nonlinear clustering plots well we we cluster them in this very high dimension 5,000 6,000 dimensions and then project them down onto onto those planes that are most those axes that are most easily discriminable if you just do straight for PCA you can nicely segregate Mouse from human but if you do this car canonical correlation analysis then you can see now the mouse the different cell types nicely cluster human and and mice so in fact here we cluster the GABAergic using the same technique in the same space the triangle is human and the causes are the mouse and you can really see how they very nicely Co clusters so focusing on Shan le cells there's one type of shaunandlisa in the mouse and there's one type in the human and they call cluster that's not always the case but at the subclass level not necessarily at the level of that what I call what we call tealeaves T stands for transcriptional defined leaves it's a bottom layer of the taxonomical team at the level of tea leaves we get seven that trust a one to one most cluster at one level above the the and the final one so this is how that looks so you can align the human non neurons with multi known neurons glutamate glutamate excitatory projection cells PBS VFP and lump five cells and you can do you can do the following so you can this is just for GABAergic neurons so here are all the different GABAergic neurons we find in either v1 or an alm because remember i told you the same and here we find all the GABAergic neurons in human middle temporal gyrus and of course Irina's is a different area of the different techniques one is nuclear sequencing the other one is seller sequencing these are highly outbred hugely diverse people these are hundreds of highly inbred mice all at the same age lots and lots of differences but still when you do the clustering you find a whole bunch of cell tied four you get one one on one mapping so you can make predictions so for example we just previously published a and Nature Neuroscience paper where in layer five we find a cell that has a unique morphology called holes hip because they look like holes in bushes well it turns out transcriptional defined there is a cell that looks more like a newer glia form cell in layer one but that expresses many of the same genes in fact 40 of the same genes that are highly differentially expressed that we used to cluster there's one part or only cell so we can predict us like so we know this in the mouse we've now done clay readers than the connectomics reconstruction those specifically you know have these nice show Nellie's you know this lamp and with candles and so we expect exactly the same thing to be true in in humans there we find one type of somatostatin chortle cell so those are the inhibitory cells that project outside so they have long-range axons in in the mouse so perform molecular leave we find one cell type that matches human and mouse in the mouse we know they have long distant axon projections the stomata starting and they involved in sleep regulation so the prediction would be that they also have long range axons in the Schumann and they also involved in in sleep regulation yeah this is the whole set cell and and we see similarities and differences in the in the shoe for the excitatory cell a few number match but then you get differences you get more differences in you get one felt up in the mouth that maps on the different cells are differently a four cell types in MTG and you get one cell type the projection neurons the layer five extrapyramidal projection yarns that they break down into different cell types in the mouse now of course we have to be cautious here with the exact number the mouse we have hundreds of mice this study only involves 8h humans I mean humans were you know we're always extremely limited in tissue so we all suspect that if we have more tissue and dig deeper we will find more cell types so you know right now it's 76 versus 116 in the mouse if we dig deeper we're all sure we'll find on the order of a hundred cell types in in both now this is really important particularly if you are in the big business of making drugs well because here for example we show in in two cells that we were with one-to-one matching so I told you there's only one type of suddenly cell in the mouse and there's one type in the human in the map on to each other so in other words they have a large number of differentially expressed genes that are differentially expressed both in the human and the mouse that they share on the order of 40 but here we plotting all the genes right we have like seven thousand genes or this is an internal probably six thousand genes that are expressed here we plot on a log scale log to scale the expression level of all the different genes in this cell type in the mouse and here in the human these bands is plus/minus factor ten so if you're outside this band this gene for example is expressed you know thirty times higher in the mouth and it is in the human yet it's still the same cell type same thing here for form and microglia cell so if you are if your farm and you have a you used to have a large-mouth lab because of course it all shut them down and you study this receptor let's see some art to start in receptor or serotonin receptor because those are all the psychoactive drugs and you did you you have a cell type and you can successfully label that knock and out and get some behavioral phenotype well there's no guarantee that that that that gene is also expressed in in the in the human so in fact you can we're putting this tool online where you can for each of these cell types you can differentially look your favorite gene so for example oxytocin which we know critically involved you know in social behavior and autism etc so here what you can see this is on a log plot this is log 2 to the 0 so this is 1 2 to the 10 for this is thousand so these are the violent plot of the express gene Kanab on cannabis receptor to cannabis receptor 1 adrenergic receptor oxytocin so it always shows there the open ones is the distribution of of that particular gene in the different cells in the human and in the mouse and so you can see many are similar but many are very very different well you have a high you know highly oxytocin expressed in some cell type some artists starting in the mouse but not in the human or vice versa and so this really helps explain why most mouse models have been a failure the principal are very similar between mice and human the principle of processing but the details differ and of course the Devils in the details alright yeah so he here to show the principal right so let's see hippocampus you have a lesion here has to be taken out is a tumor or lesion that gives rise to seizure so the surgeon will tunnel through here and will cut this out as part of middle temporal lobe and give it to us you know could be like this looks like a piece of sushi sometimes bigger sometimes it can be speaker this very often is smaller on average it's like a cubic centimeter so think of a sugar cube and then we drop it into this special via its temperature and control for oxygen and and and carboxyl and other things we mark the location so we can later on put it on with all the pictures online so people can then you know extract the metadata and we do a number of things with it we slice it for doing culture but also for the slices but also for doing long term recordings yeah and we can perfectly well as I said we have these robots where we can now do automatic patching up to eight of them simultaneously where we can record in inject current we can inject bio site in we can do the reconstructions we do a panel and all of this is accessible we do a panel of standard cycle architectonic sand markers of pythor pathology we just do it routinely we just want to know this this information for every one sample by enlarge the samples look look very good so here we have one slice for we had I don't know ten new ones that we could inject record form and reconstruct and it was fuzzy it shouldn't be fuzzy okay so these are layer two three this is the stuff you think with if you're going to remember anything about this lecture it is because neurons like these so these are layer two three / amyl cells in your middle temporal gyrus take all that sensory input that they get from let's say higher-order visual cortex and encode it and lay it down as memory many weeks later you can see there thins right because that's a scene at 50 micrometer of the slice so I'm a great believer in that we all needs to children and you know we're all conscious and so I did this at my at an old staff where we had three nerd people in the audience and I flashed up onto the screen one cell at a time not together like year different cells 12 cells half which were for Mouse have which we're from human and I removed it we removed a scale bar and then people had a phone applet to guess which one was human which one is Mouse can you do this okay so people were on average a chance now that's not to say you can train somebody so a of course this is human this is you know 2.5 millimeter this is like 700 micron oh so it's an obvious way to do but even if you'll move that you of course you can train people to tell the difference and you can for sure attain a deep network to tell the difference but the overall point is that had was just so similar although the last common ancestor right between us and those guys you probably have here in the basement wild-type it's like 60 million years right so that's the last common ancestor but we're sitting upstairs and they're downstairs and why is that I mean that's what people always want to know and most people at least in the general audience they want to be too low their somatic explanation it's fun Economo cells or it's you know a special brain area that only we have and all those explanations you know if you look deeper none of them holds holds true we are specialized buts awesome all those dogs each creature specialized in its own way and and the biggest difference that people who Tilly under unappreciated it's a is the factor thousand the fact that then really clear two times larger synaptic density somewhat higher you know so it's probably going to be a combination of all these different factors that leads to to our brain being the way it is so yeah you can do electrophysiology so what we discovered was really cool people were extremely skeptical of this look this is recording three days after we took it from a human brain you get beautiful spikes you get intern yawns to get fast spiking you can record acts and you can record synaptic potentials so here we plotted for what doesn't show you know I have another slide what we do the same thing for two more patients versus for epileptic patients we don't find the difference whether the tissue is taken from one or the other here you can see this is time out after slicing so this goes to three days yeah and there's some some there's some trends like the resting potential goes up a little bit but by and large it's incredible stable you can't do this in a mouse and the mouse typically if a cow just more if they slices more than six days six hours old their gradients run down and you have to throw the slides away humans presumably because you know we live much longer you know we may have more antioxidant anti stress factors we don't really know why this but human tissue lasts much longer then then then holdin tissue and then you can find for here we did a study we can find differences I'm not going to go into this between human and mouse so we try to in fact to identify current cells is layer two three per amal cells and you can you know you can find differences whether they're meaningful or not who knows between mouse and human and then you can do tons you can do the same thing that we did in the mouse and now in this human so you can collect self we're doing this in collaboration with height months felt in in amsterdam and with gaba thomas in in hungary you really pioneered this technique so all using stem common standards we're now doing three modalities at the same time so-called pat seek we're going into human cells right now be doing inter neurons and then layer two three pyramidal cells we injecting by reciting and reconstructing the dendrite from the axon we get the standard electrophysiology we suck out the nucleus to do single-cell transcriptomics on that same cell so in other words we then get the morphology the electrophysiology and the transcriptomics all on the on the same cell to be able to identify well you know if this is GABAergic cell which particular transcription type of GABAergic cell is this which particular type of Leah - Leah - pyramidal cell it is and we're doing this now quad routinely and we also as I mentioned we're now using these viral techniques very exciting what we can get these are a class of the makeup twenty percent of the cells here layer five cells so called primal tag that go down to the spinal cord in the monkey we've done this there many fewer Shuman we have now a virus that identifies these they're very specific cells but they're many fewer they're only 0.5% but they project all the way down and so we're now busy trying to find various promoters for GABAergic cells for VIP cells for subset of GABAergic cells in there in the human brain alright so let me finish so the bottom line is I hope I've sort of shown you that believable evidence that in any one cortical areas are going to be on the order of a hundreds distinct cell types you know in summarize it may be 80 in other areas made may be hundred 20 but it's going to be on the order of 10 to the 2 with the with most inhibitory interneurons share across regions again it's very difficult to be perfectly general there may well be some distinct inhibitory cell types but they seem to be if they exist is seem to be in the distinct minority what remains unclear as of now how these different properties map on to each other you know so how does the morphology where they project to the electrophysiology and their genes that Express how does it map onto each other does it map onto each other totally one-to-one it's unlikely what are the redundancy and the did we see redundancy in with the degeneracy but we need to understand that by we I mean they're collectively the field the brain as a whole whether it's going to be human and mouse is going to be on the order of a thousand maybe it's 2,000 but you know on that order poly not 10,000 and certainly certainly much more than 100 so the big question is particular for UK who think about the brain as a computational machine that I'm not fully sure as a right way to think about it but if you do yet you're for you're you're confronted with this challenge what is the function of a thousand cell types from a computational point of view in particular one way I'd like to remind you of this foundational paper of computational neuroscience was published almost 80 years ago in the war by McCulloch competes at the time Chicago and FFF key and they publish this beautiful paper if you haven't had it you should go out and read it immediately which then they'd sort of propose one of the first neural networks model was a very simple model where this human neurons all-or-none inhibition has a veto power it's a threshold model that they proposed and then they showed systematically they showed how any one logical proposition like you know all men are mortal and Socrates is a man therefore men Socrates will die how all such proposition could be mapped on to networks of these neurons was immensely influential really influenced the way societies organized and and in civilization there's a direct connection between that then John from Norman his book computer and the brain then he finished in 57 when he was dying and Alan Turing and there a slit release history alright so we we are influenced we have this profound belief going back to lightness and probably can trace it back even earlier to the Greeks that that the brain not the kidney or not the heart but curiously only the brain sort of instantiates these these these these steps this operation that we think of computation and there are some primary function of of of the brain in particular of this of this cortical tissue now we know that simple McCallum pips neons are curing complete right so in in fact we know that just NAND gates a whole 110 or you know game of life all those things are very simple they are Turing complete in other words anything that can be complete computed on a Turing machine with infinite memory can be computed with such simple networks so why the hell do we need a thousand of these incredible complicated cell types of neurons what do they possibly compute okay you need a neuron for doing inhibition and for doing gain normalization but why do you need 15 types of somatostatin cells and thirteen types of PD interneurons and I don't have the answer but we are we suspect if suddenly if you read the biological literature that many of that has to do with developmental reasons it had to develop your brain had to develop from a single cell there are all sorts of neurons that we know our progenitor of neurons that are expressed transiently and some remain around some our evolutionary remnants no doubt from Webley scenario ancestor some may be there for metabolic reasons so these are other reasons rather than purely computation in one but for us of most interest is this the belief of many of us in biology and in medicine that many diseases many neurological the many optimal logical diseases eye diseases and that are specific to the eye psychotic diseases and neurological diseases are not just general degenerative diseases but at least start out with a specific one or two specific cell types that their self specific diseases all right so they are for example there many types of retinal blindness that are not generic damage in the in the eye but are very specific genes that are missing in the photoreceptor forger or in amacrine cells on bipolar cells and so that then gives you a promise to for therapy because if you can introduce that that gene then you can help him there's this spectacular success now unfortunately it cost two point 1 million dollars by Novartis but this is spectacular success and a V trial a single shot a B trial from infants who suffer from SMA a spinal cord moscato fee in many of them it's deadly they die within two years it it's a dysfunction of a single gene that are expressed in an in an alpha motoneuron the spinal cord there's now an AV treatment very successful in 12 children where not a single one has died usually 99% die where you where you have a virus that delivers that gene through only those mode yawns so if we can do this there's evidence that some Parkinson's disease of course ALS amyotrophic lateral sclerosis schizophrenia and many of these diseases at least very promising hint that the disease is specific to a cell type or starts out with a specific cell type or a specific synaptic connection among cell types and so therefore if you can identify the these subtypes in the human because mice don't really get partisan they don't really get schizophrenia if you can identify those in Schumann's and then then you have a very promising Avenue using AV or other viral vectors to introduce the missing or the defunct gene and introduce them back into the patient's to alleviate or maybe eliminate the symptoms so plus in the mouse of course or in the monkey gives us very powerful tools to perturb so independent of what the functions of these we can use them to access the brain in a in a causal way in in animals and we can maybe access them to devise more powerful diagnostic tools for the humans and with that this is our team at the Allen Institute and this is our this is our founder who started us all off on this vote particularly the road towards looking at big problems T in large teams and making all the knowledge available for all of humanity for free thank you much [Applause]
