 we'll give my talk on stem cells so it's the title is concept an application articular cartilage and the question is contrary on excels for cut repair which cells could be used and what could we expect well if we look upon in jurist articular cartridge and groove play there are significant clinical problems due to what we know limited ability to regenerate themselves lesion can arise either traumatically or pathological and societies then may be confined to the vascular layer articular cartilage what we call partial thickness lesions or that may penetrate into the subchondral bone full thickness cartilage lesions partial thickness defects show no spontaneous repair activity whereas full thickness defects do when the subchondral bone is involved two different types of tissue needs to be repaired and one is the vascularized area and one is the non-disclosed area and these two areas must be restored if you want the joint function to be maximally returned subsequently the type of system that we wish to elaborate must be selected from existing different alternatives and a cellular approach a cell-based approached a combined approach a seller approach aimed to facilitate the repair activity of native cell population what we say stem cells they may consist of an empty matrix or of a matrix containing biologic signaling agents that will recruit and trigger the differentiation or locust and population into cartilage to chondrocytes cell based approaches can evolve free cells cells in suspensions that we started here in 1987 that could be immature graft cells in the matrix scuffle or cells on a carrier like macy or major graft osteochondral plugs if immature cells are used these may even be left to differentiate in vitro in the scuffle to a major graft in the body or as an immature graft implanted with a mixture of an and differentiated cells to mature in vivo and the cells can be applied as we heard either alone or in conjunction with the matrix so what we are mostly talking about these local focal cartridge lesions but there is a gliding scale in to general loss of cordless osteoarthritis and we have to to treat these lesions also in the future with cell technologies one could say that all cottage repair methods depend on introjection of these contrary and excels in to the kurdish lesions and which cells that we should use and for what Donald TCO that ought to be harvested we could discuss for months but in general there are more control in excels in Johnny patients we could see here this junk patient which is actually read where as they were not very nice repair while the old rat has a poor repair we could see if we don't have any cells we have a poor repair in this area if you use fibroblast also poor repair but if they use committed chondrocyte fully differentiated chondrocyte or mesenchymal stem cells we could have nice repairs maybe you could move it little because it's lacking some text on the left side is it possible to do something with her ok cond repair or roster contra repairs the question should we use the same cells for both areas chondrocytes for the control part or may embassies for the bony region or maybe we should use embassies for both areas that is the questions so if we use only mesenchymal stem cells as has been done by kaplan coworkers they use the scaffold and put the stem cells in this area or they use just chondrocyte in the scaffold area and you could see with the stem cells you get both cottage repair as well as boom repair but if you use committed chondrocytes you have also cartilage in the bony area so certainly in that sense is more interesting to do stem cells for the car to repair ok so this tells us that we are going to talk about is the mesenchymal stem cells we will not focus on embryonic stem cells which is a more difficult area to use nowadays mses are present at the concentration of less than 1 in 100 to 500 thousand cells in bone marrow aspirates and subsequently the EMA seem must be culture expanded to obtain enough number for repair but could a book and coworkers after 16 days that could harvest 100 million cells from only 3 millimeters of presume and marrow so it is possible to expand quite fast and get enough a number of cells and you could also use them in the freezer and use them for a time later on boomer has been considered the source of embassies but you could also find the bone marrow cells in the premises in the adipose tissue synovium skeletal muscle lung and deciduous teeth and these finally suggest that the MSC niche may not be restricted to just bone marrow and that is of interesting because then we could do research on a lot of areas and we have heard earlier this afternoon about cells from the synovium and the cells from the fat pad as well as from the bone marrow well important to know is that individual colonies derived from single MSC precursors have also been reported to be heterogeneous in terms of their multi lineage differentiation potential and I think this is important when to use it for cartilage because Miraglia and co-workers that analyzed human bone marrow stromal clothes and found that they could differentiate into three main lineages the osteochondral and a dopo genic lineage all clothes but one differentiated into the bone area one-third of the clothes divide it into all three lineages most clothes displayed osteochondral unique potential and this is what certainly we are to rely on when using stem cells but they never observed the never observed clothes with a differentiation potential limited to the osteo a depot or condo at the PO yannick phenotype nor pure chondrogenic and this is important because if you want cartilage and if you want on the cartilage then it's not so good to use the stem cells following this idea furthermore taladon and coworkers they found that in contrast with mcs chondrocytes from cordless only and not burn in the Aviva austere chondrogenic sa and calls on Camilla Coulson and co-workers here in Sargon's car Academy they found that chondrocytes and Emma seized from the same patient differentiated and formed different subtypes of cartilage heileen from the chondrocytes and a mixed cartridge phenotype from the embassies so this is important finest I think but in a very recently published paper by an eye addict and co-workers at American Journal Sport magazine they could show that boomer of cells in curtis repair is as effective as chondrocytes particular culture / and they say that it's less a knee surgery needed because you could use allergenic cells you don't need to do a second harvest reduce costs and minimize donor site morbidity but still is this the catalyst that we want could it be something else in the future because for example when I've done drilling on patient or Mike refracting I could find that some patients develop chondrocalcinosis of cartilage and this is question is there is an activity activation of the cells with plasticity that the cells goes into another lineage and you remember that there were no pure chondrogenic clothes from mesenchymal stem cells so which helps to reduce maybe both committed cells from the cartilage and undifferentiated cells from the bone marrow or bone marrow stem cells for both bone and chondrocyte area that is the question then we have to look little but on the chondrocytes because certainly the chondrocytes are responsible for the unique features of articular cottage and they are producing the car that we want a fundamental feature of cottage differentiation in the developing limp in the theatres is the formation of a pre control in Excel condensation so let a lot of cells fuse and in this condensate they start to produce cartilage when we do a cell transplantation will also use a large number of cells which will make up a condensate in this cartilage area to start the contrarian ases if when look into embryology you will find that in the joint formation there are special stem cells involved the so-called Interzone cells firma more w NT 40 plays a role at the early step in the induction of the joint into zone and GD f 5 secreted signal necessary for joint formation produced in response to w an t 14 and we heard earlier today about GD f 5 involved in the cells in the nucleus in the intervertebral discs so certainly this markers are of interest also for college because articular chondrocytes and other joint cells they derive from GD f five positive into solar cells while shaft and grouped by Kutless derive 4g defined negative cells and when we looked upon cartilage from the surrounding area of elysian we could find that there were progenitor cells which represent the pink spots so these could be the interest the ancestors from the inter-zonal cells and we have also designed primers for limited number of key genes expressed during lame Bank artist development and what we could find in the development is that you will find collagen type 2a and B osteocalcin sox9 CDM p1w NT 14 and CBF 1a1 all g these years are also expressed when we are using chondrocyte and expansion for the transplantation and especially interest is expresses of sox9 important from condensation and WMT 14 critical for you my development so when we are using cells in expansion to plan a suspension implantation or implantation with cells on a matrix-like hydrograph too similar we have an invitation what's happening in embryology furthermore articular cartilage growth is achieved by opposition from the articular surface and for such a mechanism to cure population of stem cells must reside within articular cartilage and don't wait and co-workers had looked upon that and they have found that there are indeed progenitor cells in the certain surface own in the superficial zone so in cartilage we also have what we are looking for stem cells so when we are talking about Stanzler cottage we could talk about the stem cells within cartilage but also stem cells in the bone marrow so it's a cottage stem cells that we need to induce the chondrogenic safe repair in the cottage part of an osteochondral repair if we only want cut leg anesthesia furthermore if you put a piece of cartilage into a cell culture you will see that cells are trafficking out from the cartilage biopsy so these are the most lehigh early active cells and it has been shown that these cells has the same markers as the zone in the superficial zone meaning that those cells could be the cells that we want for for a better repair and the stem cells and if you put even something more stimulating you dope the cells with fgf here you will have even a better outgrowth from the cartilage reason study has also suggested that other fully committed cells are able to differentiate into more potent cell and acquire different phenotype under inductive cues and you can see that the condo site can turn into an osteoblast or into an adipocyte and vice versa so this is certainly of interest song and Joelle and shown the same for osteoblast and they call these genetic reprogramming or transdifferentiation and this is important because if you take one chondrocyte or a few chondrocyte and mix the chondrocytes a large number of Emma sees you could see how there is cross talk in between the chondrocyte and the cells and the cells by Trin's transdifferentiation turn into condo site like cells and these could be used in Carter Chappell as a one-step technology that has been really and recently developed and is under a clinical trial while you use cells from the cartilage cells the condo sighs bone marrow cells and you mix them and put them into scaffold and then you put the scaffold into the cartilage lesion start to bear load and by time you will have a cart information what we call by cellular synergy but that's one way my idea or my my philosophy for for the future caught repair is that you have to have a combination of both the chondrocyte the committee chondrocytes with the bone marrow cells two different types of stem cells into different layers where you put your committed chondrocytes in the cottage layer you put the bone marrow stem cells in the bone layer then you could have a mixture of those cells here which means that you will have a development of the calcified zone because you have the you remember that the bone marrow stem cells did express the different types of cartilage compared to the committed chondrocytes and then you could also have a stimulation of cottage stem cells within that superficial soul together with the implanted cells to get a better integration but up to date we have treated what I was talking about local court aesthetics and people really want to have more embedded treatment for austerity lesions so could we do something with this this looks quite nicely to do with biological repair but you may do an osteotomy you put in your scaffold with Rome ourselves with the chondrocytes in this area could that be feasible well perhaps but you have to remember that osteoarthritis is an organ disease meaning that also disease process will affect the college area that we have implanted but then we have another way to use the stem cells because furthermore we know that the stem cells could be used as an allergenic cells because they work very little immune response but then also the stem cells secrete bioactive molecules that could be effective for the repair which call atrophic activity so the nsa's appeared to be evaluated the mediators for tissue repair as troffer stimulators and this is the next step for the juice of the stem cells in scar to repair to inject them directly into the joint without and is careful for osteolytic purposes but more to stimulate the cells within the cartridge not to expect that the stem cells will produce the repair burner cells and there are studies going on and why you could see how this catalyst that has been partly destroyed with the injection of cells could be restituted so this is something very thrilling to look forward in the future so finally one could say that the fundamental question of development biology is how cells differentiate differentiate or stem cell into the right place at the right time into the right type to contribute to the tissue system or where they are an integral part if you better understand how to you develop we might also understand how to better engineer the functional equivalents and finally the summer is that what we could use for the cottage repair is the committed cells the cottage deride stem cells we should expect a cross talk in between seeded cells and stem cells in the supervisor so in using trophic factors for seeded cells and a better integration mixture of cottage deride cells and BM bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells in the cottage boon interface will transfer NCA shin and production of a calcified so bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells in the subchondral bone region and also which is not so much studied cell homing meaning that we could also have a contribution of cells from the surrounding by trafficking into this area thank you very much for your attention you
