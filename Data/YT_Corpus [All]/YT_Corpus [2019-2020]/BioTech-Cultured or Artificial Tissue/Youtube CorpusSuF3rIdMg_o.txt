 welcome to this whole life action hour I'm thrilled to be with you right now for a very important conversation right now in the United States over three-quarters of soybean corn and cotton are genetically modified or genetically engineered and despite labeling requirements in 64 countries around the world most of the food made from these products in the United States does not require any meaningful labeling and although major biotech companies like Monsanto Bayer insists that GMOs are safe the World Health Organization has suggested otherwise they've labeled glyphosate found in Roundup Ready crops a probable carcinogen it's also known to be an antibiotic and an endocrine endocrine disruptor today we're going to talk about why genetically engineered foods are a food safety priority we're going to talk about how you can protect yourself and your family from hidden dangers and about the latest developments in this critical area of food production and food safety for all of us and we've got the right person to join us for this conversation because we're here today with Jeffrey Smith he is a world authority on the dangers of genetically engineered foods he is the founder of the Institute for Responsible technology in 2017 Jeffrey was named Person of the Year by masters of Health magazine for his more than two decades of work exposing the health risks of GMOs in 45 countries his book seeds of deception is the world's best-selling book ever on GMOs and his award-winning documentary secret ingredients made with Amy Hart shares remarkable stories of people who have regained their health and their lives after choosing to avoid certain harmful ingredients in their food so Jeffrey is also a dear friend and Jeffrey I'm so glad to welcome you here you know ocean I love hearing your questions and your introduction because there's like of all the people that ever interview me and there's been a thousand there's like two people that really know with such just beyond a shadow of doubt they know their stuff about GMOs and it's you and your dad so it's like it's like I I I want the people to know who are watching you that you you really do your homework and you are following what in in this year I know I know you're following my stuff because I listen to you but in each of these areas you are so precise so thank you for that absolutely so let's start with a little bit of a basics for those who may not be because I'm sure we've got our range of viewers right now who are different levels of awareness on this so what's a GMO genetically modified organisms now it used to be that we would say you take genes from one species like bacteria or viruses and force it into the DNA of other species like soybeans or corn but there's also gene editing which is another form of genetic engineering where you don't necessarily add genes from one species to another you can change and delete and double genes or reorder them within the organism that you're looking at now in both cases whether you're transferring genetic material or just editing or moving them around it's not so simple that you could say aha precision and done you end up creating massive collateral damage in the DNA hundreds thousands even ten thousand mutations and alterations within the genetic structure not to mention what could be hundreds or more changes in what the genes produce the proteins and the metabolites so it's kind of a genetic roulette when you get involved in it and yet the biotech industry claims that it is safe and predictable in spite of overwhelming evidence that is dangerous so there's been kind of an effort to say that gene editing is somehow a lot more precise and perhaps perhaps more controlled and perhaps a smaller thing it's sort of like you're taking a book and you're editing a little bit you're not fundamentally changing it and so I'm curious your take on that is gene editing I in any way less of a concerning thing than full scale genetic engineering and secondly are there any crops right now in commercial cultivation that have had edited genes I understand that the Arctic Apple may be gene edited I just read that I wasn't actually sure I need to double-check that which is important point no gene-editing doesn't doesn't get a pass in some cases and in some ways it's more dangerous than transferring genes between species and in some ways it's not so it's a mix when you take a gene from one species and you put it into another species you don't know how those genes are going to interact but what's interesting is oftentimes when you're talking about plant two gene editing you will actually transfer genes or from bacterial genes into the cell structure to get that gene editing mechanism in there and so the process of by allistic SAR using a gene gun or or agro bacterium or bacterial infection can still occur with gene editing and the process of tissue culture or cloning still occurs in creating the crop which can create in itself hundreds or thousands of mutations but what happens is with clamp gene editing you stick in a mechanism that produces let's say it produces a facial recognition program that goes up and down the DNA looking for a match and that has an assassin or let's call those scissors which cuts and can even destroy a gene now what's interesting about gene editing that's different than normal genetic engineering is if you create a gene edited plant that mechanism is still in there working so a year later if you decide okay that's the cell culture you're going to take it's very different than it was when you first genetically engineered it because continued cuts happening throughout the year also the way that gene editing works is it cuts the DNA and then the DNA reforms out of your control and when it reforms it can grab genetic material from the petri dish so hornless cattle that were supposed to be completely safe ended up with bacterial genes that produced antibiotic resistant proteins which could create super diseases mice ended up with retroviruses inserted into their DNA this is this makes gene editing particularly dangerous what's even more dangerous though is the fact that the Jean editors don't even know how dangerous it is because they go along with assumptions they say according to my manual according to my book according to my computer program which evaluates the risks my Jean edit should work yeah they stop there they don't actually do a genome sequencing but the very few genome sequencing that are done and published should show that the computer projections are completely wrong and they're dealing with dynamite yeah so Geoffrey we hear often from proponents of genetic engineering that there's never been a knowing case of bad outcomes let's say from genetically engineered things no we could also counter and say well we're all guinea pigs it without anyone monitoring a lab experiment because virtually all of us have consumed some GMOs so how would exactly would you know if there was a negative outcome when you unleash something on a population of by the hundreds of millions and then say oh my gosh no problem never mind that food allergy rates have you know quadrupled in the last generations since GMOs came into widespread use never mind that our microbiomes are being decimated by who knows what lots of factors right but maybe just maybe widespread use of glyphosate which is an antibiotic could play a part in that right never mind the rates of diabetes and obesity have all been have been skyrocketing during these same years but just functionally they say we don't know right there's lots of other factors we could attribute those things to right however you might point out that there have been some knowing impacts from GMOs even apart from the glyphosate now I want to recognize that a lot of GMO crops are Roundup Ready yeah they're specifically made to be receptacles for glyphosate and not be harmed it's a weed killer but it's also quite dangerous however apart from that Jeffrey you are asserting I think that there are some known dangers with GMOs even if they aren't the Roundup Ready type can you tell us more well let's go historically I was on the George Noory coast-to-coast radio show last night and someone called up who was a scientist thanking me for my work and then telling me what could have been an absolute devastating story back in the 80s he took some l-tryptophan supplement and woke up in the middle of the night he said he felt like his body was being tortured he gave some to his brother and the same thing happened to the brother and then he found out later about the old tryptophan catastrophe this particular l-tryptophan was being produced by genetically engineered bacteria in Japan by a company called Showa denko and they were not aware that the process of genetic engineering was almost certainly the cause of these tiny contaminants that ended up killing about a hundred Americans and causing five to ten thousand to fall sick some became permanently disabled now the FDA covered up the genetically engineered roots when they spoke to Congress to report on the epidemic they ignored the fact that it was only the GMOs the versions that created the problem they took all l-tryptophan off the market blaming it generically on a amino acid which had been safe for years in the past and years to come and it was very much hush-hush they never did an investigation to verify but that is an example of a genetically engineered product which did in fact kill people yeah 1980s now more recently we have the genetically engineered crops but before that was introduced dr. Arpad Pusztai the leading researcher in the world in his field was given three million dollars by the UK government to figure out how to test for the safety of GMOs and he explained very clearly that the process of genetic engineering it turns out and it wasn't what he was expecting is inherently unsafe and within ten days the process of genetic engineering irrespective of what gene you put in caused potentially precancerous cells growth and the digestive tract smaller brains livers and testicles partial atrophy of the liver damaged immune system in his rats this was not Roundup Ready and it was not the groom it wasn't the particular gene that caused the problem he was the generic process yes well I remember Publishing a picture of the potentially precancerous Ella growth in the intestines and in the stomach in my book genetic roulette which was being read later by dr. Michelle pero a pediatrician she looked at the pictures and in a-ha went off on her mind said oh my god this is what's happening to the kids in the United States she had been a pediatrician for years and then starting around 2000 she started noticing that very complex diseases were happening the kids were not responding to the same treatments and she realized that the leaky gut and the changes that were happening as in the lab animals were happening in the humans she started putting her patients on organic diets and finally they got better now if that was the only data point that we had it would be very weak we have asked audiences at 150 lectures what did you notice when you got rid of GMOs and they basically defined a whole list of symptoms that were consistent over 150 lectures including about two dozen medical talks where the audience was talking about thousands and thousands of their patients so then we surveyed 3,000 256 people subscribers to the Institute for Responsible technology and they reported the same symptoms getting better with digestion at the top and brain fog and fatigue and weight problems and anxiety depression the exact same relative frequencies that we saw in these lectures and so I published a peer-reviewed article not only about the research but also showing how GMOs create how the modes of action from the genetic engineering process itself to the roundup to the Bt toxin insecticide that's produced in corn and cotton and South American soybeans how their modes of action could predict these problems we published the epidemiological charts showing high correlation between the rise of GMOs in roundup and these diseases and it turns out there's similar anecdotal evidence among pets and livestock the veterinarians that treat both again same thing as Michelle Perot saw and children Barbara Royal Oprah Winfrey's veterinarian saw it in cats and dogs others large large animal veterinarians saw it in pigs and cows so we actually have anecdotal evidence animal feeding studies showing that these same set of diseases the precursors of them are created in the lab and we have so many people and physicians saying it is absolutely clear and unmistakable when people take the GMOs out of their diet they get better so that's quite a powerful statement and I just want to be clear when you say take the GMOs out of your diet are you also referring to going organic generally that's all right or is that a distinction there are people getting those results when they go non-gmo but still eat for example non-organic wheat which might be sprayed with glyphosate etc I love your question we're getting both so when I talked to a pig farmer or a cow farmer they may take their animals off of GMO soy or GMO corn or both and notice a dramatic improvement in the health I talked to one farmer who he was blaming new genetics of pigs that have moved into the area probably from Canada to on his the fact that he went from having the easiest job on the farm because he was in charge of the nurse we have 300 piglets or 3,000 piglets to having the hardest time on the farm because all the piglets were getting sick and had to inject them with medicines all the time and he a friend of his said why don't you go non-gmo and he went non-gmo and he was shocked because the pigs started acting like they did 14 years before during that 14 years when they were feeding GMO soy they were sickly they were lying down all the time they weren't they weren't they didn't have the energy of piglets when he switched them to non-gmo soy they act like piglets again and this happened and he called his friend that had made the recommendation in 11 days he was stuttering and he could hardly he was hardly coherent because he evidently mo but when human sweat they still may end up with glyphosate or roundup sprayed all over the wheats the ODE etc and so when we did the survey of 3000 256 people we asked them what are the things did you do when you switched to non-gmo and a large percentage switched to organic at the same time we don't recommend doing the experiment in pieces we recommend going fully organic because that's where you gonna have the biggest impact because it's the roundup that's part of the problem and roundup isn't a lot of non GMO foods particularly the grains and the beans and just to be clear in case folks aren't aware of this it's used as a desiccant to dry out crops before harvest sometimes farmers are able to get an extra crop cycle in or it just makes the harvest process easier when glyphosate is used and that's all very lovely I want to make things easier for our farmers but not at the expense of our health and our well-being so what's happened is that right before harvest ah mostly wheat but also some oats some legumes various cereal crops are now being sprayed with glyphosate or roundup whose primary active ingredient is glyphosate and because it's right before a harvest researchers are estimating that potentially up to half of the actual exposure to glyphosate in the American diet is coming from these crops because there's so much absorbed by the plant and on the plant right at that particular vulnerable moment and so this is a heightened reason to go organic particularly with the cereal crops if you possibly can and beans because it turns out if you just have hummus that's not organic that is enormous or has been tested as an enormous amount of glyphosate residues same with lentils mung beans peas because it's sprayed on the beans and the grains but it's also sprayed in an orange grower orange orchards and an vineyard so it's in orange juice and wine so it's pretty pervasive we have a report of everyone's testing of glyphosate at the Institute for Responsible technology so you can it's many many pages and you could sort it to see what you need to avoid if you can't buy organic yeah for years I've been telling folks that if they want to avoid GMOs the main crops to look out for our corn soy canola cotton which is used in making cottonseed oil and sugar beets which about half our sugar supply is is made from genetically engineered sugar beets the other half is generally from cane sugar so but but now it's not quite so simple because a as you're saying there's a lot of other crops that are not genetically engineered but that are sprayed with Roundup which is a big deal and we also have some other crops coming on now they're maybe not high volume yet but there's the arctic apple there are certain potato varieties that are are genetically engineered as well so what can you tell us about the the newer developments I guess there's also some zucchini squash what are some of the newer developments that are maybe way more widespread than most people realize in terms of their exposure I was talking to professor emeritus Don Huber from Purdue University some years ago and he said the new GMOs that are coming they're gonna be a lot worse than the Roundup Ready varieties and he was talking about something called RNA interference and this is what's used in the potato and in the Apple what they do is they have DNA that produces a little strand of RNA and let's just let's just animate this RNA it goes around and it looks for pieces of the DNA that look like itself and then it globs on and it silences it so it silences aspects or genes within the DNA and what it's designed to do is silence the genes that turn the Apple or potato brown when it is sliced now what's interesting is and this is well known that RNA these little double-stranded RNA pieces can interact between species so if you feed honeybees double-stranded RNA as they did in one study for one single meal it altered the expression of 1400 genes 10% of the genome and the honeybees if you feed it to mice it can change their gene expression if you feed double-stranded RNA to humans it can change our expression so scientists at the EPA scientists at the USDA who were actually bullied they expressed concern about using this double-stranded RNA because if we eat the apple now the double-stranded RNA can survive digestion can get into the bloodstream what if it meets with our DNA and silence is something is it silencing something that's important is it silencing a regulatory gene that influences many other genes yeah so we say never ever ever eat the pre-sliced apples that are being sold on Amazon never eat the innate potato try and get organic potatoes as much as possible because you may end up reprogramming your own gene expression now the potatoes have some additional problems the person that made the potato he originally worked at Monsanto and then moved over to jr. Simplot the number one potato maker in the United States probably in the world and created these innate potatoes for them after he retired he started looking at the literature and then published a book which was called Pandora's potato the worst GMO and describes in page after page after page all the reasons why this particular potato that he created might get you sick and one example is that normally potatoes get bruised and then they turn brown and around those brown spots are toxins and those have to be cut away or the potato is discarded these are like Botox potatoes they lie about their age they don't show their bruises and it can end up with these same toxins in your stomach and no one will know along the entire processing chain because the visual cue which for centuries has told people don't eat that potato is being engineered out of the food supply so you may be eating the toxin as well as reprogramming your own gene expression now Monsanto and others Bayer want to create RNA interference sprays so you can spray on a crop it'll change the gene expression of insects for example and what if gets on the applicator what's if it gets them what if we eat that RNA interference chemical it might change our gene expression and this is something that they have no answer to they're just trying to push it through pretending that it's safe yes well so unless you're secretly living with a terror that you will turn brown in the middle of the night air you know it may not be and may not be for you I think that the the danger of this is quite considerable because as you point out the only thing that lives longer than gene genetic change is extinction and because because we're looking at things that you can't put the genie back in the bottle and it may be let's suppose that most or all of these things turn out to be safer than we thought but let's suppose that one genetically engineered food or chemical or RNA you know what's your term again your RNA interference right okay excuse me one RNA interference compound gets out and changes the gene pool forever not just in potatoes or corn or soy but in humans or in bacteria that's perhaps what's picking up for the bacteria because you have just landed on something bacteria can be far worse than genetically engineered corn or or a pig yeah it can there was an experiment done by the EPA reported by a whistleblower to dr. Elaine Ingham and she said that the EPA disavows this research they pretended was never done but she spoke to EPA members who not only swear it was done but they actually gave her the results they released genetically engineered bacteria in one location and monitored its movement and found that it had traveled 11 miles in the first growing season and then it continued to travel and continue to travel and within a few years it was found everywhere on the planet now why is this relevant because Elaine Ingham was also a involved in another almost release to genetically engineered bacteria which may have also gone around the world and it was engineered to turn plant matter into alcohol well-meaning scientists thought let's send this bacteria these bacteria to farmers they can mix it with the stubble from their crop fields instead of having to burn those fields that will turn that stubble into alcohol they could run their tractors and then take that nutrient-rich sludge at the bottom of the barrel spread it on the field as a fertilizer yes passed all the tests that the EPA required it was about to be released for that same type of experiment that the EPA did to see how far it would spread two weeks before it was going to be released Alain Ingram's graduate student she was the advisor he was doing research for his PhD wanted to get something done on GMOs so he got permission to use the GMO experiment that was being done he took that nutrient-rich sludge he mixed it with soil he planted weed seeds he showed up one Saturday morning at the lab and he found that the genetically engineered sludge had turned the wheat seedlings into mush it had turned the plants into alcohol killing them now I asked dr. Elaine Ingraham what would be a worst case scenario that's plausible that's realistic if they had released this bacteria and she said this particular bacteria Klebsiella plant Accola is found on every plant that has been evaluated on the root systems etc if the genetically engineered variety were out competing because it would turn stuff into alcohol and it would survive but the normal natural plant ticular would not she said it could render - it can end terrestrial plant life and terrestrial plant life that's not a catastrophe that's a Cataclysm now this was in the early 90s but it wasn't the first bacteria that was almost released in the late nineties in late eighties there was a genetically engineered bacteria that was designed to protect frost damage by taking normal bacteria which facilitates the creation of frost and instead putting an impotent variety in that could again out-compete and so it wouldn't create the frost it and they created this but they didn't release it widely if they are gone it may have altered weather patterns because now we know that that bacteria is airborne and it creates clouds and rain from moisture and it creates snow and frost and it could have altered the weather patterns and allowed weeds to survive through the winter and could have created a catastrophe or a cataclysm now you look at gene-editing it is so cheap you can genetically engineer bacteria and do-it-yourself kits that you can buy on Amazon today for 160 bucks that price is going to go down the the impact of the ability of that do-it-yourself kid is going to go up the bio hacking labs you can purchase now for $2,000 will increase in their capacity yeah well we have major transnationals with facilities packed with robots driven by artificial intelligence for massive release what happens if we release a hundred thousand or five hundred thousand or a million organisms in this generation that is a formula for a disaster because if there is a capacity for a a terrestrial plant life being knocked out or the or the weather patterns or anything like that yeah anyways were changing the structure of nature corrupting the gene pool irreversibly all future generations will be inheriting not the products of the billions of years of evolution but the products of laboratory creations whose number one most common result is surprise side-effects right so um this is obviously chilling to contemplate and I want to say and you may even I may have a slightly different take on this maybe not but for myself I am not ideologically opposed to genetic engineering in theory in other words if it could be done safely and was in the right hands and if we knew what we were doing and if we could somehow know that we were testing properly I'm the belief that it's a technology that could conceivably have benefit for humankind and for our planet however the profit motive distorts this horrendously and what we have done is we've given the power to create life in perpetuity and to create new life-forms and to alter life at its fundamental core into the hands of companies who are out to make money that's what's in their DNA and they do not have a conscience built into their DNA there's no conscience built into the stock market and so just just follow me for a second here if theoretically bayar once previously Monsanto could you know undertake a deal where there's a nine in ten chance that they'll make a hundred billion dollars on something and I want in ten chance that they will annihilate all life on earth from a business standpoint all conscience aside that would be a smart move because nine out of ten chance they're gonna make a killing right and what strikes me is that this is too powerful to leave in the hands of companies who just say trust us because quite frankly the stakes are too high and we've seen evidence that that Trust has been ill placed already lots and lots of it so um Jeffrey I want to ask you about one more piece here and then we've got a lot of questions from our food revolution do you want to respond to the idol oh sure yeah go ahead you please I think it's just like you said we may not be the same but then you gave your side I gotta get it is your take here yeah I agree I I have said that genetic engineering in certain capacities may be very helpful specifically for example correcting a defect in humans in a non inheritable way it might be useful to create certain products in a laboratory yeah we draw our line is two areas one absolutely no outdoor release of viable GMOs that could contaminate the gene pool and two no products of genetic engineering into the food supply which exposes it to the population yeah that's where we focus now because the at the Institute for Responsible technology we pioneered the messaging about the health dangers which has driven this tipping point that's underway forty six percent of Americans are seeking non-gmo food and the food companies are scrambling to get rid of it it's working like we predicted and like we engineered now what's interesting is human choice in the supermarket is not going to stop the introduction of genetically engineered bacteria which is happening this year by companies that are doing soil remediation genetically engineered bacteria which could end up in our gut which could change who knows what we need to institute a global awareness of what could go wrong so that everyone realizes we have come to this inevitable time in human history well can redirect the streams of evolution for all time and we don't have the moral or ethical compass or even a deep understanding of the implications of the practice so we need to lock it in the lab and keep it out of the food supply and that requires policy so for the first time in my 25 years doing this I'm like now completely rewriting our activism and we're raising money to create a global movement through the Institute for Responsible technology to bring in the climate change people for planetary survival the animal rights people the health people these religious people so that everyone realizes we now have to focus as a civilization to stop this or all future generations are gonna be suffering from our falling yes absolutely thank you so let's turn now to glyphosate the primary active ingredient in roundup and then and I'll ask you to be kind of brief here just because we have a lot of questions we haven't gotten to yet from our food revolutionaries okay all right so high level glyphosate is being used widely it's it's being used most of all on Roundup Ready crops but it's also being used as a desiccant why should that concern us it's as if this molecule was designed to damage or destroy the foundations of our health it eliminates the ability to access certain minerals which can run our bodies it is an antibiotic and we know that it changes the gut bacteria in ways that can lead to many diseases it can cause leaky gut which is linked to inflammation and many diseases and autoimmune disease it can damage the DNA and is linked to cancer it's named as a class 2a carcinogen it can possibly reduce the availability of the neurotransmitter serotonin melatonin and dopamine causing anxiety sleeplessness pain etc it can damage the mitochondria which is the foundation of lifespan prevention of cancer and so many other diseases it can prevent the production of certain digestive enzymes and damage the linings of the intestines and get started it's also linked to birth defects and when injected into pregnant mice there was an epigenetic inherited effect so that the pregnant the the offspring were fine the grandchildren were really messed up but the the organ the generation that got the worst hit was the great-grandchildren or 90% of that generation of these mice ended up with serious diseases deaths during during giving birth prostate problems kidney problems obesity so it is really a dangerous molecule yeah it sounds like it okay and we already covered kind of how to avoid it which is basically going organic non-gmo and that helps I suppose it's not being used that we know of on a lot of fruits and vegetables right now other than maybe zucchini with the genetically engineered variety is that no the zucchinis not Roundup Ready it's viral resistant I there it's you know because it's used in vineyards for the lines of the vineyards it'll end up in grapes okay yes however in certain parts of the country in the rain so there's tiny amounts of glyphosate residues and things that you wouldn't think of so we just have to say yeah we're not gonna get rid of it a hundred percent and to stop it being sprayed in your area a lot of citizens are having a lot of success getting it stopped and if you go to roundup risks com we have a training program for people to help to make that happen in their area okay roundup risks calm thank you now let's go to some questions from our food revolutionaries Barbara said I see a couple of different things on labels indicating non GMO is one better than another is it just that one is certified yes I go with the non-gmo project verification which is that butterfly some companies will do self certification so Cheerios for example they declare non-gmo on the side of their normal traditional Cheerios not the honey nut cheerios I called him up and said what do you consider non-gmo they said that's proprietary I said to you is it just that you tell your farmers not to use it do you actually do tests do you do simple strict tests or do you do the PCR in the laboratory and do you have a rejection threshold what it or do you allow things that come in made from GMOs but simply don't have the DNA they would not answer the question same thing with Trader Joe's they say we're non GMO with anything that our name on it but they don't tell us how a non-gmo project has published standards that we think are very strong so we think that's the way to go yes okay thank you we heard from Murray who said I hope I'm choosing all non-gmo when I buy organic maple for organic usually starts with a nine produce with a label starting three or four are these considered GMO what is the difference between the food label starting three or four how can we know a produce is GMO or are there certain produce slash foods to avoid altogether because they're GMOs great question so there's an inventory control method used at produce places where the nine a five digit code beginning with a nine means that it's organic they actually created a system saying that if anyone wanted to tell people that it was GMO they would have a five digit that started with eight you can ignore that no one uses it it was never designed for consumers it's completely a theoretical thing that's still circulating on the Internet ignore it so organic does not allow the intentional use of GMOs now it's possible that there's contamination organic does not require testing for levels of contamination so it's possible depending on what it is that there's small levels of of GMOs the non-gmo project does require testing if you're using anything that might be a GMO so you might see organic and non-gmo project verified on the same package that I would say would be the gold standard because it avoids the roundup because it's organic and it's not supposed to use GMO because it's organic and there's been testing to verify that the system is keeping the level either low or non-existent now when you go to the produce section there's not a lot of GMOs on there so there's notes basically these are the these are the GMOs on the marketplace right now soy corn cotton canola sugar beets alfalfa yellow squash zucchini papaya from Hawaii or China apples and potatoes and there's also salmon that's been sold in Canada not yet in the United States now that's not a lot of the produce section so anything that I didn't mention is not genetically engineered at this time not seedless watermelons not pluots those are not genetically engineered in the lab and the ways that we're talking about now if you're gonna buy a zucchini make sure it's organic you're gonna buy yellow squash make sure it's organic so if you really want to avoid not every zucchini that's not not organic is GMO but it's like you know Clint Eastwood feeling lucky so you have to decide whether you're willing to take that risk thank you a couple questions really going a little deeper on the same theme jane said is there an available list of all the foods that are genetically engineered and mark said i buy a lot of raw food items in my bulk food store however there are not a lot of organically produced items there so I have no idea what's GMO is there a set of grains or other bulk foods that I should assume is GMO or non-gmo well we kind of answered the question but we did it very quickly by naming them you really want to have them written down because if you're listening to this and you're on the run you're not writing them down you go non-gmo shopping guide.com which is a free service from the Institute for Responsible technology we list all the products that have been verified by the non-gmo project we list which products are genetically engineered that list has been stable for a while but I did not mention this that animal products from animals that are not raised organic or 100% grass-fed are usually animals that have been fed genetically engineered soy corn cottonseed meal canola meal sugar beet pulp or alfalfa and some of the dairy products in the United States are from cows that have been ejected with genetically engineered bovine growth hormone which I was talking to a former Monsanto scientist he said three of his colleagues at Monsanto found so much cancer promoting hormone in the milk from treated cows the three months Santo scientists refused to drink milk thereafter unless it was organic one bought his own cow now there are genetically engineered cooking agents flavorings etc etc one example that we want to avoid at all costs in my opinion is the impossible burger because that's genetically engineered yeast to produce something called heme it ends up producing the 46 additional proteins none of which have been characterized as healthy in the food supply and it also uses Roundup Ready soy that had been sprayed with route a nonprofit group gathering testimonials of people that got sick after eating the impossible burger don't become a casualty friends don't let friends eat the impossible burger yeah if you want to be healthy then make it impossible alright thanks Jeffrey so um let's see we heard from alder new ostrov seedless grapes GMO no fortunately not what happens is the seedless grapes the seedless watermelons they come from crossbreeding they're not the genetic engineering things we take a gun and you shoot millions of genes into a plate of millions of cells and clone the cells into a plant you can cross breed and get things like pluots and seedless grapes so you can relax about those and if you get a chance try heirloom varieties because we now have a loss of biodiversity if it's so great because there's been a pushing of certain few varieties that can ship well or be picked mechanically that some of the diversity and some of that richness and flavor and the health benefits of the variety of of what nature has been given us for thousands of years is being lost so not only for your own health but also to support the system the supply system to grow that diversity and richness look for heirloom varieties as well alrighty thank you so much for that and let's see I'm seeing lots of other questions here so Janet said we eat organic and Beyond Organic foods are the foods that will support our health while being around barded with EMF cell towers our devices iPhones iPads TV etc Janet I can refer you to an article we actually wrote on this topic if you google Food Revolution org space detoxifying or detox you'll find it it's an article about 12 detoxifying foods that have actually shown to help your body detoxifying clear away toxins from your environment and those basically think the quick punchline is its cruciferous vegetables and leafy greens its lemons it's avocados it's green tea apples garlic chlorella turmeric beets blueberries cilantro and ginger lots more in the article about why those specific foods work how they work what they do what the studies actually show what kinds of things that help your body clear away but that's the the fast list and obviously organic is helpful so I mentioned apples for example on that list well it doesn't do you a whole lot of good if you're trying to detoxify with apples but you're eating apples that were sprayed with pesticides and we're genetically engineered so do your best to you know clean to the best way to detoxify is to not bring the toxins in in the first place but some of us are gonna get some anyway and we want to optimize our body's ability to clear away the junk so we can be optimally healthy and do our job well to get rid of the bad stuff when we're exposed to it in fact well there's two major ways that the body detox is the several but the liver and the cells themselves in both of those cases glyphosate helps prevent those type of detoxification it prevents the ability for these site protein site enzymes to work in the liver and it also reduces the nrf2 which is the way that the cells will detox and so by taking glyphosate in all the other toxins become more elevated if they were normally released during these pathways so being organic is critical especially to avoid the roundup so that the detoxification pathways will get rid of the these chemicals that are in your system now thanks Jeffrey Heather asked what happens when GMO food roundup and other pesticides heavy metals and environmental toxins are Julianne's and by EMFs especially the coming 5g and I'll impact us at once what is the effect on both our Center microbiome and so obviously we've been talking about some of these toxins so I guess she's really talking about what happens when the cumulative takes place and also do you see 5g as being significant in this so I interviewed 18 experts for healing from GMOs and roundup online conference and Dietrich Ling guard and leak out and both doctors who are very well known among functional medicine and integrative medicine both talked about the fact that glyphosate damages the gut bacteria and so does the EMF fields like whether it be 5g or your Wi-Fi etc and they said the two worked together and so they recommend it as part of their protocol for healing from the impact of GMOs and roundup was to not only switch to organic but also to limit exposure to these fields now there may be other ways that they work together but I don't have and there probably are other ways that it works it works together especially with the heavy metals and all that now heavy metals it's interesting there was a serious outbreak of kidney disease in Sri Lanka and in the Central America where a huge percentage of farmworkers ended up on dialysis or dying and there was a study done where they they postulated that the glyphosate would bind with arsenic that was found in the area because they're spraying with our spraying with glyphosate there was arsenic in the area and then it would bind together because it's a key later it holds on to it which would smuggle it into the system than into the kidneys and in the kidney environment it would cause the two to separate and the arsenic and the glyphosate would damage or kill the kidney and so that's a way that glyphosate works with heavy metals in this case arsenic to make it much worse yes thank you these things really do compound you can't just look at any one thing in isolation right but the key thing is we're never gonna be able to get rid of every toxin it's ever been invented on this planet but we do the best we can right so minimize the load and to optimize the health and help our bodies respond effectively to the stuff that we can't control you know there's the old the what's called the serenity prayer helped me to release or to accept the things I cannot change to give me the courage to change the things I can and give me the wisdom to know that friends interestingly it's not just about serenity you could also call it the courage prayer or the wisdom prayer I suppose because we're talking about all three of those things and in this case there is a certain amount of serenity I don't want to live in fear of things I can't control or can't do anything about I don't think that helps anybody fear is actually bad for your health but effective response manifesting courage in response to the violations that we see is an act of self-love and dignity so let's have wisdom too you know what if you if you're not in a financial position to afford to go 100 percent organic right now number one focus on cutting out food waste eat out a restaurants less preparing bulk focus on the basic staples the more of the organic foods that are affordable like legumes do not cost an arm and a leg you know even organic right the quinoa even you know cabbage carrots mushrooms some of these things can be pretty darn affordable and they're so nutrient packed and you know and of course go organic as much as you can you know but as we've mentioned not everything is on the same playing field there so if you if you not gonna go organic with something make sure it's not one of the crops that's genetically engineered widely and that's gonna be a helpful way to protect yourself and your family we had a question come in from Ruth this will be the last one from our participants here she said should we wash organic produce what about non GMO foods that are not labeled organic how safe are they I think we've addressed the second part as far as washing first let's clarify is it helpful to wash GMO crops well the question was should we wash organic food and I would have I'm gonna start and that's it right there because it's really interesting I was talking to Dietrich Ling Hart in the interview and he was talking about how sometimes the microbiome on the crops maybe in some cases healthier than the nutrients in the crops themselves he talked about how certain herbs may be efficacious because of the specific microbiome that's attracted those herbal plants he talked about green leafy vegetables where we may be able to only process and assimilate 5% of the nutrients but they're still very very healthy maybe the microbiome on those green leafy or the lettuces etc so he said that he does not he does not wash the organic produce and I've since he's said that I found out that several of my friends also do not wash the organic produce it kind of depends where it's coming from and whether there's viruses out there but anyway yeah that's one thing so I'll let people make that decision but it's an interesting concept now for non-organic things yeah I think washing is important but it's not gonna take glyphosate out of the inside because glyphosate what happens is they combine it with a surfactant which is extremely dangerous it drives the glyphosate poison into the crop it gets deposited into the food portion fifteen percent goes out through the roots but the rest hangs out in the crop itself and when you when you take that food you can't wash it off but there are there are basic chemicals that are on the surface of the chemical Laden industry so washing it is not a bad idea but you can't guarantee that you're gonna get rid of all the chemicals yeah absolutely and we did run an article on this if you google food revolution wash you'll pull up the article again that's food revolution wash about how to wash vegetables and fruits to remove pesticides so if you're eating crops that are not genetically engineered necessarily but fruits and vegetables that may have been sprayed with pesticides it turns out if you use baking soda and mix about a tablespoon into a gallon of water you create a solution that has been proven to remove far more of the pesticides than just water would you soak it for about 15 minutes and that can do a lot of good again it's all about what you can afford obviously if you can go organic you avoid a lot of the pesticides in the first place not all of them there are some insecticides used even in organic agriculture not glyphosate but some others that are not particularly great and this comes back to really the question of what is your source I I would never wash vegetables from our organic garden for example because I actually think that some of the little bits of bacteria that are on there are actually good for me but if I'm getting it from the store different story unless you know who grew it your farmers market arguable depends how big is the operation how are they running things you know are they using manure from factory farms for example right because if they're doing that then there could be some pathogenic bacteria on your lovely organic kale leaf and you might not want to eat that but if it's a natural system that's that's regenerative and that's another story and good bacteria is good for us so it all depends on source and your values and obviously if you have any particular vulnerabilities then maybe it becomes more important so Geoffrey I think we've covered a lot here anything more you want to say to our participants as we move towards completion well I think that the concept that we have arrived at this inevitable time in human history where we have the capacity to replace nature in this generation with gene edited alternatives is gives a moment of pause but it gives a sense now that we can actually protect all living beings in all future generations in this generation we could take steps that we can actually bless by protecting all of nature and all future human offspring and that's not something that our ancestors had as an opportunity because there was never a threat that could actually cause such widespread damage through time and space so we can if you know just as before we were looking at whether you can afford organic I loved your answers it sounded like you were sounded like me you know talking about not worrying and not being upset that you can't follow everything I also want to say that when you hear about the possibility of replacing nature and if you go to protect nature now.com we have a three-minute video which describes this threat and I'm going to create a new one about that bacteria which we just talked about that I'm working on today it's an opportunity for us to do something great for the future for all living beings for all future generations and it's an opportunity rather than a burden if we choose it to be that way we can choose whether we're a victim or a victim we can decide what we consider food and when we consider food shaped objects it's our opportunity to take charge and what's interesting is I was speaking in Hawaii at the end of 2019 and a Hawaiian elder explained to me what Aloha aina is it's this reciprocity of love of the land we love nature and there's a reciprocal love a reciprocal support and this I can relate from my own experience and maybe you can too when we step up voices speaking on behalf of nature protecting nature it's as if there's wind below our sails and it's an advanced technique that I can not speak more highly about of of propelling us as if we are getting supported by nature so rather than taking this as a burden and taking this as a fear take this as an opportunity and an invitation to participate perhaps you can confer provide financial support perhaps you can get involved as an activist perhaps you've become what I call a click incent revolutionary by getting the information and posting it in any case what we're doing together is laying the foundation to protect nature now yes absolutely and you really do vote with every dollar you spend and every bite you take for the future of food and how it's growing and and the truth is that as food companies recognize that there's money to be made in non-gmo foods and crops they start prioritizing we've already got a two-tiered system where farmers that are non-gmo what certain crops can make more money for their harvest then not then GMO crops can and obviously organic makes even more money and so it seems to me that we have an incredible opportunity to create a marketplace demand for certified non-gmo and in their process to shift the course of history to help protect life we obviously protect ourselves but I want everyone watching to remember this isn't just about you this is about how food is growing and the future of food on this planet so Geoffrey I thank you so much for your decades of courageous leadership in this field for your dedication as always to not just personal health
