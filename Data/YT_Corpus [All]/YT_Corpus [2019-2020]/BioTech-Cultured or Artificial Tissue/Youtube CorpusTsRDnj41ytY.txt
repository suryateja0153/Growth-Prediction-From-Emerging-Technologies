 good afternoon i'm david ackerly dean of the rouser college of natural resources at uc berkeley the department of plant and microbial biology is one of the five departments in the college pmb is pleased to announce a series of events and programming in honor of the department's 30th anniversary like all of you we had hoped these events would be in person and hopefully we will come together in the future and for now we'll come to you virtually and hope we can reach a really broad audience that way to commemorate its three decades of research teaching and service pmb is hosting a series of online talks through 2020 that cover topics which reflect the department's deep contributions to fields that include the basic biology of plants and microbes applications of crispr cast 9 to agriculture innovation and entrepreneurship and close ties between industry and academia please visit the department's website at pmb.berkeley.edu to watch for announcements of future events you may have heard the inaugural talk on june 12th titled of virulent viruses and reservoir hosts with pnb professor b excuse me britt glassinger as it was featured on the berkeley concert berkeley conversations coveted 19 series the talk was recorded and can still be accessed at the berkeley conversations website today's talk is on the future of food i'm pleased to moderate today's panel discussion with two people who are very well known to the pmb and rouser college community we'll be taking live questions via uh via facebook live or youtube live whichever format you may be listening in and we'll come to those a little later in the session we're also recording the talk and it will go live shortly after we wrap up today brian staskewitz received his phd in plant pathology here at

2019 pam was awarded the american society of plant biologists leadership in science public service award cam and bryan are here to discuss the role of new agricultural breeding technologies in the quest to feed the world's growing population while enhancing the sustainability of our agricultural practices around the world in a world approaching 8 billion people with most of the available arable land already in use for agriculture and the threat of a rapidly changing climate this challenge has never been more pressing and immediate ryan can you set the stage for us by describing the scope of the challenge in front of us in relation to the work you do and the topic of today's discussion and welcome to everybody um this afternoon it's a pleasure to join in this um panel um as david said the world's population currently is about 7.9 to 8 billion people and it's predicted by 2050 to reach 10 billion people and unfortunately we have to basically grow food greater more than 70 percent increase in production during this time period to feed the world unfortunately also that this is uh exacerbated by climate change so being able to grow this food in an environmentally sustainable fashion is going to be extremely important as i mentioned climate change really will have a major impact on disease pressures in plants we already know that pandemics such as wheat blast are occurring in bangladesh in india because of various jumps in hosts in addition many plant disease resistance genes are also temperature sensitive which as you can imagine as the climate increases the temperature increases the effectiveness of these genes will be lost so to meet these challenges new technologies will be needed to increase food production in addition high input resource intensive farming systems which have caused massive deforestation water scarcities soil depletions and high levels of greenhouse gas emissions cannot deliver sustainable food in agricultural production obviously there are no simple answers to these problems but we have to find a way to produce food in an environmentally sustainable fashion that is we need to decrease farmer inputs such as water fertilizers and pesticides i am optimistic that we are developing the tools to accomplish these goals and this will be the subject of some talk today thank you thanks brian uh pam turning to you can you elaborate more on what it means when you think about making agriculture sustainable locally and globally and into the century ahead what and and put that in the context of these very fundamental challenges that brian has laid out yeah i think brian uh pointed out some really important goals uh for all of us that using land and water more efficiently is is going to be critical most of the arable land has already been farmed so the land that we have we we need to use much more efficiently and brian also mentioned reducing harmful inputs there are other challenges uh such as maintaining soil fertility will continue to be really an important goal for farmers and maintaining farmland we have to think about farmers themselves how they can thrive economically not only in the united states but in other parts of the world and finally we really need to be sure that we can keep food affordable for even the poorest people in in the world and uh i also like to thank you for including me in this conversation and i'm really pleased that uh to be here and appreciate the audience for joining in thank you thanks pam brian i know when you're when you teach uh when you teach here on campus you you paint a picture of the the broad sweep of the history of agriculture for our students and putting our modern challenges in context so if you go back to the beginnings of agriculture farmers and and plant breeders have have worked uh together and in parallel over many centuries to bring us the crops that we have today can you share a little bit about that history of crop reading and and how it brings us to the technologies that are available to us today absolutely so as we have discussed in my classes a lot um all plants many people don't know this that have a geographic origin in the world for example corn or maize was originated in mexico rice and soybean in asia and wheat in the middle east so these are distinct areas agriculture is considered to be approximately and depending on the studies you read between 10 to 14 000 years old and all our modern crops rose through the domestication of these wild relatives that originated in these parts of the world as plants were domesticated plant breeders deployed these ancient varieties of as sources of traits that they introduced into modern day varieties by classical plant breeding meaning taking pollen from parent a and putting it to parent b and getting progeny from that so just classical plant breeding making genetic crosses in fact plant breeding as a science was only developed in the early 1900s and as we know it today has become extremely sophisticated and deploys modern tools of dna marker assisted breeding and also employ deploys employs crop genomics but unfortunately plant breeding is very inefficient and takes many years to introduce these traits into our high yielding ergonomic varieties that we use today thus new breeding tools that we will discuss today will be needed to breed varieties faster and more efficiently so we can adapt to the climate changes that are occurring throughout the world today and uh and we will definitely circle back and talk more about the actual uh the mechanisms of what we mean by those new technologies but pam maybe over the course of your cr if you think over the course of your career can just give us some examples what it means as a researcher to be on the ground so to speak or in the lab applying these technologies or the kinds of traits that you've worked on the uh the crops you've worked on and and what it's meant to be a scientist uh involved in all this work well it's been um really fantastic to be uh involved in plant biology for so many years and i had the privilege of working with scientists at the international rice research institute really from very early in my career so i was trained in brian's lab lucky me and learned a lot about disease resistance and when i began my first postdoc and first position i uh worked with uh gerd of koosh and others who had discovered a wild species of rice that had a really important gene for resistance and so many of the resistance genes that we use um and that are in our crops have been derived from some of these ancient varieties or or diverse species and so uh that has been something i've i spent a lot of time working on trying to understand the molecular basis of disease resistance in this wild species of rice from mali and then uh more recently i had the honor to work with david mchale who also had um he's at uc davis cornell with me but also spent time at the international rice research institute brought to my attention uh challenges faced by farmers growing rice in many parts of asia primarily eastern india and bangladesh who often lose their crops to flooding so flooding is predicted to be increasingly common as as the climate changes and most rice varieties will die if they're completely submerged for more than three days so dave and i were able to isolate a gene that conferred resistance or tolerance to this flooding and the international research institute led by dave and his colleagues were able to introduce this gene into varieties grown by farmers in bangladesh and india using marker assisted breeding which brian mentioned which is a a genetic technique that's not regulated it has been really important for developing new varieties so this variety has does really fantastic so even after two weeks of flooding the plants can survive and thrive so the plants that have um this gene are have about a 60 yield advantage and this is really important for farmers uh in eastern india and bangladesh who are able to harvest grain even in in the face of of severe flooding and last year about six million farmers grew this rice which is called sub one rice pam if you i want to follow up briefly on a comment you just made because you talked about the traits that are important for farmers and then of course for those of us who are on the other end eating the food the question is what are the traits that that as consumers were looking for so as as researchers and as plant scientists what is that balance of the traits that farmers want and the traits that consumers want in the in the ones that have drawn attention in in the research community so one thing to keep in mind is for a crop like rice the farmer is the consumer so most people that are growing rice in less developed countries are subsistence farmers so that means that they grow uh really only enough rice to feed themselves and their families so when a farmer has the ability to grow rice even uh under flooded conven conditions that means that they're able to feed their families and sometimes even sell some of that rice to bring in some income that they can use uh to support their children's education for example and then if you're uh if you're in a developed country and are possibly not concerned with uh how farmers are um able to grow their foods uh so you know there are there are many different types of traits that consumers in in developed countries are interested in and and particularly people are interested in color and flavor and diversity and um taste of course so um but those are also concerns of of farmers in the less developed part of the world as well is that what you meant yeah well absolutely and of course and of course what consumers want is of concern to what farmers are growing because this is a it's an integrated system and part of sustainability is financial sustainability and if there's not a more you know what does the market want and if there's not a market then that's going to impact of course practices on the farm so the food system might be one of the you know most complex parts of our modern society that entire chain right from the soil all the way through to the to the waste product at the other end so lots of moving pieces so you've been talking about rice and and brian i want to talk a little bit more about the diversity of crops so in in the northern hemisphere or perhaps almost across the entire globe a huge majority of the calories that we all eat come from just a few crops and corn and soy and wheat and rice i think top that list but of course around the world people eat a whole lot of different things and of course we all enjoy diversity in our diet so in your work in the innovative genomics institute what's the what other i'm curious what other crops you're working on and what the motivation is like what are the what are the crops that really need attention as we face the challenges of the 21st century 21st century absolutely so um the igi which is the innovative genomics institute um which was started a few years ago by jennifer doudna um basically um since it's a lot of philanthropy funds our research we decided to work on crops that really impact a lot of the developing world and i think it's it's fair to say that crispr technologies or gene editing technologies will probably have a greater effect on billions of people in the world where in medicine maybe hundreds of thousands so i think it's quite evident that i think that using gene editing technologies in agriculture is going to be extremely important so we set out a very robust plant transformation dna delivery systems and we establish crops such as wheat and rice as being important and we're able to actually regenerate plants and not just the model plants but the ones that farmers actually use in the field but i think a couple of other examples that we're currently working on is that we work on cacao people that like chocolate are interested in cacao what you should realize is that 50 of the world's chocolate is produced in the ivory coaster cote d'ivoire and that it's subject to this really important um virus disease called cacao swollen shoot virus so we are working in collaboration with um mars corporation who gave us a nice gift to actually study how we could actually use gene editing to alleviate this particular pathogen from cacao so very important it's a very challenging crop we have very recently about ready to submit a manuscript where we've actually accomplished um with myeong j cho who's the director of plant transformation and genomics the ability to actually manipulate um cacao plants in tissue culture so that's that's a great advancement another crop that we work on that companies don't work on is we work on cassava and cassava is a plant that originated in south america but it's grown a lot in africa so smallholder farmers and one of the major problems with cassava is that a lot of the roots produce cyanide and they're very toxic to the people that eat this and they can cause various diseases in the smallholder farmers when they eat these various crops so we have developed systems now where we have identified the genes that are involved in making cyanide in cassava and preliminary results suggest that we have eliminated cyanide production from these plants and um so this is a great accomplishment we hope to be able to field trial these in the near future so cassava is a plant that many people as i said but it's not it's not a cash crop so you don't find companies working on these so we feel that an institute such as the uh igi who's got these resources can apply these to crops that are important for the developing world um you know we work on some other we work on tomatoes also where there's some diseases that we're involved with but major crops are wheat rice cacao and cassava that we talked about yeah i early in my career i had the great opportunity to spend quite a bit of time living in brazil and working in the amazon and ate a lot of cassava because that becomes a real staple uh and just it's something that's on the table in various forms you know with every meal and something that's not part of our diet at all in the northern hemisphere and that kind of in that way brian i want to i want to stay with you for a moment and because you've mentioned crispr we've talked about crispr you mentioned gene editing for our for a gener for our broad public audience out there most people just know the term gmo and it's just this one word and it's a it's a it's a single term and yet it encompasses a very wide variety of underlying technologies and biological discoveries so i i think this is a this is really an important moment just can you share from uh especially you work with the igi what how to make sense of that term gmo and then what does this word gene editing mean like because that is of course we're hearing this much more in you know popular discourse in the media in the media so typically a gmo is a plant that is created um by using plant transformation with a vector called agrobacterium tumofations which is a natural soil bacterium that transfers its dna to plants and scientists in the 1970s early 80s found a way to disarm these particular plasmids and insert genes of interest and then put them into plants now one of the criticisms people have had about gmos is that when you insert dna into plants it goes into a random part of the genome so we can't control that now gene editing is an invention that actually it's a natural system that bacteria have used to fight bacteriophages or viruses that infect um pathogens i mean these these phages that come in these bacteriophages and the bacterium can actually eliminate them by recognizing the dna and then cutting it into small bits and so um essentially what crispr allows you to do is to do aggregate do more precise gene insertions into the place so we can now direct and target genes into the plant in a very precise way that we couldn't do with gmos and that in fact in the united states aphis which is the animal plant health inspection agency the new rules and regulations say that plants that where we make simple insertions or deletions are not regulated as a gmo and they don't pose any greater risk than would naturally be done so um i want to just to continue at that moment one of the analogies that you often hear is that the genome is like the book you know a book and a lot what's happening in evolution is the the letters are changing the words are changing and some of those mutations or it's like a typo have no meaning at all and then some are quite important so so it sounds like in some cases what these technologies have done is like taking a whole section of someone of a different book and moving it in like just you know copying and pasting versus the equivalent of a word processor of uh you know making a correction a change here or a change there am i pushing the analogy too far does that help i think i think these analogies have you know you can think of it as a word process so for people in the audience that aren't familiar with this that some of the applications that are being done in biomedicine so for instance they've been very successful now there are trials out there right now where sickle cell anemia has been identified by a particular mutation and so scientists can go in now and basically change the gene very simply by using a crispr technology to change that so we can make precise changes we can change the um that basically correct a bad allele for a good allele and the same thing could be done in plants we can do that but also in plants we're hopefully going to be able to and pam can talk about this later insert blocks of genes into plants to actually um that pam has done for um with vitamin a we can she can talk about that maybe too so i think it's a very those those are good analogies for people so we're able it's really the precision that we're able to do with this and at the end of the day we can actually um tell people these are the precise modifications that we've made as opposed to gmo you're you're kind of don't know where it goes into the plan and then i suppose the other important difference is gene sequencing is now so powerful that after making the change you can verify right we can we you can verify what actually changed and know that the background is more stable i mean i know pam and your um pam in your book you you just leave the anecdote of something that cost millions of dollars just 15 years ago the genome sequencing is now you know just a thousand dollars or a few thousand dollars that the pace of change in this area has been truly breathtaking now pam when you talk about the rice you you mentioned bringing a gene from wild rice so clearly in some cases you know we need to know where these where can we find these traits is an important question and i think there's a lot of recognition that the wild relatives of our crops are incredibly important sources of material so we're we we are we really depend on the maintenance of those wild varieties as well as trying to develop you know more uh more productive crops so can you that's a specific question but maybe if you can just think about that but also just put in broader context what's the role of biological diversity in developing our you know our cropping systems and i'm going to feed you a second part to this question your husband's an organic farmer some people might find that a bit unusual to have an organic farmer and a plant breeder it's working side by side and you've written a book together because the other part of the diversity question is the role of diversity on farms and ques you know serious questions we've been addressing for decades but the vulner the potential vulnerability of monoculture is the the value of diversity within a farming system so i'm just a couple different questions about the nature of biological diversity and the role it plays in agriculture yeah well as you pointed out there's biological diversity on farms in the in the sense that you don't want to just plant one variety on massive acreage um and it's nice to sometimes put in different species uh intercropping and so there's a lot of examples like that and then for genesis often biological diversity means uh bringing in uh different genetic materials so to make your um your line more diverse more resistant to disease and we scientists for many years have been bringing in uh genes from wild species so there is transfer between species um that's been going on for for many years in in breeding so that that's very very very important because if you can bring in a diverse set of genes then you're going to be less vulnerable to epidemics there's also biological diversity that you can bring in from outside the plant kingdom and so the the best most famous example of that is the bt gene from bacteria which has been very very important to farmers globally so this is a genetic engineering technique where you isolate a gene from a bacteria that confirms resistance to an insect so farmers have been able to massively reduce insecticide spraying so that type of genetic diversity i think will continue to be very important as we we go forward uh genome editing is obviously very very exciting and an important tool but i think we're going to continue to see more conventional methods of genetic improvement to be used by farmers widely yeah there's quite a few facets i mean many many different facets there that come together now a lot of people think of science as a scientist alone in the lab and everyone in science knows that's the far from the truth that it's a highly collaborative enterprise and in that on that note i'm i want to step back for a moment and uh just let the two you two of you be in conversation a bit so pam why don't you kick it off to uh a lot your longtime colleague okay and mentor uh so brian you first taught me about selection pressure which i think is a really important concept for people that are not in the agricultural community to understand so i i'd like to ask you to talk about selection pressure kind of explain why farmers can't just get one variety and forget about um developing new varieties um sort of this idea of the ability of pathogens to overcome resistance how important that is and also what kind of efforts you and igi are doing to try to engineer durable resistance great it's something i've been studying my entire life i guess or academic life and um so we talked about um taking traits from wild species of plants and plant breeders have then genetically crossed these into plants unfortunately we usually take one trait at a time and so you have a think of a field where every plant is genetically identical out there and it turns out that pathogens are quite tricky and that they're able to actually make mutations and that's due to selection pressure so any time in biology when you put pressure whether it be antibiotic resistance whether it be disease resistance it's a matter of time before the pathogen will you'll select for mutations that it can overcome that resistance i don't want to go into the details of that but we now understand the mechanisms how this actually works but what happens is that a farmer plants a crop and it's usually only a matter of several years when the pathogen will mutate and overcome that resistance and now cause disease on their previously disease resistant plant and the whole process has to start over again where you have to try to find new genes for disease resistance and then breed those into the agronomic varieties that you need so it's a constant biological warfare between the plant and the pathogen going back and forth so to try to counteract this effect there are many theories in which people are trying to do for durable resistance one approach that we're trying to do at the igi is to actually identify multiple disease resistance genes and so instead of actually inserting or genetically crossing one gene at a time we want to bring these genes in as a block so for instance if we can bring six disease resistance genes in at one time that the chance that a pathogen can you'll select for a pathogen that will overcome all six of these genes is greatly reduced not only that you can start mixing and matching disease resistance genes such that you can distribute them within the field and not have all the plants genetically uniform so this is the power of gene editing or crispr technology is that we can introduce genes that we can't do by classical breeding into plants and so making these novel combinations of disease-resistant genes we hope to be able to actually make more durable resistance great thanks brian as you've watched i wanted to let you toss the question back to pam as you watch your own proteges rise and flourish in her career it's always great to have students like pam um i think a question i'd like to have you um ask to you is that you know we talked about gmos we talked about gene editing and i think one of your more recent publications is a great um experiment where you actually made um plant rice plants that actually would help cure blindness so if you could compare and contrast your efforts with gmos with those of gene editing for traits that you're interested in developing and maybe draw upon your book which i think is something that people should read i'll give you a plug for your book also okay thanks um so for the carotenoid rice so maybe just to to go back a little bit um the audience may be familiar with golden rice which is a really tremendous uh exciting breakthrough by peter bayer and endo ingo petricus a number of years ago now and so the rockefeller foundation supported them to develop rice that had higher amounts of ultimately vitamin a and the reason is that vitamin a deficiency is a very uh serious problem in many parts of the world it's estimated that 500 000 children go blind every year and half of the children die so this is obviously a a very serious um situation it's especially prevalent in areas where uh families don't have a diverse diet they're eating rice three times a day they don't have access to other types of foods that are nutrient rich and so the idea was to engineer um carotenoids which are the precursor of vitamin a into rice and they they've been very successful and there is a rice variety that's that's been approved for food consumption in many countries now including bangladesh as well as developed countries new zealand united states canada and i think it's the last regulatory hurdle and hopefully it'll be in the hands of farmers soon but we we got very interested in this and thought it would be a nice pilot test to try to use genome editing to introduce this particular cassette into rice and we chose it obviously because it's a very important for socio-economic reasons but also um it's it gave us a nice example so it's big it's like 5.2 kb so oliver dong in my lab really who carried out the major uh most of the experiments was able to identify what we call landing pads so a region of the rice genome that when you insert a new gene will not disrupt other essential gene function and so he was able to identify a number of landing pads and was able to insert this carotenoid cassette into two regions of the genome and he he was able to come up with these golden uh golden rice so they're golden they have high levels of of carotenoids so it's sort of a proof of concept that we will be able to use genome editing to intro introduce uh agronomically important traits uh two specific regions of the genome um pam just quickly some of some of our listeners remember a cassette as something you put into a sony walkman and some have no idea what we're talking about what what does a cassette mean in uh in gene in genetics okay so a cassette so back in the day we'd put a single gene into a plant and we'd study um how that plant grows and you know how it resists disease but now scientists are able to in a sense reconstruct biosynthetic pathways so the the endosperm the rice grain that we eat does not produce any uh vitamin a and um colleagues over the years were able to identify really just two genes that needed to be added so in this sense a cassette is a cassette of um two to three genes that you can insert as a unit uh into the genome thank you thank you so um since we're talking about rice another follow-up uh and in fact we'll turn now to some questions coming from the audience so thank you all very much and if you are listening youtube live and facebook live you have a chat window there you can put in questions and and i'll just say up front we don't get to all of them um but we will uh do do as many as we can so there's a very broad question here pam and it's so it's also kind of two-part one is as you pick problems to work on and i'm paraphrasing as you pick problems to work on how much is what role does the do the social equity questions play for you about you know who would benefit from this for work uh what need is it addressing in a broader societal context and then the specific follow-up from that is let's you know once you've done your work like with the rice example how does it get from that research lab out to a subsistence farmer and what's that pathway and is it affordable and once you get to the other end is that an affordable product that really can be used widely around the world yeah thanks social equity really drove my interest um from the start and you know my father's uh immigrant mother grew up in the depression so we really grew up with this idea of um trying to trying to give back and and i was attracted to brian's lab because he worked on disease resistance and very very um excited about the idea that farmers can plant a a seed a genetically improved seed and then may not need to spray any insecticides or fungicides so that whole um environmental aspect social equity aspect really i would say has driven my work and i um you're working on tomato and pepper in brian's lab was really fantastic but i decided that i wanted to work on a food staple so that's why i switched over to start working on rice which was also becoming a a model organism at that time about 30 years ago now i think i think i got my phd right when pmb was was coming together um and so then picking what diseases and traits to work on it was obvious to start working on disease resistance because of the training and i had in brian's lab but then um a colleague uh introduced to me the the very serious um effects of environmental stress so that's that's why i started working on uh the submergence tolerance and i would say that um it is really critical to have sort of a pipeline so if if you're able to do something useful and you know we all try to do our best and you don't really know what's what's going to work and what's not going to work but to build that pipeline early so for this emergency tolerance work it was really brought to the attention of scientists from farmers i mean they were losing their crops in in flooding and the international rice research institute is part of a a very important international non-profit program that is focused on putting improved seed in the hands of farmers so the international rice research institute already had a whole set of collaborators in bangladesh and india that were able to trial um very quickly with dave mckill's leadership trial the new varieties that were being developed and then the seeds then are just put in the hands of farmers through the normal networks so in in many less developed countries including bangladesh and india rice farmers will go to their national national germplasm centers and they will get the seed from those centers so in the case of submersion tolerance rice there was no need to develop any kind of new distribution system and because the seeds are not regulated um uh marker assisted breeding is not a regulated technology it was really quite um that part was was quite easy well i shouldn't say easy because they still had to bulk up a lot of seed the bill and melinda gates foundation did provide funding to the bangladeshi rice research institute the qatak rice research institute in india and the international rice research institute to help breeders bulk the seed and distribute to farmers um in those areas and then i should say um you know kyle emerick and other colleagues um in in your college did a really important study showing that um the benefits of planting sub one rice accrued to the um the most disadvantaged farmers in the world and that was a really fascinating study um and it's because in india there's a caste system and historically for hundreds of years the lower caste farmers have had the most flood-prone land and so they're really seeing uh the major benefits oh that's a fascinating connection and also many of our listeners will know that california does not produce vast quantities of of wheat and corn but we do have flooded farmland and a significant rice industry so right there in davis you're in the heart of a of a fairly important rice growing region as well so that an important connection to across to other parts of the world where it becomes the main staple um brian you've i'm going to switch gears a little bit again picking up from our listeners you've uh i think it's fair to say you've been in this business for a long time um you've had students many generations of students and again to paraphrase from the question that came in what the question is what advice do you give students entering the field now about both the technical skills they need as well as like what we call the soft skills and and how has that advice changed how how has your mentoring had to change as the science has changed over the decades it's a good question um i think the way way i have always approached science is really to ask biological questions and then basically try to find technologies that will help me save um to basically solve those problems i think the best advice i can do today for students is that the interface of computational biology and molecular biology are more paramount than ever being able to because what's happening is that there's a massive revolution in gene sequencing technologies and we've created these massive databases and students have to be able to manipulate these databases and to be able to write code and scripts to be able to deal with these large databases so i really encourage students to get trained in computational biology and be able to bring those two systems together also i think it's important for students what i find today most interesting most students really want to make a difference in the world so they want to do basic research they want to translate that basic research into solving problems that have an impact on humanity and i think instilling those um particular um traits into students has been important as as we've gone along um again i think having a passion you know show people how you have a passion for science and how important that is in accomplishing your task and um those are probably the most important things so brian you you you may not be able to see this we knew that we had a slightly unstable web connection to pam and i think she um may have dropped off for a moment so we'll hope she drops right back in so let's just continue the two of us um so uh going back to going back to the traits you talked about how climate change will impact disease which is the area you've spent you know your career in can you say a little bit more about traits maybe non-disease traits just since you're you know in these discussions widely what are um key traits that gene editing might be able to help with specifically in relation to our now very focused attention on climate change as a challenge for agriculture right i give an example from work in my laboratory or nicholas carravolius as a graduate student of mine and with support from the open philanthropy project we're studying um stomatal density in rice with the with the idea that we can regulate a particular master regulator called stomagin where we can have an expression of from almost very few stomates to over expression of stomachs and it's well been established in the literature that if you find this sweet spot of stomatal density that you can actually make plants more drought resistant so you can use not only is crispr important for inserting things it's a research tool you can actually make allelic diversity of genes to be able to study traits you can also as many people may or may not know that many genetic traits in plants aren't single genes they're what are called quantitative trait loci we don't need to go into the details of that but needless to say there are many genes that contribute to a trait and using crispr technology you can dissect out which these genes that are really important so there are many of these qtls for drought tolerance and so we're trying to actually think about ways in which we can use crispr to identify which of the important genes in these quantitative tr loci so lots of lots of things to do and a lot of challenges out there but we think that making drought resistance is going to be really important so we've so we've focused so far mostly on the drought issue and well the flooding drought and disease but in terms of the discussion about sustainability one of the key um challenges is the is the inputs into agriculture and two of those inputs are of course fertilizer and pesticides and i believe pam is back pam we noted your brief uh wi-fi drop out but you're back so um tell us a little bit about the current status of research and the and and the role of genetic genetic technologies around specifically addressing this issue of the inputs to agriculture and the problems that arise from both high nutrient inputs as well as pesticide use yeah as i mentioned earlier the the bt trade has been really uh phenomenally important for farmers in reducing their insecticide use so just for an example uh eggplant uh which is the most important vegetable in india and bangladesh is also very susceptible to insect pests and farmers in bangladesh were spraying their crops three times a week sometimes even every day to try to control this particular pest and especially in less developed countries sometimes the insecticides are are not really controlled or regulated and so it's very very harmful often um to farmers and their families especially when they don't have a proper protection so scientists at the bangladeshi rice research institute in cornell were able to engineer eggplant to carry this bt gene and were able to dramatically reduce insecticide use often down to zero and so i think we we need to keep in mind the the importance of reducing insecticide use um and sometimes i i i hear sort of a little bit of confusion in in the public that don't fully understand that the idea of the bt trade is to reduce the use of insecticides some of them which can be really quite toxic so that's why uh traits like bt will continue to be important there's a lot of scientists that are working on nitrogen use efficiency and and phosphate use deficiency i think these will be very important i don't know maybe brian knows but i don't think any of these traits are out really in the field in the hands of farmers but the the general ideas that if plants are able to use these uh really important fertilizers more efficiently there will be less runoff into streams into our ecosystems and and into the gulf of mexico which and many other areas which are there's a lot of nutrient runoff and pollution so i think genetic technologies will be important of course management is is important as well um to try to use um add those inputs sparingly so it's really a combination of farmer practices and genetically improved crops that are that are going to be critical for addressing these important problems so i have there's a question here which it follows in part on that and that is that one of the um one of the really novel novelties that arose frankly in the last 30 years is the idea that that living organisms and genes can be patented and that they have intellectual property around them and which is not a lot of us wouldn't be intuitive if we think of a lot of this as sort of products of nature but these are very much an intersection of a natural product and the ingenuity of of crop reading and so my question and i'll start with brian but maybe i'm interested in both of you is um especially when you're thinking about these things like these equity issues where does the intellectual property side come in in terms of who what does it mean to own these discoveries uh of course there's a lot at stake and potentially a lot of financial consequences in stake in terms of the both the inventions and also those who are the downstream users and is is gene editing changing at all the landscape in terms of intellectual property and agriculture you know that's a great question and it's a very complex issue as you could um well imagine um obviously there are traits that you can gene edit and you can patent these it's really depends on what the the patent holders of this what they want to do with licensing these particular technologies i pushed at the igi that we would not take any of our discoveries and would not exclusively license them to any everybody so they would be widely available and furthermore if therefore developing countries they would be given freely to those countries and many companies actually have made that pledge that they would actually give their intellectual property to developing countries um that's important so maybe the developed country which they might be able to afford to acquire these licenses but in the developing world where they can't i think would be very important so it's a complicated matter um there's lots of intellectual property out there and it's it's even the whole crispr patent situation is still being debated and resolved hasn't been resolved totally yet pam anything to add from your perspective yeah i think um you know there are specific examples so for example gold and rocks which was developed it was funded by a non-profit rockefeller consortium but they um borrowed different you know tools and parts from um syngenta and what what ended up happening is agenda released all their um their rights and so golden rice that is now being hopefully will soon be grown in bangladesh philippines and other parts of the world is will be completely in the public domain which is really um very important if you're talking about very poor farmers so they'll be able to plant the plants harvest the seed and replant so there's no intellectual property restrictions and i think that is critically important in the less developed parts of the world the same with this emergence tolerance gene um we made the decision to be sure that that gene was publicly available so there's no we published it so there's no patent you see there's no uc davis patent on that gene so that means um if anyone wanted to use it in genetic engineering they could use it but also um if you're just using marker assisted breeding and not using any of our you know genetic sequence that that also would be in the public domain so i think it's very clear in less developed countries that um there has been and there will continue to be a lot of push um to be sure those tools are are in the public uh domain and and it's a different story in the united states in europe where um almost all farming is for-profit whether you're an organic farmer or a conventional farmer um so the so the landscape's a little bit uh difficult there i think one thing maybe we can talk about if we have time is this idea that it's the gene itself is is really where the patent is held but it's actually often the germplasm so corn breeding um has been developed for 70 years so there's very valuable what we call germplasm which is just the genetic background that's used to make hybrids and those are are very very valuable even independent of any new genes that are being added and so there's uh a lot of interest in and concern about the the the genetic background itself being patented and i don't know if brian um or david have anything to add to that but it's it's certainly an ongoing debate no brian anything to follow up on that no i just like i said it is an ongoing debate and um you know hopefully that um good rationale will prevail and trying to make these technologies move forward um and so yeah i don't have anything more to say about it sorry so um so one thing i mean one thing i really hear you saying is that it matters where the funding comes from foundation funding has really been important here and um now pmb has had a long history of very close collaboration with some private sector players in in biotechnology so as you've watched this unfold over several decades i'll ask brian have you is that relationship really changing do you see a shift in the nature of the relationship between the university researchers and private researchers and then this interface to making things available around the world it's interesting i gave you the example of uh cacao where um mars corporation is not interested in holding any intellectual property their their major motivation is to actually have a supply of chocolate so they're willing to give the tech gift funding to develop technology so farmers can produce the chocolate that they can use so i'm not sure all the other companies have the same rationale behind that but um it's um it's it's definitely but but a lot of the companies i know that if they have intellectual property like corteva which used to be pioneer hybrid they have actually allowed their technologies to be used the developing country they will give the rights to those in developing countries so i think on a case-by-case basis hopefully we'll be able to accomplish this i think it's important that we democratize these technologies uh that actually i mean that's an important incredibly important sentiment there and also just the idea that there are there are no some single silver bullet statements or answers across all these things that it is very much case by case and we need to look at each each case on its on you know on its own merits i would say in the last few moments i'm going to turn it a little bit more um maybe a little lighter and a little bit uh i'm going to say a personal question it's not very personal it's a great question from the audience for each of you who are your scientific heroes brian brian of course says there's the obvious answer it's the only answer in this setting uh well that was a setup but brian how about you who's you know i would say that um my professor my phd professor was a real intellectual um he's still around nicholas panopoulos was his name and he really taught me how to think in testable hypotheses and this really has stuck with me my entire career and he was a great mentor and i can't say enough what an influence he had on me how to approach science and ask important questions and one question one thing he always says if you can think of an experiment and if it's not an expensive just do it don't talk yourself out of it because you'll often find that it may not work the way you want but serendipity comes into play and you will find something totally new so i would say nick panopoulos for me well and and brian that speaks to something that again people are not inside the scientific research community may not fully realize how powerful that mentor student relationship is and it and it shapes our entire careers and i think all of us could tell that story of the influence of our advisors and and what a difference it made uh in the club in the i want to give you each opportunity for some closing thoughts and specifically um this is a 30th anniversary event and uh those who know our history at berkeley pmb came together in a merger and reorganization it wasn't the invention of biology it was just the uh the founding of the pmb department in its current form but what about the future if you could look ahead to the next 30 years of plant biology plant breeding here at berkeley davis what what's on the horizon and of course this is one of the questions for students entering the field thinking what their career might look like um brian brian go ahead and start okay i can just start it so i think that obviously i've been at berkeley before the pmb department started and um i think what's really been important for me um as as a faculty member in pmb is the great colleagues that we've had that really form um berkeley is again a great place that has attracted amazingly good graduate students in postdocs and have benefited from being able to attract those students in post-docs but also i would generally say across campus that i've developed collaborations with people outside the department so i think as you move forward you just can't work with just a few people in your own department you have to reach out because there are new technologies i'll give you an example we've just recently used cryo-em technology to really get an important complex of disease resistance immune receptor out and that's with the collaboration with the ava nagalas's lab and raoul martin who's the graduate student so being able to go out and to really interact with other members not only on this campus but uc davis we have a lot of close relationships with the great plant sciences at davis at stanford uh ucsf so i think as you go forward berkeley is in a great place because you have these four major institutions you've got you know ucsf stanford berkeley davis and it's all within a 70-mile radius or 100-mile radius of each other so it's really berkeley's a great place to come to do science thank you and pam some closing thoughts yeah well i really um appreciate being invited back uh being a graduate student at berkeley was really a fantastic experience you know i i i gained um from brian's mentorship and also nick's mentorship who was there when i was there and also so many fantastic faculty in the program i know many of them are retired lou feldman dick malkin steve linda patty zambrisky john taylor i mean we bob buchanan we had a really fantastic group of professors that were mentoring us um and and so it's been uh a really excellent uh to be back and you know i i concur really with what brian said you know as you go forward in your career you continue to meet uh fabulous scientists and many scientists that are willing to help you in an area that you're completely unfamiliar with and that's one of the great things about being a scientist because you're always learning and um so thanks very much for giving me the opportunity to join you today well thank you pam thank you brian thank you to everyone who's listening for joining us today we hope you'll come back for future events as part of pmb's 30th anniversary in the meantime stay safe and best wishes
