 I introduce today's speaker Alex you who's here on sabbatical until mid-february and I believe and I think Eileen introduced Alex to everyone at MVC lunch a few weeks ago when he first arrived I think I was out of town on that particular day and I understand she pulled his PhD thesis off the shelf here so he got his PhD here with Jim Patton in 1992 before that he did his undergraduate and master's degrees at five Nash Taiwan National University and then after he left here he did a one-year postdoc with Chuck Langley at a time when Eleanor was in the group and they worked together and then he did another one year post off with Becky Kahn at the University of Hawaii and then he went back to Taiwan where he's been a professor since 1994 at national taiwan university now it's hard when introducing alex to know what to talk about because he's one of these people with such diverse interests it's really remarkable so he I think of him as a mouse evolutionary geneticist but that's my own myopic worldview over the years he and I have published a couple of papers together on Mouse evolutionary genetics but if you look at his CV that's a small part of what he's done he's he's done a lot of work on shrimp he's done a lot of work on birds he's done elevational transects in Taiwan he's worked on the gut microbiomes of mammals he's worked on flying squirrels and I'm sure I don't know the half of it and so you might think given all that while he must be here to work on something with vertebrate biology after all he's on sabbatical and the mvz well no he's come back and he's now working on a book on the history of science in Taiwan and so and he's apparently taking a history class here on campus which meets Wednesdays at noon but he assured me that he would skip class today to come alex is also graciously agreed to give a second mvz seminar on a different topic later in the year I think in January so Alex I am so delighted to have you here for these months and I look forward to continued interactions and welcome back to the MVC thank you Michael it's very kind for you Michael to introduce me also very kind of him to to let me come here and helping me getting the visa you know I said Tron and setting up base here and most importantly that it's so open my gift is have me saying I'm not going to do things in mbz and instead I will go out to other departments and so that it's very kind so being the MVC o timer is have some advantages except that you know you're your own good thing because being oh I can tell you stories history I'm gonna tell you about is about a prize girl and it's all started with my major professor Jim Evans who is not here today however over the years I have learned that this is a very popular cartoon in in American culture and there's a flash Grove damn it rocky and his not so intelligent Fran will booing ghosts and just look at them you know they have some similarity and also they have differences also they differ because one is the fault got fermenter and the other that one is big and one is tiny okay and so they have distinct different ecology and there you've been look at this cartoon and say this rocky is flying down and I hope that somebody in the science jerko would have put some more effort to tell the cartoonist that did it wrong because this one does not show any of the flying membrane or the wing so to speak okay but none of this we know that they live on top of the trees which is a very tough habitat to speak you know to start with Oh Derek has some it does have some advantages one is the less competition and not to to be bullied by the bugatta the big guy blowing though but on the other hand you know you're living on top of tree and you're done you don't have too much to eat okay only leave that you can eat and to leave are terrible because they are they they contain lots of fibers and they also have a lot of plant defense mechanism you know they have phytochemicals which are toxin stalks into the - rocky well rocky does not have the wing flap but you can look at this sounds ish this is phi0 in the Sun if Asia and you can see that in the forest you know somebody described to me what really it's a flash grow in the forest a piece of rag flying round mowing down okay and this photo shows exactly that and then I have to relay this to my major professor and also back to the tie I would do my PhD I wanted to go back to Taiwan to do elevation of Radiance tips and he granted me the permission and he also cam along with me so in 1989 actually I believe it's November okay and then he came to Taiwan with me and we hiked up to this mountain area and that is the high speak of Taiwan okay let me tell you this is about 80 kilometers okay so this may be a 3200 meter and this from the sea level all the way up to 4000 meters okay so this is very very steep terrain and that is it's like even even though this is in the tropical area in winter you get this get snow and this is the highest peak I told you about and this is look at here you've got a stretch of forest and and that is one place that we went to okay and the other places look like it is covered by a very good virgin forest and to some places that we have to cross the trail like that and sure enough you can see this guy this is Jim Paden okay and that's me so this is the place that we have gone to and also I already spent two years in Berkeley and I passed my road take a lot of a bunch of classes so I'm educated by Berkey people so here you know doing in a field work and Jim doing so you know him it was so quick you know skinny in there and stuffing you know and and I did the same thing to he kept he kept coming to me and say Alex are you done yet I'm sorry ty you know because I already being educated in Berkeley and going everything against my and docile nature I said Jim shall I get back to work they're here liquid nitrogen here and this jar we keep the formerly and then we preserve another but the highlight is this we hire some Aboriginal people to come up with me to carry stuff and so they were so excited because this is an opportunity for them to go up and to hunt and so with a homemade gun you know shotgun and this it you can see Jamie very excited about this and the next stage is it what we've got you know I really need that they got three flying squirrels and with three shots okay I have to tell you what the gone they had I'm sorry the gun you know the gun was like a much louder in a very primitive but so three shots three fine screw and one of them are here from the from the collection and you are welcome to see and you see the tip mr. unusual I so got a tip bite you okay so that is that is I are one of my few collection with the French girl but that is start every single that's a story I'm vote okay and so after a few drink we have a good time with that we came down from mom tail we go to a hot spring take a bath and then we were invited by the outraging to have a few drinks and there is you know okay so I wanted to work on the fry scrub but this is some time after I got back and I lost contact with everything I really need their help to collect the samples so asked one of my friends you know see if you can help me with what was getting in touch with the original again and he told me so what are you gonna work on I say well thanks crow got my crow but literally it just means that I'm flying squirrel pieces you know shit and then tell me that Wow look flash girl actually is it's a prescription in in ancient Chinese medicine book okay so this is the name and this is you know this is the this is a fact makes basically it's a anti-inflammatory drug okay so I don't you know I don't know this I go into the literature and look this is the medicine book and this is this is a common of the British Victorian saying that this is the book and it is saying that author it's a Chinese naturalness just like we all do ok and then he said this is a very very high scientific achievement so what I'm going to do in the in the farm is to science it is today is to continue my scientific endeavor and so so fair enough so I decided that I must go and see this practice of using the flying squirrel of thesis medicine so I look it up and I found out there's a there are some farm in in China so I try my very best to get contact eventually get there and this is what you what it was like you know this is a second species of France girl which is the is a truck truck up tourists okay and then this farmer they have a little bunch of them and they do form them and they breed them and then they try best to get their natural food to feed them he said of using the artificial or of food and then the collector that you can see this and they do do this okay and then there's a buddy like I hope I don't ruin your lunch and then nowadays you'd go on the web you know this thing is real I'm telling you this is sighs okay okay then come to a point I decided that this is two species it's not enough I won the third speed Japanese colleague who is the professor in Hokkaido I said that while you know do you work on that she said yes we do capture recapture work Wow wonderful if you kill then we can get a lot of data rights I said well maybe we're gonna do a time series analysis the finest girl of microbiota in the feast is you know so you say yes I'll try that but you know after contacts ever tie and there's no response and eventually I decided to go and to the to Hokkaido and to see what's going on and so I went there and this is my students and this is the part that they he brought us to and look at this you understand what's that right that's the in the wintertime that's the marker you know the snowy going to that deep okay and so I understand that this is not the why it takes so much time so long for him to collect these samples and look at this they cannot trap the french girl because they are commissioned to do the monitor the weather the climate change in a Kaido so they're using this studying this finds grow see the response to the trans girl so they do this in the nest box and they just waiting they go into there and then you grab them and mentor everything you know Martin and greedy seven and at the trench I tell them you've got to get a poop first for me so he gave him the iron in later you know I did I did everything marking and he he followed eventually I mean in in that forest sometimes you'll see sign like this okay and that's real that's really no Kaido you have to be very careful and sure enough that's what we saw and then he treated me well and he went to work with Japanese restaurant and so this is Professor Porsche da which I have high appreciation okay so there are three species one it reached I'm from Taiwan and this is now there's you know Aborigine like them they're actually easier gut contents okay they do that okay and then this is Cheyenne we collect that place in in China is near Xian and this is a species connected to ancient mythical and then this is the is the Hokkaido specie is connected to a climate change okay so what what do they have in common of course okay and so this is this is how I think of them you know they are there on the very bad diet that you leave and they have to count on the microbiota to help them to digest but they differ in body sizes ok the pet Arista is the big one there are two species and then the medium one is the Chinese one and this is the al-qaeda one and if you look at that and this is you know this one actually had mass specific medical Bay twice so that it's a difference but they are all french girl they're eating the same thing you know similar similar habitats and ecology and then we collected the dropping and we do them attraction of skin stickiness and we do all the stuff and you can look at this this is the 19 by squirrel because there he is doing capture recapture we get we were able to get a look at quite a few sample but but then but she I got four and then we got to speed from Taiwan is there the government there micro biota in the sea coma in the faeces okay and basically this is a lot of former cutest I think most people know about this and then for the giant French girl they don't have Becky Road just this is kind of unusual and then we look at this off on diversity well the the four species pretty much the same you know this is this is the number of the specie there they all proxy about hundred or you know slightly below hundred but look at the other they have the same similar on ecological factors and then look at this the two most important phyla of the bacteria and you can this is a little guy at the media guy big guy and you see that they are very different but basically they have very few for the big guy they don't have any puppy worry about you're a dentist and then the small guy a lot and more okay and then this is this is a ratio that people study human microbiota and also the body mass the BMI and they can't came up with idea that if your your BMI is larger than thirty and you should be like that and this is so that interpretation of that is when you you have this and that means that you are better extracting energy from them from your food so we are taking this dead like the the big ones they have a lot of that in order to assist sustained by the leaf okay and we look at the beta diversity the two primes big one they have very similar component in their gut micro and they are all separate as well by their microbiota okay and so we did a little bit of the more analysis because the the figure tear the phyla does not carry too much okay so we do the cut cool currents a net learn Ellison this is you take a correlation and see how how these are correlated which is another and sure enough you see this is the big one medium one this is a smaller one of course it has more diverse by a microbial conduct there's the important one but I would tell you I would I would explain to you why the smaller one is physics like this but basically you know we have more samples right so we have more variety from but there are other factor I will show you later okay so this analysis give us more detail not just knowing their file up but we sometimes can get to their family sometimes we get to the genus we know where they are if we know the characteristic of these bacteria we know pretty much what they're doing for the price girl okay this is just a breakdown okay so what is next we do is that we try to do this this is done by this program there are so many probe on nowadays so we can do the prediction so we know by the 16s we know which better ticks off they have and then we'll go to the database and pull out the closest one that with genome and genome data and then we based on the genome data and we can map the gene to the pathway and we are mostly interested in the metabolic pathway so we only look at a metabolic pathway and then we know how many enough from those are being mapped to the metabolic pathway and then when the how many genes are there coming from the fecal sample and then we do the analysis and dividing all the genes that are related to that and divided by their body mass as it wasn't what we did for this analogy turned out that is the smallest one this is big one medium they are certainly responding as we interpreted you know responding to their metabolic constrained because if it's a math specific and Tunde the energy demand also because they are maintaining their body temperature and the loss of the feed from body and so this the smaller one are having a tougher time so they recruited more of the in terms of body mandala could more gene in order to help them process the energy to meet energy demand and that's what we interpreted the data and the result okay and then we come in up coming back to ask ourselves okay look this is among the three species right and then what about the individual with a once beat it and luckily because we have this a kind of species and this is each one and they're doing capture recapture so we got all the data as you can see this is the air visit they're actually this is the Abadi spa nice master okay and luckily we have one it's juvenile and you can't do a same calculation Jew and I stand out tremendously okay oh no a double bond is it you know going up and is it exactly and on either going down you can you know it's just just not enough simple psych to tell her too much but look this is very conspicuous difference so that boost up boost up our confidence that what the analysis tells us and our interpretation are correct okay so this is this is this is what we did with this three frying squirrel so we're the conclusion is that you know they're responding to the energy demand based on the batty my body mass the scanning issue okay but however that's a department or every men remember I told you that the smaller guy have the smallest guy have a diverse you know they they're very scattered because we are getting a sample from different seasons in different years so this is this is this a visit the dark one is 2013 and the empty one to 2014 okay again this is the composition of their dear microbiota and you can do carefully there isn't too much difference on the PC water but there so why range on PC - ok so looking at this this is the month right so immediately you will think this is there something to do with the temperature right and sure enough that's what we found out you know this is the temperature and this is PC - and you know this is the 2013 - time and it is very significant correlation and did it we do it to thousands for 2013-14 separately and all show the same trend they are responding to the temperature but remember these are these are homeo servers how come this has anything to do with the ambient temperature okay so I have to get a little bit sidetracked do a little sidetracked here so when we went to with - student went to Hokkaido there only it's a Hokkaido in a small town near the charter plan goes from Taipei to that town and only once a month a week okay so I told my student you come with me and then we go there right so we're right there on Wednesday so we can only go back the next Wednesday so well what do we do we say well hell we just go around looking around which inhibit you know that's a good we travel we have rented car we went everywhere I know and then I told them well look we have to after they prefer Japanese professor introduced with a happy tad and all we do it a little bit literature reading and so on look pay attention to the vegetation we take every picture of the potential food other clients girl which is so but yes yes I with a good time you know one week it's too long felicity so now it's good and then when we have to interpret in this date house and I tell my students look see what the forest and then he said well it's professor we've got to Japan has a vegetation data so called the big data nowadays right so let's go and see and that's what we did so we pull out a vegetation data and remember we remember I told you this is this is 2013 and 2014 remember 2013 May is lowering right so this is refraction of the of the vegetation in 2013 actually I can remember I think it's two or three degrees lower and and then you can see that this is the blow up up here and you can see this actually this match to here okay so that's one months late okay change it's different but the flying squirrel is responding not really to the temperature as far as we are trying to explain it responding to the vegetation because they offer different kind of food for them and so they are responding to this different kind of food different kind of leave and and so their bacterial microbiota also changed and this is the high and this low and you can see that they do have very distinct differences in their microbiota composition okay and we so we believe this is that respond that call it's by the shift now the temperature for the vegetation and yes dear diet okay so that's that's why when we only look at the micro you know the little guy and that's why they scared her a lot because they're responding we're more sample there is and collecting from different different month their different interests they're responding to that vector okay okay well I think I can slow down a little bit now okay so after we did more work earlier we try to look at their metabolic and metabolites remember that they are they have a lot of they have a lot of chemical to deal with right the plan talked toxin and so we're thinking that this is probably the place when they're doing the fermentation they also need to stop the problem of being talked to intoxicated and so they have to detoxify there was samples so that's that's what we did and so we look at the I mean this is GC mass that we did and then we try to allocate look difficult because it's just not enough data for these Y annual and we have to rely on on human database and we also realize on our very careful calibration of the pink and also the Realty abundance in order dude the correction annotation right so we turn out we have a 600 phytochemicals that are identified and we are able to use it and and look at their differences and indeed this is the high cut and this is a polka and they're very different okay and among those a lot of our these chemicals which are part of the odd metabolite of the fight of the phyto toxin and then we do have do found less of this in here and we also found this number and also the intensity the peak of object the intensity also lower in the high gun focus and that's why we interpreted that they are really not only just getting the energy they have to deal with it it is how they detoxify in the cecum okay and this is just to show you what we earlier work on the launch once and we because of this I also told my students that you have to look at the micro yeah because they're so used to use PCR and on their show you to this sequences and they never actually see the bacteria so I insist that we have to get some sample and send to people who can do SEM and this is what we get you can see that this is the debrief now we can recognize this is probably the surface of lead or something degrees but you can see the bacteria actually you know teaming in a tiny hole in there so they're real you know they're real they're not just DNA okay and this is our only one shot that we actually collected the sample RNA later and we also two interests in looking at this this is the part of a sign of digesta and different part of the guts and what we found out is look at this this is this from here to here to here it makes sense but it doesn't make sense here right this is larger than this so later on we look at the literature then we realize that someone in a past already knew that you know there is a junction starting and so the animal can decide somehow this is suitable to go into a second they go into a second if they do not suitable they go directly into the large intestine okay so then here the dual fermentation to the energy now the out of this this diet and we also disagree that little bit fragmented difficult is tough to get everything in order and so this is the result from the metagenomic and metallurgical analysis well we found out in the cecum we gathered a lot of gene expression for this for this for this for this ok so our interpretation of this data because remember when I show you the meta metabolite you know that differentiate that's not only is telling that that in the gut there process process the food in different way like like a compelling belt ok but we have to turn around think about think about what does that mean to a but microbe that's a happy to the micro to the chemical environment so think about what the micro are responding to that chemical environment so this is what we try to interpret it there because these are gene are highly expressed so we're thinking that this is a you know in order to when the this in just to come into the cecum this microbe or their stop being you know a failure when they're no foo but now all the sudden energy coming in they have to be actively pursuing these this resources and that's why they use this flagella absolutely and they also trying to detect where is the best play to go remember that a little tiny piece to leave the actually is a loner on sister of that structure right so they're attack those places and then they will get a super cinco sugar in and they're due to fermentation and neither their own need and that's a pump this out and that it's a beneficial to the to the host and then at the same time they need to get rid of this and this is the the exporter that's for them and so they also giving a lot of toxins and then put them out to talk to in there so this is this is based on the the gene expression that we by the database and trying to to come up with a scheme telling just you know try to figure out what's going on with for this micro and God okay and actually are young we didn't go into all this analysis you know manage alarming and so and so first we try to use our basic thing that we learned from community ecology and so look at here this is the digester for digester and this is mucosa because we thought we could in a gut you have to suite of bacteria or micro one is doing the digester for getting the energy but we also know it's important to cry our immune system in this guy and I'm going to live in your hood stuff and they most likely to stay in the mucosa so we separate those two different locations and we do you know the microbiota analysis and you thought this is speech rang and this really about this and this is it taking long and this is just exactly the same day now but we don't take me long so you can see that this does not comply to power law and the rest they can fly to power but this one have a steeper slope and by looking at that we are sure they are distinct communities because we know if you have a complete structure like this compliant Apollo and the and the need to violate Apollo that means that this one is the very dominant it take them all the maybe M if the series right it that won't take up half of the all resources and then leaving the rest to share the other half okay and then this one this one the second one will take half of the half and so on and so forth and this and did this these are all compiled to that but this one does not okay a second thing if you look at it fine you know it's rad here it's green and something most of you know black with it from acutest and that I think it's because when the first step that resource comes in it depends on who is there who can go up immediately and grab the resource it didn't you know this is a higher level so it didn't necessarily necessarily a particular species has totally takes up it's just a chance okay and that's what I sought in terms of trying to mix in on the data and the other thing I wanted to tell you is that you know this is the ingest huh and this is - in the video but look at this ingest and this is this is Ana cosa and they only share a quarter of the textile that they're in it so it just means they do have a distinction function and different community structure between the two and finally we decided that maybe we can do this do this so we give a rat and then we ship it to the rabbit feet that's increased the level of their fiber in their diet and then we try to isolate from the cecum and see what we can culture and I'm going to be very brief about this and so this is what this is the special table and plate if you have cellulose and you get the whole pink it already being digested and then you get mess of that I so means that the thing we isolated actually are that just seeing cellulose that's what we expected okay the story get a little bit more complicated later on we are able to do concert that okay and back to the back to the squirrel compared to other guys and this is the didn't manage Ino and we compare because we are some meeting men straight of being passed by the viewer so what about then in terms of the other mammals so we go back to to our other people database and then we do the analysis and this is tau okay as this is a different kind and they are distinct of course this is rumen and this disease visit this is secant and this is fecal sample and but how it really shows that at least this and this even though they are fermentation you know but they are they have very different suite of bacteria are working for them and this is what it's interesting to work on the Front's burrows okay well remember I told you we have a dip in the Ospreys so everything Jim did on that trip you know have something happened in it later on so I I was in modifying my geology geology colleague and because I know how to do this managerial stuff and say there are they say well you know we want to work on the hot spring I'm sure I can do that you know no I joined them and that's what we did and this is something you know I come back here after this is exactly I think it's 30 years so so I have to show you what I did so I have students coming all over to the United States they did very well especially uh greatly and he is now an assistant professor in UC Irvine and then the others you know - and this is a little bit complicated because he actually she actually went to Germany but her degree but her adviser was Linda Meiji left I think if you know you know she was a member of Ella Wilson slap okay naturally I will later for my student go there I said I don't know I never met Linda so I wrote to him you know I'm Burpee understand you're a member of Helen Wilson lab and I'm a I miss you know Jim Hadden so would you please take a look of my assurances application that you did as your secretary so you know having the Berkeley degree okay and then others these are the people who work with me and this is know and this is the latest one and she did a master with me and she was just accepted by University of Florida a vet school and she's no she's just her strippers limey just like the what's up me you know don't you tell me you're going to work on the Oh Pancho a deer being collected in Florida they have a problem with too many dears so she's going to hear yeah that she work with me on which is very good now she's working on Bullwinkle okay so you know actually the story does not end there no I have above the people coming I mean almost everybody from mdvi when they're going to Taiwan and I always say well so and so again BZ told me that you get in touch with you so they did yeah peanut Jane came and she was after a frog and looking the kitchen and she's now a data scientist in for the bear Conservation International and Sharon do and she came and she's now been working in Berkeley I don't know where I will meet her in in a few weeks and she to hear her story and she's a she working on together vet degree in canal and she is working with exotics exotic animal which is which means it's not dog and can something else that's good shows our inference of metric on them and this unfortunately she went into middle school and maybe she won't work on human microbiota and then evolution she picked out here CS computer sign that she's now working on by information at UCSF almost finished her degree PhD and sincere walias in the audience and head to my lab or summer and so I took her out and with two other folks she to a mountain look at the frogs I think that imprint her well and she also related to me we share 160 64 so genetic components in in western term that should be she should be like a third cousin maybe third obviously remove yeah but in our Chinese traditional journal or she is my great-niece so she had to call me uncle and there is jennifer lynn i think she's there yeah just there stand up that people see you he is my student from NTU and she's only exchange to turkey campus for a year so I should just arrived and I told her you must enroll in nbg lunch when Jesus dude and I invited nobert to Taiwan and to participate in the symposium which was very successful and the people in the student interacted with them you know they still like I like bonding this year into a keno communicating each other and so that's wonderful and I'll show you what I did in the past in addition to that I work on frog mystery interaction I mean you know my shoe and a fish freshwater fish and this is marine fish and Jim being here the physician he had either MD a doctor doing an Emmy and amniocentesis of the chromosomes and so he loved chromosomes so because my professor what Jim had you know who started at chromosome specialists so so he came with me and I was successful to entice him to go into working with angling a mammal and then this is shrimp mojo and then we did I did like Michael said you know lemons and then visit Barbie the last work I did on why my sweet cat and and thanks you thanks again it's thank you Michael because Michael kindly allow my collaborator from China to stay I think it's six months in his lab in Arizona because I did at I I went to China a few times and I tried to convince him you know how to do the collection properly you cannot just take that tissue and throughout your specimen now when you're showing me how to skin the animal and try to show him how to scissors but it's just not enough so Michael took him in and let him just be there and seeing what people do research and that has a strong impress of him and so eventually you were able to polish this in in molecular ecology and I he collected all that sample I collected here of course and I come here and you tell now this is a very precious sample interpreting our data and on that trip in my day I travel 5,000 kilometres and a lot of story of course but you have to buy me a beer in order to and then I try to it every local connection so I went to Japan Kyoto and UQ and we you know he he hear that very young professor when I started to work with him and he was assisting us it he work on this best but he's a it's a small MIMO system Otis he does not have much experience of doing fuel so at a time in Japan we travel 5,000 kilometers so I show him how to set trap and how do we collect and and and I think that is a good press on him I also give him the books I can publish on the Amazon memo tell him that look this this is what kind of work you should you should be doing and now going all over the places and collecting a lot of sample and also train the local scientist and I also are very happy that I was able although I'm on a different mission but I was able to convince that I could talk to the president of the university and their Dean you know we should do this we should do a training just like the OTS here I learned and so that is what we get and now they are it is still going on it rotating in four countries you know and so that is another activity and then like like Michael said and I got interest in this and this is the first time ever I have been to a social science conference I feel very lonely there able to convince that some of the in the audience that does it worse watch pursue to know what the sign is related to social background and social web drop in order to understand how science should be done and then finally I would like to show that the Bernie Nathan he was my contemporary in MIT so he give up biology he started doing this origami art I think some of you may have met him here but he was so good so he came to Taiwan and just six exhibition in Taiwan and the last the biggest one six fun we attracted this many people come to do this do you know in the world you can see he tried to convey sign because he felt animal and tell them into what the college or you know he had the very nice polar bear and you know on top of the icy water in in the Arctic it was very eye-catching and also convey a strong idea about what's about today psychology globally and you can attract these young kids to come enjoyed it and most importantly ensure or at least to try to attract these young people come to science we need good science it won't be long you know about 10 years about to make a decision if we imprint them early on we get a whole bunch of good scientists okay so that's it we grind it up and look at the microbiota maybe we can see if there any connection between so we showed that that microbiota in squirrels from different years was different to be said that it was the temperature was different then that related to that College was different yeah and you thought that it was the Polish it was responsible for the difference but do you try to do experiments where you control everything including the food the diet and change the temperature because the alternative is that there is some kind of a regulatory process to maintain body temperature that can affect my plan yeah we would very much like to do more experiments but it's hard to do this with the French girls well maybe well I take that back we really work hard with the Chinese farmer you know the price for a farmer maybe we will be able to use the animal to do some of the information yeah you could do it to the rest yeah we can do that with red of course yeah but let's wrap it would be less exciting I want to be a flying squirrel farm going back to the use traditional use of the squirrel feces in medicine I don't know enough I don't know Michael if you do if any of the bacterial taxa that you identified relate to that to have properties no we didn't we didn't really look into that ya know there are actually we reach the mid does magic river we're having some problem with these reviewer editors you know their before they send up a review they're asking me so do you have a permit you know i the guy no I mean look I I have to write in the supplementary and writing a letter to explain to what's going on I tell them you know I go to this farm but I told them you know look I've got I have to do this again you know 30 useful I tell them I tell it degree from Berkeley so I know that West trying to breach the gap so I tell them this is true then they will send out for review okay so you know and I do get the I just searched military I need a scholar they they do a lot of analysis but they are all probably in Chinese okay i define Korean scientists work on this and partly in in English and they do find some chemicals that they think it had some medical effect but again some work to link that to the micro yeah and they were saying that the farmer telling me they had to see the French grow with the natural food you know the typical Chinese Apple DT or something yeah is a it's a it's a Cyprus but it flatter the foliage yeah they said they must see them dead in order to have better defense so that must have something to do with the food and also the the techs are working on that you know so it's a lot of thing to dig into what is it prescribed for Oh us well in January anti-inflammatory you've been looking at the dirt you know the medical book you're saying it's set in text taste bitter and sweet and that is said it's good for anti-inflammatory and sometimes you some some you know depends on which version you look at sometimes say it's good for the area sometimes you're bleeding and it's good for stopping the bleeding something like that you know but you know in the early day the word very big the very you don't not very precise so it need to be look at carefully but as far the farmer is concerned there any big money for sale there and you know do something on their income that's why I show you you know oh my you can and also that photo I actually that's not war than my photo that with the photo I search on the web there's a new street poll counting people honored that you should try to do this because they were in Crete your livelihood and your income gave a question over there sort of similar to the question that's over here you know you mentioned it gets really cold and during winter months mammals often reduce their body temperature so possibility during the winter with cooler body temperatures it sort of selects four different micro biomes that perform better at slightly cooler temperatures that might be another explanation you can just look at growth so that would be ooh if I were yes I think she did work with them in a different paper we do maybe you know different oh okay well if you have more questions alex is sitting in the office next to mine we'll be here until February
