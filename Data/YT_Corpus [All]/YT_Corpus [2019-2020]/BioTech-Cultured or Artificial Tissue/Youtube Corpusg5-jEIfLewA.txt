 My name is Alexander König, I’m 38 years old, and I am the director of the Tissue Engineering Project House in Singapore. The project house was launched in April 2018. Tissue engineering is the culturing of cells and tissue in the laboratory. Examples of the various applications include cell therapy, transplantation, and in-vitro tests, with which you can carry out experiments on the materials that have been cultured in the lab. Tissue engineering is based primarily on three components: The scaffold, the cell culture medium, and the cells. Depending on the application, these three components must be optimally harmonized with each other. This is the challenge we have taken on in the Tissue Engineering Project House. The special thing about this project house is its international character. In contrast to the early project houses, in which we bundled our activities at a single site, in this case we are collaborating worldwide with various teams. We have ongoing activities in the USA, for example, where we are working on biomaterials that can serve as scaffold materials for tissue engineering. In Germany, we are collaborating with experts to develop components for media formulations. And, finally, it all comes together in Singapore. This is where we carry out the cell culturing and run application tests. Through our collaboration with our customers, we hope to find solutions for people with chronic or severe illnesses that cannot be healed effectively or at all.
