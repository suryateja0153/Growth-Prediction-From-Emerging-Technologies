 I know you're not all here to see me so I'll be as brief as I can and I apologize for speaking in in English you're certainly not going to understand my German so we're going to look very quickly at the future of animal agriculture particularly focusing on the cow but before I do that I just want to give you a little bit of context by going back in history to look at a previous disruption where another animal was replaced by a superior technology so this is New York City 1904 these slides from my co-founder Tony Seba and he asks a question where's the car well well there's one car the slide doesn't seem to be working to her fast forward just 13 years same a scene where's the horse of one horse that's just 13 years it's a very fast disruption in fact it took just 20 years from 1905 to 1920 to 1925 for the car to go from just 5% of the market to 95% of the market and that was at a time when there was no oil industry no gas stations no mechanics no supply chains there were very few paved roads and no one knew how to drive but just 20 years so the message here is that disruptions when they happen happen fast and they don't go in a straight line they're nonlinear they go in an s-curve they start slowly and then they accelerate and they can have profound impacts on society but we're very poor at forecasting at seeing them coming we tend to stumble into them and then clean up the mess afterwards so let's look at the cow and I want to go back in history again because about 10,000 years ago we started the long process of domesticating animals and for millennia we used cows for all kinds of things not just the meat and materials we use them for transport for energy we use them as a store of value we also use them as a store of food over the winter and for lean times they're a critical part of our culture and played a role in religions as well but over the millennia almost all of those uses have been displaced by better technologies and all were left with today are materials and food but within that category we see an explosion of uses we find cows now and pretty much everything there's cow in your sugar as cow and roads there's Karen cosmetics it's quite extraordinary but it's a very inefficient technology it takes a huge amount of land feed and water to grow a cow takes two or three years and out of it as well as the useful products we also get greenhouse gas emissions and all kinds of waste products but we're on the cusp we think of a disruption of animal agriculture there's some extraordinary new technologies developing that has the potential to displace a cow and I just want to look at one of these technologies and it's based on the age-old process of fermentation which we've used the millennia to make everything from yogurt and bread to wine and beer but more recently we've been able to harness fermentation to produce far more precisely to produce all kinds of things like enzymes for cleaning fluids and now with a combination of information technologies and bio technologies which all it's improving at an extraordinary rate we're able to produce almost anything we're able to harness microbes to produce pretty much any organic molecule that we want and that creates incredible possibilities that it's far broader than just food these technologies are gonna be applied to healthcare to cosmetics to materials and more and it also it also enables another key technology cellular agriculture the ability to grow cells in the laboratory because we can produce the growth medium the most expensive part of that process using this modern fermentation technology so just very briefly essentially it makes the impossible possible all kinds of things that we just can't get from animals insulin is a great example insulin used to come from the pancreas of a cow and a pig it took 23,000 animals to produce just one pound of insulin and it wasn't a very good product it was poorly tolerated cause all kinds of allergic reactions but using this technology we're able to produce insulin from humans a much better superior product and now far lower cost and we can produce all kinds of things jellyfish leathers been made we can make leather of all shapes and sizes unconstrained by the starting-point the cow so we can produce meat using cellular agriculture it's a bit behind plant-based agriculture the other form of meat making but it's coming down and cost very quickly well have a look at that in a second impossible foods is a good example of combining modern fermentation with plant extracts and we're producing burgers now have almost equal quality to those that come from animals so cost so the impossible burger is now in every Burger King in the US and it costs is one dollar more than a burger from a cow and the cost is coming down fast we think by the mid-2020s or be far cheaper than a burger from a cow cellular agriculture has the potential to be the cheapest form of production but it's still much more expensive but just just five years ago it took three hundred thousand dollars to produce one kilo of beef sari to produce one burger patty and now cost us three hundred dollars to produce one kilo of beef and that that that figure is dropping very fast and again by the late 2020s we should be below the price of beef from cows and the other thing beyond costs that drives adoption of new technologies their capabilities and this is where we're seeing incredible improvements in terms of taste structure mouthfeel nutrition and so on these products are improving very very fast in terms of their impact on society our health how we tolerate them in terms of price volatility now that we're freed from the vagaries of the weather food security the environment and more they're better on almost every parameter and each version that gets released is going to be better than the previous one and within just a decade or so we think they'll be better on every parameter than the meat that comes from animals and so how far and how fast will this disruption go we don't quite know yet it's still very early but all technology disruptions move in this s-curve and we think that by the late 2020s by 2030 at the latest it will have very significant impact on the market for Mead and close behind pigs and other livestock no animal is is it no animal is is safe from this disruption and in terms of land use we use a huge amount of land to grow animals you can see here the amount of pasture we use for cows the amount of livestock feed down here and this is the amount of food we eat most of our agricultural land goes into producing animals if we free ourselves from animal agriculture we'll have extraordinary opportunities to repurpose that land and use it for all kinds of other things there are impacts across society the environment enormous impact potentially on greenhouse gas emissions cows are one of the biggest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions but if we replace them in the food system the impact will be profound the effect of deforestation driven largely actually by animal agriculture growing soil and land that used to be rain for us and pommels another big cause of deforestation but people are already producing palm oil at less than the cost of palm oil from forests extraordinary exciting and in terms of our health these products can be far healthier we can have pretty much any food we want with any nutrients so we could have cookies with the with the nutritional properties of a cow burger for instance better for food borne diseases and so on all kinds of effects so this is a hugely exciting disruption but it's not predetermined it's not guaranteed to happen the choices we make as investors as consumers but most importantly as policymakers will determine the outcome Germany had huge success early on in the solar revolution they led the way but eventually got surpassed by China we see the German car manufacturing industry lagging behind in the production of electric vehicles you have the world's best brewing industry let's hope you can take advantage of it and lead this disruption thank you very much [Applause] thank you so much Jamie for that wonderful overview and I I would like now to invite Elizabeth Abigail who is working as I mentioned at the Rachel Carson Center here in Munich as a fellow on the whole question of bio politics of cultured meat to maybe give your reactions to this I mean do you believe that this is all hype all of this if cultured meat you may stand if you like or sit or whatever you're more comfortable well I mean absolutely wonderful didn't it I mean you just want to believe it so much because it's going to resolve all the problems that we have currently with our food system you talk about disruption I find very disrupting myself because it's not really disrupting the industrial food system it's actually taking us to a higher level of industrialization one that takes that's it at its basic unit of production the living cell so it's saying we can do it better than the animal we can do it better than thousands and thousands of years of evolution so I don't choose to call it clean meat or cell-based meat or or cultured meat I call it edible animal tissues because that's what they are as a sociologist I I ask myself what do these changes actually mean in terms of our social fabric what are they what are they investing us into what are what are they engaging us what what is this commitment towards meat that we have I mean isn't the problem the sort of the Western diets couldn't we couldn't we just work at the level of trying to disrupt the actual food system the way it exists now rather than looking for these high tech fixes these techno fixes so I believe that we're not going to engineer ourselves out of the problems that we're facing today I think that we need to look and do the the hard work the the hard ethical social political economic work that we need to do in order to ask ourselves with the choices that we make today in terms of what we eat how we eat how it's produced where it comes from their major demographic changes coming about the man from meat is going to increase by double by the year 2050 so what do we do instead of you know looking for the high tech Solutions shouldn't we be looking towards trying to make things better the way that we are doing it now the way that they used to be done we are not romanticizing the past or anything but I think there are ways that we can we can use that do not alienate us from nature that do not alienate us from the food that we eat and that we produce and do not an alienate us from the animals so I think that also my my feelings come from this past life that I had as a molecular geneticist I worked in the laboratory I worked for some by tech companies I did plant tissue culture I did animal tissue culture and it never crossed my mind in a million years that one day I would be eating those things that I was producing in the lab so when you understand the processes involved in cellular agriculture of growing cells stem cells and the products that go into you know keeping cells alive differentiating them then scaling them up you realize that this is not animal free meat that we're talking about because a lot of animals actually need to be killed in order for this to come about so the growth medium that was alluded to at this point in time it still mainly uses fetal calf serum which is a major by-product of the slaughter of cows so it needs to replicate the the environment that the the embryonic cells would would differentiate in their also all kinds of other products that come from animals that some that go into the making of these cells so it's not it's not yet realized it's not completely slaughtered free it's not completely animal free and I think that the the denomination as a meat is problematic it's not meat it is edible tissues animal tissues even if it's plant-based meat I mean I don't think it's meat and whatever if it's you know plant-based or animal based or whatever these foods are ultra processed their ultra processed their file their bio fabricated and so all kinds of other chemical and biological processes and interventions going to making them which have not yet been so we don't know what the effects will be on health we don't test foods the same way that we test drugs so I think that we have to be really careful because these technologies are highly speculative they're not real I know them the museum exhibit makes it sound like you know then the new break the brave new world is with is you know it's within reach but some unfortunately these technologies are yet highly experimental they're highly speculative and so we shall see what the future brings but my belief is that we should work within the limits that we have because I think that the the idea of disrupting or you know or the idea that we can attack you know technologically fix the future is really based on this idea of of you know technological progress and that technology is going to save us and that what that does is it morally prevents us from thinking about what we should be doing today right now and every day as we eat so thank you thank you so I I will give I will give Jamie a chance to respond to this but but first I would very much like to hear what Ricard avi practiced to say especially as in your talk you spoke about the the potential benefits of moving away from slaughtering cows but also the risks of the Google affine the meat industry so maybe your your response first and then we'll give Jamie a chance to reply yes I like to give you the question what do you think who will make the big business of the cut-rate meat because that's a very very interesting question another injury is interesting question is to ask what will all the million of people do who are now in the cow industry not only in Patagonia or not only in the United States also in Kenya for example with a lot of people living from the cattle and they cannot live from the cattle anymore if it is cheaper to produce cultured meat so we will have a lot of social problems and we have a lot of questions about unemployed for example and you cannot say okay there are cows now and in the future there will be vegetable this is possible in some areas in the world but it's not possible for example in Patagonia where you cannot plant and all the vegetables so what we are doing here has a lot of social impact and it's very difficult if you make a very very fast progress not thinking and rethinking the social implications and I think this is the point I agree with you I think I mean you know one of the reasons we set up we think X my organization was to try and look at these these social implications the environment implications of political implications because there are undoubtedly gonna be massive impacts across society and and you know we're gonna see you it's not just food it this is not just jobs that we're gonna lose in in in agriculture I mean what we've done historically is we've stumbled into disruptions and we've cleaned up the mess afterwards and we've managed to do that just about as we as we as we've gone about our business but that's not acceptable because we've got disruptions now coming across multiple sectors of the economy so autonomous vehicles for instance they're gonna kill driving jobs across the economy we're gonna lose jobs in agriculture here you know maybe who creates some new jobs but they're different jobs that they're not suited to the people who lose their jobs different skills and I think it's I think it's a profound question for societies what do we do about this how do we rethink our social contract how do we rethink how we feel about or how we think about work and reward and other things because if we don't if we don't change it we're gonna have huge social unrest we're gonna have big big problems with all kinds of consequences that we can't possibly foresee so I think we need to be thinking about a whole new social contract Harry reward people how we motivate people how we find purpose in our lives and so on and I think it's a major major problem that we have I'm just one technical question Elizabeth said in her talks that we were still very dependent on the fetal bovine serum as a growth medium for cultured meat but I'm from both of you that it is not necessarily the case that there are alternatives now go maybe would either if you like to respond on that yes so I mean the first thing to say as cellular agriculture is is far more speculative I absolutely agree and it's further out but this disruption will happen without cellular agriculture will be will be producing essentially meat from plants I mean we can find every molecule in in in meat in in implants and so impossible foods for instance are producing what's called heme which is a kind of critical ingredient that gives their burger the meat like appearance and taste and they can produce that through fermentation and and and over time they'll produce some of the proteins and some of the fats in that in that method as well but yeah there are issues but in terms of the serum we are finding solutions now there's still you know a work in progress but you know in my discussions with those involved the the businesses that are leading this that's not seen as a long term a long term issue they they're using it currently but it's certainly not a it's certainly not something that's gonna be around for much longer and they've already found solutions they're not they're not at caught cost parity yet but they're getting there so I don't think it's a it's interesting these plant-based approaches you to be in a way going faster than the animal cell based approaches so the I was impressed at the biggest IPO and the most successful IPO of 2019 was not of a tech company but it was actually beyond meat so a plant-based meat company making the beyond burger so it seemed it this is a kind of interesting development so I wonder about plant-based versus animal-based but I'd like to give a Lizabeth the chance to could you reply and then I would like to open it up to the audience because I know you will have questions I just wanted to respond to the fuel calf serum question because that's one that comes up all the time and we hear from the practitioners that maybe they found alternatives but they're not yet up to par the issue is that yes they can find solutions but the yield is a problem the yield and right now they're many constraints that are actually preventing the cellular agriculture from actually being realize and that's why it's so so speculative as you are saying and these are technical constraints but they're also cost constraints and their constraints dealing with scaling up to make industrial quantities of this meat so so if you change the fetal bovine serum and you try and found alternatives that are plant-based or bacterial based you you you can certainly get those cells to grow and proliferate but it will not do it in the same way as they would using that particular culture medium so that is still one of the I would say the preventable the preventing factors from you know the industry really coming to to the fore and as far as the other products are concerned I mean to to make the cellular meat or edible animal tissues taste and look like meat it takes many many steps and these involve antibiotics hormones fats proteins etc so so it's a real industrial process so I'm not sure that we're gonna industrialize our way out of industrial agriculture and and I think that you know yes there are disruptions that happen every so often we're always trying to fix the messes that we made in the first place and I think we come to a point in our history where the messes are now we mean you know we have to kind of reckon with some of the things that we have to deal with notably climate change and so on so I think that I'm not sure that we should put all our investments in these technologies thank you I'm I would like to give the audience
