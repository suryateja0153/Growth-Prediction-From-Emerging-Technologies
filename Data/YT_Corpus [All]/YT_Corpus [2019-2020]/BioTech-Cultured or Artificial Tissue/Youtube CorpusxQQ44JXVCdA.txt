 bacterial growth is the proliferation of bacterium into two daughter cells in a process called binary fission providing no mutational event occurs the resulting daughter cells are genetically identical to the original cell hence bacterial growth occurs both daughter cells from the division do not necessarily survive however if the number surviving exceeds unity on average the bacterial population you undergoes exponential growth the measurement of an exponential bacterial growth curve in that culture was traditionally a part of the training of all microbiologists the basic means requires bacterial enumeration by direct and indirect methods most bacteria rely on binary fission for propagation conceptually this is a simple process a cell just needs to grow to twice its starting size and then split in two but to remain viable and competitive a bacterium must divide at the right time in the right place and must provide each offspring with a complete copy of its essential genetic material bacterial binary fission is the process that bacteria use to carry out cell division binary fission is similar in concept to the mitosis that happens in eukaryotic organisms such as plants and animals but its purpose is different when cells divide by mitosis in the body of a multicellular organism they cause the organism to grow larger or replace old worn-out cells with new ones in the case of a bacterium however cell division isn't just a means of making more cells for the body instead it's actually how bacteria reproduce or add more bacteria to the population budding is a type of asexual reproduction in which a new organism develops from an outgrowth or but due to cell division at one particular site the small bulb-like projection coming out from the yeast cell is called a bud generation time the time required by the bacterium to double its number for example the generation time of as Cherokee Accola is 20 minutes in not collage achill studies the growth of bacteria or other microorganisms as protozoa microalgae or yeasts in batch culture can be modeled with four different phases lag phase log phase or exponential phase stationary phase and death phase lag phase during the lag phase bacteria adapt themselves to growth conditions it is the period where the individual bacteria are maturing and not yet able to divide during the lag phase of the bacterial growth cycle synthesis of RNA enzymes and other molecules occurs it can last for one hour to several days log phase the log phase sometimes called the logarithmic phase or the exponential phase is a period characterized by cell doubling the number of new bacteria appearing per unit time is proportional to the present population if growth is not limited doubling will continue at a constant rate so both the number of cells and the rate of population increase doubles with each consecutive time period exponential growth cannot continue indefinitely however because the medium is soon depleted of nutrients and enriched with wastes stationary phase the stationary phase is often due to a growth limiting factor such as the depletion of an essential nutrient and/or the formation of an inhibitory product such as an organic acid the stationary phase results from a situation in which the growth rate and death rate are equal the number of new cells created is limited by the growth factor and as a result the rate of cell growth matches the rate of cell death the result is a smooth horizontal linear part of the curve during the stationary phase mutations can occur during the stationary phase DNA damage is responsible for many of the mutations arising in the genomes of the stationary phase or starving bacteria decline phase at the decline phase bacteria die this could be caused by the lack of nutrients environmental temperature above or below the tolerance band for the species or other injurious conditions this basic batch culture growth model draws out and emphasizes aspects of bacterial growth which may differ from the growth of macro fauna it emphasizes clone ality asexual binary division the short development time relative to replication itself the seemingly low death rate the need to move from a dormant state to a reproductive state or to condition the media and finally the tendency of lab adapted strains to exhaust their nutrients control of microbial growth control of microbial growth means to inhibit or prevent the growth of microorganisms this control is affected in two basic ways by killing microorganisms or by inhibiting the growth of microorganisms control of growth usually involves the use of physical or chemical agents which either kill or prevent the growth of microorganisms sterilization sterilization refers to any process that eliminates removes kills or deactivates all forms of life in particular referring to microorganisms such as fungi bacteria viruses spores unicellular eukaryotic organisms such as Plasmodium etc and other biological agents like prions present in a specific surface object or fluid for example food or biological culture media sterilization can be achieved through various means including heat chemicals irradiation high-pressure and filtration sterilization is distinct from disinfection sanitization and pasteurization in that those methods reduce rather than eliminate all forms of life and biological agents present after sterilization an object is referred to as being sterile or aseptic disinfection antiseptics disinfectants both kill microorganisms and many people use the terms interchangeably adding to the confusion antiseptics are sometimes called skin disinfectants but there is a big difference between antiseptics and disinfectants an antiseptic is applied to the body while disinfectants are applied to nonliving surfaces such as countertops and handrails in a surgical setting for example a doctor will apply an antiseptic to the surgical site on a person's body and use a disinfectant to sterilize the operating table both antiseptics and disinfectants contain chemical agents that are sometimes called by asides the action of microbial control agents different antibiotics have different modes of action going to the nature of their structure and degree of affinity to certain target sites within bacterial cells one inhibitors of cell wall synthesis while the cells of humans and animals do not have cell walls this structure is critical for the life and survival of bacterial species a drug that targets cell walls can therefore selectively kill or inhibit bacterial organisms examples Finnick lens cephalosporins bacitracin and vancomycin two inhibitors of cell membrane function cell membranes are important barriers that segregate and regulate the intra and extracellular flow of substances a disruption or damage to this structure could result in leakage of important solutes essential for the cells survival because this structure is found in both aquatic and prokaryotic cells the action of this class of antibiotics is often poorly selective and can often be toxic for systemic use in the mammalian host for example paula nixon be and callous teen 3 inhibitors of protein synthesis enzymes and cellular structures are primarily made of proteins protein synthesis is an essential process necessary for the multiplication and survival of all bacterial cells several types of antibacterial agents target bacterial protein synthesis by binding to either the 30s or 50s subunits of the intracellular ribosomes this activity then results in the disruption of the normal cellular metabolism of the bacteria and consequently leads to the death of the organism or the inhibition of its growth and multiplication examples are amino glycosides macrolides linked assimilates strapped to Grauman's chloramphenicol tetracycline x' for inhibitors of nucleic acid synthesis DNA and RNA are keys to the replication of all living forms including bacteria some antibiotics work by binding to components involved in the process of DNA or RNA synthesis which causes interference of the normal cellular processes which will ultimately compromise bacterial multiplication and survival examples are quinolones metronidazole and refampin five inhibitors of other metabolic processes other antibiotics act on selected cellular processes essential for the survival of the bacterial pathogens for example both sulfonamides and trimethoprim disrupt the folic acid pathway which is a necessary step for bacteria to produce precursors important for DNA synthesis sailfin amides target and bind to die drop through eight synth ace trimethoprim inhibits tiger flight reductase both of these enzymes are essential for the production of folic acid a vitamin synthesized by bacteria but not humans control of microorganisms is essential in order to prevent the transmission of diseases and infection stop decomposition and spoilage and prevent unwanted microbial contamination microorganisms are controlled by means of physical agents and chemical agents physical agents include such methods of control as high or low temperature desiccation osmotic pressure radiation and filtration control by chemical agents refers to the use of disinfectant it's antiseptics antibiotics and chemotherapeutic antimicrobial chemicals there are two categories of antimicrobial chemotherapeutic agents antibiotics and synthetic drugs antibiotics are metabolic products of one microorganism that inhibit or kill other microorganisms chemotherapeutic synthetic drugs are antimicrobial drugs synthesized by chemical procedures in the laboratory many of today's antibiotics are now actually semi synthetic and some are even made synthetically physical agents to control microorganisms temperature microorganisms have a minimum an optimum and a maximum temperature for growth temperatures below the minimum usually have a static action on microorganisms they inhibit microbial growth by slowing down metabolism but do not necessarily kill the organism temperatures above the maximum usually have a Seidel action since they denature microbial enzymes and other proteins moist heat moist heat is generally more effective than dry heat for killing microorganisms because of its ability to penetrate microbial cells moist heat kills microorganisms by denaturing their proteins causes proteins and enzymes to lose their three-dimensional functional shape it also may melt lipids in cytoplasmic membranes delivering autoclaving employs steam under pressure water normally boils at 100 degrees Celsius however when put under pressure water boils at a higher temperature during autoclaving the materials to be sterilized are placed under 15 pounds per square inch of pressure in a pressure cooker type of apparatus when placed under 15 pounds of pressure the boiling point of water is raised to 121 degrees Celsius a temperature sufficient to kill bacterial and the spores dry heat dry heat kills microorganisms through a process of protein oxidation rather than protein coagulation examples of dry heat include hot-air oven microbiological ovens employ very high dry temperatures 171 degrees Celsius for one hour 160 degrees Celsius for two hours or longer or 121 degrees Celsius for 16 hours or longer depending on the volume they are generally used only for sterilizing glassware metal instruments and other inert materials like oils and powders that are not damaged by excessive temperature incineration incinerators are used to destroy disposable or expendable materials by burning we also sterilize our inoculating loops by incineration pasteurization pasteurization is the mild heating of milk and other materials to kill particular spoilage organisms or pathogens it does not however kill all organisms milk is usually pasteurized by heating to 71 point six degrees Celsius for at least 15 seconds in the flash method or 62 point nine degrees Celsius for 30 minutes in the holding method low temperature low temperature inhibits microbial growth by slowing down microbial metabolism examples include refrigeration and freezing refrigeration at five degrees Celsius slows the growth of microorganisms and keeps food fresh for a few days freezing at minus ten degrees Celsius stops microbial growth but generally does not kill microorganisms and keeps food fresh for several months desiccation desiccation or drying generally has a static effect on microorganisms lack of water inhibits the action of microbial enzymes such as in dehydrated and freeze-dried foods radiation the ultraviolet portion of the light spectrum includes all radiations with wavelengths from 100 nanometers to 400 nanometers it has low wavelength and low energy the microbicides activity of ultraviolet UV light depends on the length of exposure the longer the exposure the greater the sidle activity it also depends on the wavelength of UV used the most Seidel wavelengths of UV light lie in the 260 nanometers to 270 nanometers range where it is absorbed by the nucleic acid filtration microbiological membrane filters provide a useful way of sterilizing materials such as vaccines antibiotics solutions animal sera enzyme solutions vitamin solutions and other solutions that may be damaged or denatured by high temperatures or chemical agents the filters contain pores small enough to prevent the passage of microbes but large enough to allow the organism free fluid to pass through phenol and phenol derivatives phenol five to 10% was the first disinfectant commonly used however because of its toxicity and odor fino derivatives are now generally used these include ortho phenol phenol hexa chlorophenol issen x ir s-- or channel and chlorhexidine soaps they are mildly microbus ìtell their use aids in the mechanical removal of microorganisms by breaking up the oily film on the skin and reducing the surface tension of water so it spreads and penetrates more readily some cosmetic soaps contain added antiseptics to increase antimicrobial activity detergents it may be anionic or cationic anionic detergents such as laundry powders mechanically remove microorganisms and other materials but are not very microbus item cationic detergent Psalter membrane permeability and denature proteins they are effective against many vegetative bacteria some fungi and some viruses however bacterial andis spores and certain bacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Pseudomonas species are usually resistant they are also inactivated by soaps and organic materials like cationic detergents include the quaternary ammonium compounds alcohols 70-percent solutions of ethyl isopropyl alcohol are effective in killing vegetative bacteria enveloped viruses and fungi however they are usually ineffective against Handa spores and non-enveloped viruses once they evaporate their seidel activity will cease alcohols denature membranes and are often combined with other disinfectants such as iodine mercurial's and cationic detergents for increased effectiveness chlorine chlorine gas reacts with water to form hypochlorite ions which in turn they nature microbial enzymes chlorine is used in the chlorination of drinking water swimming pools and sewage sodium hypochlorite is the active agent in household bleach calcium hypochlorite sodium hypochlorite and claw or amines are used to sanitize glassware eating utensils dairy and food processing equipment hemodialysis systems and treating water supplies ethylene oxide gas ethylene oxide is one of the very few chemicals that can be relied upon for sterilization after for 12 hours exposure since it is explosive it is usually mixed with inert gases such as freon or carbon dioxide gaseous chemo sterilizers using ethylene oxide are commonly used to sterilize heat sensitive items such as plastic syringes Petri plates textiles sutures artificial heart valves heart-lung machines and mattresses ethylene oxide has very high penetrating power and denatures microbial proteins vapors are toxic to the skin eyes and mucous membranes and are also carcinogenic
