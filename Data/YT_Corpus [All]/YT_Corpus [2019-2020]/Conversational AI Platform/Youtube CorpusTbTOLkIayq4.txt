and sheila i'll turn things over to you thank you eric and welcome everyone so today we're talking about accelerating actionable ai in the contact center so where did we choose our topic from many enterprises for the last two three four years have been moving slowly to adopt artificial intelligence in their contact centers but the current environment what we've all gone through for the last six months has really accelerated rollouts to deal with urgent new demands and organizations have found that they can implement artificial intelligence and get measurable benefits much more quickly than they ever thought that they could with some implementations going live in as few as 15 days so my i'm going to be asking questions and participating in conversation with el sonora and rajan here and we're going to sort of pace through these topics uh smoothly uh immediate challenges and then what the initial deployments and learnings were and then what's next what's step two for companies that did do some artificial intelligence deployments earlier we'll talk about artificial intelligence and the agent experience consumer acceptance of ai and then sort of the market in general and how acceptance has been and finally we'll talk about just-in-time innovation how quickly new innovative um technologies and use cases are can be added to what's been done primarily from the work that vendors like google and vendor and uh and genesis are doing so let's get started with immediate challenges and so i'm first i'm going to ask elsa nora as you look back over the past few months what are some of the examples of the immediate challenges that customers were able to address with rapid deployment of artificial intelligence yeah i mean some of the immediate challenges we saw so many of the customers um realize immediately in terms of increased state increased volumes either through their call centers or some of these you know digital channels so it was increased volumes with fewer agents as companies thought about how to adapt to the work from home environment and frankly all of a sudden they needed to make sense of all of this data that was being generated which is really where ai thrives and so we were able to see a lot of companies that may have had ai earlier on in their 2020 you know strategic plans really accelerate the decision-making around how to solve some of these challenges um some of the use cases that we saw really quickly and sheilas you alluded to you know in in as little as two weeks were things like faq bots around you know the new operating procedures hours of operations how to initiate a return you know just some of these things that all of a sudden you couldn't readily find available inquiries questions around benefit eligibilities a lot of the emergency response and so you know a huge number of use cases really around disseminating and getting information out quickly in a self-service way while we sort of managed and normalized this increased volume with fewer agents excellent so rajan what rapid was so key as as elsinore was talking about in the may and the march and april timeframes what specifically did the google contact center ai team do to help speed up deployment processes yeah that's a great question and it's it's interesting because i think both in all of our personal lives as well as in our businesses we saw this incredibly quick but massive change that happened and what what was needed is that we needed a an all hands on deck approach both within google and with our partners to try to figure out how to how to approach this and i'll have to tell you you know my 16 years here at google it's one of the proudest moments i've i've had because because we've all really pulled together to figure out how to solve the problems and there were a couple of things that were really key there the first was focus focusing in on the customer use cases that really mattered and in particular the sectors that really mattered so elsinore was talking about you know all these new questions coming in that people hadn't had to answer before and were going to these live agents and so focusing in on solving those questions and reducing the load was was really uh really really crucial for all the statistics that you see up here and then the second thing was fast you know how can we take things that sometimes you know customers were taking months to go to how can we do that in two weeks and so that was the other big uh insight we had to do a lot of work on our end to make it so that people could deploy this uh well in two weeks and we have to critically work with uh with genesis to be able to do that so that it fits into the flow and that they're able to actually make this happen uh in in a couple of weeks and it was really about meeting those those immediate critical human needs that uh that were there um and it was amazing to see the success that happened as a result so i think one of the things that i've heard from both solution providers and from companies is that that fast deployment is something that they think can persist going forward that suddenly we have created new procedures and new operational you know metrics that will allow this to continue so what are some of the other things that you think are changes that were made for the immediate response that are going to persist ratchet and it is interesting because i think that it's actually opened up people's eyes to what can be possible and what what happened was a few things i think that many many many more organizations realized that that um by implementing ai they could have this immediate benefit and you know i think we were seeing that what we're seeing on the screen here is a survey that we did uh for some of the results uh that are there you can see that they saw these dramatic uh results and as a result of that people were realizing that this isn't just about cobit they could apply these for a number of different things both in terms of the rapid response types of applications that they have across you know every industry from whether it be retail or financial services or government uh or healthcare but in addition to that what they can do if they go further with this and so it started many conversations around okay we did this now what's next how can we make this uh this this even better um and that's been that's been great to see and i think you know in all of the things that i'm seeing with ai this is one of the most effective areas of ai where ai can make a huge difference so i'm going to throw a little bit of a curveball to you both now so initial deployments and learnings very often you'll hear enterprises say that it's really difficult when there's more than one vendor involved that there's finger pointing and things get slowed down so in these initial deployments and learnings i'm going to go to elsinore first are there new ways of working together with partners that again are going to persist over time we've been fortunate to have a long-standing relationship in our integration and the work that we're doing with google and what that this particular partnership has given us is the ability to have best-in-class ai that is tied to a platform that's 100 focus on customer experience and so because each one of us is bringing that focus to the table um some of these learnings going forward are about continuing to bring that um continuing to develop the ai capabilities with that lens that maniacal focus lens on a exceptional customer experience and there are certainly things that as you know the the deployments become more complex as some of these use cases evolve um we'll continue to work through um but but that particular focus on cx and best in class ai i think has been a home run for you know definitely from the genesis perspective and rajan any comments there yeah it's i think that the thing that we had to do really is break down borders between teams or boundaries between organizations and work together as a team focusing on the north star the north star is the customer how do we work together and apply both of our expertise to solving that customer need and what's been really impressive about genesis is is that the genesis team has decades of experience with customer service and customer experience and so we're able to benefit from that um and and the fact that they're already working with many many customers and we have decades of experience in ai that's one of the hallmarks of google and so by combining these together we're able to create a solution that meets the customer need and is really designed around that customer but brings in the latest of technology excellent so i'm going to move on to what's next we talked about the immediate response we talked about some of the learnings from that but what comes next and i'm going to start with with genesis one of the tactics that we saw was an initial chatbot that would go on a website but not necessarily be able to transfer to a live agent which might be frustrating for a customer so is that the kind of work that companies are now trying to sort of add on um so we do see that sheila but you know before i answer that i mean one of the learnings that we see and persist and and rajan was showing the statistics which is we've seen a 14 increase in customer satisfaction with introducing these conversational agents so both the customer side and the and the brand side what we're seeing is a willingness to be able to move to more complex use cases so where some of these initial conversational agents were really around the faqs and sharing the knowledge we're now seeing in terms of what's next moving to fulfillment or more complex use cases the natural evolution of that is to bookend the conversational agent experience with things like agent assist so yes at some point it isn't necessarily something that's self-contained and we have to make sure that we promote that to an agent but before doing that too you know brands are now looking at what this new way of thinking of the customer journey just given you know some brick and mortar store still being closed and trying to think about what the customer journey looks like so we have a customer just to give you an example it's a home appliance manufacturer it's a google joint google genesis customer and they do have some voice bots with dialogflow but what they also use is one of our other ai offerings predictive engagement and what predictive engagement does it actually follows a customer's experience through the website so if at any point there's a moment of struggle or questions that's the moment in which they can offer them that chat so again you start to see there the interaction between these two ai products working together at that point there's the ability to understand who the customer is personalize that experience be a little bit more proactive so as that journey and that experience progresses and it does ultimately require promoting it to an agent then that agent has a little bit more information about the customer segment the intent the outcome that they're trying to achieve so the what's next for us has been very clear in trying to bookend these conversational agents certainly with conversational experience certainly with the agent but really thinking about what comes before that and what might be an experience let's say with a digital footprint absolutely so you talked a little bit there elsinore about vertical use cases right and on this slide we're showing all the different verticals that google and genesis have worked together on so rajan can you you know perhaps pick out a couple of these and talk about you know what the first response was that rapid response and then what you see might be that next step for some of these verticals sure well i think the the number one lesson is that it's all about solving a business problem and creating a business outcome and uh you know honestly it's something i feel like i've learned the hard way with ai you know a couple of years ago as we all thought about the ai we wrote the mindset of hey here's all this great ai come and get it and and great things will happen and the number one question that came back from customers is okay that's great but how does it solve one of the business problems that is critical for me and that's where this really comes in is that i think there's a an elevation of that which is we can help make your contact center better we can satisfy your customers in a much better way and we can we can make your contact center much more efficient but then there's a second elevation of that which is what are the very specific things that this can help with you can see some of the cases that the use cases that are that are here um retailers all of a sudden they had to go completely virtual companies that were not e-commerce companies had to become e-commerce companies and handle things like curbside pickup which is a huge logistical load but they're able to do that if they're able to apply ai to it what i think is going to happen going forward is that we're able to meet the needs that are there with these immediate needs but then there are two steps that happen after that one is how do we actually help the overall customer experience and increase customer satisfaction when the customer picks the phone or types into a chatbot um and tries to contact a company and so there are many things we can do to help the agent to help the customer to be more proactive with the customer and things like that the second thing is the overall concept of customer experience how do we optimize the overall customer experience uh as part of all of the channels that they talk to uh talk to a particular company how do we actually optimize that and that that's really where all of this goes can we make it so that five years from now the experience that people have with a retailer with their doctor with their bank with their government is just a much smoother experience and that's where we're getting to um you know it's interesting as i look at this verticals list healthcare one of the things that has boomed in this last few months is telehealth so either one of you uh elsinore perhaps is there a place for the contact center in the telehealth world because some of that seems to be a little bit more in the unified communication space but has genesis found itself being involved with some healthcare concerns as they try and roll out telehealth yeah absolutely sheila and and it's it's interesting because the emergence of that around telehealth also requires thinking about some cross-brand cross-use case um you know type of situations if you think about in a telehealth environment they have to talk to a doctor and now patients require certain specialized equipment or certain specialized medicine for example so i am familiar with some use cases where there's been some of this brands working together where there's a an uber type company that will be able to deliver some of the equipment needed or some of the medicines needed that are certified that are associated following some of these telehealth um uh you know type of conversations and so we're gonna start seeing i think an emergence of collaboration across these use cases in a way that's going to force brands working together to be able to provide a higher experience and a higher service level to customers so i think it's really interesting what the current situation is going to require all of us as vendors to really think outside the box and try to facilitate some of that so the other one that i see here is unemployment claims and i know that google and genesis work together on some of those scenarios so rajan you want to talk a little bit about perhaps again how they started and how they may be morphing over time yeah absolutely and it was it was interesting to see especially within government a lot of local governments all of a sudden started to go towards using ai in their in their customer contact flow as a result of kobe unemployment claims were one of the biggest areas and i mean as as we all know unemployment claims skyrocketed um during that time and they were needing to handle a lot of inquiries very very quickly and so that was really a great way to uh to solve a key need with uh with governments but there are many many other needs within within government as you're seeing things like you know application status benefits of eligibility things like 3-1-1 these are things that this can now be extended to uh as well and and um sheila on your on your point about telehealth i think that's that is a really really interesting one too um one thing that we've done is we've been working very closely with a lot of healthcare providers and what we saw not surprisingly is that you know in some cases the majority of visits went to telehealth visits over the course of the last few months but we're also seeing is now that in-person visits are picking back up still there's a lot of telehealth um way beyond what there was before covet i mean we anticipate that that's going to be the case uh ongoing we actually just made some big investments in telehealth that we announced this week and um and i think that the context in our experience is crucial to that because ultimately again it's the customer doesn't care if it is a contact center or if it's a doctor or whatever they're just wanting to come to their healthcare provider and get very quick help where you know their wellness or their life actually really matters and is on the line with that and i think that there's a lot that we can do um with a with a combination of technologies to make that flow a lot better yeah it's been interesting to see even um personal you know pcps primary care physicians suddenly making that available um which they typically wouldn't have done in the past so there's a whole acceptance of telehealth by consumers but also there's much higher availability than we ever saw before and i've personally been taking advantage of it on a pretty regular basis so um let's move on to what a lot of this means to the agent because they're part of this as well so rajan the self-service elements of contact center ai from google were probably the first ones to come to market and get deployed can you give us an update on the agent assist where your technology is used to help create that super agent help an agent become smarter are there any anecdotes but now agents are adapting to having this new information and these new tools have what it means to them yeah definitely and uh it has been really interesting to see as we've deployed with customers the kinds of things that we're seeing people start to do with uh with agent assist because the reality is this is that there are a number of questions that can be answered in an automated way for sure and i think what we've seen with the virtual agent side of this is that we've really increased the number of questions can be answered uh that can be answered um automatically however probably still the majority of questions are things that you need a human being to talk to the person and work through a flow and figure things out with uh with that person and so the agent experience is crucial and agent assist has been very successful in reducing call times and it does two things one it makes the call center more efficient but then the other more important thing is that it makes the customer experience a lot better and what it what it's really been doing is that it's really helping the agent have a um have a strong sense of what kinds of things that they can suggest what's the menu of options that they can suggest given what the customer is talking about and it shortens the amount of time that they can deliver help to the to the customer which the customer has been really appreciating and we've seen that uh from a lot of for example the user studies that we've been doing with uh with agent assistant in the contact center and some of the some direct experience with some of the deployments that we've seen elsinore do genesis customers typically begin with self-service ai and then move to agent assist are there companies that have concentrating on on improving the agent experience for for our customers there is definitely a lot of focus on improving the agent experience um i mean it's a little bit of both but definitely the agent experience and the reason why we see that in so many of those customers is because we also have an entire workforce engagement management suite of products and so when we step back and think about the agent experience there's a couple of different facets to that there's ai and what we're learning from the conversational bots and what we can do with this real-time information that we make available to the agents there's also when you speak a little bit about it the element of being able to personalize the conversation with the customer at genesis we have made significant improvements in a design practice and what that means for us as ai practitioners is we're doing all of this research to make sure that as we're delivering a lot of this ai we're working with sponsor users we're working with agents who are giving us real-time feedback and what they need and what's helpful to do their job so when they now have all of these ai products and these capabilities that are coming at them then we're also doing the work necessary so that an agent can synthesize the information we're giving them in 10 seconds so when they pick up the phone and say hi sheila we understand that you're calling about x y and z there's that level of personalization that is critical to the customer experience and that frankly is empowering to the agent um and then at that point we have the agent assist capabilities um really shine with being able to take in the real transcription and as rajan was saying you know make sure that they can confidently answer the question but the flip side of that is also that with our wbm capabilities it becomes from an ai standpoint a really rich set of data of metrics and a lot of information that is being generated through this product that can ultimately make our data nai platform smarter more efficient can really fine-tune a lot of our models and so a long way of saying that we are tuning both our customer experience and our agent experience simultaneously with so that brands don't necessarily have to make a choice between self-service and the agent experience for both of you one of the the issues has been how can an agent absorb the information that ai is going to deliver so some of it is about the user interface so is there have there been some learnings along the way as you've begun to deploy i'm going to start with rajan but then obviously elsinore is not in her head so she's got a comment as well yeah for for sure i think that you know one of the interesting things that we've done with our first customers is that we've used our user experience team and actually actually sent them into the contact centers to sit with a lot of the agents and just observe how do they do their day-to-day work and that that user experience is is really really crucial um because you know it is the difference between the customer being satisfied and the customer not being satisfied so we're putting a lot of work jointly in with our customers uh to figure out how do we optimize that user experience on the agent side also of course then there is the the customer side which is you know i have a problem that i need solved by by one of the companies that i interact with how do i very quickly find uh what i need how do i get the attention that i need and i think there the the tendency in the past has always been you know call the phone number hit zero as many times as i possibly can to get to get to a human and uh and then you know talk talk to a person and i think what we're finding is the combination of opening up multiple channels whether it be you know a bot on the website or opening it up such that you can communicate in via chat or via social channels or you know making it such that there's a really you know clear and and friendly uh and and um and helpful voice that's there that's an automatic voice that that's there when they pick up all of those things make it such that for the customer that user experiences uh is a lot better and they actually like going with uh with with that virtual experience um much more than they have in the past and i think i think ultimately really it really boils down to that that the nuances of the user experience to make that better also on the agent experience yeah and and i mean i agree with everything that raj is saying what i would add to that as well is you know jenna says we've built a customer data platform for real-time engagement now what that means is you take everything that rajan said and now you multiply that over all of the different times that a customer has called into the brand and so if you're an agent and you all of a sudden you know you have somebody call and you see that this can be a continuation of a service call that happens you know every couple of months that still hasn't been resolved and so the aggregation of that data is really powerful because it allows you to again understand and acknowledge who your customer is which is so key to that experience but it has to be done in a way that the agent doesn't have cognitive overload where you can really surface the most important pieces still acknowledging that this seems to be the third call that this customer has made and so let's make this the last call because we're going to help you and we've understood your problem and now we're going to stay with you until it's it's resolved and so part of again that agent experience is trying to balance we want to personalize it we i want to understand who you are as a customer and we want to reduce the cognitive load for an agent so that we're making you as efficient and as effective as possible in that moment um and that's a and that's a and it's an interesting challenge and a great challenge when you're thinking about ai because there's a couple of different ways to solve that um and a couple of different ways to think about that and as rajan said really it comes down to spending quality time and putting yourselves and having that empathy for the agents so that whatever experience and however we're bringing these ai capabilities to life it is with that in mind um you know making them efficient and effective excellent so we already started talking a little bit about consumers and how they interact with ai and to one of the comments that rajan made about you know i have found what the substitute for zero zero zero is in a chat bot and it's if i try the chat bot and i don't feel like it really knows my intent if i type in i need to speak to a live agent i would say 80 of the time it works so you guys are doing your job because it should work it should work i should be able to get a live agent if i ask for one but uh let's talk uh elsinore about a specific customer so we have a use case here um of genesis customers that did a rapid deployment so talk to us about this particular case and the consumer acceptance of artificial intelligence that was really embodied in this use case yeah this is a great use case for a number of different reasons this is todd public company limited and it's very interesting because we touched about government um earlier and we talked about state unemployment or some of the unemployment agencies and you know tot is a is it um telephony provider or a temple company owned by owned and operated by the government of thailand and so we talk about you know government enterprise customers and their adoption of ai and they approached genesis in google with wanting to provide something to their customers that helped them understand the increase or help them handle the increased volume that was natural that followed you know a good human conversation and that could handle um probably a higher complexity in that conversation and so the two companies work together to try to meet some of those needs vis-a-vis the increased demand and this is a a deployment that's live today um and they're seeing you know really great improvements and up to two minutes uh reduction in the average handle time so what that goes show yeah i know great what that goes to show is that they've been able to handle just some of those incoming calls in a way that made it more effective in a way that they they were able to move through um some of the concerns that they were you know bringing to um todd so great customer story and goes to you know when we talk about customer acceptance as well um you know just how government and some of these agencies have been a lot more open to just thinking about ai now as a way to creatively solve these challenges so back to this notion of consumer acceptance rajan have you seen the businesses that google is working with more willing you know in 2020 now to roll out ai solutions more broadly as opposed to the limited pilots that we talked about earlier do you think we've we've crossed a chasm of some kind with the use of artificial intelligence in customer care yeah i i really believe that that we have in a little bit of context on this as i look over the last three years that i've been involved with our ai team here and over the the entire portfolio of ai one of the things that i i had often been telling customers and i think is still true is that you know now or say a couple years ago was the equivalent of where the internet was in 1994 where you know peop the average end user was just starting to see in 1994 what the kinds of things they could do with the internet that was that were really interesting and they could actually impact their lives and then what we saw over the first 10 years from you know 1994 to say 2004 was the internet went from being this interesting novelty to something that was embedded into every single business businesses was critical to every single business we're going through that same flow right now with uh with ai just overall well we are i think that ai and customer care is the first big area to cross the chasm and i'm seeing that i saw that before code hit and i think that that we saw with covet is really accelerating uh that and again what it really boils down to are business outcomes and if people can start to see business outcomes that matter uh to them then then it really it motivates them to want to do more with this um last year as we were doing broader call you know contact center implementations some of the things that we were seeing was a dramatic um increase in the in the number of call deflections a dramatic increase in in uh or dramatic decrease in call handle time a dramatic increase in customer satisfaction all three of those are metrics that really really matter to any business uh that that's out there and so we've seen the interest in contact center go up quite a bit over the last year but actually more than that the real live deployments and i've seen you know very very large contact centers now move uh fully to using contact center ai and that's been a great thing to see it's actually i think a model for the the rest of ai and how ai can uh can impact industries i think i think customer care has amongst the most potential so it's interesting that you talk about um things that we might have thought about in the past but we're changing you know things are changing about the way we think about ai it was interesting when you talked about deflection there because i remember you know deflection used to be a dirty word right in a contact center we don't want to deflect our customers we want to take care of our customers and i think there is more of an acceptance of deflection now um maybe that's not you know the best word but people the reason being that consumers want to be handled want to be able to handle their their interactions in a self-service way so it's not really deflection it's the way consumers actually want to interact with the business sometimes so elsinore if we think about the market you know sort of broadly we came into this with a couple of notions especially when google contact center ai first came out there was self-service and there was an agent assist are there new things coming that are coming out of these early deployments are there new ways of thinking about you know how we're going to use the google contact center ai capabilities going forward yeah absolutely i mean you know you you've you've hit to saying that the conversational agent and the agent assist piece of it are still very paramount um to that experience but you know just as important as i said earlier is really rethinking what the cost what the entire end-to-end customer journey looks like and for from a genesis ai standpoint is really um you know blurring the lines between some of the ai and martech and some of what we're seeing in customer experience and what i mean by that and we have a specific ai offering that really addresses that um which is predictive engagement and you know just to give you to go back to the example you just said around deflection you might have a customer that's on a website for a particular company and they're looking for answers to something and what predictive engagement can do in the background is it kind of now understands the customer segment and the outcome that this customer is trying to achieve and at some point again there's a moment of struggle they kind of abandon it and at that point you can pop up the chat now what can happen in this instance is a customer saying i'm trying to find answers to x y and z and the chat is able to redirect to the page that contains the faq or contains the knowledge within the existing website and so these are examples of self-service these are examples of containment that now start start crossing that web experience with the conversational experience with ultimately you just supported um a customer getting to the answers that they needed so you know a lot of that extension into into what is now what you would have traditionally considered to be more of the web optimization type use cases um so you know with predictive engagement especially because as i said we understand your customer segments and we understand the outcome then that makes the conversational and the and the agent assist experience just that much stronger the other thing around that around what customer wants and is when we present this entire end to end journey we'll get questions especially on the ai side that say we know we can only handle 5000 chats let's say and so if we look at the end to end experience and we're starting with customers that are somehow in their website then it's it's really on us to try to use ai to help you as customers understand how to prioritize those 5000 chats if that's all you can handle which ones get deflected which ones are contained which ones are the most important and valuable ones that you ultimately have to bring to an agent and so as brands are fine-tuning their ai investment it's about looking at that journey helping customers optimize it becomes smarter around it so that they can make some of the best decisions on how to how to customers progress through this workflow um you know make more informed decisions knowing all the different levers that you can fine-tune across something like predictive engagement and dialog flow and agent assist so sort of a similar question for you rajan when you think slightly longer term are there shifts happening in the way google approaches the market for conversational ai yeah and i think i i think there definitely is and i think that if i look longer term i think that this becomes a third user interface um and what i'll tell you what i mean by that then from a from a user point of view from a customer the customer's customer from that user's point of view they really only care about two things when they when they call into a company or when they come to a company's website they want to get their problem solved as quickly as they can and they want to get their problem solved they don't want to go away without without an answer or without a resolution that's really all that they care about and they don't want they don't care to spend much more time than that and so traditionally there have been two user interfaces the user interface number one is you go to the website and you search on the website and you look through faqs etc etc and you try to find an answer to your question in the self-service way the second user interface has been i call in and i talk to a live human and i try to get my question answered and there are variations of that uh with uh with with how you talk to uh you know you talk to an agent through a chat or you talk about the phone there's a third user interface which is conversational ai we've discovered that in our consumer experience with google overall because what was happening with google search is people wanted to search but what we're finding is that the types of things people were entering into the search box was they were asking questions that need an immediate answer or they wanted action on something they wanted to take an action on something and that's why we invented google assistant to begin with um and all of the things behind google assistant as a result of that we're finding that people's interaction with that new third user interface has made their experience to find information much much better i think the same thing can happen for every company out there by introducing that third user interface customers are going to get the action that they need and get the questions answered that they need much more much more quickly and that just increases customer satisfaction goes to those two goals that the end user has excellent so in sort of a rapid fire mode for this last question before we get to the uh the questions from our audience members so get ready with your questions as large global tech company google i have to assume that your road maps are planned months in advance did the recent crisis cause google cloud to shift priorities to put some things on the near term road pat map that were maybe six months ago weren't even on the you know have you shifted things around because of this and then i'm going to ask you to answer the same question elsinora when uh rajan is done yeah i think that there are two things that have really shifted one is that rapid implementation and so we were we still are focused on how can we transform a the customer care experience or for a company and that that can last over the course of many years but then the the thing that we found with covet that we're finding postcode or in the midst of this that we think will happen post covet is that rapid uh deployment and so we've been putting a focus on how can we do things that are more self-service that can make it so that people can deploy in less than four weeks and so we're doing we're doing a set of programs around that and we have a set of products coming out around that to make that uh uh to make that be the case the second thing is that is the the set of use cases in the industries that we're focusing on you know areas like government for example have really spiked in their in their usage and so we're doing a lot more to try to figure out how can we take what we have and apply it to different industries that now have much greater need than they did six months ago genesis our ai strategy is really um to have a very flexible platform and that includes our own native technology technology you know with partners such as google and and really what it's done is it's built to be able to offer you as a customer maximum flexibility in where you've made your investments so as we work towards rapid deployments and to getting some of these youth cases split up in a very short amount of time that type of flexibility has been really really validating because we've been able to meet customers where they are so i mean it's been wonderful to have that validated what we have heard from customers as we worked with them is we love your strategy but we need it in 127 languages so we definitely had to think about accelerating our language capabilities because this is a you know this is something that is globally accelerated and all of the brands want to be able to offer them in those in those local languages and so we are definitely looking at ways to scale our language capabilities excellent so i'm going to move this to the next slide and i'm going to let the two of you speak to it because you guys know how best to speak to this slide and when we start with the left we'll start with elsinore yeah i mean as we we kicked off saying this has been a really great partnership um in what we can offer customers with you know best in class ai and as we said that that really that big focus on cx um if there's one thing you know that i want you to take away from what genesis can bring is that we are looking at that end-to-end journey for the customer that may start with a phone call that may start with the web experience and really focusing on that omni channel conversation with a customer and orchestrating it and what we mean by orchestration is really being able to support the workflow regardless of where it starts in a way that makes sense for you as a customer and that really is the flexibility of how the platform is built and how we bring in partner integrations to be able to support that experience to that you know we continue to add and augment that experience with other types of capabilities ai capabilities that may be part of our wem platform routing capabilities but at the core of it again is really thinking about the customer at the center and how we support that best possible experience regardless of what channel it may have started and and helping you resolve whatever that may be with the right level of effectiveness efficiency and empathy and roger i think it's your time to now say how great google is well i you know i'll go back to something that we talked about earlier which is that north star the north star is how do we meet customers needs and i think what's great about this partnership is that you have a company like genesis that that is the best in customer experience and has a you know decades of experience in customer experience and you bring that together with what we're doing in ai and google we talk about google as an ai first company and we really mean that we've integrated ai into every pr every product from google that you use on the consumer side on the enterprise side has ai integrated into it and so we've invested deeply in becoming the leaders in ai and and having the best infrastructure having the best capabilities that are out there and if you bring these things together you can really create transformative experiences uh that improve customer satisfaction and that's really what we're what we're focused on excellent so i am now going to turn it over to eric who will moderate our q a all right thanks very much sheila and of course thanks rajan and elsinora for a great uh discussion and just really uh interesting and uh encouraging to to hear about all these developments and the speed that they're happening in so the first question we have um is a question about uh kind of specific to the the integration and solve i'll uh throw it to both raj and and elsinora um and we're being asked what is the status of the integrations between dialog flow and uh genesis cloud so one of you would prefer to go first so dialogflow is completely integrated with genesis i mean it is one of our strategic integrations for conversational ai so if that is something that you are looking um to have somebody reach out and talk about what your options are that is absolutely something that we can do today and uh browsing anything yeah no i think that that that well covers the dialogflow is really the heart of a lot of the uh a lot of our capabilities and so we've deeply integrated that in with genesis along with all of the other parts of this our agents this product and a variety of other other parts of the contact center portfolio okay great thanks very much um the next question uh i'll start with um actually i think i'll start with sheila because you've you've covered this kind of across the industry uh and can speak to it as a broader trend um they're asking how is cloud critical you know cloud services critical to adoption of ai for contact centers um actually this is kind of a two-part question and i'll save the second part for after we do this because it's a little a little in another direction but first of all what's what's been the role of cloud in in allowing ai to be adapted and sheila i'll start with you and i should take myself off mute before i answer so i was gonna as i was saying um genesis is a great example of that path that cloud has played in artificial intelligence initially when they started working they started working with their very biggest customers who were premises based customers and there came a point where a decision was made that the only place to do artificial intelligence was going to be in the cloud because the data is what what was necessary and if you couldn't rapidly get access to all of the data in real time then it was not going to be true artificial intelligence now what's happened now is that we and i feel like i'm telling elsinore's story for her but you can take and it's not just at genesis at other companies as well you can take google contact center ai and apply it in premises solutions but it is cloud on top of premises the ai is happening in the cloud and so those decisions are being made in the cloud based on the data that's in the cloud so um you know i think there was a moment when we thought we could do ai on premises that's gone away but now premises customers can't take advantage of it but all the ais in the cloud good work google yes yeah again you expand on that eric you know be a hybrid and what we're seeing now especially especially in some of these use cases where there is now an appetite to look at these uh workflows in in the cloud is some of these enterprises are moving those that are more related to ai first as part of some of this transition to the cloud so it's definitely paving the way for some of those um transition migration transformation discussions one thing i'll add to that is that there are three big reasons why cloud is so important here um the first is uh is as sheila was pointing out the processing power that's there a lot of these models that we're talking about require major compute to be able to uh to be able to process that and to be able to train that and that's that's where the cloud uh really comes in uh in into play the second is scale being able to handle this across you know millions of interactions tens of millions hundreds of millions uh or even billions of interactions and and cloud can scale uh to be able to do that and then the third is innovation and i think that's really critical in ai an ai model doesn't stand still um it gets better and better and better over time and so you can see that with our voice models for example that literally every day it is getting better and so you can really do that well in the cloud because you can continually update that and make it better and better makes sense that that as one of the things that that we hear across the board with cloud is just the continual feature upgrade and and flexibility just continues to grow there's a second part of the the question that i mentioned that's a really a different question but i think it's a really interesting one and an important one for enterprises um and i'll i'll throw it maybe to rajan first just to mix things up uh they're asking how does a business get their data ready for ai this is it's not necessarily a a simple thing or it's it's the data that you have may not be just uh it may take some effort to make it ready for ai is that a fair statement i think that's a very fair statement i think that you know data is the most important part of ai and over time we're getting it so that the the the creation of a model is getting easier and easier the deployment of a model is getting easier but the data is the is the is the part that you have to focus in on because if you put the wrong data into a model you get the wrong outcomes uh with that and so i think the first thing to start with is the purpose of what what you're trying to achieve and then figure out what are the what are the right data points in which systems you uh you need and where do you need to to get them to one great thing with conversational ais there are definitely things that are essentially already pre-trained that can help you so for example our voice models um we've been honing the voice models for for um phone call interactions for a long time and you can just benefit from that instantly uh right away uh but then the the next part what you have to think about is your conversations what types of call flows are coming in and how do you handle those conversations what are the intents that uh that are happening in those kinds of things and that you know we're getting better and better at and making that easier for customers to do um but you need that data about about the types of interactions that are happening in your contact center elsinore any kind of specific tips on what some of your customers have done to approach this yeah this is a topic that's very near and dear to my heart because i spent 20 years in data and analytics and for a really long time the stats out there as 80 of ai projects fail because you have to have major data transformation initiatives and you have to think about what that looks like and so one of the most important messages that i feel we bring when we talk about the genesis data and ai platform is that we make data ai ready and you can't underscore how important that is to be able to actually speed up the adoption so if we take you know and expand on what rajan was saying you know benefits of working with google who's continually training and already giving what we're feeding the data and ai platform in the right data schema just ready to be used by models is so important i mentioned the wem platform earlier we've got a series of data and a series of metrics that is being collected continually and that is in real time being captured by a lot of these models and so from a customer standpoint we really begin by saying you can start using adopting deploying and seeing the benefits of ai without really having to think about these major data transformation initiatives so again we work really hard to make sure that your data is ai ready well and that's a great point i mean because we've emphasized so much the uh you know uh accelerating ai adoption and if somebody's looking at it and saying i know my data is a mess and i know that where it's just not really where it needs to be there there's a way still to to get into ai quickly and and not have to go that route i remember talking to a genesis cust um salesperson years ago literally in the 90s in australia and they said they had sold cti to a customer and they went to the customer to start doing the implementation process and found out that they had no customer database right so there was no way to do screen pops because there was no place to do it from and uh luckily we've come a long way from that time where we got almost a you know too much data so it is nice to hear that there are ways to get it up quickly with some some quick um templates or whatever and then let the system learn over time great and with that uh we're just about out of time for this webinar um i've put up a slide to remind everybody check out uh our sponsors for some more resources i want to thank uh genesis and google cloud for sponsoring the webinar and everybody in
