 [Music] today we are here with Taylor from quantify who is the practice lead for public sector and higher education we're very excited to explore some of the solutions built but quantify before we dig in Taylor can you tell us a little bit about quantified yeah of course we've been around six years now we focus primarily on AI and machine learning solutions we found that we're able to provide a lot of value for customers by helping them with their data strategy as well because you know that's kind of one of the fundamental building blocks of any AI or ML initiative we have been a Google cloud partner since 2016 obviously with that AI machine learning background we've been very close with Google cloud and have 325 GCP certified professionals which is about a quarter of our workforce we've actually been the 2017 and 2018 machine learning partner of the year and are a contact center AI launch partner as well that's awesome Congrats on the ml partner of the year and for being a CCAI launch partner can you tell us a bit more about CCAI and what it means to be a launch partner yes so there's three components to CCAI there's a topic modeler which uses keyword clustering to identify high frequency topics there's dialogue flow which is the NLP back and kind of the virtual agents so to speak and then if there is an instance where it needs to be transferred to a live agent there's functionality called agent assist that uses a real-time keyword search from the conversation between the live agent and the customer to pull up suggestions from the knowledge base and help them answer questions quickly as a launch partner we help customers through the entire lifecycle of a deployment so that's everything from helping them design conversation flows programming intents building integrations with the knowledge base CRM systems anywhere else that you know user data might exist and then also you know building that agent a6 functionality as well great thanks for sharing more about that can you talk more in depth about the types of technologies that quantify uses yes so because we've been using dialogue flow since before it was even actually called dialogue flow we've built a lot of custom machine learning models that you build manage and deploy any of these dialog floor contact center AI solutions one of them is intent identification so that takes your historical call or chat logs understands the ways that users are asking questions and programs that context directly into the virtual agent another involves the ingestion of text so think a you know knowledge base or FAQ section on your webpage it pulls out questions and answer pairs there and again makes it directly programmable into the virtual agent we also work a lot with the NLP sentiment analysis that exists in dialogue flow take it a step further in what we call a motion analysis so trying to understand when users are having these negative feelings identifying that earlier and helping you intervene before it starts becoming too negative and of an impact on customer satisfaction lastly we deal a lot with integrations so having your users or constituents reach out to you on whatever platform they feel comfortable is very important to creating value for the people that will be interacting with the solution whether that be voice chat messenger platforms SMS dialogue flow has all those integrations built in and very easily accessible can you talk about some of the specific solutions that quantify has built with CCI yeah so when a lot of people here contact center AI they think of the traditional call center while it's a great tool for that we found that the NLP capabilities behind dialogue flow are actually useful in a lot of other situations as well there was some work that we did in conjunction with Google Cloud and Penn State World Campus where we used the NLP capabilities of dialogue flow they had identified four different types of student requests where advisors were spending up to five thousand hours per year really just pulling different pieces of information during determining a student's eligibility to change major campus something like that so we use dialogue flow to recognize the intents of those users provide a templated response to the advisor that can then be personalized based on the student all while pulling all of that data that they had to spend 15 minutes gathering putting it right in front of them and giving them the opportunity to add value with their time rather than just searching for data what are some of the challenges that you've encountered when building these solutions yes so the first one that comes to mind is designing conversation flows not always do customers understand what they want to automate and how they want the agent to say it so we found that with using the topic modeler you can not only find a lot of the high frequency topics but you can dig down a level understand within those topics what people are talking about and help structure the conversation flow of the virtual agent using that we've also seen intent clashing a lot so as you continue to add intents to the bot it becomes more and more likely that there's going to be similarities between an existing intent so we've created an automated solution testing tool that goes through and tests those intense every so often and gives you an early indication if there's going to be problems with previous intent so that you can intervene and fix that before it ever sees the light of day well this has been very interesting thank you so much for being here with us today it was my pleasure if you'd like to learn more about quantify you can visit quantify calm thanks for watching and stay tuned for more episodes of stock chat [Music] you
