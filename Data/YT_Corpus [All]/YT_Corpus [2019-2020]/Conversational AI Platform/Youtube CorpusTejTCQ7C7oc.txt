 We discovered that conversational AI was growing very fast and becoming a very relevant channel for our different customer segments. We knew that we had to be present in that channel as it's a channel that our customers use. We decided to work with Mindsay as part of our Hanger 51 program. We were looking for an excellent team and technology that we could develop jointly to create the best conversational AI in our industry. We were looking to improve customer loyalty and the service we provide to our customers. We started by providing some important services, like flight status and check-in, in a very new way of interacting with our customers. We then added weather,  interesting activities to do at the destination, the possibility to buy tickets through the chatbot and many other services. The Mindsay team is very talented and behind the scenes there is a very strong and flexible technology that helps us integrate these services not only in the chatbot environment but also in voice.
