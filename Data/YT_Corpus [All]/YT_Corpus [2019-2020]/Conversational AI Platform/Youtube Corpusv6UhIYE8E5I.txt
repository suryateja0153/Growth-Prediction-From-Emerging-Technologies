 Slow IT support not only adds friction to the workday, it also limits productivity for today's businesses. The average IT ticket can take hours before a help desk agent first reads it, and days before it's resolved. Fortunately, a large percentage of these tickets can be resolved entirely by AI, from end to end, with no agent intervention needed. The Moveworks AI platform uses the latest machine learning techniques to transform Microsoft Teams, the hub for teamwork in Microsoft 365, into an autonomous IT support channel. The Moveworks bot chats directly with employees on Teams, addressing their tech issues instantly. You can easily integrate Moveworks with Teams, as well as other enterprise apps, to help resolve IT issues quickly. Ultimately, unlocking the full productive power of your workforce starts with Moveworks on Teams. Modernize your IT support with Moveworks and Teams today.
