part of your console in the question box yeah okay so make questions okay excuse me our speaker today is Bala Iyer Dean of Faculty and professor of technology operations and information management at Babson College our thanks go out to bold 360 by LogMeIn for their sponsorship of this webinar and now on to our presentation digital experiences using a conversational interface voila tell us about your research on in this area of customer experience thank you Bruce and welcome everybody this research that I have worked on started with a couple of years ago with colleagues cherry keen at Boston College and Andrew Bogut who's a investor and a venture capitalist in the Bay Area so the findings are what I'm going to list here in this presentation and my twitter handle can be found here in case you want to follow some issues around technology and strategy I mainly tweet about those and a little bit about the Patriots from time to time okay let me just set the expectation here on what kind of conversation we're gonna have here so we have now in the digital transmission era everything is getting connected and in the process of getting connected expectations have also changed as to what to expect as you interact with with companies so because the I'm going to be talking about conversational interfaces and commerce but more from a strategic perspective I want to set the stage for why is this important to understand from a strategic perspective and I will also talk about some examples of how companies are using it and what are some lessons learned in in the in the process so the big the key thing now today is that every company is trying to use technology to build and manage and deliver unique experiences for customers and build that in a very consistent manner across every touchpoint so as a result we are talking about digital experiences so this means that we have to pay attention to every aspect of product lifecycle and also we got to be looking at every interaction as an opportunity so the core ideas are poor things that you have to take away from this one using this concept you're going to talk about today how do companies automate some of the interactions and learn from every interaction the key goal for for her companies and you see to a large extent we'll talk about engagement stakeholder engagement is very important and we are going to talk about customer engagement particularly in this conversation the other expectation is that these conversational interfaces give companies the opportunity to create innovative business models and finally and this is a key concept with any digital initiative is you become part of multiple ecosystems and I refer to them as dynamic ecosystems we'll get through these concepts through examples as you proceed so here the trends that allow us to do the things that we just talked about when you try to do a startup or if an established company is trying to add new value you don't try to build everything yourself today you borrow some things from others who've done it for example Amazon has done a great job with AWS where you can get lot of the services from AWS but there will be a time soon where every company will be looking in out so that if they are very good at something they'll offer that as a service collecting data is going to become standard and then the same data will be used in different business contexts to get this different business value out of it and one Buffett talks about building modes data is going to be the new mode and the data we are talking about is not just the customer data which we are doing very well collecting today but also how people use the products and services that you sell and we refer to that as product in use our data the other trend that you see today is what I refer to as ambient user interfaces what I mean by that is if you look at kids in high school today if they see a text underlined they click on it because they expect that be a hypertext link similarly very soon people expect every object and every device to understand instructions that we have them do something so the user in a phase would be ambient and you can just talk to things that's going to be an expectation and finally what does this mean for strategy today when you think about an Apple product or Amazon there are some things that have investments they are made it makes it very easy for us to interact with their products and services and we also know that we have some expectations you pull out an Apple device immediately you can make it work it connects to things pretty quickly understands that things have to be connected for it to work and out of the box you are able to do that and they have created some expectations around digital experience in it is not just Apple I refer to these companies that are setting the trend today as digital Titans just as we learned in the earlier era about business and how to compete from automotive companies now it's the time of the digital Titans to teach us how to compete so examples of them are Apple Amazon $0.10 Baidu Alibaba you can see them to the right and the picture you see the graphic you see is about each one of them and their interconnections they don't they also collaborate as they compete so this is a representation of that these are all multi-billion dollar companies as you all know and they have what I refer to as platform based models and they are the ones who are experts at creating digital experiences they have they're setting the trend in that and they have also shown us what it means to own these data assets and they have taken these data assets into different domains which has led to other issues because now they have a competitive advantage over new entrants and even incumbents and the intervener businesses because of the data they have from other settings that they brought in and essentially by becoming multi-purpose platforms that present a threat to companies in every sector but one of the key there are few key concepts you learned from them there are many but I'll highlight a few for the purposes of this conversation they have introduced this concept of a digital customer what I mean by that is today when you interact with smart power products by a smart product what I mean is products that have built-in sensors an ability to process information when you interact with these smart products you generate information through doing every use a digital customer is somebody who's willing to share this information that is generated and you drive a car there's a lot of information that's generated about yourself how you drive the car and even the location where you are the environment that is around you a digital customer is willing to share that information with the provider and that exchange is favorable to both when this concept is used effectively companies can build that in that data mode that I was talking about which is information assets and the same data that you're collecting can be used to make the products better so every interaction is not just about surveying customers and telling them in some future release I can create a better product for you but actually right then and there to improve the product or service they are providing so this almost instant value is provided and that can't be the expectation the other concept that's important and that's evolving today and there are articles about this in the Sloan management review is the concept of digital replica so when this data that's being collected is used to build a digital version of the product or the customer that you're serving that's referred to as a digital replica so for example in the case of GE they build digital graphic URLs of the turbines that are they in the aircrafts and they able to track it and monitor it real time and know about problems or challenges that occur in real time and take actions to prevent anything bad from happening so these replicas that companies own through the data will allow them to provide monitoring services predictive maintenance services in fact move to more outcome-based services with their products and services if you look at a digital replica you have things that go into Twitter first of all you should understand if it's a product what is the physics and mechanics that's behind the product so that you can build a digital version of it you collect event B is date around then a price which is the classic database management system does you collect customer data which you are all doing today but I think the new thing that you're collecting is how products are getting used so if you're a driver of a car and you drive within the speed limits and you are not writing the brakes all the time you're not speeding and all those things can be recorded also data about the context where the car is operating can also be collected and while the decimal is driving the passenger is driving in the car you could even get physiological information about this person but what constant what do you think are the top use it uses for a digital replica we'll give you a couple seconds to fill out the poll we'll have those results in a second Paula do you have some thoughts on what what our people just getting used to this whole idea or I think in different shapes and forms people are getting used to this idea it's been around for a while but pulling it all together is what's happening which is end-to-end connecting the ideas of product reviews to actual design of products that is finally coming together thanks to technology okay so let me move on the I think it was during the f8 conference that Mark Zuckerberg captured the moment by saying that the the new generation of customers actually want to interact with brands also just like we talked about us clicking the underlying text they would like to interact with brands just like they interacting with any other person a friend so this is what brought us into the world of chat box and then we'll connect it to other such issues so these are simply programs that you can use natural language to interact with with companies and they will the key point remember is it's not magic because they have to have data sources to help answer these questions and we'll make the connection again clear as you move along unlike look at the tech industry oh that's yeah so we we have our another poll here this is the one about asking our attendees whether they are currently using chat BOTS are you currently using chat bot a chat bot will give you a couple seconds to answer here okay so looks like most the largest 41% are saying no and 29% have are currently using chat BOTS and the rest are considering using them how does that affect with with your expectation and that's it on which I was expecting I'll tell you reasons to support both BS and nose and just as as we move along why it makes sense there is reason to be cautious about it and the motivations to adopt it so I think if that makes that makes sense so one way to look at this is with most technologies look at it as stack and I'll explain what that means so look at UI design it is evolved from back in the day when you actually punched in commands either did at the DOS prompt or even through Linux how you interact with the operating system to more of the graphical user interface they're too small sin point-and-click and that be interface became standard then apps became the next one I think the next layer is the conversation layer they actually talk to you know programs or or objects and they may actually end up in working and hack and getting the task done ultimately we want the computer to do tasks for you and the more it becomes natural the higher is difficulty in processing requests and the more it becomes command driven the more difficult it is for the humans to write queries to the computer because you have to learn the computer language so either you're learning the computer gets to learn more about us or we gotta learn about how to talk to computers so it's one way or the other in within the chatbots i just want to give you a simple structure because this is important for us as we look at the lessons learned so if you take the chat board interface that's where you type in your request and the way this works is the chat pod requests and the chat pod functioning has to be embedded within things that you already use people this expression that is ab fatigue that using too many of these apps is already causing challenges for people and they end up using only very select few then downloading everything that shows up so if we add another interface for chat pods it's going to be very expensive to get people to talk so one strategy that's been taken is that companies are using the existing channels you use for messaging and building chat BOTS within those channels so that's one aspect of it the other thing is and within chat boards there's a heavy dependence on artificial intelligence engines because what separates these things from a traditional database and you might worry the traditional database through sequel is your ability did use natural language and that's where you need the artificial intelligence engines particularly natural language processing tools are very important here you need apps third party services like apps and even third party data sources for this value proposition to work but the key thing that goes on within the company is you build a set of databases and domain knowledge so when you look at a chatbot you could get some domain knowledge from the provider about let's say if you're building a bot for financial services and banks service provider could give you some domain knowledge around that and by the way as you start using the chat bot in your business you can add more to it if you still don't have common sense so they has to be some engine for general knowledge and then you gotta collect both the customer data and contextual data that's available to you doing the interactions that you provide so as you introduced chatbots you also have to think about the various sources for knowledge and the data you're collecting and remember the the bet is that you can use that data for other opportunities with other businesses and you can use that interface to build very unique experiences for the customers that's the but in order to deliver on that you need these third-party service providers but then the third-party service providers cannot give you all these types of knowledge you're talking about so you have to figure out what you own and what you can get from third party so in general when you talk about stacks and this is not anything to do with conversational layers but in general stacks there are many layers and the reason why this layer logic is important is from a strategic perspective firms can choose to dominate one layer for example if you decide to dominate the conversation layer or the a player you can pick one of those but in general layers closer to the customer are more valued because that's where you get the most cus customer data so you want to move up layers if you can the other thing that can happen is as you move up layer you also have the ability to commoditize layers below by actually providing some of the lower lower layer services are making that as not so relevant so you games moving up a stack but getting to be challenging now because a the expectation that you're going to have as they call it more humanity in the exchange so computers need to understand humans more it's easier said than done that you move closer to the customer because then you got to take other considerations help you put in there as we will talk about they here are some popular messaging apps and most of the adoption have gone into the billions and that's why they have become relevant the messaging is the platform that people are pick because of the adoption there and then what does it mean to have conversation commerce so for example if messaging apps are popular then conversationally interfaces allow people to use the natural language to talk to these programs so we use apps like Facebook Messenger we chat and dark and this this conversation commerce the phrase was coined by Chris Messina and I think the only thing I would like to add to that is ai has become very important in making this happen I think there was a question let me just look at what the question was okay yeah this could be referred to as the new stack and by the way you have to keep close track of the competing stack as it evolves because you could introduce new layers or new layers could get introduced and the implications for your own business you have to judge after the layers introduce no the question is whether the conversation layer is going to be adopted wildly that's the challenge to figure out as our poll said 41% are not ready for it 29% are looking at it as the adoption gets higher it becomes a legitimate layer in the competing stack the global chat bot market prediction is that it's going to be 834 million but if you look at the investment it's much higher 24 billion that's because it's an ecosystem and you have to invest other aspect for the deepest you when we refer to a bawd it's not one type there are many many types of bots and i won't go through them all but you could have it for as a personal assistant I think there's one I use all the time for looking for restaurants but news helpdesk product selection and even individual brandy so it's not bought is not just one thing several types of bots out there here's some cautions there's a study where people 63% said that they would use a piece I think our data was little bit lower but 63% agreed that they would use these BOTS but then they also find it quite creepy if pods behave too much like humans but the big takeaway for me is people like to know whether they interacting with real live person about and then they also want to be assured that the BART is not able to handle their questions that there is a human intervention available for that so this is a very interesting takeaway from this study also there's another study by information calm that said they only understand 30% of the requests and there's a reason for this because BOTS cannot be general-purpose engines because naturally its processing in AI has not reached to a point where any query can be understood we still have to have nano intelligence to do this we'll talk more about it and then 55% said that his accuracy and understanding was not there so here's the challenge right so users expect a highly personalized almost like a real human interaction with BOTS but the technology it's my belief that the technology is not there to deliver that and that's why that data had said that only 30 percent of the requests could be actually understood make sense so for very structured tasks like ordering a pizza it works but for the rest there's still challenges that are out there so what are some of the things that won't have to look for before you seriously proceed with this you should have clear recently adopters um you have to pick an area process there you know that you will find some results the you have to pick a platform and I give you a list of platforms the end of stock that you have to use to pick these the the initial development and based on the architecture you got remember that it's better to own some of the data and engines that you use and you also want to be able to deploy across multiple messaging platforms and the key thing is this is like any other platform and adoption metrics within platforms matter and the same thing here so when you pick a platform number of users on it developers on it those things matter just like other platform friendly you're gonna have the ability to create personas or more human-like interfaces and is important for that in the platform here's a picture of an ecosystem for BOTS that I drew based on the currently available data there are about 500 companies on this list and close to 500 relationships so if a bot platform works with messenger then there is a link between them so they this is the entire network of the bot ecosystem as of two days ago and the individual company names or find of them I will provide this as the list in a spreadsheet and you can take a look at them later but the takeaway here is that subsystems are coalescing around Google assistant facebook Messenger and interestingly to an AI provider also a cask or 10r and others there so that's expected but what one each look for four key players are those that connect multiple of these subsystems for example Alexa is occupying a key position here nest is occupying a key position Harman Kardon is occupy key positions smooch which is another platform provider is able to work both the cross facebook messenger and google assistant and has an interesting position and if you look right smack in the middle you see slack um slack seems to be in the middle of the action within the board providers which is very interesting to note so those are the key players within the ecosystem and you should keep tracking this over time so that you understand who the key players are and like I said the list of companies in this ecosystem I will provide that list to you all and I think you'll get an email later on how to download it so I'll rush through these because smartphone adoptions are going up and also the people number of people you who use messaging apps are going up so these two have become like the effect of operating systems now the current generation of consumers don't want to leave these apps of platforms and they want to conduct both their conversations and commerce through the same platform so let's go through some adoption and here the predictions are that Google assistant is going to leap ahead in terms of adoption and Alex and Syria are also going to stay in the in the picture so these are the underlying operating systems that we're going to be looking at and some of the applications that have taken off right now most of you would have seen this how you can order an uber through Facebook this is you could expect of course there has to be Pizza ordering but for doing this you have to first register with the Pizza Hut and others before you can start ordering it that those are examples there's a case study I'm riding on the guyy which I'll get it says second the one that I was like for you most of you look at is this growth part the reason is a it speaks the slack as the platform one around which it works the other thing is they set the expectations very clearly as to what this thing does so for example right out of the gate they tell you they use the following data sources of spot Google Analytics MailChimp and social networking sites you know that that's the underlying data set and then they give you sample questions to ask and how this thing works so the expectations are set very early on that it's not an answer every possible question but limit it said and they also mentioned in that that the personality that they have given this is the cdos personality ACPO Thermage who is on a tough spot they've adopted his personality for this particular bar it's very important to have clarity around those as to what is the nature of interaction you're going to have with your market and then what data source do you depend on figure is the case I've written which is a start-up that's looking at how do you use chats for event planning and and also you can arrange transportation while you're at it so multiple things are being combined the other one is travel for airline flights all your financial service firms they all have these interactions but these are interactions with your bank accounts and so on so Bank of America has one Capital One has one MasterCard has one and they've given it names as you can see this one was interesting H&M where it's not just answering questions about service that they are providing but it's also helping you select products and you can imagine this for many types of products you can have these kinds of interactions out there so what's it for idea behind all these but somehow you make sense of the queries that user asking the more narrow the expectation the higher you could respond effectively since making can be done as to what people are asking and then you can help them make decisions right but in order to make those decisions you need to provide support through expert systems or machine learning techniques and through the various data sources that really so AI is not to a point where you can understand every request that's being made yeah we don't have superpowers yet I think they're AI is right now is applicable is for more narrow intelligence you can pick one domain and help many answer the many questions within that domain different providers of the AI engine okay now so a pickup losses pick a platform for development and that platform should be just like I told you about how do you look at the effectiveness a platform you have to get adopters developers and so on then what is the kind of interaction you want to have what persona should you have fully experienced build the bot piloted make sure you get all the domain knowledge understand what kind of algorithms are there behind it as an experiment don't just start by saying I'm gonna adopt this and also constantly look for innovative users in other settings and you can do this internally or you can use third parties to help you with this so I gave you a next couple of examples you have locked me in and b-24 companies that can help you with these making these choices what is in risk most of it I've heard a story about Microsoft a about unintended consequences of of cat wads technically regulations very soon on how you can use the data and security and privacy are also key here let me just look at tail end of it let me tell you why it is important to consider this seriously because data is the new competitive weapon and most businesses the successful ones particularly digital Titans are more than one business for example Amazon in addition to retail has the services business which is in fact the most profitable one it's not just Amazon that way we take Netflix Netflix has a core business but now it's entering into movie productions because of the data is collected about user preferences so this helps them um make sure that there are other options open for that so let me move on and end with the next view so when you have data you can like if you think Facebook they would like to explore new opportunities with known partners like if they were using that with Zynga one of their partners they can use that with then the game developer they can use it just internally to come up with new product ideas or open it up for third parties to build applications on top of it a different base we went through some of these before what but the one that you also want to keep in mind is just because there's an algorithm doesn't mean it's okay algorithms may have biases hidden in them and you have to keep a watch out for that so the question and I I would like to leave you with is all these chat BOTS here to stay I think the 30% gives you pause because they are not a general-purpose engine but for specific tasks they've been very effective but not till I was injured so I agree with the poll here which still says that no but they're somewhere exploring if the ones are exploring it are the ones who apply hopefully in a narrow domain so one of the final takeaways we shouldn't call the chat box we should call the niche chat box because they applied narrow domains set the expectations very clearly that it works for narrow domains the important thing is to get at insights from the log files of interactions at the end the companies must own these digital experience across many channels data data data data all these data that you collect you can use not only in your own project improvement but also in participating in other ecosystems just like what Netflix or Google and others have done so let me start with that okay thank you voila and we have time for four questions and we have a lot of questions so let me let me jump right in several of the questions have actually picked up on some of the recent headlines that we've seen involving social networks and I wanted to here's one given the recent issues with social network app data how likely are people to share more data more of their data in the future is this going to be a problem that's an excellent question I think if there are no regulations I right now there are not much regulations on data sharing but it's going to come very soon and every day about this quite a bit if people see value in exchange and they trust the brands I see them sharing the data but the level at which we are sharing right now knowingly and unknowingly is is certainly a something that will stop so my expectation is that trusted brands that have been delivering value would continue to delight and would be successful but it's not going to be what what has happened recently with the news where a third party was able to collect using a starter set of 250 survey is going to fifty million of collecting data of two million people those kinds of things are by the way that it's through API some of these things can be regulated does this here's another question picking up on what you were just saying about the social network problems what are the risks of using free platforms and does this argue in favor of having your own platform or being more more proprietary yeah so this this is going back to the platform strategy so regardless of platforms in whichever layer we are talking about in every layer of the stack that we talked about a few platforms are going to dominate and the way the plan I mean you can read about that in many there many papers written about and books written about platforms so if a platform is begin to dominate it makes no sense to create your own platform but if there is an opportunity because you're providing some unique cold service right here then it makes sense for you to develop your own platform but I think with with messenger and others that are there for the communication and the bought platforms out there the narrow domain bought platforms are still open so I don't think for example every bank has to reinvent the core platform they just need to use the existing platforms but create unique digital experiences around that plan so they only experience and not necessarily the platform but if the platform is not there yet then it makes for hence for them too libido okay another question that several attendees have raised has to do with this feeling of missing the human connection and that kind of the sense that that they don't that they are stressed about losing the human interaction and to what extent are companies developing hybrid systems you know BOTS with humans kind of in the background working together see that's that that's the key point that came out of the survey you know just like put it be programmer you'll know that if certain conditions are not met there should always be a graceful way for the program to exit similarly is for every process that you thinking about they must be human intervention so service providers the ones that I listed for you they're like we 24 in long mean and others they also have healthcare services to go with their offering it's because of that 30 percent rule that we talked about for general-purpose engines but even for narrow domains understanding exactly what the customer is looking for can be challenging and that's why you need an escalation to humans so I look at this technology as mostly augmenting human intellect rather than substituting humans okay another question for a large company engaging with the public at an early stage what are the practical first steps that you recommend for the large company to get involved in in this area I would say experimentation I think you know it's if this gets if it's with any other high tech products that we're talking about the new layers as they emerge it's very important to do strategic experiments with scope clearly understood and then with measures in place and then seeing if what their domain this makes sense just because everybody's doing it doesn't necessarily mean this competitive advantage in it for you because your customers may not be part of the segment that uses these applications in their daily lives so in order to test it out you got to do strategic experiments and then see what kind of adoption results you get before you launch it to a broader scale implementation and that's where reusing what's out there makes a lot of sense because today experimentation costs with technology have gone down because of those services that are already available to reuse that I mentioned in the in the trends slide okay the question has to do with here's a specific question why isn't IBM active in this area with Watson Watson is part of that engine that drives all of these AI sim part of this whole conversation commerce is the messaging and the AI engine right AI engine iBM is one of the providers of those Indians so you have to understand the architecture of this whole idea of conversational commerce architecture part a big piece of that is the AI engine that runs behind those and they are they are inside there somewhere one of the questions that came in is will we see digital replicas of each of us as individuals yeah that's the that's the piece that I wrote I think three months ago that it's not the market share domination I'm worried about I'm more worried about what percentage of our information do these digital Titans have that's the digital replica I'm talking about so once they have that it'll it'll be easy for them to predict or we need next and that has some serious implications yes I am worried about that in here's one a question that came up involving this was one of the this was one are there examples of disasters you can point to where companies did a poor job designing their interactions I think that Microsoft they experiment was what comes in do that if you allowed where they did the training with general data on Twitter feeds and it went totally out of control so you may want to read it up in the press so it is very important how you train see there there's no avoiding the understand deep understanding of the architecture behind these experiments it's you cannot run it as a black box so if the learning engines if you don't understand where the data comes from for the learning or a pet then there are consequences to it so every aspect the training data you use the domain knowledge you get the AI engines that you're using it's important to understand the pedigree of those two here's one that just came in our chat BOTS used in b2b and which types of usage will probably develop in this area in the near term yes there are examples of b2b also but I think the because of the proclivity for us to get to the consumers first because it's a lot of the innovations today are coming from there I think my expectation that the b2c one will lead the way in this one ok question involving the healthcare area can a I help patients and doctors communicate better do you see that um this is not about chat box and you're asking in general does AI help doctors and patients communicate better especially if you're using remote expertise of doctors if they don't speak the language perhaps yeah this could act as a rosetta stone for these exchanges maybe that's what the the question relates to is AI is also using you know the datasets to train for disease management and others there's that aspect of it the communication aspect I think if they're referring to that yeah there's a possibility that you can use the language understanding and translation to get patients to understand more what the doctors are saying yeah that's possible okay there was a in an art in your article you referred to an offering from 1-800 flowers and I'm wondering if you could take us through a little bit on how that worked the mechanics of that and what it might suggest to other companies yes that's an interesting one in fact I was looking at that video a month ago we're here where Zuckerberg was saying the pointing out the irony of using a phone number to do messaging so if you don't but flowers in the ordering flowers it shows up as as a link within the conversation and you can click on that to actually initiate the order and it's the payment information of those already in the messaging platform that you have it's very seamless for you to get this thing done but it understands the context of the conversation and because there's a relationship between the company and let's say messenger that shows up as a link during a conversation and you're able to make the order in that lot of the related information that you need already there in your phone and you could use that information and that's a convenience aspect of it that people are highlighting so in that example so during the conversation you're talking about sending flowers that's possible to understand so then you got the natural language engine kicks in and says perhaps we should now sending the option for them to order it so it's in context and then you're in payment information is available hopefully you can look up the person's directory to see if they have the address where those flowers have to be sent so it's everything is in context and makes a lot of sense to send this and that's why it's efficient so that's a good example of how it should it should work okay it seems that people are several the questions seem to speak to the idea that people like the convenience but they worry and kind of stress about losing the human side of of the relationship when do you think we will see bots that can understand context and make decisions that people feel comfortable with this beer to be careful about being too human-like because some experiments have shown that if it is too close to humans people are repulsed by that and adoption drops so that's one we have to worry about the other thing about when see the AI engines you are talking about today with promise was there for a long time that can understand common sense but it's not delivered of that yet that's why it's good to look at it as narrow domain versus broad and general so for narrow problems I think it works effectively but the broader problems we still will need humans in the loop so I don't see that completely vanishing but a good set of problems that we solve every day could be classified in the narrow domain and I can see those getting substituted but mostly it's going to be augmentation of human intellect I see going forward one I think we probably have time for one or two more questions here's one that kind of picks up on what we were just talking about how do you see the balance between convenience and privacy that's the bargain that we are currently facing how much information are you willing to reveal I think there was Facebook head at once point and algorithm that could predict if people are getting gauged well that seems like very interesting app but we want to live our lives to and find out ourselves rather than an algorithm predicting that so people are going to at some point not give up the ownership of the data but just like a medical record allow accomplished access it temporarily rather than to give away the ownership like the one which happened the recent Facebook image analytic experiment where the data will actually download it that you can see people are becoming more conscious of that now and the fact that companies have the ability to build digital graphic URLs of you I think it's people are beginning to understand that better now and what are the consequences of that that and and and then what are some solutions we still didn't have I don't have solutions there where we can temporarily allow companies to accesses data portal one use and then we didn't control over it after that I feel we have Jordan should be there I think we're gonna have to end here okay that concludes the presentation and that's all we have time for as far as questions over the next few
