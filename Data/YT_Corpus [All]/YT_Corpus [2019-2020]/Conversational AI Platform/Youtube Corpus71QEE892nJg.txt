 on this episode we talk to da ki about how large healthcare companies can start to gain the benefits of running in the cloud so how is the cloud kind of been a catalyst to making this change in the industry is hope yeah it's a great question so if you look at traditionally most big healthcare related companies are not really on the cloud they are usually on their own data centers moving to cloud has many challenges so one is regulatory and compliance challenge we are seeing that most cloud providers today are HIPAA compliant out-of-the-box which reduces the sort of barrier of entry but it's still pretty hard for them to new massive amounts of data to cloud because there is cost associated with it but the stickiness aspect with the cloud is that you don't have to build tools from ground up because there are so many services out of the box that the cloud offers that it makes valuable because it's a question of opportunity cost can you get to market sooner however still there are like enough challenges for big healthcare players to be on the cloud what we are seeing at doc here in startups which is a start-up basically we don't have that issue we can be unplowed we are cloud native from get-go so we want it to be scalable resilient and use all the services out of the box so that we can get to market sooner what we have seen as we were able to get to market significantly faster not having to worry about infrastructure or managing servers and used plethora of services that Google cloud provides a great example of that is kubernetes engine and along with all the other containers that we can easily roll out and other tied up services like SQL proxy and so on which makes it really easy for us to like not have a big infrastructure and DevOps team but focus on ruling out product features so it's been great that way to be on at all and that makes sense for startups who you know they want to be cloud native they need to get to market sooner it's really easy to be agile when you learn small what would you say the most important kind of cloud technologies or cloud related resources are available to larger companies that can help them adopt similar methodology that's a great question so so I think it's a multi-phase approach for bigger companies that are not on cloud already so what I suggest is that any of the new products and services that you want to roll out you want to consider being on the cloud first so some principles of being cloud native means that you can use some of the open source technology so that you're not necessarily locked into one cloud vendor and you have the option allottee of being able to run that back on your data center so the first suggestion from my point of view is that you start building new services and products as sort of a cloud native version that can run on any cloud including your own data center second phase of that would be how do you sort of bring other interesting data that you sit on in your own data centers and use that in conjunction with the data that's being collected on your new services and products so you could bring your own data to the cloud or you could sync the data back from the clock to your own data centers where you are now building much more robust set of models or services but over time as phase 3 I would say that you may want to consider moving a lot of your computational needs onto the cloud the challenge with that is at scale cloud becomes pretty expensive an example of that would be if you are building a lot of interesting models that require a lot of CPU computational resources then these are pretty expensive on a per hour basis so it's still very valuable to consider moving to a cloud but then build it and design it in a way that you are not tied to a specific cloud and there are many open-source tools and technologies that let you do that so that way you can bring it back up and it isn't a bad joke yeah and a hybrid approach is still that's you know not only relatable but actually really desirable to a lot of people so how does that relate to the cloud before right and so it depends on where you are in the company's journey so a big established company may have already own the real estate for having the their own data centers so the marginal cost of adding the server would still look far more lucrative them to move to cloud as opposed to move to cloud but what I see is that there is going to be an explosion of different tools and services and especially new type of computation environments that you can get for example you're seeing people use that Google is is pioneering and rolling out it'll almost be impossible to bring those two back to your data centers so in some way you're right that it's better to be on cloud because you can manage costs certainly in some way because you only use it on on-demand but then with already at scale certain companies find it easier and cheaper to roll out new machines but not necessarily offering the same capabilities it's an opportunity cost of the future versus marginal cost or the present day that these big companies have to make a trade-off the initial cost will be higher on the cloud simply because to replicate the same level of computational resources it's going to be expensive but with the right sort of themes and right infrastructure teams in place where you are not spinning up resources and wasting your way you can somehow have a handle on the cloud but I think really it's the future of where your products can go which i think is only possible being the provider stay tuned for more conversations with da ki if you enjoyed this episode check out the stack tap playlist for more great videos [Music] you
