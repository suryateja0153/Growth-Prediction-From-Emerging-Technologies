  Dramatic music  [Ashish Kakkad]: Coptivity's this idea that voice interface is becoming a natural way for people to work. [Charlene Wahl]: Instead of calling dispatch where they call in a license plate number that could take up to 30 minutes, they can easily just say the license plate number which goes to a chatbot using cognitive services [Coptivity Interface]: Adam-12 go ahead. [Sia]: CHRIS would transcribe that information and from there that will go to the LEWIS service in Azure which then goes understands that the deputy is intending to run the registered owner. [Coptivity Interface]: Property successfully queried. Your plate is 1129 EXP by statute for last absolved first of Tiffany on a 71 Chev. [Chris Hodgkins]: Giving an officer or deputy better situational awareness in the moment, because now he's keeping his eyes on the situation, immediately give the plates, and then get information before he even steps out of the car. [Eric Egland]: It also saves the time of dispatchers so they can focus on more complex quires. [Negar] With the Coptivity, they don't need to call in anymore so in a couple minutes they can have their results and that would be amazing, and in some scenarios life saving. [Chris Hodgkins]: Utilizing LEWIS and the different software available on the Azure stack is what makes this possible. [Ashish Kakkad]: We're looking at Azure to really transform what we do and how we do it, and bring new innovations to the table. [Negar]: When you can use the new tools and services that technology is providing and make everything easier, faster, and more efficient to your end users. [Ashish Kakkad]: So they can basically do what they need to do, right? It's leveraging technology to solve problems. [Stuart McKee]: Artifical intelligence is a great example of how are customers are able to leverage amazing hyperscale capabilities that we've built in our facilities, and use them uniquely and creatively on the Edge. I think you'll find a great example of voice assistant and cognitive services to develop a solution that, hopefully, will actually help our public safety and our officers that are out on the edge provide better services for citizens. [Eric Egland]: It's one of the things that makes me proud to work at Microsoft, we invest resources to help customers accelerate progress on their digital transformation journey. [Ashish Kakkad]: It's a continuous process. We just continuously move forward. That's the way I see digital transformation is more like digital evolution.
