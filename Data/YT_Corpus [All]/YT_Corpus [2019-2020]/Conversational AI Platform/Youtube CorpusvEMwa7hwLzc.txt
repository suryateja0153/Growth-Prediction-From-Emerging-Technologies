 Hello and welcome to the digital transformation online summit my name is Gianni Quintana and I'm going to be discussing conversational marketing chatbots AI technologies and how you can utilize those to help your business and clients businesses capture better engagement get more conversions for your sales teams all right so without further ado let's start this presentation how can we remove friction from the buying process and yes even amid the crazy coated 19 times were all living so first I gotta talk about the pink elephant in the room right so we know that we're living this pandemic and so yes let's all support social distancing so we can get the curve down flatten the curve and get back to some form of normality and let's say yes to social distance learning and sharing knowledge a little thing about this picture these are my two young boys Ethan three years old and Nico six years old he's on the right and they love to get into there police SWAT car and kind of patrol the neighborhood to make sure everyone is practicing safe social distancing, listen all kidding aside I know how important this conference is to many of us who are looking to strive and not just survive Covid nineteen whether it's for ourselves but also for our partners and our clients alike. So you know without further ado let me get into the presentation Conversational Marketing what is it and why is it important? So conversational marketing is a new category maybe three years young that Drift has created I'm a Drift certified partner and referral partner and have been for three years and it's really a paradigm shift that focuses on helping not selling where ever hope focuses more on the buying which is now really not even thought about as buying but actually helping and not selling. So by the way, don't worry about any notes because I'll be sharing this slides at the end as well as all an e-guide that'll give you a little more insights into this presentation. mm-hmm so we know that right now because of what we're going through with Covid-19 we're likely going to be communicating during and post Covid-19 ,you know work from home environment that's gonna look kind of like this picture right with kids in the background two parents working and we're all trying to build trust with our potential customers clients and partners and they might look almost informal and we're always going to be on so when you think about the expectations that customers have had for the last 10 to 15 years and more so let's say the last decade you know think about the Apple Store people want to have conversation based instant responses and that is true that same expectation customer expectation that we have as b2c customers is the same that b2b customers have. So why would we want to treat them differently? For many of us if we have business-to-business as our core potential customers we know that this process that we've had in b2b can take weeks endless emails and has caused buyers a lot of friction and frustration around how to get to a demo call how to get more information from a potential you know company and and this is a process that typically we have as best practices in b2b and I would argue that it's it's outdated and it's really has lost its its way and because it's not kept up with a customer's expectation, so when we think about Conversational Marketing and Chatbots, in particular, we also may go right into thinking about live chat which we all know if we've been around since the 80s and even 90s has been around since the 80s and the 90s but it's been more of a conversation that's transactional versus conversational when you think about live chat Olark and the likes right, so when you think about live chat you know you think call centers circa 1990s scripted poorly responses that are sourced overseas through third-parties and there's usually poor quality interactions unfortunately because they're lacking the in-house expertise and there's lack of skin in the game as well for these third-party outsourced live chats agents, so when you think about that and you move into this evolution of live chat during full-blown Covid-19 times you're gonna have those same issues that I'm describing on the section before on this evolution graphic but it's gonna be a little bit worse I would think because right now you have no call center manager. Most call centers are just not working, they're doing it remote right on-premise to do Quality Assurance which is a big big challenge for a lot of these live chat sort of services and also these scripted options you know if they're not fine-tuned or changed often they really don't resonate with that potential customer on your website and there's less supervision at these live chat centers these days because there are just no live chat centers actually operate it's all being done remote which kind of complicates matters now when you fast forward to you know circa 2015 when Live Chatbots started really taking shape whether they were through HubSpot's chatbots or Drift who  just went very got niche down and specifically around AI Chatbots, the game have changed now that we're living in this work from home environment I think it's super important to think on how you can leverage conversational marketing and chat BOTS into the mix they're literally made the technologies made for having your SDRs sales you know the BDR's business development reps, and inside reps, who now have had  inside sales and now outside sales club to turn into inside sales all work and leveraging Conversational Marketing Chatbots and all the technologies around that to have real-time engagement now, to reduce website bounce rates and accelerate pipeline or you know basically lead to closed velocity and the the important aspect of competition marketing is that it's a collaborative co-written effort on the part of folks that have skin in the game. So I work with clients and their marketing and sales teams who obviously have a reason to want to make sure that this type of the strategy works, so they could get more pipeline they can get more sales and more revenue right so there's a win-win because it's co-manage by marketing and sales and it integrates to most CRMs you know in in in a way to make your buyer pipeline efficiencies and velocity are just that much more efficient. Okay so when you think about Conversational Marketing you have to think of a framework and this framework really is what's made it a category leader and disruptive and it's really helping b2b businesses over you know over the last three years of more may be approaching four years to really become more honed in on how they can leverage Conversational Marketing to disrupt their competitors right and the reason it's disruptive i would say is because it follows these frameworks these questions the what the who the where why and went right so when you think about it you know we're always thinking and creating content to drive people where to our website right so by having these conversational chat pods they're living and that and the play books that would build out co-written co-developed with your marketing team with your inside sales team with your operations team we're able to understand what pages are critical where we need to have these box whether you know it's a high intent page like your pricing page or your resource page like your blog content page you know what is that they're trying to strive to do or who are they engaging in this. Is it anonymous? Is it a person who returned after a couple visits? Is it a targeted account the top 100 250 accounts that your corporate team has? You know who are those people do we have like ideal personal profiles buyer personas and how can we get an engagement level with them right. So that's where the where comes are they coming in from direct, you know sales approaches, ads you know our ad spend our nurture campaigns organic webinar events blogs etc so we really try to cover in this framework all these questions that you see here so that you can build out the right type of communication when they're on your website at the moment of engagement at the end of the day the customer right now has all the power we're in a supply-side economy and we others an oversupply so they really do have the power you have to be able to follow this framework if you're trying to launch conversational marketing in the right way. Now all your buyers want to connect with you in real time when intent is highest right and so when you think about live chat they were trying to solve for this by being able to for a live chat person to engage with that prospects questions and answers but unfortunately like chatting another response time and time can be you know almost instant or just as good as conversational marketing Chatbots it still has some deficiencies and I'll go through these, first of all, the limitations of Live Chat right so we don't get the two confused you can't compare apples to oranges. 1- limited to working hours only, call centers unless you pay a premium which it might not even be warranted or you're gonna get 24 hour live chat support right and you're unable to separate sales and support because typically that person that's outsource is not a support expert or a sales expert they're really just following the script and are just kind of give you a lead report afterward right the high there's a high volume but low quality in terms of chats typically and there's no strategic visitor the information they don't know if  a visitor came in from one of your targeted top 50 accounts or not so how do they know if they're gonna roll out a VIP kind of a you know personalization to that prospect that visits your site there's usually a lack of automation because they don't have any kind of integrations with marketing tech marketing tech stack and that's very important as you know for b2b to accelerate velocity and to be able to have a window and insight into who is visiting and what you know channels they came from and so forth that's through marketing tech stacks which Live Chat typically doesn't integrate that level so why is all this important I think this is so important because we all know and have been living the last 10 years of customer experience being the really the net new king when there's an endless supply of options customers have all the power and point in case when you think about the Airbnb's of the world right everybody, they didn't kill the hotel industry they did it to themselves by limiting the availability and pricing options. Uber didn't kill the taxis they did it to themselves by limiting the number of taxis and price controls Apple, Apple didn't kill the music industry they did it to themselves by forcing people to buy full albums but all it wanted to do was you know get that one the track on an Xyz record right or XYZ CD. Amazon same thing they didn't kill other retailers they did it to themselves with bad customer service right? While Amazon tripled down on the best experience their UI experience of customer service experience so then you find yourself gravitated to use Amazon.com for anything related to shopping books audible music etc. Netflix, Netflix didn't kill blockbuster they did it to themselves because of the ridiculous late fees and they just got late to the game right Netflix was a disruptor they created a category. So all these businesses kill themselves by not understanding that customers needs and this is important because when you think about the driving forces of future customer experience you know according to Forester sorry reports around CX, they have insights 90% of customer service leaders agree personalization is core to the future of automation implementing existing chat technologies increasingly become a solution of choice and why is this it's this because 60% of 63% of customers say they will leave a company after just one poor experience and almost two-thirds of them will no longer wait more than two minutes for assistance we live in a I want it now when I want it how I want it because I have choices type of customer centric world so we have to meet the expectations and actually I would say exceed them if you're meeting them you're just doing status quo so what does this mean in terms of the live chat - Conversational Marketing AI revolution chatbots revolution when you think about Live Chat and I'm on it for a little bit longer on these slides because I want to make sure that we're looking at apples and not oranges you think about old Live Chat business as usual' was a call center Live Chat operators third-party work answering calls trying to their best of their ability to follow the script and answer. During full-blown code 19 which is what we're experiencing now and having for the last few weeks it's going to be call centers that are pretty abandoned and everyone's doing call center type work that's overstressed overtaxed and under less supervision because of people in these calls center environments are working from home not a good recipe for the kind of experience you want to potential customers or current customers right? Now you'll remove that friction if you get AI Chatbots that still have that live conversational marketing type of feel but it's going to be done on your website internally to your sales development reps business development reps and it just feels more authentic it's more internal to whatever your business goals are and what your business solutions offer that customers or prospective customers. So again Conversational Marketing and what does it do it enables companies to shorten their sale cycle understand their customers and creating more human buying experience here's a graph that explains a little bit of how we drift which I my certified partner and our agency is combines targeted real-time messaging and intelligence to optimize conversions right so we're all writing white papers we're all doing webinars we're all trying to figure a way that they can contact us the way that the chat BOTS plus like chat you're able to get this done in real time 24/7 365 and your speed to lead and your speed velocity of converting you know someone who's a prospect that's interested in the pipeline to someone who's on a meeting to someone who's not closed or getting closer to a closed-won that's really a you know the acceleration factor that you can do with live AI Drift Chatbots plus live chat on your website again there's benefits and I'm going to describe briefly the four key benefits of Conversational Marketing first you're gonna instantly respond 24/7 365 so while you're sleeping or I'm sleeping I'll get inquiries that come in from my turned on you know non-working hours Digitechy Chatbot you know people leave their message their email and I can get back to them understand what their needs may be right you're gonna convert more leads the reason for that is because of your Chatbot allows you to you know once you put your custom messaging and what you're trying to get out of the conversation an ability for your your prospective customer to dig deeper and what they want out of the conversation and then right away get into a Drift-book more qualified meetings because you're giving them a calendar right there for them to pick a date a time to connect with you for next steps right? And you're also providing the one that I really think it's really critical for B2bs that are in you know high-volume sales and long-term sales is have this white glove strategic accounts approach so account-based marketing you're able to a Conversational Marketing with this platform we're able to help you identify your top accounts and provide like this VIP rolled out kind of treatment and personalization when you've got let's say Nestle's one of your accounts Nestle hits your your website and you're gonna be able to give Nestle and that person in Nestle a different type of experience when they land on your website through the Chatbot interactions. Here's a little bit of an experience that my clients Happy or Not Practice Panther and Rock Content have had using our implementation of Conversational Marketing Chatbots and comes into the marketing into their sales and marketing mix. Happy or Not they're CX customer experience global leader they provide these terminals which have happy faces from green to red at airports as well as in your retail environments and public sector and so forth and also at stadiums so here when we approached and worked with them and the consulting engagement to get this done we notice that they had a really high bounce rate of 80 percent they had a lot of eyeballs on their website which was great about a hundred thousand unique visitors per month but they were getting a tremendous amount of bounce rate because there was nothing engaging on the website. So outside of content that we helped them produce they were tailored to specific industries we also implemented the Drift Chatbots so that folks (customers) can have better conversations and may be more engaged and know whether it's for support whether it's for sales or whether it was industry specific that that was potential online visitor prospect was wanting to know more about with Happy or Not they reduce a bounce rate by 44 percent and now we're engaging with under sixty seconds and so that speed to lead is critical same thing would Practice Panther which is a legal software company and Rock Content which is a global leader in the interactive content software company. By the way b2b SaaS is only one vertical that we help but we could help those that are in health care we can help those are in public sector there there's uh there's a more industries and companies that can leverage conversational marketing. so why does response that matter in B2B, well it's critical because according to a Harvard Business Review study 90 percent of businesses that don't reply in less than five minutes lose that business forever and that's pretty a hard pill to swallow when you think about all the money that you invest in marketing and sales to drive people to your website to have a nice experience and to engage with you and if you don't respond with them in five minutes you lose them so all that effort time energy brain share and money can be thrown out the window right so it's critical that you have a response rate a response time that's less than five minutes and Drift and conversational marketing chatbots that we helped implement can help you with that, one way of doing that it's because we're creating second nets right so we're not saying or suggesting you need to get rid of all your forms we understand that sometimes your lead attribution many good leads come from your forms your forms are you up in your pricing page forms that you have on your services page and so forth, having said that we also know that by having second nets you're able to catch those folks that don't want to fill out form they want to go directly to having a conversation with you and giving them that option so second nets are important and I'm going to talk about eleven types of Conversational Marketing examples bots (playbooks) that serve certain different customer interactions I'm not going to go through all of them but I'm gonna pick three number one number three and number eight because I think they're important and number your lever inside so if we look at number one the second and what is it I kind of described it a little bit earlier but basically it's the easiest place to start you can take tip your toe in conversational marketing you will. You are not, going to necessarily replace all the forms but you're going to give them a second option where they can request a demo or contact you ask about something of your service right there and unlike the form the second net can be proactive just go get people to start having the conversation with you they can skip the line if you will here's an example Wistia does this very well they have their form but as you can tell they also have a way that you can use the chat bot to start engaging I want to talk to sales right away which you know like; What platform to use? they say other okay great what did, How many employees do you have? You're leading them down questions that you want to be answered before sending them into a sales invite they put their address and boom now you have a meeting that your team can actually have with that prospect right that's one example here's one that I have in my own page conversational marketing around your pricing page your pricing page is probably the highest intent page you have on your website and if it isn't you should make it your highest intent page and to do this you want to be able to have a chat bot that's one going to resonate with those people visiting so for mine for example I go hey there we feel yeah code 19 times less invest in your future can ask you a question because more than likely they're thinking about me and probably two or three other digital consultancy agencies are conversational marketing agencies and they want to engage with a little more conversation on pricing so I give them options oh I'm just checking things out I'm already one of your clients or yes please I'd like to speak to someone now and as you're pushing them through that you're able to and get exactly what kind of questions they might have around pricing so you can be very specific in terms of whatever their intent is and what your answers are about pricing over chat and you know it's not easy to explain there were chats or likely you're gonna get to putting them on a call on a meeting right away right now which is the the endgame in the goal lead magnet so we all work really hard to develop a lot of content e-guides, video blogs podcasts what-have-you and when we do this our intent is that we want to give something to get something usually their email their phone number so that they can get to the piece of content these are lead magnet pages when conversational marketing the cool thing is that you can actually create an all living in one place you can provide them non gated which I would highly encourage you try and test give non gated valuable content this is a 26-page a guide on inbound marketing and the best practices the five pillars are on it to grow a business 3x and so they can go through it read it on their own without having to give me anything but if they want to right here my Chatbot is already asking them hey let's get in touch leave me your email and we can set up a meeting you know and it goes right into an actual my the requests were an appointment in a meeting on the Chatbot so your lead magnets can now you know you're giving them content now they don't the way to get an email you can get really super creative here and put a video if you want you can just have them download it like I did online right there and then or you can tease them with a first chapter and then offer after they give you their email to give them the rest to unlock it if you will but I personally try not to have a them go through hoops and just give them the content that they find value they're going to email you and look to get an appointment with you and have a conversation with you which is what you ultimately want okay another tip that I think and another strategy that is really powerful these days more than ever is video so leveraging LinkedIn connecting with prospects via LinkedIn then sending them a drift video right off from LinkedIn by the way which I can show this is what I did this is the backend of my Drift where you can see all the eight pages of basically um videos that have done short videos have an example of a potential client which potential client out of South America they're a chocolatier called Pacari chocolate had a few videos sent to him last one which Santiago saw he saw it for 77% of it which is good and from that I was able to get on it literally while he's watching the video on a quick chat and secured a Zoom meeting for later so here's a way to humanize with direct authentic videos showing him that you actually understand a little bit about their business and want to set up a time to see how you can help and here's how mine looked you won't be able to hear it but that's not a problem I just want you to see this was done literally right from my LinkedIn clicking on my drift you know tool that allows me to do these videos and send them right away be a LinkedIn to that prospect so here I'm showing like that I care that I that I've actually done some homework and research but I want to see how we can help each other into some synergies right so again you want to humanize with direct authentic videos and follow up once you see that they land on your on that video and that landing page you can do a follow up and say I noticed you saw something 7% was there more information you wanted or how can we set up a discovery call that sort of thing okay so in conclusion you know I think that Conversational Marketing is really the best way to remove that friction in the buying process and showing your more human side of the sales and marketing experience we're trying to change how b2b is into a b2h so instead of business to business let's think business to human experience it's all about that human experience right you're able to leverage chatbots and the AI technology playbooks to increase engagement on your website you're able to champion authentic real-time two-way communication with buyers and your teams internally whether they're your sales team support team operations team and you're able to build that trust in secure next steps which is really meetings to close business faster in at scale it's all about velocity its lead to lead and you're able to utilize proven partners such as digital comm that understand conversational marketing implementations and can help you avoid the pitfalls of doing it yourself right we're here to help and if your business is interested leaving my contact information at the end plus I'll be sending out a PDF guide around conversational marketing to all those that attended my session post-event again I hope in my my deepest wish for everybody that was on this event in this particular presentation is that we can strive for a positive future amid all the craziness and the uncertainty I do believe that we're gonna come out better together and it sounds cliche but I think we will you know come out of this better than we are right now so let's connect more from b2b status quo to a more new business to human experience.
