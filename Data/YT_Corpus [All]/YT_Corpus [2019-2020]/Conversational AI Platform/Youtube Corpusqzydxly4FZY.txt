 Hi! I have a big news for progressive CXOs and BI & analytics enthusiasts We're releasing our Tableau extension for Alphaa AI The augmented analytics platform so that you can securely use conversational analytics on your Tableau Dashboards online or offline, that won't matter anymore. Guys, we received a lot of request from our clients that they should be able to use Alphaa AI as an extension on their dashboards. Because they wanted to operate in security of their own systems so that's what we did. I'll show you a demo in a bit but before that I should let you know that We're offering 5 free POCs for teams larger than 10 where you'll be able to use Alphaa AI as an extension and as a platform or both on your own dashboards. And for now, please have a look at this demo which is done on publicly available  Tableau Dashboard of Superstore You can open the Super Store dashboard on Tableau Public I'm going to edit here. And now I'll go and add an extension. I'm going to add an already downloaded file Now let me just test it out with "What is the profit for furniture?" And there you go, it has picked the appropriate filters here and also selected furniture in the category And it says that we did $10.6K in sold quantities and generated $0.7 million revenue with 13.48% profit. Which represents $91.5k profit in sales and it has also created this chat over here. "Time-series analysis for segment in order data by sum profit" So you can leave a comment below an we'll get in touch with you and we'll let you know if you can be a part of this little POC that we're doing. And, let's take it forward from there.
