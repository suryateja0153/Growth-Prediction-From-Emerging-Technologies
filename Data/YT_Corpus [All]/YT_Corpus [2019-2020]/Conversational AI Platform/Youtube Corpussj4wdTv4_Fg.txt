 Artificial Solutions focuses on a form of AI that we refer to as natural language interaction. Basically it allows people to speak to applications, to devices, to websites, to chatbots, indeed a wide range of different channels, in a very human-like intelligent and conversational manner using natural language. Now we've chosen to approach this rather thorny technological issue in a slightly different way than many contemporaries in the market in as much as we have built a platform. It's a platform that we call Teneo and it's a platform that allows non-specialists to rapidly build very sophisticated conversational systems and once built they can be deployed across multiple languages, multiple platforms and multiple channels. But that's only part of the story because there's another card that should be played and that's to do with the conversational data because if you can capture the conversations in all the gory detail you can really start to understand what customers are thinking. It's like having a focus group at your fingertips but not a focus group of 20 people for an hour, it's equivalent to a focus group of millions 24/7 365 and by interpreting that conversational data you can really start to understand what customers are truly thinking, what their likes are, their dislikes, what their sentiment is, what they're looking for, what they're thinking and you can use this information to better inform your company in terms of what products and services you might be looking to build. You can also use it to personalize the responses that are given back through the conversational systems making your system truly personal in its approach. In short what we do at Artificial Solutions is make technology think.
