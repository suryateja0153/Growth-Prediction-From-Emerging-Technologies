 [Music] hi welcome back to Microsoft build live my name is Amy Boyd and I'm joined by tulasi and Govinda from the Microsoft Q&A service team in this segment we're going to be talking about how to create truly conversational BOTS and using the Q&A maker cognitive service so um thanks very much for coming guys and and welcome can you do a quick introduction about what it is you do at Microsoft sure hi everyone I'm toasting Hayami I'm the product manager of Q&A maker which is the conversational cognitive service for in the language space I am Gurinder Singh I'm a developer in Kenema can I come in I'm sassy can you tell us can you like level set us all a little bit and tell us a bit about Q&A maker sure so cue a maker is actually we just had a session about this just a little while ago Q&A maker is a natural cognitive service in the conversational AI space and it helps you to easily create a conversation layer over any data that you have so it can be you know an FAQ page a support website of PDF and it extracts question and answers and makes a conversational model out of that and you can easily make that a bot so the great thing about Q&A maker is that you don't need developer expertise or AI expertise to create a bot and we're gonna show you that I'm so excited to show you that demo and the and even better is that you can add personality to it so oh very cool we all like a bot with the personality yeah and if people have questions online please go to aka.ms/offweb and ask us some questions you can ask anything to these guys and they've been more than happy to answer well while we're waiting for some questions to come in I think we have a demo right now guys want to show us how we create all of Q&A maker service yes let's do that so good when they're here we'll have which was walk us to a quick demo and show you how easy it is so if you haven't used any maker yet you should yeah thanks to T so for this demo I'll take surface Pro user guide so surface pro user guide is basically semi-structured data and it has headings subheadings which is quite suitable which can very easily generate question-answer documents so we'll go to KN Omega dot ai and we'll start by creating a knowledge base so first thing that you should have AQ animaker resource in azure so I already have one so I'll skip that process so you need to select your Azure account in this drop-down and then you can specify some name for your Kb I'll select surface pro demo and in next step you need to provide your data source so we already I already showed you that surface pro PDF so I'm linking that and the cool thing about Q animaker is you can add personality to it so I'm adding friendly personality and then I'll say create so in background it extracts data from the source and it puts those data into the index so create usually takes couple of minutes so I already created a KB for you so you can see that in this KB there are 171 PNA pairs which are extracted and in this view you can modify you can add you can delete key appears key any maker also allows you to test your KB before publishing into the prod environment so let's go ahead and test it out so I'll ask hi so the bot replied and I will ask how to setup surface pro so bot replied with the answer that how can I set up surface Pro so I will say I can I can chat with the bot I will reply you are awesome so since it was a friendly personality the bot replied with a friendly behavior so now I am quite confident that my KB looks good so I will go ahead and publish it so I will close the test pane and I will go to the publish tab and I'll publish the KB so now my KB is published in prod environment now we recently introduced a new feature where you can just create where you can just connect your bot where you can just deploy it to as your bot service so I will click on create bot so it will redirect me to a portal Azure we're all in that air in the pain with all my data will be prefilled so that I can deploy a bot easily so it usually takes a minute yeah so you can see my all the data is prefilled Mightyena maker account is linked so I don't need to add anything I'll just hit create so I've already created a demo bot for you so we'll go try out in the website so it's still loading so is this similar to the test you were doing in the sword like oh is it a friendly personality is it that and then that's just baby but I own similar queries here hi and accept that this is actually published to a bot rather than it being in the Q&A maker UI this one is actually lying yeah this one in a spot where you can publish it so how can I set up a screen so if we knit back to give in the screen if we got an answer now from that yes so it gave me the example and now so I've shown you that without any code I've created a bot out of it and now we can deploy it in bot framework provides many channels so you can deploy it in Cortana you can deploy in team skype etc all right so you can see that you know to do all of this you didn't have to write he did not write a single piece of code a single line right and you can take it directly all the way the team's to Google even now with the new channels yeah and that's the magic cue animaker with bot framework and bot service nice so so what we saw there was we went to QA maker day i we created a bot we uploaded quite a complex PDF it wasn't a very simple PDF or add headings and formatting and pictures we then went on to publish that so we have an API endpoint cuz you know do you have to have the bot like is that all you don't have to you can use the API endpoint in any application right so like any other cognitive service it's a simple call a tress request nice and then we were able to actually test that within the azure portal it's alright nice so that's a full end-to-end yes and we haven't opened I mean we'd love to open visual studio code right but we didn't ask so that was a win very nice very nice and so um it's a nice bot radio and we ask you a question and we get something back what if I wanted a bit more complexity what if I wanted to have a bit more back-and-forth conversation um can I can i guide a user can i yeah actually this is a great question because we just announced a brand new feature at Bill's today and we just had a session that announced this where you can create multi turn on guided conversational slows using Q&A maker in fact that I think the document that could when they're already did it has that so maybe we can see that first yeah I'll show you one scenario in the document so in this view you can see that in accounts and signing section we have multiple queries which you can ask maybe a you sign in in screen windows hello to sign in or sign out so in the put in the heading you can have different subheadings which can be treated as a different context so I'll try this that out in Cana maker so already with the data that we have already the data that we already have I'll show you that in the first column there is a context tree so you can see that accounts the mean the parent is accounts and sign-in and they have three children's and similarly in answer column you can see the answers and the prompt which are the follow-up questions which you can ask so let's try in tests pin and even monitor and you need to make sure you enable multi turn so I asked it gave me three answers it gave me the answer and three follow-up questions what I could ask next so let's say if I want to use a sign-in screen so you're asked and it answered me that's really nice I guess they kind of you don't know what you don't know as an end user like I don't know if I asked can I know in my electric bill company or whatever you know I'm like oh I want to do this but then they're like well actually did you know there's this offer that you can take or they're something I you can I guess start guiding people smell oh yeah real process of how you want them to kind of move through the system as well that's that's nice it's very very cool and what is it what is this called if we want to search for that kind of thing you can just search for documentation on queue and I make a multi-ton it's a public preview that we just announced so muddy done very good and you had a session earlier today was that on that conversation it was it's as well as language very nice so if people want to go and kind of figure out a little bit more go a little bit deeper and they're going to be able to catch up with that online later very nice okay so if you do have any questions please as I said feel free to go to AKMs Microsoft build live do ask your questions to the Q&A maker team they've been working very hard on these demos and would love to answer some of them so we were chatting obviously just before this and I said and I often say to anyone who's building like machine learning algorithms I'm like oh they're not you know you don't just build it and then it just sits that like you it's like a living thing you kind of have to look after it and update it over time and we've always wanted to get more intelligent can we do that with with QA maker can we can we provide it more information and you know to help us do that and this idiot pointed with every machine learning model like you said as well as a bot you wanted to keep learning with time and that feature we call into any maker as well as in other cognitive services like language understanding we call it active learning we release this and a couple of months ago we have some improvements but basically we allow the based on how users are chatting with the bot itself we will give feedback and then you as a developer can choose whether or not to add new suggestions and improve your model so you're still completely in control but Q&A maker will make suggestions for you because it knows what you know users are asking so let's actually try that I think you have that in the oven we have another time I know so I mean another life okay so this is the same right this is the same knowledge base you saw earlier with the windows surface and you'll see that you know you now have a new option called there's active learning so the show active learning and you can filter by the suggestions so this shows you only the suggestion so maybe you can talk about an example yeah so you can see here it gave me one more suggestion how can I sign in so it is based on users data what user queried in the context of this question yeah so we can keep keep seeing the suggestions now as a developer I can choose whether to add it reject it and keep improving it with time so can super simple and it keeps evolving how does it like bubble its way up almost is that is that something that happens behind the scenes it depending on how many people exactly and this is abort so either implicitly the model knows what the model doesn't know you know okay there's a mall you know is that this one I know a good answer for this one I know there is no good answer this stuff I'm not sure about so we keep storing back and I'm trying to use some again machinery concepts in the backend to cluster that and give the most relevant suggestions you can also use this to get direct feedback from users so the user says I saw some options I think this is the best answer you can also use that to feedback oh yeah no so it's gonna say cuz obviously you we sort of have to tell it normally it's like right there that's fine bit of both okay cool and about like maintenance of the system is there ways that we can I guess that comes as part of the active learning does it in the sense that you know if there's lots of duplicates or if there's like it's it's not quite answering the question how I worked if I was a human can we provide that in that yeah which base is it along with active learning when we are providing suggestions we also regularly do cleaner so that we're not just yeah we're not just showing the same number of suggestions all the time so it is being maintained at all times talk a little bit about personality cuz I think the interesting thing is we have a session on Wednesday talking about personality stuff right on an eleven and so in this case you saw personality coming through with chitchat right so we showed an example where he said you know the friendly persona so we have three right now that are in public but we just announced two more you will see its starting tomorrow so we have professional friendly witty and the new ones are caring and enthusiastic so you can choose the one that's more suited for your bot based on the scenario like if you are you know if you're if you're in a hospital or a caring separate situation you might choose the caring one right the caregiver kind of but if you are just a fun bot you might want something friendly or witty even yeah the vide one is always fun very nice and so have you seen different companies kind of yeah in these different personalities I'm assuming depending on the brand exactly you know you give off a bit of a flavor don't you buy your firebrand answer and that was part of that set ups not exactly right it's already it's super easy all you need to do is just select it and it comes automatically for you so very very nice and some set questions oh yeah oh great stuff we have some questions thank you thanks for signing in some questions and we have it Naveen so and can you add multiple docks to the knowledgebase and will it search across different docks I was literally about asked a similar thing about document types as well and so yet multiple docks searching across all these docks can you do that yeah you can add we can add as many docks as you want we have like a very large number we can add yes doc files Excel yeah and it's the bots and their knowledge base the ranking model will search across all of those and find the best possible answer it does it automatically for you so you don't have to worry about separating them separately in question yeah and we have one more question on there as well and can the bots be once it's deployed can it be deployed into native apps mobile apps web apps or does it have to always use the API I guess it is the API the basis and then you know use those packages in all of those different apps is right so we have the API we also have an SDK yeah so we do have the SDK available in most primary languages and those we keep improving with time the API is always the the latest and greatest but we also have SDKs we have are just the Q&A maker SDK as well as the bot framework SDK which is a more tightly coupled version of what's available with the bot framework itself no I so that's kind of like integrated into it is that yeah very very good and at one log so I think we have about 30 seconds left whatever got that from Ronald are there any automated testing methods so is there any way we can test what the box says that's a good point so today we don't do we're thinking about introducing something like batch testing today you actually do manual testing only and then you have app inside so application insights is the way you can check what people say in the logs and then you can see what the bots responding to that that would be the easiest way to do that today okay well I think we're open time okay thank you very much for joining us and saucy and Govinda and I hope throughout the rest rest of build thanks Jamie thanks very much everyone this has been a Q&A maker on Microsoft build lives [Music]
