 I love the idea of getting applauded for just coming up and saying hello my name is Nicola strong I'm from strong enterprises and I have the wonderful job really I mean I'm so looking forward to this session you have chosen well on success in conversational AI so what we're going to do is we're going to have four speakers they'll speak for about 12 minutes each we won't have time for questions in that 12 minutes what we will do is suggest that you have opportunity after the session so I'll ask each of them to come up and individually and give their talk and let's see what they have to say so the first person that I would like to invite to the stage is Duncan Anderson good morning good afternoon I should say so my name is Duncan Anderson I run a company called humanized AI I'm the former European CTO for IBM Watson we set up humanize AI we've built a what we call a communications platform which happens to have some AI communications in it but it's not all we do we do lots of things and we specialized that platform into the hospitality market so hotels accommodation suppliers etc so what I'm going to do is talk about how I've seen success in that marketplace and particularly I'm going to give you some examples to show you to illustrate some of the things that I think are important to to success so we define hmm something went wrong with my emojis that's what happens if you write charts in keynote and convert them to PowerPoint so we define success in our marketplace as how many people engage with AI assistant and we're getting 65 percent of people staying in hotels that have our software using our system so 65 percent is pretty high and 10 percent of those people are actually purchasing upgrades in the hotel so that's what is a business success metric for us and we define that success as as being having a civil attributes the first is having at that AI the second is having humans so we're big on that fact that an AI system cannot support customers on its own we need humans in the loop as well and how they interact together is really important and we need tasks and workflow management in the hotel as well because it's not just about humans taking over from the AI it's about generating works for people to do and then that work happens asynchronously from a conversation and then thirdly thirdly it's all about integrating with the systems in the hotel so you can actually do things it's not about just having a conversation for emojis again I can tell you I'm going to be blighted by emojis so the first example is a conversation where somebody has been making a reservation in a hotel when a reservation arrives in the hotel we get notified about it and then we start chatting with the guests so this is the conversation that we're having we're saying hey we can see your reservation we don't seem to have your email address could you share it with us so we're gathering information about the guests and here we're saying we would like to know a little bit about you why you what kind of things are you interested in and we asked that because if we understand who the guest is then we can personalize the conversation later on so that's the first part of what we're doing the second part is actually making money for a hotel because that's the purpose hotels really only buy things if you can make money for them so we hope to make money one of the things we do there is we say here's some things you might be interested in buying from us would you like to buy an early check-in or a late check-out for example these are real conversations by the way these are not faked up these are actual customer conversations where somebody says yes I'd like to buy like checkout and we say that's 20 pounds and I say yes I'd like to buy one of those and then we say that's fantastic as it happens you cannot automatically sell that late check-out because there's a lot of juggling around workload in the hotel so somebody in the hotel needs to make a human decision and at this point we generate a task for someone in the hotel to make that decision and they go away and make the decision and then they press a button in our console and that sends a message back to the guests to say if their request has been approved or not so that's where the instant integration between AI and the humans is really super important now this is going to be a fun one this is when the AI go has has a bit of a trouble so we had a guest who had ants in their room she starts off this conversation by saying when I checked in and got into room 304 I found more than 20 live ants on the floor kitchen fridge I walked down to receptionist and asked for help and look as a witness she saw that and felt so embarrassed so you can tell this is not a gonna be a great conversation she carries on they claimed that no rooms for me to change and claim to your manager said will reimburse first nights of stay for me your staff also claimed will try their best to change another room for me because I booked for a week how to stay in a room with a lot of ants a staff sprays once in my room and I also use another bottle to spray my room most events have been killed and some ran away I should say this I've broken this conversation up this this guest actually entered all of this as one message to our boss when I woke up for a walk-on next day that manager in reception promised me to change another room for me and asked me come back after one o'clock because they needed to arrange another room for me it seemed reasonable but when I back to hotel at 2:30 that male manager you have to watch out for the male managers said there are no more live ants in room 304 but only dead bodies of ants which is OK for me to stay I told him he made a promise to me in the morning but now he claims only dead laser vats which is no need to change another room for the coming six nights I disappointed what he said and how he broke his promise I found ants again when I got back to my room yesterday night as your female hotel staff also saw she said will contact your female manager see I think the females are better at dealing with answer than the male's I use dishes washer to clean up table kitchen and floor right away the main point is I found two more live ants in my room this morning I need to clean up the room floor once again remove three or four is a home of ants because they know the way to return their home I would like to get your reply asap what do you think Auerbach makes of that I can tell you I had not spent much time training it about ant infestations I work best be shorter questions maybe try some rising oh maybe I could get a member stuff to help so funnily enough it's actually the perfect answer because if I had spent a lot of time trying to work out how to response to ant ant infestations we would almost certainly have had a stupid conversation we were we were wound up the guest and it would have gone downhill rapidly so actually we did exactly the right thing to say I can't really cope with this I need to remember stuff which is again why humans are really super important yes okay this is an interesting one I want sex we don't get much of this but we do get some of it to which our bot says I don't think I should answer that but this person will not be deterred I want sex with Charlie I don't know who charlie is that seems a little inappropriate so you get some very weird stuff happening with hotel bars and really it's about containing that kind of stuff and and so we have taught our system about lots of inappropriate things that happen in hotels and it does a reasonably good job sometimes great things happen when you get humans involved and so here's a conversation where somebody has made a mess of making a reservation and actually our bot has handed over to a member of staff at this point so this is a conversation not with our BOTS at this point but with the member of staff when the member of staff is solving the problem and actually at the end of the conversation we've got a really happy guest because they recognize they've made a mess of things and our system has solved the problem and if you think of the system as being a combination of AI and staff and using AI at the right point and using stuff at the right point that's the right way to think of it and so early on our AI recognized that this was something that needed a member stuff and it bailed out which was exactly the right decision sometimes you get basically evil people live alone creepy robot okay I can find a real human if you'd like it's kind of chirpy isn't it in response to not the nicest comment no so I don't know what's going on here okay no problem so you can see maybe the cure penis isn't quite appropriate to the input but it kind of makes sense we like to think our system is uplifting even in the face of adversity this is another one that's you don't get many of these my girlfriend now ex is on her way escorted by police it's not any big deal she refused to leave my flat after break-up and we had to have her removed did she get in okay I can get a member stuff to help if you like so you can see we start at there at the beginning where our AI is in control of the conversation and it's providing a lot of value of itself because it's driving a conversation and it's actually collecting information about the guests and then it's selling things and then we have these examples where the AI says I shouldn't handle this I should get a member of staff and we really believe this combination is is the key and so if we think of success as being AI + humans + workflow task management for those examples where something needs to happen offline like looking to see whether we can get a late check-out or not for this guest + integration with systems so that we can when we collect for example their email address we actually put that into the CRM system so there's an interactive this isn't a a chat but we have a nice fluffy conversation this is a chat bot that actually achieves a purpose and integrates with systems and execute transactions on the behalf of the user and that's what we feel is is a successful system and how we get that high level engagement and how we get to actually sell things and make stuff happen so that's my view of successful chapels thank you thank you very much now my next presenter is looking at that in a very different way so I'd like to invite to the stage like Akemi Tsunagawa hi everyone my name is akemi I do have a little long complicated last name that everyone gets wrong I'm from a company called Bespoke, I started about four years ago in Japan so number of tourists visiting foreign tourists visiting to Japan literally tripled over the last few years maybe six years or so but in Japan not many people speak Japanese I mean English or Chinese to support those foreign tourists so what we do is to automate some of the communications between places like hotels airports train stations with those like foreign travelers you ask very simple questions for instance like best way to get to X and then our chat bot answers and then right now in Japan one in every four foreign tourists are using our service and here's like how it works a lot of those places Airport stations hotels you see like all these like you know fliers and like sinuses and all that stuff that not many people scan but once you connect to for instance like a public Wi-Fi at the airport our chat window just pops up so there's no additional download you don't need to download anything at the same time you don't get to choose so it just pops up and then it starts asking you questions but then today I'm going to share some of the mistakes that we've made and how we fix those mistakes on our user literally went from like no user to like over 10 million users in like a very short amount of time so the first step we did of course like being made a chat bot that kind of works then like we were very happy with it but nobody was really using it and because you're not gonna be actively trying to look for flyer or QR code to scan right so what we did was like put our service on public Wi-Fi so as soon as you agree to terms and use then our chat window pops up and then there we started getting a lot of people accessing our chat bot but then the next problem was nobody really was like chatting they see the window but they leave immediately so we started like looking deep into it and realized the most important thing actually isn't really to make a chat bot that works or to promote the service but it's more about designing the conversation I think my it was you also do something else that I don't remember but here like some of the stats that I would like to share so in the beginning what we did at the airport on the initial message we call it welcome message we had it something like welcome to Japan how can I you know how can I help you today it was too vague we play some buttons but it was too so not many people were interacting with our chatbots so we changed we look into what people were actually you know standing us like we look into like a chat history and learned that like majority of our users were asking about flight information so we rewrote the message to be something like welcome to Narita Airport and I'm your travel buddy do you need flight information and then only two buttons yes or no then initial engagement literally went up by like three times the next thing we tried this is like I think example from one of the hotels that we service left side we had like a very long answer probably to process this it would probably take you like I don't know maybe 30 seconds to you know figure what it is so we've II wrote it to you like something else that's much much shorter and then also placed buttons for the type of questions that the people would normally ask us like follow-up questions then this also increased our engagement a lot higher so more people started to like continue to chat instead of just leaving immediately then my images are gone again but next thing we did the most important part it's to their this is my favorite one so left side the avatar is the robot icon so it's called be bot and it's the robot icon and then right side it's very small but it's a human face and that's my sister's face my sister has an animated face so I decided to use it for service and we run it for bit and then more people like you know more people were like continuing to like chat but then the only problem I had was the people started asking weird questions like do you have a boyfriend and you know can we go on dates and my sister of course didn't know about that and then she told me you know like last few weeks I'm like walking on the street so random foreigners like foreign tourists like one take pictures with me I'm like you know I think you're becoming popular so as soon as she said that we decided to take it down so I engage meant went down but I was still okay then we needed to try more things right because it went down so next thing we did we started testing like the wording on buttons so wording on buttons seems like very small change but actually it made massive difference and this is like one of the big like failures that we had so we changed it from no to something a little bit vague like later then the engagement dropped significantly so we changed it back and next thing we tried we as soon as like we started getting a lot of requests like incoming messages from many foreign tourists we had enough data so we started populating relevant suggestions as buttons that way people don't have to think they just continue to chat by clicking on buttons so this is like Vic this worked very well and then I think it was around like 42% success then we looked deeper into some of the conversation like request that weaving like you know receiving especially for hotel clients and then these are the actual examples so for instance when people ask a lot of the same thing like is your swimming pool open yet so that could actually translate into something like your pool isn't open early enough you might wanna you know instead of waiting until July you might want to open it up like little bit sooner if a lot of the guests are asking the same question there's actually a translation for something else and it could be a sales opportunity for some of the clients and another example my favorite one was do I have to be a member to back and that probably means your website it's not so easy to navigate so I might as well just look on Expedia so a lot of these things we share with the clients then the slides got a little strange this is another one these are like other things that we do as we started getting like a lot more data we started analyzing more and for instance if a hotel guest sends something like oh I'm tired I'm jet-lagged then we start recommending like hotel spa there's a great spy on the second floor that you might want to try for instance and if people go like hungry then we recommend a restaurant inside the hotel so basically defining triggers on like key words then recommend something else is like additional services to help clients sell more and an airport could be something like airport transfer to sell or it could be sending people to gift shops say have you been able to get all of the stuff that you need it so all these things that we do the most important thing wasn't really the technology part I think it was more about getting making users happy so our clients are also happy and then this is the actual I think TripAdvisor review one of our users left on the hotel page and then by collecting more reviews for hotel clients they get more booking maybe direct booking and then that makes our clients happier this is the last one and I know I'm watching um and yet there are another two to go so yes I'd now like to reduce to a crit fish yes all right there we go hi everybody my name is accurate Vash I'm the co-founder and CEO of haptic thank you so much for having me over here you know it all mostly headquartered out of India what today I'm gonna go over is less about actually chat BOTS but a little bit more about us I think you know the team wanted to share I wanted us to share a little bit about our journey which has been fairly eventful over the last five years we started out you know with this vision and mission in 2013 vision was to build the world's largest conversationally I assistant company and the mission which was which sounded quite fancy at that time was to enable this shift from clicks to interactions this was really a very large sort of macro thesis that we started out with it's we've gone through a lot over the last five and a half years like we it's from August 2013 until pretty much now you know we've done we've done a combination of products and solutions and businesses over these years you know for much like any other typical startup you know we've over abused the pivot over these years and I'll go into just sort of year by year how we approach how we approach this problem so this is first year of our operation so we started out saying that look we want to build like a conversational assistant company how do we do that so we basically built a direct-to-consumer mobile app we called it the haptic customer service desk what you would do with this is you would download an app from the iOS or the Google Play Store and you would basically try and say you know try and get customer service queries addressed our eventual goal of this was to actually get brands and enterprises onboard and create a marketplace so that people could simply send in their query whether it is related to an airline whether it is go to a bank and then the actual end customer would be on this marketplace servicing these queries it was all human no AI so we actually had a number of agents at our that we would staff and then of course as we would take it to third-party brands on the marketplace they would put actually their own agents online it was all chat no boys we raised some seed investment back then to get this going one year later pivot number one we basically said look this customer service marketplace is not working brands are not coming online frequency of usage is not as high so for any direct to consumer products one of the things you want these people should be using it often enough turned out people don't have customer service queries as often as we think they do so we pivoted to say that look let's build a concierge right can we basically you know build something which people can use more frequently they can request things like you know set me a reminder they can request things like you know can you help me web check-in and the idea was that look now your we can take AI automation automate a bunch of stuff and then hopefully over a period of time figure out some way to make money switch to 1e or later this is like a half period not a full pivot right but basically saying that okay look now people are doing a bunch of concierge type stuff now how do we make money let's introduce e-commerce right so we basically went down the route and saying look instead of just people requesting reminders and web tracking why don't we help them order food why don't we help them book flights so we went into this route of trying to basically get people to essentially do a number of the day-to-day transactions on on this sort of mobile app we called it a simpler so back back in Asia this whole concept of super apps is pretty popular the most notable of course being WeChat out in China so we said look if we're going to go down this Beach at route try and get people to like do the day-to-day transactions on this personal assistant is what we called it now you know the good powder and you'll find out over the next few slides is that for whatever reason and hopefully there's not many VCS over here for whatever reason people kept believing in this thing so we keep getting more money so we raise another 11 million at this point which was on this whole idea that we're going to build this beach at of India next year this 2016/17 I call this haptic a little bit of everything because I think we were doing a little bit of everything because clearly for you know different reasons all together this whole super app concept did not work we thought that the whole idea of being able to do things over chat would be great turns out that it was not really chat that was the problem the challenge was that when you're trying to build so many different services in one app you cannot be good at all of them right so for food delivery there's one particular app or service that will do a lot better then I'm trying then trying to be an aggregator so anyway so what we didn't this is not two years back what we did two years back is that we basically went into this route of you know trying to do a number of things so we had our super app that was running so there was one team we said look there's a bunch of technology we've built out over these last three years which you know helps in automating bought interactions so why don't we start licensing it out to enterprises and go down to be to be rude so we started doing that on our super app which actually introduced an ad platform so we're trying to we're trying to monetize that through ads as well so this year when it came to conversational AI we were doing little literally everything you were doing conversationally I for direct-to-consumer we were doing conversational AI for enterprise I am reordering conversationally I for advertisers and marketers lot of fun by the way so this was a little of everything finally it took us only four years to find product market fit and fortunately we survived all this time and eventually out of all these things that we were doing we found product market fit in our licensing for enterprises and helping them solve customer service queries you know lot of people are very familiar with this and ultimately this is where a lot of the entire conversation layer industry is moving towards where basically what we do is we are the entire entire technology platform we license this out to brands and enterprises who use our SDKs or plugins into third party platforms to try and automate customer service queries you know I'd like to call this the s AP of conversational AI platforms and the only reason to do that is make think of it like having a fairly large horizontal feature set in terms of Technology modules pre-built templates and you can really customize it as much as you like so it could you know it's it's meant for the large enterprise you can come in you can rip it apart you can pick certain modules this is basically all of the effort that went into over the last lot of four years that finally finally got over here so where are we at today is really the question right so all out of all of this you know sort of ups and downs twists and turns we ultimately ended up or we ended up 2019 this is where we are we processed about two billion interactions through our platform about half of these have come through the direct-to-consumer sort of mobile apps and products and about half of these have come through our Enterprise integrations we we reach about 100 million end-users on a monthly basis about 30% of these come from again our consumer apps and 70% of these come from our enterprise integrations and over this period we've actually ended up building 124 odd live applications again most of these are now our enterprise integrations these are our current customers which is finally making the business actually work so coke KFC Samsung will find a lot of Indian customers over here because our business predominantly was India up until last year finally this all of this you know like I said for some reason we keep getting money so all of this all of this ended up in about two months back reliance Gio which is hoping people know them reliance Gio which is India's largest operator and led a 100 million dollar strategic investment into the company about two months back now this is what we are so this is what we're trying to do moving forward we basically have what we like to call a full stack conversationally i platform you know text voice multilingual so one of the things is as we are focusing on you know the next billion users to come online particularly in the India market multilingual is very important India you know there's English of course as a spoken language but along with that there's 25 other languages that get spoken in India so for us being able to do multilingual particularly in Indian context becomes extremely important we've built out of all these things that you see overheard pretty much everything has been built in-house right from our dialog builder we have our own agent chat interface I completely agree with the previous speakers that you know AI cannot solve every query end-to-end it has to route to a human agent we have our own line Linux dashboard you know the human plus AI concept actually also goes into the fact that we have about a 60% AI trainer team so this is the team that basically tags data labels data sets up workflows we think that's a very important component of actually the platform and you know this is really how we look at it now so you know going back and thinking about what we want to do moving forward you know we think of our sort of mandate as fairly large in terms of you know the areas that we want to focus on and the way we look at it is that as you think about conversationally I you know you have a number of different channels which actually chat all voice BOTS can go out to so obviously devices is something that's that's that's becoming very relevant over the last few years today we hear about Alexa or Google home but then there's a lot of other new devices coming to market so how can you build conversational voice first technology across multiple Hardware touch points first party is of course apps and websites where BOTS could be built and third party is again particularly in the emerging markets like India and Asia a platform like whatsapp becomes extremely important you know by far the most used app on the messaging circuit in India so how we can build on these third party platforms becomes extremely important customers of support of service is sort of once one use case that we do really well we're going to explore some more use cases with some of our customers particularly the idea of being able to do conversational commerce which is being able to provide a shopping assistant for e-commerce from and this is all the stuff like I mentioned we have we have the bot builder the agent chat 26 languages is what we're trying to build out so India officially recognizes on the Constitution I think about 30 plus languages our idea is to try and see if we can build you know NLP or NLU in about 26 of them and a lot of other fancy stuff that's going on finally this is really where we come from this is really where haptic really finds its inherent motivation from which is that the last 250 million people who came online you know skip sort of the desktop and when went straight through the smartphone and that's mostly from again in India context right we have this thesis that you know the next billion people who will come online might even skip the traditional graphical interface and go straight to conversation and this particularly implies like I said through the emerging market where the traditional interface does not make for easy usage especially in all the different languages that were talking about about us just making sure it all ties in still this was more for me than anybody else that look everything else everything is still tying in our aim is still to build the world's largest conversational I assistant company about 125 people five offices looking forward to work with everybody thank you so much it really doesn't stop there and the last of all though they certainly the fourth person in our very international team is Lauren can see Lauren cleanser and I'd like to invite you to the stage now almost Kunze to choose your own adventure um okay so yes I'm Lauren Kunze I'm the CEO of Pandora Boxx thank you all for being here today I wanted to talk about failure in conversational AI because there's a lot more content and comedy but they told me to stay on theme so I'm going to talk today about a bot on our platform that is processing around a hundred million messages a day and I'm going to tell you how we built it and how you can also do the same so a bit about Pandora Boxx Pandora Boxx is the largest rapid development and hosting platform in the world by the numbers we add about three to five thousand developers to the platform every month for a quarter of over 250,000 registered developers a quarter of a million they've built over 325,000 chat BOTS for a variety of different verticals and we've processed over 60 billion messages between BOTS hosted on our platform and human I'm users so we have a free self-service platform with a number of different features that allow anybody to sign up and easily deploy a bot on a variety of different popular voice and messaging channels and we also have a professional services department that works with some of the largest brands in the world to build conversational AI applications companies like coca-cola and Toyota so today I'm going to talk specifically about a bot that we've built for the largest door-to-door delivery company in Japan the amato transport um could you push play on the video inside the phone back there it's a button you have to push well we'll see into it but this is a bot that's processing around a hundred million messages a day it's saving the company millions in monthly and in Japan as you can ask Academy if I'm telling the truth later it is commonly known as the god bot because it just it just works so basically the goal is to let customers track packages and update delivery time and location in real time which is unlocked a massive oh there goes the video grades and it also at this point in time we are now pushing messages out to users to let them know their packages out to in delivery so we're integrated with their real-time logistics platform so trucks can actually reroute if somebody is not at home so I'm gonna break down for you how we actually got here and built a bot like this and I loved Duncan's example earlier because what I've always said is that bots for customer service tend to fail or don't really work for two reasons and the first reason is that when something goes wrong people tell a really long story about everything terrible that happened to them like about the ants those are very long story it's usually four to five sentences but if someone's really angry it's much longer and BOTS technology actually can't parse anything other than short answers but the real reason is that if something bad has happened to somebody a bot is going and they're already angry a bot is going to make them angrier about a hundred percent of the time really good customer service relies on you feeling like somebody made an exception for you we call it the exception principle and moved a mountain to fix your problem this bot works so well because we're getting to people with messaging before they even have a problem so that's where the savings really come into so I used to walk around saying that before you decide to build a chatbot you need to make sure that it's solving a real business problem but that's actually not enough you have to make sure that conversation is the right tool for whatever job your customer needs to get done so this is a famous framework from Harvard Business School which I did not attend but you can buy the books for much cheaper than tuition and the classic example is that people don't want a quarter-inch hole they want a drill or they don't want to drill it one 1/4 inch holes that jet lag to San Francisco so basically you have to make sure that conversation is the right tool for your customer it's not the right tool in some cases it will actually slow them down once you've identified that conversation is the right tool you have to figure out where you're going to meet your customer we had a lot of customers who you know notice the statistics around smart speaker adoption you know right now over 50% of households in the US have a smart speaker so a lot of brands Russians and well we have to have an Alexis scale but the reality is that if your customers aren't already on a channel and you haven't done the research to validate that nobody is actually going to talk to your bot so in the Amato transport example online messenger which is the most popular messaging platform in Japan we actually had a request from customers to be able to use the messaging platform to track packages and then once you know where you're going to launch you have to know what success will look like so what are your KPIs upfront and how are you going to measure them this is what a typical project roadmap looks like for a chatbot development project and the key thing to notice here is that the initial development timeline is only about one to three months and the reason for this is because you don't actually know even if you have a ton of historical data about what customers will say to your brand what people will say in action so it's very very important to launch quickly and iterate rapidly and it's just a good way to do an agile development process so in the package tracking bot example you know we released it with just one feature to start with letting customers find out where their package was and then the next month you release another feature letting them update the delivery window and so forth this is what a typical team looks like the turnkey solution for chatbot development is actually a myth it's an extremely cross-functional team within the enterprise and the vendor side you need copywriters and conversation designers who will actually script the conversation it turns out that people with a humanities background are actually much better at understanding natural language than both computers and engineers if it's a big brand you often need legal thank you somebody got that joke one laugh you need legal to approve all the copy to make sure that its brand appropriate and you often have the marketing team involved for the post-launch plan and a whole bunch of different resources so it's very important to resource appropriately then most successful bots will integrate with a back-end system in order to retrieve real-time data so how do you actually design a conversation this is a classic example of what I like to think of as bad design on the right is a TV guide from the 1960s and on the left is what it looks like today and what they basically did is they lifted an existing paradigm into something completely new without making any changes are taking advantage of the medium and we see this happening today and chatbot design a lot where companies are trying to lift you know their website and recreate it conversationally with a bunch of different buttons and that's actually not how conversation works it's a completely new paradigm with different design considerations so we get this question we've got our team together we've got our roadmap and now we need to actually start building can't we if we have a lot of data take all of our call center logs live chats emails and play training manuals and dump them into a Big Data blender and push the machine learning button and out comes a perfectly conversational chat bot unfortunately this Big Data blender isn't real it's the thing that I made up and it doesn't exist the problem with conversational AI today is really that it is an unsolved problem and the industry suffers from what's known as silver bullet ISM which is latching onto the idea that the latest techniques are the be-all-end-all breakthroughs so big data and specifically deep learning and neural nets have led to major breakthroughs and historically hard AI problems like image recognition and speech recognition but they haven't actually fully worked for conversational AI so that's why most production systems today are actually a hybrid of rules and machine learning systems rules are necessary to make sure that the bot doesn't go off-topic and turn into like a famous Microsoft a situation where the bot you know learned on a diet of tweets unsupervised and turned into a Hitler loving sex robot very quickly so I already said this once I can say it a few more times today really updating your bot after it's live with real customer data is the key to success and most of the work in conversational AI happens after you launch great BOTS share a number of different features they let the user drive the conversation they function within a network and they talk to each other they're modular they can also accomplish their own goals they understand language and they keep context so this is an example from our website of a sales chat bot that lets a user wander off topic because as we saw earlier in Duncan's talk oftentimes people will text I want sex luckily you haven't seen the 60 billion logs that we have so we've only dealt dealt with a few incidents but I tell you about 30% of all inputs are off-topic or inappropriate so we get this question we can skip some of these networks bots ok so we get this question a lot how do we force a user who has gone off topic back on topic and this is actually a trick question because BOTS are built by humans to serve humans and not the other way around so really good BOTS need to take into account what the user is saying oh yeah I don't have an emoji problem but it do have a formatting problem take into account and update based on what people are saying because every interaction with your chat BOTS is essentially a piece of user feedback on how BOTS want to interact how people want to interact with your brand we can see that so the Yamato trends for example once we're live we have to run unit tests and regression tests every single time that we make an update and these are actually updated every single week based on the new and incoming data that we're getting so it's a kind of a never-ending process basically we also have BOTS that are in the network in the amount of transport example that are tracking conversions in real time and will log and store the conversion in a database so every time we successfully tell someone were there packages or create a conversion it is stored so we're able to check and measure for any abnormalities in terms of the number of turns in a conversation it takes to convert a user a hundred million messages a day is actually 60 gigabytes of log data so there's no way that a human can possibly go through all of that and this is where machine learning is actually effective as a problem solver so we've trained custom models to flag use a user sentiment and as I mentioned earlier abnormal conversion numbers so that we can actually surface those bad and actions to human users that said it still takes about three human resources working two days a week to make updates that's why the modular architecture is so critical we can have multiple people working on in a team on the bot writing new tasks cases before release so I think a big headline here is actually augmentation and humans will always be in the loop in these cases because people are constantly saying new things to the bot we're adding new features and in fact new words actually enter the language at a pretty fast rate so the work is never fully going to be done all of that said we're still I think many many years away from natural language understanding being a completely solved problem so there is a long way to go and I think when we get there if we get there we will probably have achieved true artificial general intelligence so just a quick recap on the steps to build your 100 million message a date bot you need to first identify that conversation is the right problem for your use case you need to properly resource the team you need to design the conversation leveraging the fact that this is a new paradigm but not for too long don't launch after a year of work because you will be surprised shocked and appalled that what people are saying are different than whatever data you put into your big data blender make sure you integrate with back-end systems so that you're actually accomplishing things with real-time information and getting real work done the bot is really just the tip of the iceberg in a conversational UI layer on top of a lot of existing services make sure you build your test cases and are ready to iteratively run regression tests and update them and know how you will measure success and be prepared to build in those measurements into the development cycle don't forget basic marketing rules and finally never stop working because the work is never done any questions I had to skip some slides for time but please come find me later and thank you so much I need to go to the international school of pronunciation and thank you very much ladies and gentlemen for coming along this this afternoon I think that was an awesome group of people to listen to today I just like to ask you now to show your appreciation and thank you very much you
