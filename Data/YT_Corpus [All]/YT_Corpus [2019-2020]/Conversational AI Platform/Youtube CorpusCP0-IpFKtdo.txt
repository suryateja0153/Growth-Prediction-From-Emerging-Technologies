 These workshops were really well organized What was the most important is that you can think around different topics, in more depth than what you would usually do when you run your startup. What we think is the most valuable key takeaway from those workshops is how to create excellent and right timing touch points for our clients. I learnt firstly that there are many different ways to do the same thing. Be it growth, fundraising or marketing, there are so many different methods that have been successful, and you just have to find what works best for you. I learnt that fundraising is the combination of vision and finance. If you have the vision and not the finance, you're a dreamer. But if you have the finance and not the vision, you cannot grow fast enough Hana has drawn a lot of experience from product development, market testing, and customer behaviour measurement. For Bossjob, it has been 3 months of very immense learnings. I think looking back, GVI seems like a crash course of about 5-10 years of founding experiences, all being presented to us.
