 [Music] welcome to deconstructing chatbots I am Priyanka Vergara and in today's episode I have a very special guest from conversation design team at Google Kathy port Thank You Kathy for being here thanks so much for having me okay Kathy so what is conversation design what is your role at Google so I'm the head of conversation designed outreach which is a bit of a mouthful but basically it means I tell people both inside Google and outside in the world about conversation design what it is and why it's important so what the heck is call is Asian design at a high level you can think of it as we're teaching computers to communicate more like humans and not the other way around and you know a lot of us have had frustrating experiences with our voice assistants I don't know if you've ever had a frustrating experience a ton of times how do we avoid them a lot of times people think it's a technical problem but in fact it's often because design best practices were not followed so we want to make sure that when people are building these things if you follow good design principles you're much more likely to have a successful experience I am a developer so I really don't write design things oh where do I get started we always recommend you start with something pretty straightforward called a sample dialogue it's basically like a movie script it's a back and forth between your user and your system and it really helps you kind of flesh out your ideas and make sure you're going in the right direction and you just write these down and I always tell people don't worry they really don't have to be perfect especially right out of the gate mine are certainly not perfect when I first write them down but over time you just remember that old rule there's no great writing there's only great rewriting and after you've written some you do just like you do in Hollywood with a movie script you do a table read you read them out loud so you find a willing victim and then you have them play the part of the user and you just take turns reading out loud and you'll be surprised you'll actually find a lot of problems and issues with your design just through that alone before you've written a single line of code so Kathy I know how to have a conversation why do I have to design a conversation before I started working I think a lot of people are used to designing for things like mobile apps or websites where when somebody taps a button or swipes or selects a menu item you know what they chose and if you're designing a conversational system whether it's voice or typing people are gonna say all kinds of things that you're not going to expect and part of conversation design is really guiding people to success by showing them the types of things that are gonna be able to say in order for you to be able to respond okay so I get that I need to learn more about conversation design but if I write my prompts correctly then do you think everything else will just follow the better you write your prompts in your flow the more likely you are gonna get answers you can respond to but the big thing I always tell people is when you're working with conversational experiences people will always say things you didn't expect and that's just kind of human I mean when we're talking we often don't understand every single word that the other person says but we don't say oh we had errors that's because we're so good at what we call repair we repair our conversations very gracefully and we get back on track so that's the kind of strategy you want to apply to your conversational systems if you can repair things gracefully when people say things you don't expect because that will happen then you can get them back on track and keep going can you walk me through some of the examples of how you would repair a conversation yeah so if somebody says things says something your system didn't expect one quick thing is just to rephrase the options that are available at that current time you definitely don't want to say like I didn't understand or say that again you're not helping the person right they're trying to get through your experience and you're just you're banding them so one way is to just sort of rephrase the current options not the all the things they can possibly do but just like right now what should they be focused on another part of that is called rapid repro so that's just a really fast way to do that so let's say you're writing a chocolate recipe bot and you asked do you like milk chocolate or dark chocolate then chocolate and the person says 65% which you know maybe we don't understand that so a rapid repro be sorry was that milk chocolate chocolate and that'll get people that contract and one other thing I want to say about air handling or repair is a lot of time that first rephrasing or rapidly prompt will get people right back on and going again but if they have a second error right away there's probably not enough information for them to know what to do or what to say so at that point you might want to have something a little bit longer with a little more detail like oh your account number is on the upper left-hand corner of your bill or something like that because they're struggling at that point and you just really want to help them out okay so whatever understanding is don't just say I didn't get that right huh just try to be a little bit more specific about what was it that you were expecting and how can the user get back on track exactly that that's actually very interesting and amazing advice we are seeing a lot of smart displays coming into being what are your recommendations for designing for those smart displays yeah I'm really excited to see some of these different ways that people can interact and I think smart displays in particular there's gonna be a lot of interesting things that people come up with what we advise is to always start designing the voice-only experience first which might seem a little counterintuitive but in fact the voice-only experience is often the most constrained and complex I'll give you an example let's say you're just writing about business hours and if you're thinking about a mobile phone experience if I'm asking you know what time is sushi king open you can just pop up a card on the phone and it has you know Monday 10:00 to 6:00 Tuesday 11:00 to 7:00 or whatever but if I just ask on a smart speaker and I say what time is it open today if you started saying Monday it's open 6 a.m. to 7 p.m. Tuesday it's over that's just way too much right so instead you want to craft the prompt just like a human would to answer just the question itself so if I say is it open right now that's a yes/no question you should start with yes or no if I say you know what time is it open on Wednesday it opens on Wednesday at 11:00 and you'll find you might have to write dozens of prompts to handle that what would on a mobile phone is only one card mm-hmm okay what would be some of your final pieces of advice for our viewers today well first I'm just really decided to see what kind of experiences you all come up with that are gonna be really interesting to see I also think that voice is really matured in the accessibility realm I think we're finally seeing examples where voice technology can really help people who might have motor impairments or visual impairments or even cognitive impairments and I think this just brings us into the idea of inclusive design which means we're not just designing for this person or that person but really designing for all of us I mean if you think about it we all have impairments from time to time situational impairments like I'm carrying the groceries in and I can't use my hands or I forgot my reading glasses and I really want to read this text message so being able to use my voice is really handy there or maybe I fall and break my arm or something like that so I'm just excited to see that voice technology is really risen more to the challenge of helping people who really need it the most yeah thanks Kathy this was awesome I really learned a lot about conversation design today thanks for having me thank you everybody for watching this show I hope that you guys like to cat these recommendations and apply some of those in your conversation designs and if you would like to learn more go to action star google.com slash design well I've been designed the sample dialogue for this conversation so it doesn't take two take three [Music] [Laughter] [Music]
