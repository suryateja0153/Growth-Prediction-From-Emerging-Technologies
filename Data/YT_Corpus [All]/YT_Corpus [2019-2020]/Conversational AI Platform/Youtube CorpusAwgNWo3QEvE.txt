 from the silicon angle media office in Boston Massachusetts it's the queue now here's your host still minimun hi I'm Stu Mittleman and this is a cute conversation from our Boston area studio welcome back to the program Bobbie Patrick is the chief marketing officer of uipath Bobby good to see him Fritz Pearson all right Bobby we're gonna tackle head-on an interesting discussion that's been going on in the industry of course artificial intelligence is this wave that is impacting a lot when you look at earnings reports everyone's talking about it most companies are understanding how they're doing it it is not a new term you know I go back reading my history of technology Ada Lovelace 150 years ago when she was helping to define what a computer was you know she made it was the the Lovelace objective I believe they said which what was later quoted by by Turing and the like is that you know if we can strive it in code um it's probably not artificial intelligence because they're not building new things and you know being able to change on there so there is hype around AI itself but uipath is a you know one of the leaders in robotic process automation and you know how that fits in with with AI and machine learning and all of these other terms it can get a bit of a bit of acronym soup and we all can't agree on what the terms are so let's start with some of the basics Bobby please give us you know our PA and AI and you know we'll get into it from there well robotic process automation is you know according to the analyst like Forrest or part of the overall AI broader kind of massive massive market you know AI itself has many different different routes or your deep learning right in and machine learning naturally image processing right you know and so on so I think AI is a term covers many different grounds right in our PA AI is apply it applies to ways it applies within our PA in that we have a technology called computer vision it's how a robot looks at a screen like a human does which is very very difficult actually you look at a citrix terminal session or VDI session different than an Excel spreadsheet different in a SAS and most processes run across all of those so a robot has to be able to look at all that all of those screen elements and and and understand them right so it was AI with in computer vision around understanding documents looking at unstructured data looking at handwriting you know conversational understanding looking at text and an email and determine context looking looking helping with chatbots but a number of those components it doesn't mean we have to be built that all ourselves what our PA does is we bring it all together we make it easy to automate and build and create the data flow of a process you know then you can apply AI to that right and so I think look two years ago when I first joined you I pass putting our PA AI in a sense same senate's laugh year ago we said you know what RP is really the path to AI in business operations now you know we say that we're those highly valued a tight company in the world and no one has ever disagreed yeah so it's it's good to lay out some of the adopting because one of the things right they look at and say if I'd looked at this product two or three years ago it's not the product that it is today we know how fast software is might change along the way second thing you know automation itself is something that we've been talking about my entire career and I look at things that we were doing five 10 15 years ago and calling automation we kind of laugh at it because today automation absolutely is making a lot of changes our PA you know is taking that automation you know in a very you know strategic direction for many companies there so yeah it's it's the the conversation we had last year at your conference was you know our PA is the gateway drug if you will right of that environment because automation is scared a lot of people am I just doing scripts you know hey you know what do I control what do I set so maybe just give us that that first grounding of kind of where that automation path you know has common is going yeah so there's no kind of automation right you said we've had automation for for for decades primarily an IT automation primarily was around you know api to api integration and that's really hard right dave requires developers engineers requires them to keep it current it's expensive and takes long you know a longer time you know along comes a technology are PA and uipath right where you can automate you know fairly quickly there's built-in recorders and and you can do it with a drag-and-drop of like a flowchart and and you can automate a process and that that that automation is immediately beneficial mean that out come is immediate and and the cost of doing that is is is small in comparison and I think maybe it's the long tail of automation in some ways right it's all these things that we do around a.s.a.p process the reality is if you have si P or you have Oracle or you have workday the human process is that around that involve still in a spreadsheet they involve PDF documents and you know a graded my favorite examples right now that's on on YouTube with Microsoft is Chevron so Chevron actually has hundreds of thousands of PDFs that are generated from every oil rig every day it has all kinds of data in different in different formats tables and and different structured and semi-structured data and they would actually extract that data manually to be able to process it and analyze that right working with Microsoft AI and uipath RPA right they are able to automate that entire massive process and now they're on stage talking about it at Microsoft and uipath events right and you know they call that AI that's applying AI to a massive a massive problem for them they needed the robot to be completely accurate though right you don't want to apply you know have worried that the data it's being extracted from the PDFs is inaccurate right so you know machine learning goes into that there's exception management it's processed part of that part of that as well but you know they call it AI yeah some of this is just you know the people in the industry the industry watchers is you know we get very particular on different terminology well let's not conflate artificial intelligence or augmented intelligence with machine learning because they're different environments I've heard forced or talked about right it's a spectrum though there's an umbrella for some of these so you know we like not to get too pedantic on you know individual terms itself you know but let me give you some more examples cuz I think I think you know the term robotic and rpa yes it's true that the vast majority of you know the last couple of years with our PA has been very rules based right because most processes today like in a call center there's a rule do this in this and this and this and so you're automating that same rule space structure but once that data is flowing through you could actually then look at the history of that data and then turn a rules-based automation into an experience based automation and how do you do that you apply you apply machine learning algorithms you apply data robot element AI IBM Watson do it right so but it's still the RPE platform that is that's driving that automation it's just no longer rules-based its experience based Oh a great example at uipath together Dubai recently was Dubai customs they had a process where when you declared something would say you box of chocolate they had to open up a binder and find a classification code for that box of chocolate well they use our our PA product and and they make a call it call out to IBM Watson as part of the automation and they just write in you know pink box of candy filled chocolate and it takes us deep learning it comes back with a classification code all as part of the automatic process what happens Dubai customs lines go from being two hours to being up a few minutes right it's a combination of our rp8 capability and our automation workflow capability and the ability to bring in IBM Watson you know Dubai custom says you know they applied AI now it's solved a big problem yeah one of the things I was reading through the recent Gartner Magic Quadrant on RPA and they had two classifications one was kind of the automation does it all and the other was the people and machines things like chat BOTS some of the examples you've been giving there seemed to be that combination where do those two fit together or are those distinctions that you make yeah I mean I you Gartner's interesting guard was a very IT centric analyst firm right and I T often in my view are very conventional thinkers and they're often not the fastest to adopt breakthrough technologies they weren't the fastest to adopt cloud they weren't the hephaestus addicted to adopt on-demand CRM and they weren't the fastest to jump on to to RPI because they believe I why can't we use an API for everything and the Gartner analyst is kind of in the beginning of the process of the Magic Quadrant you know I spend a lot of time with this and they were trying hard to say that was what you should solve everything an API that's just not reality right and it's not feasible and it's not affordable right and so but RPA is it's it's not just the automation of a task or a process it's then applying a whole set of other technologies we have 700 partners today in our ecosystem natural language processing partners right machine learning partners right chatbot partners you mentioned so we want to be we want to make it very easy and a drag-and-drop way to be able to apply these great technologies to an automation to solve some big problem right what's it fun to me right now is there's a lot of great startups that come out of say insurance so they come out of financial services and they've got a great algorithm and know the business really well and they probably have one or two amazing customers and they're stuck we for them this came from a partner of ours you're becoming you uff you're becoming our best route to market because you have the data you have the workflow and and so our job I think in some ways is to make it easy to bring these technologies together to apply them to it Automation to make it through that a democratized way where we're you know a non engineer can do this and and I think that's what's happening yeah those integrations between environments can be very powerful something we see because you know every shop there's lots of applications they have lots of technical debt and you know they're not just sweeping the floor of everything they have what are some of the limits of a inr PA today where do you see things going yeah I mean I think I think you know deep learning you know we see very little that that's probably and things within companies I think you know for the vast majority of our customers they use machine learning within our PA for computer vision but by default but you know they're still not really at a stage of kind of mass adoption of being with it which algorithms do I want to apply to a process so I think you know we're trying to make it easier for you to be able to like in drag and drop a I we call it let's make it easier to apply but I think you know we're in we're in in very early days and as you mentioned there's market confusion on I know one thing from our 90 plus customers that are in our advisory boards I know from them they say that their company struggles with finding an ROI in AI right and you know I think we're helping there because we're applying it to a real operation they say the same thing about blockchain I don't know Stu do you know of a single example of a blockchain ROI great example yeah it reminds a big data was one of those that you know over half of the people failed to get the ROI they want it's one of those those promises of certain technology right the high level it's you know you know let poopoo Bobby thinks that actually have tangible results and yeah things done but you weren't following the strict guidelines of the API economy well true exactly right but I you know you look at you know is what's great what I find amazing is so I mentioned on another one of our talks conversations that 23,000 people come to you I pass events this year to our own events not trade shows other things that's different and they want to get on stage and talk they're they're delighted about this and you know in there they're talking about you know generally speaking our PA is helping them go digital but they're all saying their ambition is to apply AI to make those process a smarter to learn from to go from rules-based to experience based I think what's what's beautiful about uipath is that you know we're a platform that you can you can you could get there over time right and you can apply a different well you can't predict perhaps the algorithms you're gonna want to use in two or three years we're not gonna force you you can you apply any algorithm you want to an automation work going through and so I think that flexibility is actually for our customers it's it's very they find it very comforting yeah it's one of those things I say you know most companies have a cloud strategy but that needs to be kind of written in you know not in stone but you need to revisit it every quarter same thing with what's happening in AI and in your space things are changing so fast that they need to be agile they might be able to you know make changes so in October you're gonna have a lot of those customers up on stage talking where will this AI discussion fit into UI path forward in Las Vegas yeah so you know we talk a lot our AI fabric framework and so it's around document understanding getting smarter robots get smarter smarter what they see on a screen well they see on a document what they see with handwriting and improving the accuracy visual understated looking at you know face recognition and other types of the images and be able to understand the images conversational understanding the tone of an email is this person really upset how upset or a conversational chatbot or or else you know really evolving from mimicking humans with our PA to augmenting humans and I think that story both other than the innovations the customer examples on stage I think you're gonna see the sophistication of automations that are being used through uipath growth grow exponentially okay so I want to give you the final word on this and I don't want to talk to the people that might poopoo or argue our PA and AI and ml and all these things furgus inside your customers you know what we're you know how does that conversation start are they coming it from you know AI ml are PA or their state or is you know is there a business discussion that that usually catalyzes the disengagement there our customers are starting with digital right they're trying to go digital they know they need digital transformation it's been very very hard right and there's a real outcome that comes quickly from taking a mundane task that is expensive and automating that right so the outcomes are quick often projects and involve our partners like Accenture and others the payback period in the entire project with our PA give me six months it's self funding what other technologies do and b2b is self funding in one year so that's part of the incredible adoption growth but every single customer doesn't stop there they say okay I also want to know that this automation this this I want to know that I can go apply AI to this and it's in every conversation and and so there's two big booms with with with with with with UI Pathan or RPI the first is when you go digital there's some great outcome there's a Productivity gain its immediate s'right I guess I said the payback the payback period is quick the second big one is when you go turn it from a rules-based to an experience based process or you apply apply AI to it there's another set of business benefits down the road and it will keep getting as more algorithms come out and things you can keep applying to it so this is sort of the gift that keeps on giving and I think if we didn't have that that connection to machine learning or AI I think the enthusiasm level though of you know majority of our customers would not be anywhere near what it is today all right well Bobby really appreciate digging into the customer reality RPA ai all the acronym soup is going on and we look forward to UI path forward at the Bellagio in Las Vegas that's our fun all right I'm Stu minimun as always thank you so much for watching the cube
