Google and Celeste grade Alliance relationship manager at Google geela Matt Celeste over to you thank you Eric and welcome everyone so if you are regular readers of no jitter you may have noticed within the last week or so I wrote a post called are you ready Google contact center AI is here and we are very lucky today to have two of the people who have helped bring us to this point in time Celeste and Matt and I I have created some questions that I know that if you were here and you had an opportunity to be with them in front of a fireside you might want to ask the first one Matt is why is artificial intelligence so hot right now I mean we think about it for the last you know AI started 50 years ago I mean singularity theory you know was something that came up in the 1950s some of the logical reasons why AI now is there's so much greater computing power there's so much more data available to support machine learning certainly cloud computing I think has been such a big part of it but what is is your perspective on why artificial intelligence is so hot right now Matt thanks Sheila I think it's a really good question to ask so I think you've hit on a couple of the key points there there's aspects of on the data side aspects on the hardware side as well as on the software side and so at Google there we've kind of noticed significant advances in technology both on hardware where we have developed what are called tensor flow processing units or TP use which are specific hardware to take advantage of the vast amounts of data that's that's not readily available for kind of AI as well as we've invested in developing algorithms that can take advantage of that hardware so that we can really make this vision of AI that as you said has been around for decades it can make it into a reality now when we think about context centers specifically there is a unique opportunity to take advantage of this historically brands have tried to identify ways to reduce the cost to serve customers while simultaneously trying to improve customer experience now unfortunately this has led to automation experiences such as IV arteries I think most of us can agree don't feel super customer centric right and so we're all too familiar with the experience of having to listen to all the choices they are multiple times in order to make a proper selection only to then be forced to do it all over again and keep going deeper and deeper through this hobby archery and we see it in as many ways our attempt to modernize and improve the customer service experience actually ended up in shifting part of the burden from the contact center to the customer and so artificial intelligence is relevant for contact centers now because the technology is at a place where we can really remove that burden from our customers and incorporate technologies that actually deliver on this goal of improved customer service as well as increased operational efficiency now conversational AI specifically which is technologies that relate to how conversational experiences are allowing us to create systems I can understand what users are contacting contacting us about let them speak to us in a way that's natural and simple and kind of feels like a human-like conversation and so we should be seeing use cases for instance one of our customers Marks & Spencer has has that migrated to a truly conversational IVR where customers call in and they just say naturally how they typically would what their problem is and what they're looking for and they've been able to scale that in a way that previously wasn't possible they're handling over 6 million calls routed and that conversation IVR can handle over 2,000 customer intents now if you think about in the context of having a human rather that call that's a lot for a human to manage right to really accurately route to thousand different types of requests and so we're seeing that now is really the time for artificial intelligence to have an impact in the contact center space excellent yeah it's interesting to think about having been in the market as IVR first came in right in the early 90s originally what we wanted from IVRS was the ability to automate some portion of calls right maybe it was 5% my maybe it was 10% things that could be very easily answered and when I think about conversational AI I think about what you know again we don't want to get rid of all live agents right what we want to do is perhaps take that 5 or 10% that the 1990s IVR was able to automate and perhaps lift that a little higher you know and to your point take on some of that burden that the customers have had to explain everything and let artificial intelligence maybe get us to 20 25 percent of the kinds of interactions and questions that customers have being automated and then so much easier for customers let's move on exactly what is Google contact center AI what is what is that good question so Google context where AI is a solution that brings together a couple of different conversational AI building blocks to create a product specifically tailored to serve the needs of the contact center to the first building block we think of as cloud speech so there are a couple of components to cloud speech itself the first is speech to text transcription which provides the ability to take audio and identify specifically what words the user is actually saying the other side of that is text speech which provides the ability to take the text and then turn it into an audio signal and it's actually a voice response saying those words the other building block we think about is dialogue flow and dialogue flow is effectively the core natural language understanding piece here this is what allows us to go from this sentence or words to actually meaning to understand what is this user or customer trying to convey to us what is their intent no we've taken these building blocks and then we've added some very contact center specific functionality as well as partnered with lesson providers to package this into what we call the context in our a I solution now that solution is made up of three key components so the first is virtual agent which is effectively voice box chat BOTS you can think of conversational IVR experiences all of which are powered by dialogue flow the second is agent assist which provides real-time suggestions to customer service agents based on what the customer is saying and this is where we think what you discussed before is you want to have the virtual agent can handle hopefully 25 or more percent of the simple calls and then empower the agents to be specialists so they can handle the tough calls and the more interesting use cases and then the third component is insights and this is where we enable contact center managers and quality assurance analysts to better understand what's happening in the contact center in real time so what are the words that you've used a few times is intent and we talked about Marks & Spencer creating a conversational interface that can handle 2,000 intense can you get the audience a couple examples of what an intent might be so we can people can understand it yeah definitely um so an intent at the end of the day is just what is the user trying to say to us what is trying to understand what they want to do so for example if you're Marks & Spencer then an intent might be I want to understand what hours are certain stores open right or if you're a telecom provider it might be I want to understand what are the international travel plan options it's really at the end of the day what is this user calling about and so as contact center manager you could understand that your users have hundreds of different reasons that they might call in and that means you could have hundreds or even thousands of different intents and that's what is at the core of this natural language understanding technology is the ability to effectively understand what is this user reaching out to us about and let them talk to us in a natural and kind of human friendly way okay now I'm going to put on the spot a little bit are there types of intense that don't lend themselves to conversational AI that once you when you when you see them you say okay that's really going to have to be a human agent so that's a great question Sheila and I think the way to think about this is what are those types of intents that you want to have a human touch right so if for instance maybe you're working with a bank provider and someone lost their credit card and they've identified that there have been some fraudulent charges that customer wants to have a human in the loop to feel like they that their concerns are being met as well as to feel a sense of confidence that their account is being managed properly there are also other instances where maybe that's a truly truly complicated and unique instance you you rarely want to build the intents to handle every specific type of intent that might come out there you want to get the intents that can get the most coverage right and then at a certain point you let you can start to lose a little bit of the their ROI if you get the intent that will only show up once a year right so the way I think about it is kind of to two ways to think about it you a want to make sure if there should be a human in the loop that the customer knows that you care about them and you bring in your agent to handle their case specifically on the other side is if it doesn't happen very often but it might not be worth the effort of building out a tip for it excellent that really helps us understand you know how this applies to our businesses so let's move on why does Google see what if Google sees its role in bringing a eye to the contact center because for example you're not a contact center provider you know you're not saying you have a contact center software solution but what is your role what is Google's role here so Pierpoint we are not a contact center provider but we have been investing significantly in conversational iia technologies for the past few years and I think this kind of makes sense right if you think about the development that we've needed to build to make Google search and Google assistant as effective as it is currently we had to develop and had to invest in both the algorithms side as well as the scaling side to make those consumer products be able to integrate conversationally I at scale and do it well and the reality is that conversation is it's very relevant to con to the contact center so we see this as our opportunity to improve consumer experiences for all brands in many ways it's an opportunity to democratize better customers experience and ultimately we hope that brands spend less time worrying about how can they technically bring these experiences to customers and moreso spend time thinking about how do I create an experience that's true to my brand and allows me to develop a deeper relationship with our customer we like to think that we are the we can create the best conversation on AI technology but our customers understand their voice and their brand and that's those are the things that they should be focusing on within the context of so are you going to walk through these elements you touched on virtual agent and agent assist and insights but could you talk a little bit of more perhaps about how I as a company might install how I might implement Google contact center AI do I have to do all of these things can I do one of these things can happen how would that work great question and thanks for that Sheila so as I mentioned before they're kind of these three components to contact scenario there's the virtual agent which is the voice bot the chat bot agent assist which is how we actually help the human agent while the with the customer as well as insights which gives more information to your customer service managers and their quality assurance analyst now when we think about where to start there are a couple places but the easiest place frequently is on the virtual agent side you know under you'll have an understanding of what our customer is calling about and so you could build out a conversational experience to start to offload some of the burden of the mundane questions from your agents and secondly after you get the virtual agent started then we start to think about agent assist how can we empower those agents to be more knowledgeable and have higher kind of first-time fixed rates things of that nature but frequently customers we're seeing customers start with virtual agents and then move to agent assist and insights afterwards got it okay so I think as we move on to the next question what has Google's approach been to building contact center AI solutions I'm going to bring in Celeste grade here who has been working with all of these partners to answer this question what and thank you Sheila and I'm very excited to be on this fireside chat because I have been working these partners for years now and so it's exciting to see where we have done and what we've done together so our ultimate strategy as we look at the space and a lot of what NAT talked about earlier as far as truly democratizing AI is how do we ensure that each one of these contact centers can take advantage of truly the the best types of customer experience possible and make sure that it's not a science experiment and make sure that we're not doing pocs for the next five years and we realize the best route here is really partnering with it the the telephony providers that all these contact centers providers have and just adding in AI on top of their existing solutions this there's a lot of things that make sure that you're leveraging the solutions that you've had for years to come that has the overall contact center experience right and B it makes sure that you can really have this great experience that's already integrated with these providers so you can start taking advantage of it you know in three to six months versus five years after you hired all of your data scientists so you see all of these providers and as part of it most of them have already been pre integrated a bunch of them after our G announced they've also announced their GA and we have various different system integration partners also to really help your organizations in whether it's building more conversational IVR whether it's assisting a lot of that change management to really ensure the best experience for our contact center customers and providers so if I look at this list Celeste I see companies that are pure cloud plays you know like an ice and contacts or you know Salesforce or Tulio and then I see others that have premises based contact center solutions as well as cloud right people like Genesis or Cisco or Avaya is there any difference in how Google works with those customers looks different you know trying to apply Google contact center AI to a premises solution versus to a cloud solution what's different from your perspective I think that's a great question and I think it's one of the values of our partnerships and working with these partners for years now and that they've they've worked on areas in which in integration with contact center AI is essentially a hybrid to our making it easy to actually integrate with on-premise so it doesn't matter if there's maybe an on-premise solution it's so long as it fits in that software context we figured out ways in which to integrate with context Center AI so it doesn't matter if you're on Prem or cloud it can still be very easy to enable yeah if I look at some of these vendors several of them that have both premises and cloud solutions have created paths for their customers to begin to take advantage of cloud solutions while staying on premises and one of the top things that people want to be able to add to existing systems is artificial intelligence so it's great that Google has that approach that says okay if your cloud yeah that's going to be easy but if your premises today we will help be part of that bridge letting you take advantage of artificial intelligence which for the most part does come from the cloud but on top of your premises solution so thank you so much good stuff thank you so we're going to go back a little bit tacky we're going to go looking a little techie here with Matt what is an API an application programming interface and how do you use one and you might even start with why is Sheila asking me this question so I would presume that you're asking me this question Sheila because at the end of the day context Center API or context in our AI rather is a suite of api's that we've built to fit this context in our use case now when we talk about api's they are pretty much a way for different applications to communicate with one another in the case of contact center AI our partners have integrated with our API s as a means of bringing our AI technology into their context in our platforms so let's kind of walk through an example to talk about how these actually work so let's take for instance a customer that uses the contacts in REI a virtual agent technology and an end customer calls into a contact center now the contact center as a service partner will send us that audio via an API call then within the Google size our application will first transcribe that audio to text using our speech to text technology and then afterwards we'll send that transcription to dialogue flows natural language understanding to determine what is the right response for this user the next step is to take that response from dialogue flow that's in text form and actually convert it to an audio signal so we take the text to speech and use that to create a voice response that we've then finally send back to that context Center as a service partner using once again in AP on call and then ultimately that your contact center as a service partner plays back the audio to the end customer to complete that interaction now while we use API to work with our partners one of the benefits of these partnerships is that customers don't need to concern themselves with our ap is our goal for contact center area at the end of the day is to make it as low to no code as possible so while this concept of API is in the background enabling all of this we don't want our customers have to worry about it so I noticed on the last slide that talked about the partners that you have that it was not just contact center as the service companies but also there was a relationship management company their CRM so there are times when Google is working with more than one other application you know like a contact centers of service and a CRM and does that get more complicated that's a good question so there are times when we are working with like a CRM provider fred sense because there's relevant information stored in their system that can affect and then kind of improve this customer experience so in those instances there is another party that we are communicating with via api's however once again in the goal of making this kind of a load you know code solution it's not something that the customer has to work with has to worry about we build those integrations with the partners to CRM providers to ensure that the kind of end to end solution we provide is very turnkey and so that if you have information that's relevant to the call within the CRM system that we can seamlessly pull that into the contacts or application and that your agent can have access that information as a need or even in the context of kind of that virtual agent automation experience you can bring in the information as needed so that you can voice it to the customer perfect thank you so if I think about what I've heard so far I might think well am I going to need dedicated contact center developers in order to use Google contact center AI I don't know if I have any if I have any I don't know if they know how to do this so do I need dedicated developers but yeah so our goal when we talk about making it a loaded no code solution is to really ensure that customers don't need developers so most of our contact center contact area customers won't need developers to get the solution up and running our speech technology works completely out of the box both on the speech-to-text and the texas beach side and then when we think about the virtual agent side of things our customers that are having the most success bringing virtual agents into their contact centers are investing in conversational designers rather than developers to design and create these these conversational experiences and many times those conversational designers are experienced in high-performing agents because those are the people that are most familiar with the array of questions that customers might have rather than developers right and then also for those customers that don't have the investment don't have conversational designers on staff we also work with other partners that can help out designing those conversational experiences but then lastly thinking about the agent assist side there's an integration there with knowledge bases to enable agents to get the recommendations and the suggestions from our technology but we actually are also working on knowledge connectors so that that's also very plug-and-play at the end of the day we don't want developing development to be a hindrance to kind of unlocking this technology for your contact center and improving that customer service experience so we don't see dedicated contact center developers as a need to make this work so question how how do I decide which intense that I want to work on so I don't need a developer I might be able to do that with a business analyst in the contact center does insight help me with understanding what might be the right kind of intense to work on so that's a good question so insights that's one of the key components of it really so we have a feature that we call our topic modeling where you can just give us a bunch of data whether it's chat transcripts actual audio logs and from that we can pull out one of the key things that customers are calling it about so then you can say okay well twenty percent of the time they're calling the let us know that they want to change the address for a shipment or ten percent of their time they're calling to figure out an account balance and from that you can then identify what is the best use cases to start with building out these conversational experiences our goal and once again this is kind of an out of the box solution that that when you work with your contact center providers you can get this insights provided to you so that you can understand how should I start like where should I spend my time with building out these experiences what's going to give me the most bang for my buck in terms of kind of time time given to to building this up good stuff good job handling these on-the-fly questions I'm thinking of as you're speaking I like a common hahaha we've the Google contact center AI was first announced in the summer of 2018 and I think we've talked about the fact that it is now generally available all of the components as of a couple of weeks ago so what else has been going on other than getting from you know announcement to general availability what has been happening at Google contact center AI for the last 18 months and and what does GA really mean in Google parlance so for the last year and a half we've really been focusing an Rd and so we're reading from both sides of that both the research and the development so from a research perspective we realize that contact centers are a relatively new space for Google and so we have a lot to learn by the past year and a half we've done a significant amount of research actually visiting contacts that are sitting with agents sitting with QA and I was sitting with contact center managers to better understand how do you contact centers operate and how can we build contacts and REI to be most helpful for these users and now that we have a much better understanding of the various keyhole keeps various stakeholders from shift leads to QA analysts agents themselves and so at the end of day this is what allows us to make better decisions when it comes to development now we've spent a lot of time developing new features and new functionality specific for the context in our over the past year and a half as well so on the speech-to-text side we've been developing some of the most advanced deep learning neural network algorithms and now we support over 120 different languages we have our speech to text so Cabul area is 10x that of the Oxford Dictionary we're also working on specific telephony models too in that can handle the challenges of the telephony context when trying to do this transcription we we've had American English for a while we just launched British English American Spanish and Russian and we have many more to come now the other side of speech is the Texas speech and so we want to ensure that in this context in a context we are supporting a natural and conversational sounding voice and so one of the areas we've been able to take advantage of here is google's deepmind technology that really provides us those nearly human sounding voices and now we have over 90 different wavenet voices which is really the cutting edge in terms of natural sounding human human-like voices as well as over 20 different languages of the can support well the other side we think about is this is for dialogue flow and so that's we're talking about before which is that natural language understanding and the real kind of conversational core that powers natural and rich experiences and so we've now support over 30 different languages for dialogue flow with more coming we can support over 2000 or up to 2000 intents to really meet the needs of large enterprises enterprises ni VRS and the proof is in the pudding that we're seeing over a million developers now using dialogue flow for their natural language understanding technology and then once again we spoke a bit about agent assist before but we've been doing the research to understand what the asian experience is like and so now we've been testing some of these features that were developing for agents with live agents to understand how can we improve that and then lastly within the context of context an area we've been working on these integrations with our partners now we want to make that API integrations that we have with them much easier to use identify ways to make this a better user experience as well as ensuring that context center center at AI is a place where it can scale reliable and you mentioned kind of what do we mean when we say GA what does that mean within Google and we recently went from beta to GA for context and area and the biggest difference there really is the ability to reliably scale and in handle production workloads I mentioned before that we have a significant amount of experience in the consumer side with a Google assistant people search YouTube kind of scaling kind of machine learning basic artificial intelligence based products and so being able to do this product at Google scale is really where that what we need to achieve to get to the level that we can call ga and so a big part of that is the technical aspects like ensuring that we can scale up our servers and handle tens of thousands of concurrent calls at one time and then another part is a little more operational right like ensuring that we actually have the support team and the processes in place to support enterprise customers and provide them the experience that they expect so that's interesting I've done some work with companies as they develop their own applications and one of the issues they have is how do we scale this right we've done this proof of concept and it's you know it's fine for the small number of calls or intense but how do we make sure that we can take this into production as nice to know that you know even before you go general availability google has has taken those steps in you know for their customers I want to take you back and ask you a question about something that you said there Matt you talked about one of the things that Google has been doing for the last 18 months is building telephony models and you said you know Russian and a couple of others for the speech understanding but what is telephony models mean because you can understand the languages but I think there's something more there that the audience might be interested in yes so what do we say to Latino models we're talking about that speech to text transcription model that's made specifically for the telephony context the reality is when audio is coming through as the telephony reading in telephony pipes though the quality is a little bit lower and the actual the technical aspects of it are different you have lower frequencies and so we need to ensure that we can handle the audio as it comes through a phone signal and you can transcribe it correctly and there there is there's both that aspect as well as the reality that in the telephony context you can have a pretty long utterance as opposed to if you're doing just the traditional have IVR context those other answers are much shorter so you could think of for instance if a customer calls in and they're talking to an agent there might be a lot of small talk there right they might be talking about their day they might be talking about whatever happens to be on their mind as well as eventually getting to the issue that they called in about and so there are some unique challenges in that context to ensure that you're transcribing it appropriately and so our goal is to ensure that we are bringing a quality service no matter the channel no matter the context and so to do that we're actually building out specific speech-to-text telephony models so we can ensure that we are providing a quality transcription as it kind of is the first step to doing some of the natural language understanding on the virtual agent side as well as providing great suggestions to your agents for the agency side excellent I think that that helps us all understand you know the other thing I think about is you know cell phones and that kind of thing that you're purposely working on lower quality voice dreams that you might be getting because I think you know I was always I was surprised to hear from one of your partners actually Avaya that over 50% of telephone lines in homes today in the United States are mobile right so it's not an insignificant issue that contact center calls are coming in on mobile phones so being able to handle that that quality of speech that quality of recording so that you can then do the rest of the work that Google contact center AI wants to be able to do well makes sense but now probably the best one is ID in your deck this is it this is this is the money slide you're going to tell us about three of us tumors that have actually deployed Google contacts in our AI pre general availability and I think some of these even spoke at your event in London last week yeah well so we actually had Marks and Spencer on stage getting with us last week and so one of the examples that I touched on briefly before is Marks & Spencer is a retailer in the UK and they are now successfully routing over 6 million plus calls and so one of the benefits there is they can have a high number of intent so using all close to 2,000 intents and being accurately routed to the right agent as opposed you're having a human sit at that part and just try to route all day right you could think of if you're a customer service agent it's much more appealing to work on interesting calls as opposed to just routing taking the first call and trying to route it to another agent all day now and from a kind of cost savings and kind of customer experience perspective they're seeing an improvement of over 10 seconds in average handling time all right so the proof is really in the pudding there another example it's Policy bazaar where they are seeing actual top-line growth where they've had I've been able to close sales over 13,000 sales actually and then over 2 million dollars in annual monthly revenue and so this is an interesting case where it's not so much how do we make the business more efficient but how do we actually improve our top-line and provide better recommendations and a better experience to our customers that actually increases that kind of brand loyalty which results in gonna you can get manifests rather and how much they're spending with us and then lastly its Woolworths which is a Australian retailer that's doing something very similar to Marks & Spencer where they are using a conversation where they are to provide an improved routing experience for their customers and so it with Marks & Spencer and Woolworths I know what is policy Bazar do the policy Bazar is a company that helps you identify what's the right insurance policy effectively right and so you could think about like insurance can be a pretty complicated space and so what they've been able to use the contact center AI technology to do is to provide better recommendations over the phone to their customers and so they're providing a new channel to get recommendations which in may a somewhat complicated space kind of easier to handle and kind of understand because you can whittle it down to a couple of options that are good for the customer and then deliver those options to the customer and a conversational and kind of natural feeling context excellent so you know it looks like there's business to consumer all happening here but I'm sure there are probably some business to business applications as well but maybe that will save those for the next webinar because now we're going to get Eric involved again and he's going to run a poll question for us okay thanks thanks very much you and here's our question do you see applications in your business for the kinds of projects that were deployed at Marks & Spencer Policy Bazaar and Woolworths and options are yes we've already deployed virtual agents we're prototyping virtual agents we don't use them today but we're considering them and no we don't have any plans and maybe you know maybe just just real quickly Matt if you could just reduce as a reminder for people how you might characterize in a couple of words each of those three projects Marks & Spencer was about sort of call handling efficiencies i fair so I would say Marks and Spencer and Wohlers were about call handling efficiency for retailer policy Bazar is actually about providing recommendations to customers in a conversational context and those it how did how did policy Bazaar sort of validate the savings that that they that they had so in policy bazaars case it wasn't savings there's actually sales and so they could see that how what sales are actually coming from a conversation that's involving this conversational experience and so they could directly say that X percent of sales were a function of the conversational experience got it okay well here's here's all our results with that I'll just hand it back over to Sheila you want to talk with Matt and Celeste about the results or just move on but thanks everyone for helping i'm so not surprised to see that over 50% of you haven't yet deployed virtual agents but are considering it and good on you you're here learning what google contact center i can possibly do to be part of that future 22% saying they have no immediate plans and that's okay too because we did ask the question about you know virtual agents there and some companies are saying you know what i like the thought of using google contacts and rei to assist my agents you know the way Marks and Spencer did by allowing call disposition it helps the agents save 10 seconds on average and alcohol but we're not really ready to do agents and almost 10 percent say they have already deployed virtual agents which you know a year ago number one I don't think the number would have been as high and number two I'm not surprised at that and just today I was doing something about something I ordered and I got a virtual assistant from a company and then I went to the shipping company and darn I got another virtual assistant in chat so it's definitely happening do you have any comments Matt on the prototyping and trialing we've got 16% of people saying that you talked a little bit about how people transition from that to deploying yeah so as we mentioned before a little bit at least but we think see topic modeling as an opportunity to identify what are some of the key use cases you can use then once you start to prototype in trial you get a little bit more experience with how do I build out these conversational experiences right you start to develop a bit of that conversational designer competency within all your contact center and so what we recommend is once you've kind of gotten past this prototyping phase you can start to once you have confidence in maybe one key intent where a couple of can test you can deploy it in the contact center and then using topic modeling to understand the other key things that your customers are calling out calling about you can start to kind of add on additional intents there as well as understanding are there certain phrases that are getting confused that the virtual aids getting confused about and improve kind of the accuracy of your virtual agent at the same time so I like to think that you start with a prototype once you have confidence in the prototype you expand the amount of traffic it's getting and then you can start to add in additional intents while you're using topic modeling to understand what are the topics that people are calling about yeah it's interesting what you say I remember once that this notion that you don't have to guess for those first couple of applications of app artificial intelligence all you have to do is ask agents and supervisors they will tell you what the most often questions are you know what one of the things that we end up spending time on that our could easily be done by a virtual assistant but then when you want to get more sophisticated and it's the tools like insights that are going to help you take it further good stuff okay so we've talked about what you've been doing for the last 18 months Matt you would I guess there's another couple of guys better work on us that Google has as you look out over the next year or two from contact center AI yes so we're planning on expanding across all of those different areas that I've touched on today so one of our immediate key focuses is expanding the languages that we can serve with our telephony speech models and so this is one of the key components to enabling context in our AI for our customers globally currently we support American and UK English American Spanish and Russian and our plan is to rapidly build out additional support for other languages in the next year or two now 51 with England virtual agent side we're focused on enabling enterprises to handle the scale and complexity of a contact center why look flow already supports five times the scale of our nearest competitor in terms of number of intents and is being used in highly complex use cases now we want to double down on that strength and accelerate enterprise adoption and so this predominantly will mean features that better serve the enterprise you can think of things such as better tools to build BOTS tools to understand where BOTS get confused and the ability to handle more intense there's some of the things that we're thinking about and working on currently now on the agent assist side we're just getting started so there will be a ton to learn in the next year our goal in general is to help agents be more effective and efficient by reducing some of the more mundane tasks they do and allow them to focus on providing the human touch in customer service we're currently working on a number of feature improvements to our knowledge article and FAQ suggestions to make them more relevant workflow suggestions it easier fulfillment to help agents more easily and quickly solve issues for customers we're looking at improved check tools like smart reply for suggested responses and smart compose for our auto completion and we have a number of other features that are a little bit earlier and they are in these days which will crystallize as we start to learn more right I think this is one of the areas where we have a lot to learn as we have more adoption and to understand what's really moving the needle for customers and then lastly we'll also be go deeper into insights for contact center area topic modeling was kind of our first product within this space which enables the automation of understanding what topics are being discussed in the call but we're also working on more advanced call analysis tools to help contact center managers QA analysts identify what our specific areas of interest fulness within these calls how can we help them perform more efficient that quality assurance process as well as quickly identify opportunities to actually coach your agents identify what are things that the agents are struggling with and you can help them out proactively excellent looks like you've got a busy couple of years ahead of you and that we'll be seeing the benefits event as we go on so I am going to turn it back to Eric who's going to handle the QA all right sounds great thanks very much Sheila and also Carson thanks Matt and Celeste was terrific really interesting counter for QA just reminding everyone you've got the text box at the right hand of the presentation window where you can type in your question or click the Q&A icon at the bottom of your screen and let's start with a question on here's one how this let's just kind of maybe start with with the Google team and then maybe get any perspective you have Sheila well how will the verification and identification process work with virtual AI agents basic search so for virtual agents when come to AI agents we have this feature called fulfillment which allows us to connect with your back-end systems and process any type of virtual or verification or authorization process that you might need another thing that we're actually starting to work with voice biometric firms as well to start to provide another capacity for that verification or authorization process what we have a number of customers that are using it today and we're seeing it this is very helpful because for instance if it needs to get to the human age it's it's ideal if the customers already been authorized or verified and you know who they are so we've kind of developed this with that use case in mind so we can easily support it the other key lady any thoughts on I was just going to say that you know since I didn't open my big mouth I really don't have anything to add on that one that I think is kind of thing it's not a lot of people's minds and it is for the Google team what does Google do with my data that's a great question so your data is your grade of Google and no one else's so we are very very serious about how we handle your data no other customers will have access to your data it is and share for training models at the end the day it's imperative from our perspective that any data you provide to us is only use for models within your company and for your customers as well as if you send us any data we also do what we call DLP which just removes any forms of personally identifiable information so we ensure that we are not storing anything that might be of concern to you and as well as anything that you store with us will only be accessible to you and no other customers so I think what you talked about there that DLP process is is what some of us may know is anonymizing the data so what's the difference you know what a sort of follow-up question here Matt what's the difference between securing our data if I'm one of your enterprise customers and using the data to make better models so if if I'm your customer Maggie Smith analytics is your customer you're securing my data your anonymizing it but do you do you use it to create models that might be used by other people other companies very question fair question Sheila so we both secure the data so anonymize it as you said but we also ensure that we do not use your data for anyone elses models so any models that you train or you build using your data will only be used for your use case and for your company it's one of the the key components as we see it is that we don't want there to be any data sharing amongst customers data is a very valuable asset to your company and it should only be used for your benefit and so we ensure that there's no data leakage no data sharing if you give us data on for your use case it will only be used for your use case it will not be used for any other customers models excellent good to know thank you okay thanks very much Matt and let's go to another question we Sheila asked earlier about whether whether an enterprise need to hire developers and Matt you indicated that that you really don't but but AI itself is kind of a whole new sort of field of expertise and discipline and is the idea here that I can just they essentially outsource everything dealing with AI to Google and and my enterprise folks can worry about what they've always done or do I need to hire people who know something about AI and and who are those people if they even exist so I'm going to start with this one because I have been working with companies that are you know thinking about these issues right and I think the good news is that the graduates coming out of Business School's engineering schools are taking these kinds of classes they are beginning to understand and in coming out with skills that might not be in your contact center today but will be useful not because you need them to build the AI but you need them to understand how it will work in your business right this you know Google is doing really good work to understand the contact center market working with all the contact center vendors but there's still vertical aspects of artificial intelligence meaning you know the various industries and so I think you do want to think about hiring people who may have coursework or former experience in the area of artificial intelligence without necessarily needing them to you know be coding all day long that's the sort of Sheila's point of view what curious what yours is met I would agree and of double down on what you said there Sheila I think one of the goals that we had in mind is you don't need AI developers now you don't need machine learning engineers to make this work but you should have folks who understand how a AI works at a high level right that they understand that the as the quality of the model is dependent on the data that you provide that there's going to be a training process sometimes to ensure that you can create a new model but these are more high-level AI concepts that they can that can be applied broadly as well as your employees that have a deep understanding of your key use case so it's really not AI technical knowledge that I would say you want to hire but just kind of more of the AI general knowledge and then the deep domain knowledge of your business so they can understand where that intersection is and how to build kind of the contact center experience appropriately okay great and we've got time for one more question I mind we got a ton of questions here which is awesome and we're not going to get to them all but we'll have all these questions collected and we'll have them in the in the report that our system will generate for us so the folks you've heard from today will be able to get back to one on one with the information on your contact that you gave us when you register and they'll be able to help you with with answers after the event so let me close with this last question and it's a small question if I was going to start an AI project how would I begin so I'm going to start with this and then obviously Matt will join in hopefully I think if you go back to one of our earlier slides and you looked at all of the vendors that Google contact center AI has worked with contact center vendors you will probably see your contact center solution vendor there that means that they've already been working for you know 12 to 18 months with Google and they're down a learning curve and so you can start with the people that you work with every day in terms of how do i integrate that to what I already have today so I think that's the best place to start is right with your existing contacts vendor what do you think Matt yeah I would agree the goal here is to not introduce too much additional complexity right so your contact center software provider has been working with us they have an understanding of specifically how can you use their software kind of their contact and application within the context of contact center AI so they will be the subject matter expert to get you kind of off the ground day one and then using the other components that we talked about right so using topic modeling to understand what are some of the key use cases that we can use as well as as Sheila mentioned you have a number of subject matter experts in your context in or that's your agents your contact center managers and then you can identify what are some good use cases to start with and work with your contacts in a provider to actually kind of get that off the ground and running all right terrific I'm gonna go to that's a great note to end on as you can see I've pushed out a slide with some resources a bunch of blog posts and some other information that Google's provided for us so please do take advantage of the opportunity to learn more about this topic it's a really rich topic and as you can see it's one that's going to be just increasingly more important over time we'll be covering it extensively at Enterprise Connect and you'll be reading about it everywhere including no jitter Sheila covers it extensively and and Google obviously is a huge piece of this so I want to thank Google for sponsoring as well as thank everybody in the audience for listening in today we really appreciate your attention and your participation now within the next 24 hours you're going to get a personalized follow up email from us with details and a
