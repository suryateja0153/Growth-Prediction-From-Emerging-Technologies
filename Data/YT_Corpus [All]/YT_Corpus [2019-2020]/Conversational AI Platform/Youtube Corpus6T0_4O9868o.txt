 welcome to deconstructing chatbots I'm Priyanka reg area and today's episode is a special one because we are going to visit spring Elmo's office in Pleasanton California and sit down with Dhruv Ahmadi their expert at managing conversational AI projects stay tuned because we will talk about real-world use cases of conversational AI how some of them have come to life starting from the idea to the finished experience without further delay let's go and chat with drew my name is Ruth Ahmadi I'm a technical project manager at Spring ml Springer Mel is a Google cloud from your partner in advanced analytics and machine learning we work on AI n ml use cases across you know computer vision chat box predictive modeling increasingly data migration as well you know we founded the company about four years ago now started as a small you know local team of less than 10 employees we've grown exponentially since then we're about a hundred folks all over the globe for different offices and you know it's it's been an exciting journey we feel like we're just getting started in a lot of ways that the founders started with a core belief that machine learning and artificial intelligence will really transform the way you know enterprises do business in the future and that's really our mission is to help them you know incorporate AI nml across their business Google is probably the leader in AI n ml and we leveraged a lot of the best school technologies from tensorflow to auto ml to dial up flow for building chatbots and really helped customers accelerate the time they see impact we've seen use cases both you know b2b as well as consumer chatbots spanning a number of different industries from retail to banking to pharmaceutical one that we did recently for a big pharma company helping their product managers easily retrieve information about different drug studies as well as regulatory hurdles we also worked on a cool consumer broth for a retailer and helping them provide a gift recommender for the customers I think the biggest learning as I see it is that design is fundamental to building any successful chat but you know unlike traditional IVR systems you know chat BOTS can handle nonlinear conversations and so really working with business stakeholders to figure out what the ideal conversation flow looks like will be essential to building that that thought that works for for the users [Music] today at Spring EMA office in Pleasanton it's such a nice day today absolutely really nice so what do you mean that conversation flow how do you design a conversation we ask a number of different questions initially right off the bat first you want to understand you know what are the key business objectives of the chat pod what is your workflow life will a human be part of the process or should the bought be able to handle all questions then we move to some more tactical types of things so how many unique types of questions do you want the bot to handle you know our most those questions static is there a general response for a question or are the dynamic questions so is it dependent on the specific information that the user provides so like connecting to a back-end database or some absolutely once you have like kicked off a project what do you see as some of the implementation recommendations that you provide to users so if you're a new customer you know we recommend that you start with a four week PLC just to kind of showcase the art of what is possible you know maybe throw in some static and dynamic questions for some variety we start with you know a week of requirement gathering followed by a couple weeks of agile development we'll take your feedback into into account and finally a week of user acceptance testing just to make sure that users are comfortable and everything is working effectively what happens after maybe a month or so sure so after about a month that's when we move into a production phase so that'll be a couple more months where we add more questions both static and dynamic you know we may add a user interface and then you know we may release the bot through multiple channels including Google assistant and Google home but others like facebook Messenger and select sued review show you talked about a little bit in terms of how to implement the chat bots you've talked about some examples can you show me a back-end infrastructure and architecture of an implemented chat bot absolutely let me show you awesome all right we are with Drew and he's gonna walk us through how some of these chat BOTS work yeah so let's take a look at one that we did for a coffee shop uh coffee I love coffee yeah that's - absolutely that's what the chat well will do for you so so this chat pod basically helps the coffee shop automate their customer service awesome so as you can see we have aggregated some of the most popular items at the bottom here just to allow you to easily select one of the items so for example if you want to order a couple donuts you can select the item at the bottom and as you can see to the right we're basically showing you your order in real time so you can see how much you're paying and the front end is it created with App Engine it is yes so this is deployed on App Engine okay and you know one other item that's kind of cool is you can select what's most popular this week so for that we're able to aggregate overall data over the past week and figure out you know what was the most ordered item oh that is amazing would you need you to see what that was Chuck okay click on that oh wow it looks like some more glazed donuts I think I've had enough for today yeah so that actually the coffee shop demo itself was pretty enlightening to understand how the front-end would work can you show me an example which talks about a little bit of back-end behind-the-scenes stuff absolutely so we actually did a chat pod recently for a Google internal team for Google collections and really what this chat pods does is it helps Google customers easily look up their account information invoice details details about their account in general you know and for example if you're you know a customer at Telemark you can easily look up information specific to tell Mart and only once you're authenticated as a telomere customer okay so what does the front-end look like for that one so for that one we go to the bot so as you can see this is a main Google Health page and to the bottom left we have a section for Google actions yeah so you can click on that and then you have to log in with your details and again only if you're a Telemark customer are you authenticated to to see telomer invoices so in this case we'll use those email details and now we're on the main Google collections page and I see the chat window that can come up absolutely so it's a pop-up at the bottom right so if you click on the pop-up you can now start using the chat log Oh perfect so before we actually start to use the chat pod with talimar as an example can you show some of the vaccum interpret interconnections between the dialogue flow interface and the front-end and what's what's in the behind-the-scenes absolutely so you know basically users are interacting with the web UI deployed an app engine now that app engine layer sits on top of dialogue flow and dialogue flow is where all of the user questions are are built-in now dialogue flow integrates to a couple of applications it integrates to bigquery in this case bigquery is where all of our data is stored all the information around account details and invoices and then the actual documents themselves they're stored in cloud storage and what that does is basically allows us to email those documents back to the user after big asked questions okay so are you gonna show the example where we see the email coming up absolutely let's take a look say I wanted to find my latest invoices should ask for a company name so we're at Cellmark and as you can see the chaplet responds with the three latest unpaid invoices so the invoice numbers the due date as well as the amounts and then if you go to your email you can see that those just arrived you can take a look at the copies that is perfect can we also look at dialogue flow interface and some of the intents that were created in there yes absolutely it's as you can see each of these items here are different intents so in that latest invoices example if you click on it [Music] so we fed in some different training phrases so those are different ways that a user can ask the particular question you know recent invoice latest unpaid invoices and as I mentioned before the cool thing about dialogue flow is that it has the AML Nai capability to learn over time so if you ask something similar it should know that that's you know latest invoices is one factor you're asking for well awesome that was great thank you so much for giving us all that information starting from how you started to design the BOD up to the point where how you created these integrations with Babbitt bigquery as well as with GCS thanks through for walking us through that amazing demo we welcome well I hope you enjoyed the tips and tricks shared by Dhruv today to bring your conversationally I use case to life we cannot wait to hear more about your specific use case in the comments below if you liked this video and would like to see more such content don't forget to Like and subscribe to our Channel [Music]
