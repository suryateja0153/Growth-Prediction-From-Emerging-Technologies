 Really good Conversational AI solutions require three things: one, you've got to have deep technical capabilities. You've got to have a team that's done lots of projects across lots of industries and they've built up all of the experience, the battle scars and have all of the tools and accelerators at their hands to be able to deliver good technical projects, but that's really only a part of it; another part of great Conversational AI solutions is the customer experience side of it and it's a very different kind of design than traditional IT projects you've got to have experience in voice interfaces, in chat and messaging and building solutions for clients that they can now engage in a very different way with their customers than they have in the past; then the third is great relationships with the companies that have the technologies that make all this possible. We've got very deep relationships with Google, with AWS and Amazon, with Microsoft, with IBM, with a lot of point solution companies and verticals that bring the technology capabilities that we can make part of the solution.
