 [Music] thank you for oh my god I can't even see at the back there's so many people thank you for so many people attending especially on a Sunday evening it's exciting and I hope you all had enough tea coffee and I'll try and do my best so we don't sleep so that's why I go for today all right all right so topic for today is conversational ai which is the new user experience or the new user interface and we're going to see how conversationally is becoming the new user interface how many of you all here have heard about conversationally AI or have been introduced in some way shape or form okay it seems about 50% and for those of you who have not we're going you're at least going to learn and get a flavor of it today and I hope you start to think about conversational AI in some of your projects and businesses so with that just a little introduction about me I'm Priyanka or Gary I'm a developer advocate at Google for those who don't know what developer advocates do I call myself a happy path engineer I build scenarios and demos and sample code so communities like these can utilize them how how we internally build tools and then we create create samples so that it can be utilized by by external communities and then I also do things like this where I interact with communities to learn more from how you're utilizing our products and then take that feedback back to our product teams so we can improvise and improve our based on the feedback that we get from the communities so that's my role in short and I can be found on the internet if you have any questions later if you don't get a chance to ask if you're too shy to ask you can always reach me on the internet at P Virg area and most of my blogs Twitter and github all the code that you're going to see today can also be accessed if you search me through P work area in any of those channels with that okay we're going to start with conversational a bit of a history conversation area is actually not very new we've been introduced to it the first conversational experience actually started to exist around 1950s which is when when it was built the first experience by some research scientists they were able to identify or recognize 16 words 1 6 and then Carnegie Mellon University did some more research and they were able to get to about recognition of about thousand words and since then we didn't call it conversational AI then obviously it was just recognizing words or recognizing human language but over time we've been utilizing conversationally I in a lot of different places and one of those is IVRS or interactive voice response solutions most of us have have gone through that experience when you call into maybe an airline's or your bank and you try to know your account balance or moving a flight and and you get that automated system that's what an IVR is so we have been familiar with conversational experiences it's just not been in those terms but most of those experiences lead us here right we've all been on a phone call where it's like can I just get to the agent I don't want to speak with you can I just talk to a human being and what do you think is the reason for that most important reason for that is you are talking to a machine that's based off of flowcharts so when I say I want to get some coffee to say this phone system and this phone system responds back or would you like milk in your coffee and I respond back saying sure right but it was expecting a yes or a No so when I felt sure it had no idea what to do it broke right there so that is what usually happens it's just a very simple example but when you're talking to a bank and you can relate to all all the experiences that you you've had on the phone in the IVR systems and the main reason there is it's not based on natural language understanding it's based on flowcharts if the user says this do this if they say that do that and if they say anything in the middle it has no idea what to do and we get this experience which is quite frustrating so the idea here is my goal for today are in around twenty five to thirty minutes is to kind of take you through the journey of what conversational experience is why it's becoming very important and mainstream and why we should start thinking about it this side I'm not gonna go through it all but I wanted it to be here because the previous one which leads to a very frustrating experience there are lots of reasons for why a conversational experience can be frustrating one we just talked about which is very rigid flowcharts or a scripted flow and some of the others could be you're not telling the user that they are talking to a bot you're you're misleading them and telling them that you're basically just keeping that information away from them so they are expecting human-like interaction which is not going to lead into a better experience and the others could be you know a bad use case where it cannot be solved through voice or conversation you should actually have a human being there so just utilizing they're just taking the right use case and applying conversational experience to it is and there are some more which we are going to see in the later part of the presentation so not spending more time on it now why is a conversation III is obviously becoming the new user interface and there there are multiple reasons for it the biggest reason is Internet of Things the number of devices that we interact with today has increased so much that it's going to be nearly impossible for us to to interact with our apps or in with with our eyes and hands right now think about your small coffee makers or the lights and the fans and the rooms that are smart and when you get into a car in the morning and you're doing all these things you know like take me to you want just the directions just to start without looking at the at the phone take me to my work or take me to office or take me through the way there has less traffic so when we when we think about these these newer newer devices we it's nearly going to be impossible to interact with them through through other ways so Weiss is going to be a main channel and we are already starting to see that so as these devices grow conversation is is one of those ways where there people are going to resort to to get their work done faster there are these are some studies and researchers that have been done that prove that there are people actually want to get self served if you provide a good user experience from the conversational perspective then then 80% of them of the of the customer experience can actually be served by a well-designed bot or or a conversational experience so spending resources energy and time in learning what those use cases would be is is really a good way to start so think about that and then there are lots the I mentioned a few use cases that are common which is customer service I want to return my shoes you usually don't have time between nine and five to call into a into a retail or an e-commerce store to return your shoes because you think about that type of stuff after five right when when you're not at work and and if the if the customer experience there can be turned into voice without an agent you would actually enjoy that you would actually want that so those those types of use cases where you're purchasing things returning things trying to get some support on a on a product that you've already purchased so ecommerce has a lot of those use cases in general if you're a software company another company then you also look at you you look at the product support in in a conversational experience manner so that's one and then the second is the example that I gave around the devices that use a washing machine in the house a refrigerator how do you switch them on and off with with wise other scenario could be a home entertainment system Auto when you want to navigate somewhere when you want to play Spotify or other things and it needs to be hands-free so those are that we can think about these first two very easily the third one is actually a very interesting one because the companies are starting to think about utilizing conversational experiences in their businesses to increase efficiency of the employees I'll give you an example here when you when you want to look at how many days of vacation you have left in a year I'm pretty sure you go through a bunch of clicks and then you look through a bunch of documents to figure out oh I may have like five days left and you spend 15 minutes to actually do that now if there was the conversational experience can actually take all of those knowledgebase articles and and search through those articles it can authenticate you as a user because you could be a part-time employee a full-time employee a contractor and in the number of days that you can take as vacation differs depending on who you are and how you've how and in what your position is in the company and how long you've worked in all of those things but but the well-designed conversational experience can authenticate you can identify how all those parameters like how long you've been in the company and based on that you get 25 days and out of that you've used 10 and now you have 15 left so do theirs there's a lot that has happened there but that is what that's what conversation experience experience can can do and companies are starting to think about that another you another use case as an example could also be you have customer support agents that need to use some knowledgebase articles and these knowledgebase articles are not in all at one place so increasing their efficiency would be combining the the search base for the those knowledgebase articles and then for the agent itself they can just search for what they want to get an answer for and then respond back to the to the user so you just made them a little bit more efficient by utilizing a conversational experience so think about it in those mines the first two are is easier to think and start with and as you start to think more about it you're you can see or think about connecting businesses and employees and that as an efficiency factor by now there's this is purposefully somewhere in the middle as a slide by now you might have already understood what a conversational experience is anything that is not based off of flowcharts anything that is based off of natural language understanding is what a conversational experience is is usually defined as and you you there are lots of different terms that there are around voice BOTS chat BOTS conversational UX and UI all of that kind of falls under the same umbrella which is anything that's powered by natural language understanding and what is natural language understanding so I know 50% of you all had raised your hands so maybe to basic but for those who did not I'll just still go through this for a second natural language understanding is nothing but a translator that's translating a human language into binary and then for the computer to understand and then binary from the computer to to convert to the human language I've oversimplified it but that's pretty much what what natural language understanding is and there's lots of other terms that you're going to come across which is natural language processing and natural language understanding natural anguish understanding is a subset of natural language processing where smart stuff that humans can do we can paraphrase we can spell correct we can understand Spelling's we can understand accents all the smart things that we can do we can brief or summarize something big that we've read all of that comes under natural language understanding so once you've trained those models then you can start you like them and you'd use the tools to do that it's working the the other terms that you you learn you come across our ASR which is automatic speech recognition so what and it kind of goes in full circle so you'll first understand what the users saying which happens through ASR which is automatic speech recognition I said something your machine has to understand it which is the SR now it converts from speech that I have said to text so that it can apply all those models and then from text it converts it back to speech and saves it to the user so you're going to come across some all of these terms in some way shape or form when you're working with conversational experiences that's why I have them there don't necessarily have to know them fully but just being aware of them is important and and all these terms kind of apply to both both wise as well as text so if somebody is speaking versus typing something both the natural language understanding technology applies to both ways in text with that background I think this it's also important to understand that touch language understanding processing ASR all of it kind of falls it's not under just one umbrella which is AI or ml or deep learning it you kind of need a large amount of data to apply machine learning on it and then you need to have it have the neural networks learn have the model learn so deep learning would on its own so deep learning is also part of it and AI is also part of it so it doesn't quite those terms don't quite just fall into one thing I just like to explain because I do get this question a lot it's kind of good to just get that mapping out of the way now there's there VAV of all I'm pretty sure come across very bad conversational experiences where it only does one thing and that - not very well so it's very important to understand whatever we pick in a conversational experience to build is we go in with with a good understanding of what those what is a factor that builds a good conversational experience now there are three there are three factors one is intent which is whenever a user is asking your experience for something it is an intent so when I said and there are many ways for a user to ask for the same thing when I ask for coffee depending on where I am and what day it is and how bad mood bad mood I'm in and what I am feeling I can ask for coffee in multiple ways if I'm happy I would maybe say oh give me some coffee if I'm sad I could be like oh coffee would be great right now right then that's just me asking for coffee in multiple ways but if we go across this room I think we've got about 300 people we can probably come up with about 3000 ways in which people can ask for coffee and when you when you think about that the that intent of getting coffee can be asked in 3,000 ways and when you so you need to apply machine learning on all those samples to to understand that 3000 one person who's going to ask for coffee right and that is not that's not very easy so that's one challenge that you need to think about when it comes to when it comes to users intent and understanding it the second challenge is entities there are lots of there are things that you'd have to extract from what the users trying to ask so in the end our intent for did you get I would like to get some coffee coffee is is one of the variables if I said I would like to get some coffee with two dreamers and in one sugar right then two creamers one sugar and coffee all those three pieces are required in order to actually create coffee right so those three pieces become my entities or parameters that I need to extract in order to service the users intent and some other examples could be I'm setting up an appointment for 2:00 p.m. tomorrow 2:00 p.m. and tomorrow are critical pieces of information to set that a point so you need to grab those now it's easy to think about samples like this where dates and times and numbers and currencies are very common so but you still have to build models for for those for those entities because dates can be set in multiple ways it can be tomorrow it could be the date format it could be the year first and ten days later if they're if they're typing it so there are different ways in which you would have to have your model understand the dates as well so you have to need all those examples so again machine learning would apply and that's they're the entities is another challenge the third is context you and I can talk to each other and understand each other because we can we can assume I can assume that what I said two seconds ago is is retained in somewhere in your brain somewhere in context right we humans interact with each other very well because we can retain context if we if we expect a similar level of service from a machine then we need to make sure that the machine can retain context there's an example on the screen there but you can also assume another example how's the weather like in Chennai today right and there and the experience responds back with whatever it is cloudy sunny and then and then you want to know the weather for another city and you say oh how about New Delhi and it still needs to retain in this case its release needs to retain the context that we're talking about weather and we're talking about today but only the the place has changed so saving that is also challenging saving the context and and how to utilize it over time in a conversation is challenging so you need to use the right tools all all the three things that I mentioned are are pretty critical there are some others that are the fourth one here which is you are not just going to provide this experience for one one interface it's not going to be always on the phone it can be over text it can be on your website it can be through a smart speaker so you need to make sure all those integrations to whatever you're building as the conversational experience are built and then and then we talked about the intent the machine learning the natural language processing and the list keeps growing say today you're only building four for the region in India but tomorrow you want to expand in Europe and in that case you would have to now start to think about machine learning for the language where you're going to deploy next or go global so all of that combined together is not very easy so you need to use the right tools and then towards the towards the further right which is the fulfillment piece you can have the best possible natural language understanding on the front end to understand what the users saying but if you can't really have a proper connection a proper API request and a response mechanism to to feed the required response back to first get the response and then feed it back to the user then all the front-end work that you've done with with amazing natural language processing goes goes waste because the the backend cannot set an appointment or the back in cannot make that coffee that we were talking about so it's very important to to make sure that CRM systems the databases that you're connecting to have the proper API is they have the proper authentication mechanisms so that your front-end chat experience or conversational experience is can serve that request with that the all the red boxes that you were seeing without knowing much about machine learning you can use the tool called dialogue flow in order to in order to create a conversational experience and it will create the intense for you you'll just give a few examples and I'll show you this in a demo you'll just create a few examples and it will auto train a machine learning model for you with just those examples and and same for like if you need to some of the advantages around languages it supports 20-plus languages if you're going global you don't have to think about you know expanding in in some of those other languages and then it utilizes text-to-speech and speech-to-text and natural language processing api is underlined so it's which is which is built on on google's research and database database of large amount of data where where we've trained the machine learning model for natural language processing and what's happening is when you provide the examples that for your business then the model trains with those subsets of examples along with that underlying natural language processing API that is already pre-built so it's very it makes makes your makes the conversational experience come to life faster because you're not training the machine learning models for normal natural language you're training it for your specific use case which is much much better and easier so I'm going to switch to the demo so you can see the stuff that I'm talking about so what I've done is have built a very simple conversational experience in Django Python I'll show you the architecture in just a little bit but let's see what it does and this we're using a very bad internet connection so we'll see how this goes it in any conversation experience you want to make sure that you tell the user what what this experience actually does if you keep it open-ended it it leads into situations where they don't know what to ask and what your experience can do and then they're going to ask things that you can't support and you obviously have to handle them as well in a very graceful way but it's always good to tell them what your what your experience does in my case since it's a demo I'm doing two things which is setting up appointments and exploring landmarks there are two very random examples because I wanted to show you two very random things set an appointment for 2 p.m. tomorrow for and it should ideally go back and set an appointment in my calendar okay so when you come into the calendar you see the appointment popping up so what's happening here is actually let's hold that let's hold what's happening let's try the other one as well which is exploring landmark so what I'm gonna do here is I'm going to provide it a demo JPEG image which is because it's very hard to see in my in my window there let me open that demo image here so you can see it is the image of Golden Gate Bridge so when we submit that image the experience is supposed to take that image and then tell you what's in that image so there's a machine learning model on on in the conversational experience that's being triggered which is looking for what's in the image and it's specifically looking for hopefully it comes up and it's specifically looking for landmarks in the image and in this case it is supposed to come back and tell us that there's Golden Gate Bridge in there and okay something yeah all right so we got it it I'm not doing any parsing here I'm just looking for labels and I'm just displaying that here but it gives you an idea of what's happening so this is what the what's actually happening behind the scenes and so we had a we had the dialog flow interface which was which is written in Django Python and you could you could write it in any language you like and you could connect it to and I'm basically triggering whenever the users saying set appointment or uploading a file I'm triggering detect intent API in dialogue flow and dialogue flow basically has intense which I'm going to show you in just a second cool so is saying that there's a detect intent API that gets triggered which understand what the user said they were trying to set an appointment in the case when I said set an appointment for whatever whatever ad whatever time and then it takes that request parses the entities day time and the appointment type and then sends it to the calendar API the Google Calendar API gets triggered it I have authentication for that in the in there and then it responds back saying that it was able to set the appointment or it couldn't find that time and tell me another time and I'll set it then the other thing that's happening is when you upload the image another intent is detected which is uploaded a file and I want to apply machine learning on it once that intent is is selected the file actually I'm uploading it from the front end to cloud storage so the front end doesn't get very cumbersome and then I'm grabbing the file of the vision API grabs the file I trigger now dialog flow triggers the vision API grabs the file from cloud storage and then applies the vision API on it and then tells you what's in that what's in that image so I'll switch back to dialog flow because that's the most interesting piece and I have about two minutes but I'm gonna take maybe one more minute extra because of the intent matching here's how the interface looks like when you log into dialogue flow to get to dialogue flow its console dialog flow comm and then once you get there you create an account which is obviously free and then you create what is called an agent and inside an agent you have intent entities and fulfillment which are the three main things the intent in this case was scheduled appointments in the demo and I have some examples in there so as soon as you type this example you you get the highlighted versions of your entities that you've created 2:00 p.m. and end the day and day and and the time our system entities because they are things that can be yeah so days and time our system entities because you don't have to create dates and time entities because we've already created them because you have to apply machine learning language processing on those as well so to make it easier you don't have to create any of those they're already in there because everybody needs to H times currencies and countries and addresses and things like that which are common what you what you would have to create custom is that appointment type and we'll just keep rolling its that appointment type which is for whatever business you are if you are a pizza shop toppings would be your custom entity in this case we were doing a driver's license thing so driver's license appointment type is is a custom entity so that that's how there's a developer entity or a custom entity and then there's a default system entities you make them required and in the example you weren't able to see it but initially I was trying to show you when I said set an appointment then it understood that I'm trying to set an appointment and then it would ask me for the dates and the time that I didn't the parameters that I didn't provide so that what that is what makes it a very natural experience and if I'm a if I'm somebody who says everything at the same time in the second example when I typed I I did it all at the same time and I said set an appointment for 4 p.m. tomorrow for driver's license it knew that I gave it all the three pieces of information in one shot it didn't ask me for anything else but if I only get I said 4 p.m. tomorrow I would like to set an appointment ok then it would still know that I've given it two pieces of information and I need and I need to ask for that third piece as well it keeps the conversational very very natural and that that's what that's what the beauty of that is you access those variables with a dollar sign so whatever the user had said you can't see it here but the appointment type has a dollar sign so whatever that parameter or entity was you use it with a dollar sign to access it anywhere in your this is the way you define your entities in vendor custom and the parameters you can tell the user if they have not given you some information fulfillment is the most important piece you can create now this is where you write a little bit of code to connect to your back-end in my case I was connecting to to the calendar API and to the vision API whatever it is that you're use cases you're connecting to a database you're connecting to a CRM system to Salesforce ticketing anything that that you want to connect to you'll connect to the api's from the web hook the web hook there are two ways to do it you can you can have your own web book that accepts post requests or you could also use something that that's inbuilt which is cloud functions and cloud functions gives you a template of code already where you can just pop in whatever the whatever the function is in my case it was set appointments and applying machine applying vision API on it so I created two functions and I just did whatever I needed to do in those two functions and it takes care of the rest so I don't have to worry about where it's deployed and in any of that because it's happening it's a server less function when you I know you've learned a lot about serverless today we don't have to talk about that integrations so again this is the most important part as well where you you're not just building this experience for one thing right you want to enable it for all the different channels where the users are so you build it once and then you just click through these one-click buttons for integrating with say Twitter or or Facebook Messenger or you want an action on Google assistant you can also connect it with with Twilio or you can download the agent and upload it into Amazon as well and make it an enabled for Alexa or Microsoft Cortana so you just you just build it once and you deploy it anywhere you need it with one-click button there are lots of other things you can connect it to phone you can connect it to knowledge bases I gave an example earlier where you can provide a fake use in HTML or text format and then it will it will create a chat experience for the fa Q's so people can just ask instead of reading through your FAQ documents which is pretty cool you can spell you have built-in sentiments in there so you can understand and trigger a human being or a human agent based off of the sentiment that you're getting in real time so in here so you get a sentiment score and say you got a really bad score during the conversation you can trigger a user off of this off of that trigger a real agent based off of that score which is also very cool and then there's built-in text-to-speech as well so all of that there's there's there's obviously a lot more that I can't cover in in the time that we have so I'll leave you with some resources but the very last thing I want to cover is don't just jump in I know it's very easy to to get started with building a conversational experience so people just we as developers just want to build something and it's and I think in conversational experience it's very important to to lay that groundwork to understand what you're building why you're building and how you're going to get there so these steps I think are very very important and crucial to understand what identify those top journeys that actually make sense to to convert to a conversational user experience and then once you've identified them build a business plan and agile I don't mean like a full-blown business plan what I mean here is understand what it would entail understand what those back-end systems would be and just and then design a persona is your part going to be geeky you're funny and how is it going to sound because all of that is going to matter and then you start to think about actually building something so with that I would like to wrap it up that's me again Pia Vergara is how you can find me on the Internet all the demo and the code and everything that you saw today can be found on my medium blogs and on Twitter you can also follow my my deconstructing chat bot series which is on Google Cloud YouTube channel where I go from 101 if you don't know anything about conversational experiences - at the building and understanding concepts out of 301 401 level so I'll feel free to check that out if you are looking to do something very specific and have questions I'm always available to answer them as well if you reach out to me or LinkedIn or any other social media channels thank you so much for being here [Music]
