 [Music] hello and good afternoon welcome to another episode of dawn cast i'm daley and i'm kathy no now job interviews can be intimidating and a lot of time and human resources goes into the screening and hiring of candidates but what if we look but what if it took the human out of this question curious thing co-founder zam sam zheng might just have the answer welcome sam welcome thank you thank you for having me yeah so first of all congratulations on creating this and leading a team of disruptors with curious thing um tell us what is it and what does it do there's a bit of technical problem first of all let me call not taking human we are not can you can hear me yes there's a bit of a technical we are not taking yeah maybe it's an internet speed um shall we start again or i don't know no that's fine just continue got it got it got it so yeah um so first of all let me clarify we are not taking human part out of the equation we are basically um you know letting people refocus on the more important step of the whole process because for lots of people they think recruitment as one interview they make a decision but the reality is on average people do four to six runs so uh we are just doing the first round uh using ai to do the short listing um to go back to your question what is curious thing we are basically a phone call based conversational ai for first round of interview um and the problem we are solving is because now when you think about shortlisting you receive 1000 applications maybe you spend five to seven seconds per cv then you make a short listing decision um from 1 000 to 100 or 1000 to 50. we are trying to give candidates the opportunity to interview 100 um you know business is an opportunity to interview 100 of the candidates um so they can make more data driven um you know recruitment or short listing decision so that's that's the problem we are solely we actually want to help people we are not replacing people so how does it work so uh if can you take us through the process of how it works yeah let me actually show you um so you know how does it work very quickly let's assume i apply for job um and then i receive the email saying hey please call this number for the interview um then is it straight away that you would get that um response yes uh through an email with the ping so this is my mobile phone welcome to interview hosted by curious to help me locate your interview please enter your pin followed by the hash key now i just need to insert my ping thank you your code is one one one one please wait while i check your code your interview role as engineer at curious thing i will pass you to our ai interviewer now please wait a second welcome to the ai interview for a curious thing my name is christine thanks for joining me today we will go through a short interview with a mix the technical and behavioral i'll stop here so essentially after the intro i can do the conversation with ai just like you know i do the full interview with another human the strength of ai is ai doesn't flip ai can handle thousands of phone calls you know overnight um and importantly it scales with consistency so that's why we are developing this to help with the shortlisting process which is the first round of interview okay i've been a recruiter in the past and oh my god every time i would advertise a role get thousands of applications and i feel really bad for each applicant if i don't get back to them within a few days because they get really frustrated it can be a poor candidate experience so i can see that there is this need here so why did you start this business were you in recruitment or hr in the past like what was the kind of moment where you were like i need to start this um i wasn't a recruiter at all actually um this is the kind of a unique part of curious things so maybe i'll quickly introduce myself so i'm a serial entrepreneur this is my second startup uh previously i was cto co-founder of another ai startup called hyphena the company is still there i'm still shareholder i'm just no longer involved so a few things triggered the start of this company which was we want to essentially use a new technology called knowledge graph to build a paradigm of the new technology that can do you know basically ai questioning so unlike most of the conversational ai what we want to do is put ar in the driver's seat and ask a question to human to collect information and with purposes so we thought we were building some computational curiosity that's why we call ourselves curiously the kind of like application layer with the which is the ai job interview was actually um you know only we only started this like few months after we were building the api layer which is the ai asking question um you know with purposes part so that's two separate thing when we started we didn't really think of the recruitment the reason why we were doing the recruitment conversational ais because what we have found because my previous company will also do conversational ai including my co-founders previous company people usually don't take ai very serious and only for certain use cases like job interview people will actually also question um you know basically seriously because you have something at stake what was the purpose of having an ai asking a question so what was the idea behind that why it was so important that the ai asked the questions that's a great question let me share with you um you know today most of the conversational ai you know framework they are designed uh with a task fulfillment paradigm uh if you think about say how you work with siri or you know alexa it usually handles things like what's a weather today uh autumn and pizza or plain beetles right it's like human drive the conversation while ai just fulfilled the task which is great you know we're not against that at all but for some other situation or some other conversations you might want ai to be your driver of the conversation um the purpose is to collect information in a very consistent way so you can do benchmarking or just basically just to tap into um you know our like knowledge as human beings um so that we can discover some insights or you know automate a certain part of the decisions um because you know if you ask human to do that there are two issues firstly as human beings i can only make 10 phone calls per day right i can't make 1000 it's impossible the second thing is you know if i make that phone call in the morning or in the afternoon they are not going to be consistent because maybe i didn't really have a great lunch you know i'm so in the afternoon i might feel not as good as you know a phone call in the morning so us as human beings we can do deep and you know very very um complex decision but also it's subject to non-linear biases we've got emotions gets in the way exactly and if we haven't had our coffee we get cranky no cigarette we're kind of you know that person picks up the phone and we're not thinking hang on we don't like the sound of that voice that's it and also bias right if we hear maybe an accent or whatever it is there is that that risk as well um so you're saying that the the confident conversational ai will not have those biases like accent you can benchmark because it's asking the same questions right for that particular job is that right and then you can just so absolutely our ai will ask um you know similar questions not exactly the same question because based on people's answer the ai might ask different follow-up questions um just to make sure that you know as candidate they do understand what they are talking about say oh you know for this particular topic can you share with me more etc etc but they are very consistent um you know one key thing we we share with our client and we also have possible feedback on that is our ai only analyzed what people have said instead of how they say it um you know so essentially can basically open up your pipeline right and so your data not just from those people you you would usually hire but from everyone um so one of our clients from new zealand they actually shared with us using us as the first step of the interview they actually have lots of diversity in terms like people going to towards the second round or the third round so which we are super super proud of so i read somewhere that you're a self-taught uh engineer um in addition to being a serial entrepreneur what how do you how did you teach yourself engineering or is that actually true or i read something it is true um so i'll share with you guys something funny because um you know in engineering field if people are saying i'm self-taught engineer people think you are really good but what i realize is when i tell work with my client i'm like oh it's a self-taught engineer does it mean you are not as good as a normal engineer that's why i stopped telling people i'm a softball engineer my training my training background is uh actuarial i was trained as actuary i was spending years building a stats model for insurance companies uh you know modeling earthquake bushfire then i went to consultancy then i started my first startup so um you know i i kind of learned lots of coding myself and i love it um you know but it's not like i come from a totally different background because as an actuary or statistician you also need to do coding but it's just a different different types of coding now you said that you're a serial entrepreneur and you started the hyper ana startup what is hyper anna what does it do and how different is that to curious thing and why is anna and why is i anna hyper oh okay sorry yeah i can't really uh you know represent uh hyper and a lot because i'm no longer a director there so hyper and i in uh you know long story short it's artificial intelligence for uh for data scientists like you know it's basically ai for bi business intelligence so i was a cto co-founder there so i was basically the person filled up the staff in the beginning um yeah so yeah that's pretty much what hyperprenatal does yeah so so both are still basically in ai artificial intelligence using artificial intelligence to obviously uh with your actuary background it's about benchmarking getting the numbers and and you know having statistics yeah probabilities and statistics and graph isn't it yeah yeah absolutely actually the two companies they are in two very different sub-fields of artificial intelligence because it's a very very big uh field and um you know at curious thing we do more conversational ai we are more focusing on natural language processing which is one of the very important um you know sector within our artificial intelligence as a big industry now the biggest you you the the recent news is that you are creating this platform for the department of foreign affairs um the using they're using your platform is that right sorry cam please repeat your question i said that the the the news the news recently was that you are doing something with the department um a government agency in terms of using your platform got it got it uh yeah you're referring to the austrade article sorry so yes yes so um yeah i think the article is mainly uh about two things firstly we are expanding in the u.s actually we have started our expansion i don't know since january february um so we have a one team member there based in san francisco so uh another thing in the article um you know it particularly mentioned is because you know we want a tender we are selected for um you know part of the it's called recruitment reimagined um you know for the us air force so it's like you know they are trying to i would say re-engineer the whole recruitment process and we are selected as one of the software that is going to be part of the kind of like a new recruitment process so um that's that's a very huge news for us i think we are the only international software provider and mostly other companies are huge yeah we are very very proud i was gonna say you must have been excited with the news uh yes i was excited for i would say a few minutes then i went back to my day-to-day busy work so getting back to the grind yeah so here at dawn we're we're very much about shining a light on a lot of um culturally diverse voices as well in addition to you know diverse voices um has your cultural upbringing have to do much with uh what you're doing now like is it um would you say it has contribute to your drive and your tenacity and your desire to do all these entrepreneurial projects what do you think um the very honest answer is i don't think so i'm sorry for saying this because um you know i think why i'm building a style a lot of people like you know doing startups for all different reasons right the reason why i do startups is because i want to be able to reduce that value to people so that's a part you just dropped out so can you repeat what you said that that the initial you're saying that the reason why you build startup uh yes okay i'll repeat that again so yeah i think people are building startups for all different reasons right um you know um for me the reason why you know i i really love you know doing a startup building a company from scratch is because i really love building product um you know building a product that is so good uh people use it and people actually gain lots of value off of that because that's my that's my drive and that's my passion um yeah because i think that's that's a key that's a key thing not necessarily you know the the other part my primary drive is actually building an awesome product which if i think back regarding culture i don't think it's relevant a lot but maybe when i was like being a kind of a statistic statistician when i was like doing model uh lots of way of thinking what built there which is like you know very earlier uh stage of my career um i see how a well-defined process and a kind of like smart and intelligent decisions can really add value to businesses yeah on along that journey to build products there must have been some very dark moments moments where you think i don't know if i'm gonna you know make this happen or challenge or challenges what were some of those moments um to start with um i think our hypothesis because at curiously we have three co-founders myself david and han we are all from tech background however you know we are very different in terms like cultural background age and i think when we started there's one thing we sit down you know i discussed and that really kind of like was driving the whole journey of curious thing which is uh the fact that we believe in iteration um which essentially works in this way it's more like everything we have as opinion is hypothesis and um you know if it's a hypothesis it doesn't mean that we shouldn't take action it only means that we take as a hypothesis when we go out and do our kind of like initial testing it's literally a testing then we revisit hypothesis the reason why i mentioned this is because lots of like dark moments are actually due to the fact that from time to time we can't accept uncertainties especially when the uncertainty is becoming something that is um you know kind of like a negative outcome however for us we accept these kind of uncertainties in the beginning so in general i would say emotion wise we are not like very extreme we are relatively stable as founders um yeah because you're talking about you seeing those dark moments as hypothesis is that right is that what you're saying that basically you're you're so therefore you having the because it's a hypothesis you have if it's fail then you come back with another hypothesis and you iterate is that exactly exactly um as a company we don't really like of course great ideas are awesome but we don't think great ideas they are the foundation of a good business or product we believe great iteration is the foundation of building a very very innovative product so all of this is translated into how we see the world how we see uncertainties and how do we build stuff what are some of the major highlights that you've experienced so far in studying curious things um i think the major highlight let me think i think firstly it's my team i'm super super proud of my team um you know um i think like if if someone asked me it's like you know what's the what's the number one thing you are most proud of i would say it's my team um because we started with three people now we are 14 still a super super small team but we have three locations we have sydney uh brisbane and also san francisco however we can [Music] really really usually say that we have one very very good team culture and the team culture is not just what founders kept talking about is actually what we practice every day which i'm very very proud of and i started to realize this bit like the team culture you know being a very good highlight of my journey was the first year anniversary of this company which was july last year and when the whole team sit down we talked about hey what we like about our company and what we don't like about companies so we can improve actually we you know people were discussing smaller groups however what we come up with is something super similar then we converted that into team culture um you know statements so um yeah i think that's the moment i'm very proud of so there are two things out of that first did you use your curious thing ai to select your candidates two how do you define a good team culture to answer your first question yes we do in fact our ai is designed for more junior high volume roles however for us because you know in software companies uh people say you have to eat your own dog food um so yeah we do we do eat our dog food we have to if you are in sales you have to give a try and see if you like this product if you don't like it how are you gonna sell it if you are into technology you need to give and see um if you want to be part of the team building right um to answer your second question which is um how do i define a good team culture i would say um you know good team culture firstly um it should be unique um the reason why i say this is because you know if we say our team culture is being ethical then you need to ask yourself well which company's team culture is not about being ethical right every company needs to be ethical if your team culture is about doing high quality work again it's too generic so what we have is firstly we over communicate which is you know if there is a certain thing you don't know whether you should ask or not just ask if there is a certain thing you don't know whether you should share or not just share um you know the second thing about you know what is i in my opinion a great team culture is it's actually gonna be um you know the multiplier so just think about like every individual as individual kind like contributors right and you sum them up as a team culture is actually the multiplier and it's actually the company's job to make sure that the multiplier is greater than one which could be 1.1 1.2 so overall you'll achieve something better but if your team culture is not as good then you have you can have lots of great individuals but the multiplier is 0.8 and 0.9 and importantly when your company grows team culture is the only thing that could scale because you know as company leaders when your company is 30 40 people it's very difficult for you to have one-on-one with them every day but you have to rely on others in the team to make sure that you know the team culture is expanding into their the new team members day-to-day work so yeah that's how we see this i think that's the best answer i've ever heard in my life i know it's just amazing oh because of the math formula right yeah yeah it's like yeah what is the formula can you give us the formula again it's just like that's true statistician but you know as i listen said i'm thinking well how do you the mo the multiplier how do you have that multiply effect in culture well then it's like if you've got a lot of good individuals then collectively it would okay i'm probably not explaining this probably multiply bit um actually now i'm not going to try to explain it again so do you know what i mean sam like how do you then uh have that multiplying multiply effect in culture let me let me give you a uh like a real life example right uh say in lots of like uh software companies um you know the the you know product or development team and the business team sometimes they are misalignment because from business side they they they don't fully know what product roadmap is they only know the high level at the same time they don't necessarily understand how long does it take to build a new feature and from that side they don't fully understand how difficult it is to close a deal right so then from time to time there might be tension there might however you know if you can really make the dev team and the business team as one team actually they will collaborate so good feedback will pass to the dev team in a much easier way at the same time the business side they will know from time to time a certain new feature is not going to be possible to deliver within one to two weeks and also you know your theft team will have better business knowledge because they see how business team is making decisions handling clients from time to time and when they are doing day-to-day work especially in terms of like a certain decision for certain features they could make a better business aware decision now if you think about it it's like it could be like two team members they work you know individually it's like one each but it's like one plus one times 1.1 so you get the extra productivity and also they grow faster so that's kind of how we see it right so do you think that kind of concept or formula he just given that's not just in software but do you believe that it can also be applied in any other section or any industry in other sectors if it's not just product but service do you think it can actually also work in in in industry that offers services rather than say selling services rather than just products absolutely um you know if you think about like say 2t members you know if they are super super collaborative then essentially say team member a they did a certain thing they shared their learning very quickly then team member b will actually solve that and the second time team member b does a certain thing she might be actually it's much easier for me because i know how to handle this already and also i'd rather spend extra half an hour on this task and make this part of playbook then team members see when he or she has to pick up this task it's almost automatic it's within the same team but if everyone is actually practicing really really good collaborative culture then essentially you know things can move fast in a very positive way so um yeah i i feel this is like i didn't invent this of course like i it's just in general i'm a big believer that team culture is a good multiplier okay well um so have you got a lot of business mentors or coaches along the way like i know you've got a lot of experience as a serial entrepreneur but um do you constantly have like someone on speed dial that you can just call straight away and say hey i'm not sure about this or do you have that um so my one of my co-founders david he was my mentor when i started the startup journey um you know but now if you ask me do i have like one person or two people i always you know ask for mentorship not necessarily because um you know but i ask advices from all different types of people i'll give you one example when i started the curious thing there was one big change for me which was i was a cto so i was a technology leader but now i also need to lead the business side and how do you build a sas software sales team how do you actually scale it how do you hire how do you bootstrap lots of questions i need to i need to kind of like uh also for myself of course i go talk to my investors ask for the right introductions i go talk to those business leaders i trust at the same time i try to find everyone in the industry that has got the right experience i try to ask them what they have learned so i would say you know this is kind of what i feel like the the mentorship or you know it shouldn't be coming from the other people's seniority because they don't necessarily know more than you do because they are more senior at the same time you really need to think about say i asked this person a question question whether this person is the right person to sh to kind of like listen from and learn from so i would say everyone could be your advisor or mentor just ask the right question and digest this yourself so that's kind of how i see it you know in my team members i also get advices from them i'll try to ask them hey i did these particular thing in this way what's your thought because you have done this more than i did right um you know i've got someone working for me they've done business a lot longer than i do um so i also ask them that's a great way to put it yeah so i mean often when we talk about setting up a business and people starting out you know we ask often who supports them like is it their business connection is it their family support like how important are those factors in helping you as a startup to grow and build and scale your business you know from family to business support that's a great question um so this is the the part i will start with the family part because um you know firstly i i really appreciate how much uh you know my family my wife has to sacrifice sacrifice um to kind of like i would say to allow me work you know say it's pretty much like 12 plus hours every day she doesn't see you six days per week yeah and it's it's not like really pleasant life if you think about it especially you know if your partner is you know kind of like working like that pretty much non-stop then there are a lot more you need to do so i think every startup founders if they decide to start a kind of like this journey uh firstly talk to talk to your family making sure that they are fine with it not just for a few weeks not just a few months but assuming he's gonna be like this forever um so yeah i think that's the that's the that's the first part you definitely definitely need to ask for forgiveness it's not just a support but ask for forgiveness because really you know if you make certain things successful people say oh well done they wouldn't say that to your wife or your husband right but they actually suffer the same thing with you um so the second thing in terms like in general what kind of like support you get from you know the business side or the ecosystem side i would definitely say you know no matter if you are doing a startup you are a founder you work for startup or you are investor or you just interested in this get involved in the ecosystem because in australia we have a relatively small ecosystem we are growing but we have a very small ecosystem um you know there are a lot you can contribute to um you know it could be you give a certain business devices about your particular industry it could be android investment it could be you know just be a customer there are lots and lots of ways you can contribute and all these contribution actually will help us grow not just curious thing but any startup in australia god every answer you give sam it's just like a gold book it's called listening for the gold you know on every single thing i'm gonna say i'm gonna say to my husband please forgive me but all these years i've been side hustling and the hours and the you know that you spent and actually also because you don't go for me you know i i haven't gone to a full-time job and she's about to leave one because you want you're so passionate about you want to build something i haven't resigned yet oh oh oh oh oh oh oh by the way i'm sure i'm sure you can cut this party yeah yeah yeah but by the time this goes to air she'll be going yeah maybe yeah that's right um it's that time that you spend out there as i call side hustling constantly um but thank you that's a really um a gold piece of advice and wisdom there sam it's amazing um thank you for that uh so so have you along that have you had many no's um and how do you deal with those no's and how do you convert them into a yes um i'll answer your last question first which is how do you convert noise to yes uh firstly not all the noise can be converted into yes if you if you try because everything is like about how do you prioritize your time right there are certain noise say for example you know you can't you can't sell you know it's very difficult to sell um ice cream in i don't know alaska right i assume it's difficult i don't know you know and if they say no just try to think or maybe it's wrong it's the wrong thing for me to try to sell ice cream here um you know i i know there are lots of books trying to founders every noise could be a yes the reality is it's not especially if you spend lots of effort converting a noise a difficult noise yes you lose also lose lots of other opportunities so don't try to do that try to think about it try to be analytical and um you know the first popular question regarding do i get lots of noise uh of course i do uh you know majority of my life is noi and to be honest um that's that's just what's expected um if you do not just if you are an entrepreneur or if you are a startup lots what do you do you do you know kind of like uh lead generation for company you got lots of noise that's just part of your jd like the the founders jd the number one thing is to be used to noise number two thing is like understanding what is the noise you should focus on and convert you know and try to convert them and what are the noise you should just let go so yeah yeah it's about resilience isn't it but but but but you're saying also to understand the market there's no point going into a market that will not have the need like if you go sell ice cream to alaska and they're not going to have ice cream why spend the energy in trying to sell into that market or trying to pitch into that market it's better to find a market or an audience that would you know would have would perhaps buy or or appeal to and then spend some of that energy there and you might get a yes you might get a no exactly i would say you know at least personally that's what i feel do not focus too much on the yes or no but focus on the reasoning behind it that's more valuable um you know people could say yes to you but you know they don't really see the value it could be other reason they say yes that's not going to be repeatable people could say no to you but it could be a certain thing you find useful because like i said i think you know especially building a startup everything is about iteration um you know the winner they can run iteration faster if out of 10 conversations regardless it's a yes or no you realize okay that's not the sector i'm gonna focus on that's the sector i'm gonna focus on that's something i want to test that's a really really good kind of like you know approach already then you keep iterating until you can systematically get lots of years but don't focus too much on whether people give you a yes or no focus on why either giving you a yes why they are giving you a lawyer and try to find the repeatable yes that's how at least from b2b perspectives we do b2b software right that's the kind of like the approach you should think about okay that's a really good point because i recently cancelled a subscription to a software and it asked me a series of questions why like is it because of budget and then they were really really detailed i just thought oh yeah it's just it's not about canceling a scription or not cancelling it's about okay understanding yeah understanding the context and the circumstances around that so you're right that's that's the insights that are really really powerful um i mentioned earlier sam that we're very much about diversity and inclusion so what's your views on that within the technology sector i think the technology sector has built a bit of a reputation so what's your thoughts um i would say definitely things can can be done better um um like okay so in technology sector um you know the the agenda you know kind of like you know you don't have enough female engineers sorry i'm trying to you know use the more appropriate word you don't have enough female engineers female data scientists using stats exactly um yeah even in statistics uh even in math right um you know i think i think this is like a you know a system level issue um because you know i i to be honest i don't know why but in the education in education you don't have enough pipeline say for example if say in high school people who pick like you know uh young girls and females they pick the advanced math the percentage compared to male is much lower yeah then you will have less female engineers because people who go to uni study engineering will be lower and then people who actually go to the engineering job you know you will have you know many many female good engineers but i think you know there are few things i i don't know the answer but i i i think i have your questions firstly you know why you know why we don't have enough females going to stem education uh you know science stats you know technology software you know is that because the way we select students is wrong i'm not saying it is but that's my hypothesis um you know should we how do we encourage more females going to this sector from education right yeah and as you mentioned sam is the pipeline and i think that if there is nothing in the pipeline then you won't have that at that end and i think the pipeline and you're touching upon that the hypothesis for me is that young young girls at uh in the home going to school um either basically the family background or perhaps even i mean were you interested in maths yeah i did advanced maths so did i but i didn't like it you know i i i did not like advice i did it because i had to yeah exactly that's it you did it because you had to i actually didn't mind yeah but i see what you mean it's it's a pipeline issue it starts from a very very young age and perhaps it could be a branding thing like it needs to be encouraged a lot more maybe more for for certain populations because of the stigma or branding issue whatever in the past um so i don't know maybe we could get kim kardashian or something to [Laughter] you know like i know my son loves maths my son loves loves maths um and it does very well in maths i'm i i would say i'm a very weak statistician numbers i liked maths because it had one answer and one answer only there's different ways of getting to the the answer much like problems there's different ways to solve a problem but i liked how it just had one answer and it was really black and white no it's the formula that drives me but as i think going back to what you're saying sam is the the pipeline and the hypotheses or looking at the how do we um create that uh pipeline and looking at how to engage more young women into stem the subjects like stem and from your perspective that's how perhaps you can then address the lack of women in technology um and and yeah yeah you know i i'm you know i'm not a like a policy maker but that's kind of how i see the problem so i really hope you know we have more female engineers and you know i highly encourage you know um if you are in high school or you you are in uni um try to consider something um you know that is more like technology if you interested don't don't fear the fact that you know you're female because to be honest i think having more females in the will will definitely bring more perspective because today technology is not just about you know coding it's not just about getting a certain answer out there are lots of you know a solution in part that would actually need different perspectives what's your advice for individuals and uh business owners especially those of migrant backgrounds um you know what's their what's your advice to them if they want to start up their own venture yeah that's a great question so um you know i was born in china i came to australia 16 or 17 years ago i did high school then uni um i would say i think the first thing is uh try not to label yourself um you know um because no matter what you do i think this is kind of what i believe right um the varieties coming from individuals today right you know people are so different actually between individuals the varieties they bring is much bigger than this you know kind of like cultural group uh brought to them like you know say cultural group is more like you know i say ah kind of like what food you like you know um but to be honest there are lots of different things actually within you which is like the bigger variety i don't know if i put that into the right way but that's kind of what i feel but if you try to label yourself then you can only you you're actually limiting yourself in terms like you're behaving a certain way um you know try to try to find your own kind of variety yeah yourself that is beyond your cultural group or whether you were born in australia or not born in australia um you know i i would say that's my number one advice um because if if you really kind of like you know recognize that um for yourself actually you will see that um you know you can finally ask yourself few things which is what's your true passion uh what you want to do with your life and are you able to kind of like do things for you yourself then in addition to that i would say just work hard and try to also maybe in certain cases use that as your kind like you know advantage say for example you can speak a second language maybe that's your that's your unique strength um yeah so yeah that would be my advice the difference is you that's our that's our hashtag for dawn the difference is you it's it's basically exactly exactly exactly so anything and you know i think if anyone try to summarize you belong to this group and for people in this group you should behave in a certain way um i personally i'm not a big fan of those type of labeling and advices i would say everyone is different um you know and you should work in the way that and thinking the way that that is unique for you um if you want to do a startup try to think who you are and what's your strength what's your weakness then try to basically utilize your strength and try to do something with your weakness maybe through partnering with others so yeah that would be my that will be my advice focus on yourself first great answer um where to now next for curious thing
