 Station de Monte you by Comcast hey welcome back here ready Jeff Rick here with the cube we're at the Comcast Silicon Valley Innovation Center here in Sunnyvale it's a very cool space I think it's growing up over a number of years as they originally I think with some acquired companies and now they got a huge set up here and we had a big day today talking about customer experience and and really you know if you look at the Comcast's voice room mode and there's a lot of stuff going on that's maybe under the coverage you don't really give Comcast credit for but they're actually doing a lot and we're excited to kind of dive into it a little bit deeper with our next guest she's Annie Weka sir she's the CMO of the unifor any welcome yeah thank you for having me here absolutely so what does unifor for people that are familiar the company so unifor is a global leader in conversational service automation and our vision is to bridge the gap between human and machine through voice AI and automation it's a mouthful yeah burst a tional service service yes so people talking so you guys are heavily involved in voice so what are the applications where people are using your voice yep well primarily our focus is call centers so large enterprises who have massive call centers where we want to go in and help them with AI on automation to help better listen to their customers help better listen to the customers voice and and solve the problems in a faster manner so I don't have to repeat my account number six different times to success foreign agents are cotton an IVR cycle or or perhaps the chat that you were talking to doesn't the person on the phone who picks it up you have to repeat your story right this is something where the AI and automation will actually assist the agent to become a superhero so it's pretty interesting because you know there's a lot of conversation about AI and ml but really you know where it's gonna have its its impact is applied AI yeah you said the company started out really more just on a pure voice but now you're applying more and more kind of AI in the backend so what you know what kind of opportunities do you have now beyond just simply being able to do voice you know conversion yep no well to the first part of your question the company started at IIT Madras back in 2008 and originally the focus of the company was really centered on voice voice being the lowest common DOM in an India in India where the languages are 260 you know potential languages to understand and maybe 25 at the top we set out really to to focus on voice and then realize that customer service was a large market and somewhere we could we could have a big impact right right so you recognize you said a hundred different languages a hundred different languages through our platform which is which is pretty incredible when you think about it all of the different people calling in to customer service potentially or maybe through a chatbot or a voice bot to get their issues right and then you integrate in with whatever the the core system is that the customer service agents are using yes so what are the types of tips and tricks that the call center agent gets by using your guys service yeah so think about it as a platform where the customer can can help their agents be more effective agents so one of the things that call centers struggle with is something called after call work where they may agents may spend two to three minutes after a call summarizing the call one of the things that our technology does and and this is primarily for one of our customers who's a healthcare client they said you know wouldn't it be great if we could automate that completely so we've taken the after call work for one customer client taken that two to three minutes down to 10 seconds where that work that the agent would have done is is completely summarized and the agent validates it can correct it if needed and it's completely done so that not only saves the agent time to either pick up more of calls and help help other customers or it can get them off the phone in a quicker manner to save the call center more money so that's doing more than just simply providing a transcript of the call we're just something a different track ring actually is listening in to provide suggestions it's actually taking it to the next level in terms of what categories I categorize in what type of call the outcomes etc it's it's actually quite interesting because oftentimes less than 1% of calls are listened to somewhere between 1 and 10 percent of calls are listened to in call centers so we can listen to a hundred percent of those calls in addition we offer something called it's more along the lines of like a live agent coach to where the agent can concentrate on the conversation with the customer which is the primary thing listening to the customer and our technology will serve you up coaching mechanisms in terms of getting to faster resolution for the customer and getting them better insights to be almost a superhero of an agent right and I would imagine the the accuracy in terms of recording what happened in the call to go back in and do the analytics and and and and you have a text-based search so you can do all types of analysis on those calls which was data that was probably just lost before right into these yeah the ether you're exactly right I mean I I think the accuracy is is clearly a lot lower than if you were to have the AI and automation and machine learning technology there so the other conversation in the the sit-down that we had earlier today was really about driving a customer-centric culture in your own company not only just enabling it by really building it inside I wonder if you could share some of the things that you guys have done to help make sure that everybody stays focused on the objective which is the customer yeah I I think it really starts at the top right it starts at the leader of the organization so we have a a CEO who's extremely focused on on customer centricity and in fact it's it's our number one core value within the organization so you see everyone from the CEO down to down to the rest of the organization completely focused on the customer and and their needs what about when the customer doesn't know what they need what about when you're you know you're bringing a new technology and you you're inviting a slightly different process or a slightly different change and you're saying hey this is actually a better way to keep texting transactions and we actually have a really cool coach that can help you know kind of guide the people how do you help you know move customers to a place that they don't necessarily know they want to go yeah I mean you find that a lot right it's not necessarily the technology that we're providing for today but it's having the innovation and having the the foresight to create a platform that that will be future proof so that's critical you know I think that there are a lot of customers who might not know that what they need today but that's our job to help them innovate and push the envelope on all things AI in automation right I'm just curious to in terms of the impact of your technology on kind of the tracking software for those call center agents right so this is a group of people that have to process a lot of calls you know everything is tracked to the minute and you know it's funny they had a demo with Westworld and you know when when West world's funny because we started treating machines like you're treating machines like machines and they wanted to treat be treated like people and sometimes I wonder on some of these technologies you know is it is it enabling them to have more time to be more thoughtful is it enabling them to have more time to get to better outcomes or does it sometimes perceived as oh my gosh you're just trying to jam you know four more calls in my hour by taking care of my two minutes that I used to spend wrapping up the the call do you think about the citizen customer the time is really the premium right so the number one focus is is giving people time back and whether that's the that's that the customer who's calling in and and you want to solve an issue and get them faster resolution or whether that's the agent that wants to free up more time in having the conversation with the customer solving their problem and then and then getting off the phone I think that's the most effective way of doing it just final question in terms of in terms of voice in the evolution of voice because I don't think people are really completely tuned in certainly not people hold like like we are what are some of the conversations when people finally get you know kind of the enabler that voice communications opens up that that's not necessarily available with text or not necessarily available with other types of channels yeah I mean I see it most easily in my children they expect everything to be voice enabled and so everything from the Comcast remote that they pick up in our living room they everywhere we go where they see a remote they expect everything to be voice enabled so I mean that's that's really the future and I think a lot of customer service will be listening to your customers voice however they want to communicate with you whatever channel they want to communicate on right really cool story Annie and and thanks for taking a few minutes and tell sharing it with us yeah thanks for inviting me all right geez Annie I'm Jeff you're watching the cube the Comcast CX experience innovation day here at the Silicon Valley Innovation Center thanks for watching we'll see you next time
