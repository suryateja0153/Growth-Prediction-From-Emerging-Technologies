 I saw this spot and had to stop. It's a little bit steep... Looks like water run trough it. It's probably filled with garbage... First target... I expect trash. The top of a can. Hmm... I have to walk like this to avoid the mud... That's a bad idea, I will try the right side. It rained the day before... That's a surprise - part of a buckle. GPS (POI) #1. I think, I should check if there is "more". But how... I could find another way, but I have to take this straight line. This seems to work. It's a small hill, I will be on top in a few seconds. This is iron. I'm using DISC value of "2", that's why it sounds "good". I just updated back from v3.1 to v5.2 (or something). All my settings disappeared, I need to adjust my "Iron" program. That's my "MD24 Iron" program. If I had the HF coil, I would use the highest frequency. Something not made of iron. A worm. Pieces of something... It's trash now. It's already out. It's a seal. A bag seal made of lead. Where should I go? It's nothing... Something tells me to check out the other side. I only have ~1h and 30min time today. I also forgot my power bank. The camera will stop anyway. I have to pass on "all of this"... A piece of lead, but it looks older... Wow! It’s a lovely buckle. It isn't plain. How old could it be? The size :). It was a "big" surprise. I have to cover the speaker. Dogs are barking from quite a distance... A shiny casing. It's so fresh, I almost bumped into the hunter. 1h left (I have a stopwatch running). A lead bullet. I will cross this road and check out the other side. It's a musket ball. A bullet. 36 min left. It's a button. This is how the area looks like. It has already been hunted, look at the holes. A small musket ball next to iron. I'm using my other setting. A tiny piece of foil. It's a button. It looks "old". More holes... A pull tab. And this must be the hole where it came from... Pottery. A bullet (thrown) under a tree. Iron... Another pull tab. An old, lead bullet. A musket ball. Look, a few small spiders running away. This rock is interesting too... Probably lead. I don't know what to think of this location... Someone didn't make it. Foil. The 12kHz frequency of the Deus doesn't like my pinpointer. A sausage clip. A shotgun cartridge. Hmm, what is this? Maybe I should return to the signal... I think, it's a different one. It's a button. It's an aluminum ring from a bird. A bottle cap. Two targets. Let's check this one out first. There must have been a worm.. Is it a button, or something else? The second target. Sounds like iron... And it is iron. Something next to iron. The last coil sweep sounded like iron too (at DISC "2")... It's a small casing. A spider. Go! A small lead bullet. My friend the bumblebee! This was his way of saying "hello". I'm watching a bird. I think, it has a nest in this tree. I will avoid the area, no need to stress him. A small musket/pistol ball. 1h:33min - I have to go. Who is this?! :) He doesn't have a ticket for my train. OK, now it's time... Macro shot of my assistants. Yes, that's a smile... Ring from a bird. 1980. Pieces of lead. Lead bullets. Lead musket/pistol balls. A seal made of lead. A button, or something else? That's a button for sure. Another one. Part of a buckle. The "old looking" button. The tiny buckle. Trash... And treasure... Detecting time: You saw it.
