 welcome to another MedCram corona virus updates number of deaths has gone from 565 up to 638 that's an increase over day of 73 and that's exactly what it was yesterday so it looks as though we've got a linear increase here in the last couple of days I am very sad to say that one of those deaths was dr. Lee wen Liang who was credited as one of the original doctors who recognized that there was a outbreak and then succumbed to the very infection that he was warning about and for those of us that are in the healthcare industry doctors nurses respiratory therapists all sorts of people who every day go to work to fight disease a comrade of ours has fallen and it gives us pause to remember that this is not a numbers game they're real people with families behind every one of these numbers in terms of the infected that's wet from 28,000 274 to 31,000 440 interestingly yesterday that number represented an increase of 3700 today only an increase of 30 166 could this possibly be where things are starting to level out I'm eternally optimistic but I'm not sure so interestingly if you go to this website called world meters dot info backslash coronavirus backslash you come to this dashboard that we referenced a couple of days ago and shows here the number of corona virus cases of course and the number of deaths and the number that's recovered and what you'll see here is the total cases and if you notice very carefully you'll start to see that it looks as though it's starting to layer off but it may be difficult to actually assess that from the way this graph is laid out so if you keep scrolling down you'll see this linker that says more case statistics if you click on that you can see here the corona virus cases and there's little bit more detail here's the part that's interesting if you look at daily cases worldwide on the graph here are the bar graph you'll start to see here that February 6 for the second day in a row there seems to be somewhat of a decrease at least there's a decrease here on February 5th it may be that the data hasn't all come in yet for February 6th it's unclear but that is certainly something that is noteworthy and something to watch and then there's the growth factor which is basically taking the derivative or the slope of that increase and that's what we have here for the growth factor you can see early on there was quite variable and then it's been generally speaking just above 1 in terms of growth and here again for the second day in a row it seems if all the data is in and is correct it would seem to suggests that the daily cases growth factor is finally for the first time here going below 1 for two days in a row potentially and hopefully that's gonna lead us in the right direction and then again here we have the total change in number it seems as though we were in the 29 mid-20s here in terms of change in total number we've dipped below 20 down to 15 and now we're down to 11% we can only hope that that is true we're gonna have a better understanding of what's going on here in the next couple days over the weekend which by the way as we did last week we will take a break and we'll start up at the beginning of next week I want to put these numbers into perspective however right now in the United States we have a flu epidemic I'm sure that's globally as well about 19 million people have gotten the flu this year a hundred and eighty thousand of them have been hospitalized here in the United States and believe it or not 10,000 of them have died this flu season 68 of those 10,000 were children you in terms of those people that are recover to make a note of that yesterday the total number officially that recovered was 1178 that's gone up by about three hundred and sixty nine to one thousand five hundred and forty seven and we're gonna see this number increasing a couple of weeks ago we were in the few hundred and now things have taken off the thirty thousand so we gonna start to see definitive things here one way or the other I will say though dr. Lee had a kind of unusual course if you look into his history he was hospitalized on one twelve twenty twenty of course by that point they had suspected along the way that he may have had this virus and he was tested numerous times it wasn't positive until February first 2020 he passed away on two six twenty or should I say he passed away on actually on to seven because it was I believe Friday morning already in China at the time that he passed away so why was it that he came down with symptoms and yet for a good week two weeks no positive coronavirus on testing I don't know if there was a quality issue or whether or not he just didn't have very Mia not exactly sure why this was the case I want to talk about what's going on in Canada because we've had a couple more cases in Vancouver first case in Vancouver was related to a gentleman in his 40s who recently had traveled to the area in China who Han and then there was a woman in her 50s in Vancouver this was the second case in her 50s who became ill on February 1st 2020 after a husband and wife from one had visited her and so there was a female and a male in their 30s that were visiting and they're all staying in the same house so when this lady became ill and she was with someone that had come from Wuhan they tested her and she was positive for the corona virus it looks as though they have now tested these people as well after the home isolation and of course they are both positive as well which is not surprising given the fact that the woman in her 50s probably got it from those in their 30s what's interesting is that these people who are in their 30s generally young speaking here had very mild symptoms maybe only a slight cold and then it went away what's significant though about this case is this represents the first person-to-person transmission in Canada so far however it appears as though everybody is doing well at least the cases in North America no one's been hospitalized because they needed to be it was more for a quarantine and isolation as it seems that young and healthy people are better apt to deal with this virus those of us who are a little rundown let's take this opportunity to get extra sleep and to prepare ourselves in case there is a epidemic care of coronavirus but more importantly because there already is a flu virus issue thanks for joining us you
