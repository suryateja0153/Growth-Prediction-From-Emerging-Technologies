 he's what I tend to do when I do small data research I attend to get a haircut and to talk to the hairdresser and hear their reality and then I talked to the church leaders and I talked to the community leaders and once I've cleared my palate so to speak cleared my glasses there was a German philosopher which once talked about could to Oberlin which means culture glasses you become blind because it's you close to the forest to see the trees once I cleared that palette I'm able to see things in a clearer way that's where things starts to stand out and a culture is is really everything and I've realized over the years working with brands that there's no way I can build a brand without getting the culture with me because if I don't get the culture with me it would be a shallow brand you may have a great products but the end of the day the services are horrible and then you will only remember the service you won't remember the products and if your product is a service it's even worse so your goal at any point in time should be to create an amazing culture where people are really proud where they have a spirit of what you stand for so a brand can it's not necessarily just a product or service it can also be an interaction the way you talk to people the way you handle things that were you listen to people all those aspects of just as important I'm pretty sure in in Germany and here in Italy that immigration is going to be the make-it-or-break-it point for EU mainly because I think there's a lot of people whose are sick and tired of immigration however it is not accepted in the society to say we don't want to have anyone into our country and so that is the topic where you won't discuss it in public that's where you will say deep inside with very few friends that's what small data is and once you can pick that up you can say that type of people says this behind the scene then you can start to see signals around the whole board and basically use big data to verify if this makes sense but in the u.s. one is more inclined to have big skilled data when your one is probably more and trying to understand the nuances now society because even Europe is 300 something million people know Italy's is is it's less than 100 million and didn't matter where I come from it's less than 6 million so we have understandings and appreciation for different culture differences and therefore that's the nature of small data digital communication and is a misunderstanding in the way that people think because it's digital you cannot do offline research all the research you have should be digital and we use big data to analyze it one of the things I tend to say is that if you really want to stand out as a digital comedy you need to understand how the consumer lives offline and if you understand that you understand why they use the product the way they do online I believe that we believe that we have a lot of freedom and that we have the freedom of choice we liberate it and we make a lot of decisions every day I think the reality is it's almost the opposite the patterns of behavior we have is almost identical I see that increasingly as soon as there's a break we'll be online what we're doing online is what millions of other people are doing so even though we believe we're pedaling away we're pedaling in a round circle like a little mouse and I think that's where we are a static consumer and I do think that we will need to break that vicious cycle we can only do that by being present you [Music] [Applause]
