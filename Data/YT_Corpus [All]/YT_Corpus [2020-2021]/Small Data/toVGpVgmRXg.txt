 My name is Tunde Kehinde. I am the CEO of Lidya. The power of small businesses is they create the most jobs, they're a big part of GDP, but most traditional lenders struggle to serve small businesses, because even in loan size as little as $500 is meaningful for a small business, but it's tough for a bank to make money there. So what Lydia does is we gather data on small businesses. It can be as simple as is your business incorporated, your bank statement, analyze that data, and come back to you and say, "Look, you're qualified for this loan size, you can get it at this time, and you can use it to grow your company." You can apply online, get an answer within one day, and get the money delivered to your bank account, and you can use that money to grow. And over time, we give you a credit score, and pricing that's still up to you. We've now given loans to over 4,000 businesses. We've given about 10 million dollars across a variety of sectors, and the whole idea is let's take this model across frontier markets. We plan to be in two more countries per year for the next three to four years. We're aiming to disburse a billion dollars worth of credit to small businesses by 2022.
