 Hi it's Keir Finlow-Bates here. And today I want to talk a bit about data. Because there's this often bandied-about phrase, "data is the new oil". Now we can't all be Google gathering vast quantities of data in order to make meaningful statistical interpretations as to what's going on, however that doesn't mean that using some data to inform your decisions isn't a bad idea. I recently conducted a small Linkedin  experiment and it's statistically insignificant in that I conducted the experiment once, I got a very small amount of data, but you're going to make a decision what is better: making the decision purely on a gut feel or making the decision on a gut feel backed up by at least some numbers that provide some evidence that you're pointing in the right direction as it were. I think it's something that's overlooked. We like to think that we can do everything scientifically using mathematics and statistics in order to get the right decision but often in our everyday life it's more a matter of making a decision and you don't want to be spending months and months putting together effectively a PhD thesis in order to come to a conclusion. Sometimes it's best just to do a quick test: that's what A B tests - A plus B tests for websites for example are about. You know, maybe website C, D, or E would have been much much better, but the fact is you haven't got time to code them all up. Why not just put two out there: do a one week run to see which one is more successful and then focus on that one, rather than just going with what you feel is the best site, because that is totally uninformed. Hope that was interesting, see you in the next video soon. Bye for now!
