 welcome back from lunch um we'll begin the afternoon session um i want to first of all before we do that i want to thank everyone for the very robust candid um and direct conversations that we've had in the morning session and i encourage you to voice any concerns opinions that you have on the next topics that will be discussed so um let's go on to have dr steven anderson present fda safety surveillance systems dr anderson please go forward dr anderson were you able to hear me can you hear me now we can sir okay how do i move the client forward just just indicate to us when you need them to move forward okay next slide um so thank you for the invitation to speak i'm going to talk about our vaccine safety surveillance and effectiveness programs that we have in place for post licensure or post authorization evaluation of vaccines the systems really break down into sort of two larger categories one is passive surveillance of vaccines i'm just going to talk briefly about bears and then our active surveillance pro monitoring program and i'm really going to focus a lot on that aspect in the presentation and that includes our systems i'll talk about as examples of best and then our fda cms partnership next slide please so focusing just on the passive surveillance this includes the vaccine adverse event reporting system it's a system that's co-managed and shared by cdc and fda if you go to the next slide this is a slide that and tom chuma bakura in the next presentation will be talking more in depth about um there so i will leave it to him to talk about that and just give you a few high-level details in the next slide as to fda's sort of role in what we're doing with theirs in partnership with cdc so i just want to say that there's a lot of coordination between fda and cdc we have weekly and bi-weekly coordination meetings on bears and and in general are sort of our pharmacovigilance activities in the between offices and sda and cdc so sieber does have physicians in my office that will be reviewing the serious adverse event reports from bears and this includes sort of reviewing individual reports but also things like the death reports and conducting investigations into those reports conducting aggregate analysis case series and a variety of approaches we also use statistical data mining methods to detect disproportional reporting of specific vaccine and adverse event combinations next slide please so all right so i'm going to talk largely about our active surveillance program if you go to the next slide i just wanted to give you some brief background on our active surveillance work so um there is legislative authorization for fda to conduct active surveillance one one sort of um set of legislation is the fda amendment act of 2007 and that really directed fda to develop systems that i'm going to talk about such as best and sentinel and i just um wanted to remind people that um the number of people that these systems cover were mandated to cover more than 100 million persons so you're going to see some large database numbers in the systems that i'm going to talk about um there's also the prescription drug user fee act there's commitments between fda and industry on sort of priority areas that program is renewed every five years through um and approved by congress the program does provide resources to conduct post-market and post-authorization types of surveillance mostly around safety and we've extended that to include effectiveness the next slide um so i just wanted to step back just a minute before jumping into the data systems and talk about considerations for vaccine monitoring as we think about for these covered vaccines what are sort of the data needs so what we want is sort of rapid data access for near real time surveillance i think the next factor we want is sort of large databases of tens of millions of patients for evaluating sort of rare serious adverse events that we might see for these vaccines we want data that represents sort of an integrated care spectrum and that means from an outpatient setting so if a patient gets a vaccine stay in their doctor's office and then they report to an emergency department or a hospital a few days later then we'd like to have a system that can cover that sort of continuum of care in those different health care settings the patient might visit we want high quality data obviously so that we can assess that the vaccinations did occur and that the events and we want more information on the types of events so we can adjudicate whether the events are real or not and then along those lines we really want data with significant clinical detail and that may mean access to medical charts so again if we identify safety signal we want certainty that the signal is really a true signal the next slide so i'm going to talk about the fda biologics effectiveness and safety system i'll just say up front that the best system at fda is part of the overall fda sentinel initiative it falls under that umbrella we have several data partners in best and several general partners that provide um other support to our um infrastructure and those include those are listed here in the first bullet point acumen ibm watson and iqb are sort of main contractors a contract research organization but we also have large insurers involved such as health corps humana optimum health agent health care providers such as medstar and others we have a large component of academic organizations represented in the system as well again i just wanted to emphasize in the last bullet point best includes really a folks that see in a minute as well and then what we have is more powerful data where we link the claims and ehr data so you get sort of the benefits of each where you get additional granularity to adjudicate serious adverse events that you might see or be interested in evaluating the next slide please just to give you a flavor for the types of data sources that are in best the claims data sources are listed here and i just wanted to point to the right column where you see patient numbers represented in millions so you can see that there are tens of millions of these types of records for representing individual patients and i just wanted to point out that the bottom four three or four are really health care health insurers again they provide again tens of millions of patients such as optum health corps and health agenda the next slide please and then we have ehr electronic health record data sources and so those again are listed and you can see those range anywhere from you know could be small anywhere from one or two million up to you know over 100 million so there's a lot of potential for these systems we're still exploring some of them but they hold a lot of potential for conducting vaccine surveillance you can see that there are electronic health records systems represented as well as those again those linked electronic health records and claims data that provide again a lot of specificity but also assurance that you've captured you know the vaccinations and the adverse events of interest the next slide please so the best initiative i just wanted to show you that there's a lot that goes into the best initiative it's an ehr network and a lot of characteristics like we're looking for short lag times one thing that we're also doing with best is we have sort of more on-demand analytic capabilities to sort of do sort of more tailored investigations and tailored analyses of these large databases i just also wanted to mention that before we've been using prism which is the post-market rapid immunization safety monitoring system that is also part of the sentinel system and we've used that in the past and i will say the difference between best and prism is that best really incorporates many of the data partners and nearly all of the large data partners that were in prism um so for consistency we've floated over to use the best system but we still have access to and will may rely on the fda fentanyl prism system to conduct some analyses as well so the next slide i also wanted to to speak a bit about a partnership that fda has had with the center for medicare medicaid services this has been partnership has been in place since 2002. i just wanted to say cms data are nice claims data they cover a very large population of the elderly nearly all the elderly in the u.s and about 55 million persons greater than 65 years of age we the nice thing going down to the bottom bullet point is that we also have access to medical charts and then also access to sort of that continuum of care with these data so powerful set of data to do analyses on an important population when we're considering covid19 vaccine safety and effectiveness surveillance so i'll go to the next slide please i just wanted to sort of point out you know there's a lot of strength to these data systems but a lot of limitations as well so i showed you a lot of data systems and data such that we have access to but you know not all the claims or ehr data systems that we have can be used to address safety or effectiveness regulatory questions um each system has its own limitations or for instance it may cover certain populations like the medicare population covers the elderly we probably won't see much in children in that data set um some may be limited to health care settings like just hospitals the level of clinical detail may not be as sort of refined as we would like and so on and so forth so there are limitations to each of them so you kind of have to pick carefully which ones are suitable to do you know vaccine safety and effectiveness type of monitoring work and i'll go on to the next slide please i just wanted to recover we're still it's really ongoing work as we're planning um our plan is to conduct near real-time surveillance or it's also called rapid cycle analysis we plan on monitoring 10 to 20 safety outcomes of interest and those will really be determined on what we see in the phase three studies of sponsor safety data that gets submitted to the fda we'll also coordinate with our federal partners like cdc va cms and others to identify adverse events of interest that we want to follow and i will say that at the the bottom bullet point really just emphasizes our first initial plans to deploy rapid cycle analysis would be to use the cms data to conduct this sort of near real-time safety monitoring for these outcomes i'll go to the next slide please and then this is really just a list of the safety outcomes that we're thinking about doing for our rapid cycle analyses um it's not all-inclusive um and some may be some may be excluded um we're going to prioritize the list and then make determinations about which ones to include but this really gives you sort of a flavor for the types of adverse events we're thinking about and these are really drawn from lists of people like we've partnered with cdc so cdc has a prioritized list as well as sepi and other organizations so we've drawn from all those lists to develop our own working list again go to the next slide please so i just wanted to say that we have significant experience with near real-time surveillance and rapid cycle analysis so we've been conducting rapid cycles near real-time surveillance for annual influenza and gbs since 2007 and then we've also done work in the fda sentinel prison system where we did a rapid surveillance type of project too where we looked near real time at six health outcomes of interest during the 2017-18 seasonal influenza vaccine next slide i just wanted to talk a bit about our our other surveillance plans because it won't just be around the rapid cycle analysis so if we identify signals from those rapid cycle analyses we'll need a capability to identify and sort of adjudicate those signals so you go from a screening method which is near real-time surveillance approach like rapid cycle analysis and then you want to have more certainty that that event is true so we would use our date of other databases to evaluate those safety signals further by conducting either small epidemiological studies or larger sort of self-controlled or cohort studies or more comprehensive protocol based assessments others in the government are also going to be using things like tree scan signal detection efforts for identifying potential signals and so we would plan to partner with our government agencies to help them in refining and adjudicating safety signals that they might identify next slide please we also can plan to conduct vaccine effectiveness and surveillance work it remains to be determined at this time so i just want to say manufacturers will have a role in conducting vaccine effectiveness post licensure or post authorization studies and we may conduct those types of studies as well so we're thinking about just general effectiveness studies to look at specific outcomes that include some populations of interest so like the elderly patients with comorbidities etc we're also interested in duration of protection studies how long will the vaccine protect a person once they've received the recommended numbers and then perhaps others as well i just want to say that we're coordinating efforts on effectiveness studies with cdc's ncird and we're doing this through monthly and bi-monthly meetings with them next slide um i just wanted to say we have significant experience fda does working along with cms and um conducting um effectiveness studies for the annual influenza vaccine as well as zoster vaccine and then we've conducted a duration of effectiveness study with exhaustive x vaccine so we've done probably nearly i think we've published i think nearly 25 to 30 articles in this particular area so i have a significant body of work already and experience in this area next slide i just wanted to just emphasize that this really isn't just an fda only activity and looking at safety and even effectiveness of the kobe 19 vaccines and just remind people that it's a large u.s government efforts that's coordinated and we're working with cdc cms va we have other partnerships with nih there's dod indian health services so this really is a big effort spanning several government agencies and a lot of coordination among the agencies so the next slide just really reinforces how that is done it's done through a lot of meetings we're meeting weekly with cdc regular meetings with va and cms the goal is we plan to share protocols discussions of safety and effectiveness outcomes of interest and then just sharing general plans and they'll be coordinated planning and conduct of surveillance activity so that near real-time surveillance those 10 to 20 outcomes i would expect that other government agencies will be doing either the same list or a similar very similar list of number of outcomes in their rapid cycle analysis and with that i'll just next slide end with acknowledgements because this is not only a single person's effort myself it includes a number of other people including colleagues in my office cdc cms va and our many other partners who work with us on this effort and i'll stop there thank you very much thank you very much for that presentation we'll take questions now from the voting members and as well and the liaisons uh dr goldman your hand is up first thank you sir so first of all excellent presentation really interested in how we can best work with uh primary care i did want to bring up a few potential pitfalls that i really think need to be stressed with the best initiative first of course the confidentiality issue goes without saying and everything needs to be assuredly hypocompliant and make sure that the patient's confidentiality is assured but my biggest concern with the use of ehrs as it has already been showed was thrust upon uh primary care and has been quite burdensome in its implementation and use when we have to do any type of registry integration data mining frequently that cost for the interface and any other data exchange falls onto the private practice and the community physician is quite burdensome and costly so i think this can be an extremely useful tool for data mining for finding out uh adverse events and making sure the vaccines are effectively distributed and communicated but i just want to make sure that we dovetail on the theme from the previous talk on the importance of support and funding we do not need an unfunded mandate or any other cost burden because if we end up requiring and mandating private and community physicians to do this reporting and shoulder the cost of any upgrades or interface to the electronic health record could make the whole project fail in the community setting so i just want you to be mindful of that but thank you for your work over well thank you for that thank you for that input appreciate it dr palin please go all right thank you for this presentation and thank you for sharing how multiple components of the federal government are working together for vaccine safety and effectiveness in your slide about going from screening to epidemiological analysis there was a component that's mentioned tree scan signals would you please expand upon that conversation yeah so tree scan is a signal detection method so instead of just looking at our 10 to 20 outcomes what that enables um us to do or the or whoever is deploying it i believe it's able to look at thousands of outcomes like up to 6 000 or more different types of outcomes and see if there's any potential signal associated with those in a specific vaccine and so those might be you might be thinking about so think about icd-10 codes that we would be screening against to look at specific procedures and then outcomes is that helpful yes thank you thank you dr glickman thank you um bob glockman i'm the liaison from ahip had a couple questions about your use of claims information the first one are you do you have concerns about the lag on when claims information may actually be received from providers versus the timing of the adverse event and and secondly uh tying that adverse event to the time to the vaccination if the vaccination is not paid by the payer we have a way to integrate the the data sets to to uh assess whether or not that adverse event is truly related to the vaccination yeah so so your first question around the lag um so we have a a relationship with cms and so we do have access to to near real-time data coming out of cms so that's why we're proposing to use that and that lag is really um first we get unadjudicated data and those data can come in we're just going to take those on a weekly basis but they could come at us every few days if we wanted we were going to look at those every week and unadjudicated means it's not settled in the chart and it's not necessarily everything's been coded in the chart and so that might take like approximately 30 days to resolve and once that data is entered in then then that that gets updated sort of in the next data streams that we get further down the road so but the point for cms is that it's pretty rapid access to almost immediate data followed by the 30-day lag for you know additional coded data and i think we would have that with any ehr system too where coding would have to catch up but you're right there is a lag challenge with claims data so and for some of the other systems that we have such as optimum or haltogen those those may go out to three months or so and so again that would be a challenge to actually do studies in those a rapid turnaround but for verification with large numbers of patients it still may be very useful for us to use those types of systems and then your question about sort of if it's not being paid by a payer you're right that could be a potential problem we're working with cms and others to perhaps make sure at least the administration of the vaccine is is um required um and needed so that um so if if there's a payment made for the administration then we're hoping the administration not only gets recorded but what was administered will get recorded but this will be a challenging area we are continuing in the government to work on this challenge thank you dr bill oh thank you um i just wanted to say that i appreciate the emphasis in your presentation about collaboration with other government agencies and other groups that are working on vaccine safety in terms of things like harmonizing outcomes of interest and very regular communication sharing data i think that's actually going to be extremely important and in that regard i wanted to uh point out that i think this needs this sort of collaboration and coordination really needs to continue through the entire process so that as potential signals are investigated that that communication continues and certainly when it comes it comes to communicating to the public that uh everyone is well coordinated so that um we're providing clear and information in a transparent kind of way so i appreciate your efforts in this regard and um support the way you're working to stay very coordinated thank you for that appreciate it ms barter thank you for this um overview of this the monitoring systems um as i think about um the very first phase which will likely be um healthcare personnel and and likely be through employers or maybe even the local public health partners i'm i'm not seeing a system that kind of covers that monitoring outside of theirs and i know dr shermap aguero is going to talk about the v safe um but how are we going to manage the monitoring of of those individuals when we don't really have a the only databases we're going to have are the registries yeah i mean we've been giving some thought to that and i think i think you're right it really is a huge challenge and i think one of the some of the electronic healthcare partners we're looking at um do have their own health care plans so their employees would be covered by it so so we would be looking at these employer um based insurance plans um in hospital systems to actually um you know identify adverse events in in those populations in addition to theirs but again that's a new area that we're currently exploring and i think the other thing is looking at facilities the other is you know nursing homes and skilled nursing facilities and so we're looking at a variety of approaches and one is the center for the cms data um do cover those facilities so we're looking at you know can we glean safety information from those facilities so again we're we're getting a little bit of the key populations but you're right we have some holes in the populations we're able to identify especially early on dr lee um thanks so much dr anderson for coming and presenting today i just wanted to echo dr bell's comments that we really appreciate your engagement in the acip vaccine safety work group revast and your willingness to coordinate and collaborate with federal partners on a harmonized set of adverse events and protocols as vast as planning for reviewing the data and monitoring safety in all the post-market safety surveillance systems that span the federal agencies as you know well we used prism after h1n1 vaccine safety in near real time in 2009 10. and since then have been able to use both fresh data as well as the adjudicated claims which do take longer but fresh data similar to cms you know could be available from the data partners uh that you mentioned so you know my questions are along the lines of uh um ms batas which is you know thinking about phase 1a so we're very focused on phase 1a and 1b um in the early you know three to six months of our vaccine vaccine program and the cms data only covers adult 65 and older well so if the vaccine is not found to be as effective in older adult populations which we're waiting to see but it would make a lot of sense for us to think about using sentinel and best to monitor during the early phases of vaccine allocation so the specific questions i have are which you know closed or population-based systems do you think would be feasible to use aside from cms in order to capture potentially those essential worker or populations or the adults with high-risk medical conditions as well as healthcare providers and when do you think those systems would be available and would they be available for real time near real-time surveillance or would this be retrospective after um you know many months have passed um and then if you do have any plans or protocols in place for using prism or best when do you anticipate having an update on these plans or so that we can understand the scope and the timing of availability of such data all right well wow that's a lot to unpack so so we brought up so um for for recent partners that we brought on board um we've recently brought on four or five new part new claims data partners and that includes the partners in prism as well like um optum heltogen um healthcore and humana um so we have used those in the past as i mentioned in that one slide for doing that sort of precious data approach where we were doing near real-time surveillance on six outcomes so those same partners are and are going to be in bet are invest now so we would plan on exploring with the data partners you know if we can repeat that effort again with you know safety outcomes again i think again the limitations that we find with the the claims databases gets to the chart review so if we're looking at chart review we just add on anywhere from four months or longer anywhere from four to eight months in adjudicating outcomes that we observe so we have ways to look at data upstream and downstream of an adverse event to determine whether it occurred prior to the vaccination and those kinds of things and do a bit more adjudication but to get at that medical chart data that's going to be very hard so in the in the age group from basically 18 to 64 um we'll be using these largely the best and maybe perhaps the sentinel system to be capturing that age group but others are going to be capturing those age groups as well like bsd so tom can talk a bit about that and then we also have va system that's also ehr based so there's going to be a bit of a lag if we're relying on these claims data systems but again i think they can provide some useful information does that answer all of your points thank you just to like ask specifically do you think either central or best might be available in time for uh as we're anticipating early vaccine allocation to some of these populations um just thinking about the next you know couple of months we're preparing for um vaccine deployment and whether or not it fits into that timeline well i think sentinel is ready um i think we're checking with these the new partners um invest and seeing if they're going to be ready to to use the approach we're using so it's just a matter of a new common data model and transfer formation of the data into that new common data model approach and then whether um you know they can um you know whether we can get rapid access to that data too and do rapid refreshes so that conversation i don't have an answer for that as to the timeline but it may it may be four months six months before we get an answer other than new best partners before we're able to um so i won't take any answer but i'll say to stand up you know the rapid monitoring that we would like thank you we'll take two more questions and then move on to the next speaker dr kimberlyn uh yes in this the systems that you've described and others i bet we'll hear about through the afternoon one of the possible adverse event outcomes that will be watched for is multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children and i'm curious what y'all are going to do about the case definition of that because the case definition requires evidence of current or recent sars cov2 infection by virologic or serologic means in the prior four weeks will the case definition have to be modified in order to be a applicable post-vaccination um i yes i believe so so i haven't looked specifically at that outcome to start determining how we're best going to monitor it so i don't know what the i don't know so maybe others perhaps um if i could offer that yeah this is uh jose remember so if i can offer some comment about that so there there are antigen detection tests that do not rely on the spike protein they use other structural proteins um so you know we've some discussions have been had about that and using those types of assays to document a recent infection over if i could follow on that what about vaccine induced misc in other words not while not natural infection inducing it but the vaccine itself if the case definition requires evidence of of wild-type infection we're in a catch-22 on that yeah i i would agree with that and to make a determination that somebody hasn't been infected is also fairly challenging all right final question will come from uh miss mcnally thank you just i'm trying to make sure that my my assumption is correct that these fda surveillance systems would be in place regardless of how a copa 19 vaccine would be authorized so in other words whether it was an eua traditional pathway or another regulatory mechanism such as the expanded access that's right and i think i think the question gets back to um you know are those administrations going to be entered into these health care systems and how that that will be done and i i still think that's the relevant question for those um you know for those programs thank you okay we'll uh we'll stop here again thank you dr anderson for answering uh all this all these questions we'll move on uh to the next presentation by dr shimoguro on post authorization safety monitoring plans and again thank you for yesterday for jumping in when we were having technical difficulties with the speaker assigned to safety talk it's my pleasure can you hear me okay we can okay could you go to the next slide please next slide so just by way of background the us government has a responsibility for public safety with respect to vaccines our monitoring is independent from manufacturers and covers all vaccines we maintain the largest most robust and most sophisticated monitoring systems available in the united states and u.s government agencies collaborate on monitoring i think dr anderson did a great job talking about how our efforts um for covid19 are are highly coordinated um our systems and our methods are complementary and we collaborate on analysis especially on on signal assessment next slide i want to mention that cdc's advisory committee on immization practices has established a copit 19 vaccine safety technical subgroup its purpose is to advise cdc and other federal agency partners on planning and preparation and to independently review and evaluate safety data post authorization post licensure safety data on covet 19 vaccines will be regularly presented at public acip meetings next slide so i'm going to give some brief updates on vaccine safety data link monitoring and clinical immunization safety assessment project consult services but i'm going to try to spend most of my time and focus on really healthcare professionals role in reporting adverse events to the vaccine adverse event reporting system and also healthcare professionals role in facilitating patient enrollment into our new vsaf smartphone based active surveillance next slide next slide so the vaccine safety data link is our is our large linked system database system that we do active surveillance and research in includes nine participating integrated healthcare organizations with data on over 12 million persons per year it's ehr data and administrative data next slide we also have access to charts for chart review i wanted to add so our planned activities for covid are near real-time sequential monitoring rapid cycle analysis monitoring for vaccine-mediated enhanced disease studies to evaluate covid19 vaccine safety during pregnancy including fetal death and infant outcomes tree temporal scan data mining and other projects as you see below next slide this is a preliminary list of our vsd pre-specified outcomes for rapid cycle analysis it's very very similar if not identical to the one dr anderson showed you and this is because we are regularly coordinating on developing our list of pre-specified outcomes next slide so moving on to sisa next slide the clinical immunization safety assessment project is a collaboration between seven participating medical research centers and cdc um they do clinical consult services and clinical research next slide so the the csup consult service supports u.s healthcare providers and health departments on complex vaccine safety questions it assists with the evaluation of patients with adverse events after covid19 vaccine or in making clinical decisions about administering covenants 19 vaccine to a person who may be at increased risk for an adverse event it's available to u.s healthcare providers and health departments by contacting cdc info next slide next slide so vares or the vaccine adverse event reporting system is our spontaneous reporting or passive surveillance system it's co-managed by cdc and fda it is the nation's frontline system for monitoring vaccine safety in the early warning system for detecting possible vaccine safety problems it it has traditionally provided the most rapid information on vaccine vaccine safety when new vaccines are licensed and recommended and rolled out to the population um we typically can get information very quickly often in a matter of weeks to start characterizing the safety profile of new vaccines next slide bears can rapidly detect safety signals and can detect rare adverse events it's subject to the limitations of spontaneous reporting systems in general and the main limitation is generally we cannot assess causality from bears data alone verse accepts all reports from all reporters without making judgments on causality or clinical seriousness and it's a hypothesis or signal detection system that requires verification of signals in more robust data systems next slide approaches to analyzing various data include traditional methods such as clinical review of individual reports and aggregate report review this is looking at large volumes of automated data statistical data mining methods detect disproportional reporting of specific vaccine adverse event combinations in the varus database next slide this is a preliminary list of our vares adverse events of special interest the the ones highlighted in blue there are adverse events of special interest that we will clinically review um and um we'll be analyzing those in the separate database um where we're abstracting reports and accompanying medical records where available next slide i want to spend some time i'm talking about health care professionals role in various reporting health care professionals have been cdc's long-standing partners for reporting vaccine vaccine adverse events to bears ever since vare's inception in 1990 invares depends on health care providers to identify and report suspected adverse events even if they aren't sure if a vaccine caused an adverse event really for bears healthcare professionals our eyes and ears out there we depend on them to use their clinical judgment to detect possible adverse events and to report those as promptly as possible to theirs hipaa permits reporting of vaccine adverse events and medical documentation to various for public health purposes and health care provider participation in vares reporting will enable public health officials to have accurate and timely information on the safety of covet 19 vaccines specific guidance on vare's reporting for vaccines authorized for use under emergency use authorization will be forthcoming this guidance is different than for traditional um traditionally approved vaccines um this this uh guidance is is in progress and um will be communicated to healthcare providers when it's final next slide so in order to um the the process for submitting a veris report is very fairly simple all you need is is internet access in the office in the healthcare facility um or just internet access in general even if you're a member of the public you simply go to the vera's website this is the landing page this is the first page you see up in the left hand corner there there's a little link for report and adverse events you click on that and it takes you to next slide it takes you to this page which is really how to report an adverse event there are two methods although i will say nearly all public reports electronic reports come in using the online reporting tool but individuals can use a fillable pdf if they want you just simply click on that report online link and next slide it takes you to the online reporting form and what you see there on the left are these sections for the vares report split into basically almost topical areas and just below that you see what is a miniaturized various form so it cues you to where you are on the particular form and kind of gives you a completion status and on the right hand side you see the initial data elements for the patient information that's the section we're on right there you move through these various forms you advance to the screen and next slide when you get to the final data element 28 you just complete that and you hit the submit button when you do this electronically if you've inputted your email address you'll get a verification that you that you successfully submitted of errors report if you didn't um vers will follow up with you um through more traditional ways next slide uh if individuals are a little more visual um and want to see a video you can go to youtube click on that link and it's a it's a joint cdc fda presentation on how to use the vares online reporting tool next slide i want to next cover our v safe system next slide vsafe is a new smartphone based active surveillance program for covid19 vaccine safety it uses text messaging to initiate web survey monitoring it conducts electronic health checks on vaccine recipients daily during the first week post-vaccination and then weekly thereafter until six weeks post-vaccination and there are additional health checks at 3 6 and 12 months it includes active telephone follow-up through the varus program with vaccine recipients reporting a clinically important event during any of these v-safe health check-ins and aveira's report will be taken over the phone if appropriate we also capture information on pregnancy status and it enables follow-up on pregnant women next slide this is a very high level schematic so you can see cdc and the vaccine recipient up there on the top there's this bi-directional communication we're sending out these text messages for these health check-ins with links to web surveys individuals are sending information back to us on their post-vaccination experience if an individual reports having a clinically important clinic significant um adverse event which we define that for the purpose of be safe is the individual missed work was unable to do normal daily activities or receive medical care that triggers events at the varus call center where they will reach out to the individual contact that individual and complete a varus form if appropriate i mentioned that we also capture information on pregnancy status and for those we will be following up um cdc will be following up on pregnant women to monitor the health of the the pregnant woman and monitor the pregnancy um for the duration of the pregnancy next slide so be safe allow estimation of rates of local and systemic reactogenicity and rates of clinically important adverse events following vaccination and symptoms and conditions associated with these adverse events next slide so we anticipate health care professionals will play an important role in v safe enrollment initially when the program rolls out it is going to be a manual enrollment process the individual the patient the vaccinated individual will have to take some action to enroll themselves in v safe and we are asking that health care providers will provide a one-page information sheet to patients at vaccination what you see on the right here is just a draft um section of what is a one-page back-and-front um information sheet we're still in the process of of developing the specific language for this but it has it's going to have a url code up top and a a qr code to scan this will take the patient right to a a website where they do a a pretty simple registration process and that kicks off the series of events where we start sending these text messages and start getting information back from the from the individual we also ask that health care professionals counsel patients on the importance of enrolling in vsaf so there's really two things that we are going to ask that number one you give them this information sheet which tells them about vsafe and on the back side has some technical instructions and that the that you um basically give a a very short um counseling statement on vsafe and the importance of role enrolling in vsafe and we'll provide information on how to briefly counsel patients on be safe we want to make sure that this fits into the normal workflow we understand that we are asking healthcare providers um to do additional work to enroll these patients we want to make it as seamless as possible we want to just incorporate it into the normal counseling where an individual gets a sheet gets a simple counseling statement on v safe in the importance of enrolling and hopefully that will provide incentive for individuals to enroll in the program so we can get information on these early recipients a vaccine and we plan to keep this going as long as we need to next slide next slide so in summary vsd and csa and other planned projects are key components of covid19 vaccine safety monitoring and adverse event assessment vares is the u.s frontline vaccine safety monitoring system it has traditionally provided the initial data on the safety profile of new vaccines when they are introduced for use in the population health care providers can play an important role in identifying and reporting potential adverse events to theirs health care providers always have been they are right now and they will be our partners in safety monitoring and we depend on healthcare partners to um identify and report adverse events to theirs vsaf is a new smartphone based active surveillance program and health care professionals can play an important role in helping cdc enroll patients and be safe at the time of vaccination in the coming weeks we will do an educational and outreach program and a promotional program targeted to our partners and health care providers on on v safe and on on the important role that health care providers can play in enrolling patients and be safe we consider health care professionals are partners in safety monitoring both for bears for v safe and the opportunity to participate in cisa activities if they so wish next slide thanks and i'll be happy to answer questions thanks for that presentation um i think what we're going to do is if dr wharton is ready to present we'll put her slides up and allow her to present and then uh we'll ask quest questions from the group to both of you are we ready with dr wharton's slides uh good afternoon thank you is the audio okay it is fine thank you very much great thank you uh next slide please uh so uh as dr shima bakura mentioned the coven 19 vaccine safety technical subgroup was organized several months ago including a number of independent expert consultants acip members liaison representatives as well as subject matter experts from federal agencies and this group has focused on adverse events of special interest reviewing u.s government plans for safety monitoring as well as discussing communication issues next um as we are moving toward implementation of a covert 19 vaccine program we are transitioning this technical subgroup to a to a smaller data review group this is really building off lessons learned from the h1n1 vaccine safety monitoring where there was a consensus that linkage to a federal advisory committee would ensure transparency independence and public accountability and so the composition of the group will include representation from both the advisory committee on immunization practices as well as the national vaccine advisory committee a number of independent expert consultants acip ex-officio members from federal agencies and from other federal agencies as well as liaisons from the veterans administration and the department of defense next uh the um the post-implementation objectives of the gr of the group are to review evaluate and interpret post authorization or approval coven 19 vaccine safety data serve as a a really central hub for technical subject matter experts from federal agencies that are conducting these very important post authorization or approval safety monitoring projects to share the safety surveillance data to provide advice on analyses interpretation and data presentation and and very importantly connect to the acip cover 19 vaccines work group on issues of safety data presentation to the advisory committee on immunization practices and application of safety data to policy decisions we really do think this structure will facilitate the rapid communication of any safety concerns that are identified to the acip next so we're expecting that the the work group will have a a couple of different types of deliverables one of them will be covid 19 vaccine safety technical reports for internal acip and cdc and federal partner use as well as cova 19 vaccine safety data summaries that will be shared with the public next and that concludes the presentation thank you thank you very much so we will open this up to questions from the work group i'm sorry from the voting group and from liaison dr goldman please thank you a real brief i thank you for the presentations um dr shimbaku kuros on the be safe i just have one potential concern when we look at social determinants of health and underserved areas we're assuming everyone will have access to cell phones so that may be a limitation in some areas and we just need to make sure that we're mindful that while most people do have some uh form of communication we're dealing with indigent homeless and other populations we may want to be extra cautious about how we monitor them and they may not have ongoing access to care as we would like over thank you dr coyle thank you for the presentation i think this is an area that everyone keeps asking you know what is what's going to be happening with the vaccine is available um i did have one question for you about theirs and whether there's been any consideration for modernizing bears to be able to accept electronic messages from an ehr or from a registry i know that that's been discussed in prior years but i was just curious if there's a way to fast-track that or potentially look at that to get better data this time around we have done some work on on using basically using computer algorithms applied to ehrs to help healthcare providers identify potential adverse events and then facilitate the the if you look at the varus form there's very specific information that's this asked on there um and kind of an a fully automated push the button type of process i think is is challenging um but we have been working on sort of a facilitated automated process and we would certainly like to explore that further and look to other ways to i think use modern technology and ehrs to facilitate vares reporting i'm i'm not sure given the timelines we we would be able to get something in place um in in the next several months but that is that i think that's the next evolution of theirs thank you dr stinchfield yes thank you so much for the presentations a question for you tom will the one-page v-safe information be translated into that number of languages that amanda showed earlier or will we be doing that translation at the local level so i believe it'll be translated into five languages and i i'm not sure what those languages are other than spanish is definitely one of them so it will be provided in it will be provided um there will be multiple forms in i believe at least five languages dr palin ah thank you for these great presentations the um communication um that is done culturally specifically is very important and discussed earlier that these stages part of that is there going to be um capturing of the diversity of the united states um when people are enrolling in to be safe and what's the feedback to make sure that we it truly represents all the people who are being vaccinated so the the enrollment process is designed to be um very is designed to be quick and not impose a lot of burden on the individual um and so the initial registration process right now does not ask about race ethnicity i will say that information is is asked on the vares form so for individuals who report a clinically significant adverse event and we follow up with them in various we will get that information um as as far as um will this be representation we are it is our goal to enroll as many people as possible in as many areas as possible um in as many types of settings as possible um it will be open to anyone at least right now if you have the electronic capability to to enroll and to get these text messages and we hope to move to also have an email and alternate email pathway um that's a goal of ours enrollment is voluntary so i guess what i'm saying we will do our best to make sure that we enroll as many people as possible in as many settings in as many areas as possible thank you dr bernstein thank you uh safety surveillance is so critically uh important it's this is an immense uh collaborative uh effort and it's quite impressive i i think i have a simple question but in yesterday's presentation when you stepped in uh tom you um i thought i saw that 36 of reports to theirs were from manufacturers and i i wondered a did i miss read that and b i i think for a trust in what's happening with theirs i wondered whether it would be more the information would be more trusted if it didn't come necessarily through the manufacturers so the the manufacturer reports and um if if dr anderson is on the line he may want to jump in here um manufacturers are required to report um all ad at least for in for for licensed vaccines all adverse events that come to their attention so a manufacturer report is actually initiated by usually it's initiated by a public report so instead of the health care provider directly logging on to theirs and submitting their report in the case of a manufacturer report the healthcare provider would have contacted the manufacturer and then the manufacturer in turn submits a report to vares so so typically um you know these are i don't want to say it's a pass through but it's it's an indirect way of getting the report into theirs we just we want to make sure that we get all reports of adverse events as many reports as possible and um so if a health care provider or a patient or a parent did decide to reach out directly to the manufacturer this is the route where that information gets reported to theirs so they don't recommend directly completing it themselves is there a some interpretation that's made by the manufacturers and reporting to bears um when you say could you when you say an interpretation could you clarify i mean it actually goes through the fda electronic submission gateway um and is and is um parsed into the the vares data fields and then goes to to the varus program so whether it comes from a healthcare professional or the patient uh himself or herself or the manufacturer the data can be equally trusted well one of the one of the limitations of passive surveillance is that there's inconsistent completeness and quality of the the data and that i mean that applies to um i don't want to say some reports are better than others some reports from different types of reporters are better than others i will just say that there is some inconsistency in the completeness and quality of data and largely depends probably on the person who is actually reporting the information thanks dr whitley williams please thank you very much um thank you for this presentation and you know also the importance obviously of surveillance even though it is passive i would just say that lessons learned from our children being at home and not in school there were many barriers and i'm concerned about the patient barriers not everybody has access as hard as it is to believe um to the internet um there may be access obviously outside the other thing is sometimes many people have you know cell phones that they purchase minutes for and they're not smart phones per se so i am concerned i want to make sure that um as i'm sure you do that it's all in inclusive um and i if there's any way of tracking um or recording um even if it's by zip code i think it would help to make sure that we are being inclusive um of all communities in in recording any um any untoward uh effects from the vaccine long term thank you good i see no other questions thank you very much we'll move on to our next presenter which is uh dr biggerstaff who will discuss modeling strategies for the initial allocation of covid19 vaccines um please go forward dr burgerstaff i think you will be switching gears a bit here and i'd like to thank the acip for time during today's meeting to discuss these strategies and i just want to note that i'm presenting on behalf of the modeling team within the data analytics and modeling task force and so there's a lot of people who have helped make these slides possible next slide please i'm going to spend the next few minutes walking you through some modeling analysis that we conducted to answer the question what is the potential impact in terms of preventing covid19 infections and deaths initially allocating vaccine to one of the following groups after vaccinating healthcare personnel in phase 1a specifically we're looking at initially allocating vaccine to adults aged 65 plus adults with high risk medical conditions or essential workers this work builds on previously presented work to the acip in august and utilizes additional modeling approaches to ensure a diverse set of methods are utilized for these important questions next slide please so i'm going to for the next few slides i'm going to be describing the methods and focusing on how we stratified the population and the model the assumptions we made for vaccine characteristics and allocation and the characteristics of the assumed epidemic scenarios and how they varied in relation to the introduction of the vaccine we begin by stratifying with five age groups zero to four five to 17 18 to 49 50 to 64 and 65 plus we then stratify each age group by risk status between low risk which we find as those persons having no select high-risk medical conditions are high risk which we define as having one or more select high-risk medical conditions the high-risk conditions we considered in this analysis were chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or copd heart disease diabetes kidney disease or obesity we selected these conditions to match an mmwr analysis of the prevalence of underlying conditions associated with an increased risk of severe covid19 illness from available brfss data about 40 of adults are estimated to be at high risk with this risk increasing by age for individuals with a high-risk condition we assumed a three times higher risk of mortality upon infection relative to the low-risk group based upon a review of the evidence supporting the inclusion of these groups into the high-risk list next slide please in addition to age and high-risk status we also stratified by occupational status about 40 of adults aged 18 to 64 are classified as essential workers and healthcare personnel make up about 20 percent 25 of those workers for these essential workers we assume that they are only able to reduce their workplace contact rates 35 percent as much as other adults of the same age because this is an assumption we varied this from 20 to 50 in sensitivity analysis we based the contact patterns used in the model on a social context and mixing study called polymod which was conducted in multiple european countries the contacts and mixing data were used were adjusted for united states demographics and were taken from a study authored by prim and published in 2017 the contact rates are stratified by age group and setting which were home work school and other settings next slide please now i'm moving on to vaccine characteristics and allocation assumptions next slide we assume that a full vaccine course consisted of two doses given 28 days apart the assumed vaccine efficacy for both doses was 70 with the first dose having 17.5 percent efficacy which is one-fourth of the assumed full production we varied this in a sensitivity analysis where we explore the impact of reducing immunogenicity in adult age 65 plus in this sensitivity analysis we reduce the ve in the 65 plus age group by half which resulted in a ve of 8.75 for the first dose and 35 for both doses for all analysis we using protection from either the first or second dose was achieved 14 days following the vaccination next slide please continuing on with our vaccine characteristics assumptions we assume that every vaccinated person is partially protected which in the vaccine modeling literature is called a leaky vaccine we also assumed that the vaccine was infection blocking which meant that it protected the recipient against infection and subsequent onward transmission to other individuals this assumption leads to vaccination having benefits beyond those directly vaccinated since transmission is reduced and this is called indirect protection for any breakthrough infections which is an infection in a person who was vaccinated we assumed no attenuation our reduction of severity or transmission for that infection because the above is an important assumption we also assume that the vaccine was only disease blocking in a sensitivity analysis this means that there is no protection against infection or onward transmission for those vaccinated and the benefit they receive from the vaccine is a reduced risk of severe disease if infected the only benefits of the vaccine in this sensitivity analysis are among those directly vaccinated for all scenarios we assumed no waning of either naturally or vaccinate or vaccine acquired immunity next slide please now i'm going to walk you through our vaccine allocation assumptions for phase one in this analysis we assume there are 200 million courses of vaccine available for phase one and it's important to note that a course equals two doses since we assumed this is a two dose vaccine in phase 1a we allocate the first 20 million vaccine courses to healthcare personnel after the initial allocation to 20 million healthcare personnel we have 180 million courses remaining and we move to phase 1b which consists of adults age 65 plus adults with high-risk medical conditions and essential workers next slide please within phase 1b we initially allocate 20 million courses to adults age 65 plus or adults with high-risk medical conditions or to essential workers once 20 million courses are allocated to members to one of the three groups exclusively we then allocate the remaining 160 million courses of vaccine to members of the three groups concurrently for these 160 million vaccine is allocated proportional to each group size in phase 1b next slide please it's important when we're thinking about these allocation strategies to understand where we are in the epidemic so now i'll walk you through how we constructed the hypothetical epidemics for this analysis based on preliminary serological data and modeled estimates we assume that the percentage of the population infected two months prior to vaccine introduction was fifteen percent to understand how the results would vary in scenarios with lower or higher values we assumed values of five or twenty percent we estimated the impact of the vaccinations and simulated future epidemic trajectories using compartmental models that incorporated time-varying social distancing mitigation strategies from these models we compare the outcomes of the numbers of infections and deaths averted within the six months following vaccine introduction for the three initial strategies i just described compared to scenarios with no vaccination campaigns next slide please within the simulated epidemics we assumed 100 of the individuals were vaccinated are not yet eligible for the second dose before moving to a subsequent phase and vaccines were administered regardless of infection history meaning that individuals who had been infected would receive a vaccine we assumed 10 million people could be vaccinated each week resulting in members of phase 1a and 1b being fully vaccinated in about 9 months the person's returning for the second dose were prioritized over persons receiving we also varied the epidemic the the timing of the vaccine introduction relative to the epidemic incident and we created three hypothetical scenarios in the first scenario we introduced vaccine before a rise in incidents in the second scenario we introduce vaccine as incidents rises and in the third scenario we introduce vaccine as incidents falls the next few slides will illustrate these scenarios and when vaccine introduction occurs next slide please the next series of slides show epidemic curves for the three scenarios along with the day the vaccine can be introduced which is day zero on the x-axis and marked by the vertical line as described these epi curves are simulated using a compartmental model where we vary the levels of social distancing to achieve the shape of the curve and represent the shape and duration of the epidemic with no vaccination because we don't know the height of future peaks we assume the maximum incidence in each of these curves match the peak incidence from the summer of 2020 in the united states the scenario i'm showing on this slide is one where a vaccine is introduced before incident starts rising and then plateaus begins to decline around 60 days after day zero next slide please this slide shows the epidemic curves for the scenario where vaccine is introduced as incidence rises and the day of the vaccine can be introduced continues to be marked by the vertical line on day zero in this scenario incidence plateaus and begins to decline around 40 days after day zero next slide please this slide shows a scenario where vaccine is introduced as incidents falls incidents plateaus and begins to decline around 30 days before day zero in this scenario next slide please this figure overlays the epidemic curves for the three epidemic scenarios along with the day the vaccine is introduced the horizontal bars represent each vaccination phase and the length provides an estimate of how long it takes to fully vaccinate that phase under the administration assumptions of 10 million doses per week as a reminder in phase 1a we allocate the first 20 million vaccine courses to healthcare personnel after this initial allocation of 20 million we then move to phase 1b where we initially allocate 20 million courses to adults age 65 plus or adults with highest medical conditions or to essential workers once that initial 20 million courses is allocated to one of the three groups exclusively we then allocate the remaining courses of the vaccine to members of the three groups concurrently next slide please now moving on to the findings of these analysis next slide this slide shows the population-wide averted percentage of infections assuming an infection blocking vaccine and that older adults receive full protection or efficacy from the vaccine as younger age groups the bar chart shows the percentage of infections averted by the phase one campaign over the six-month horizon following the introduction of the vaccine each group of bars represents the different vaccination introduction times relative to incidents rising or falling with the left most group of bars showing the percentage of cases averted in a vaccination campaign that begins before incidents rises the middle group of bars showing the percentage of cases averted in a vaccination campaign that begins as incidents rises and the rightmost group of bars showing the percentage of cases averted in a vaccination campaign that begins as incidents falls the colors represent the group that receives the initial 20 million doses at the beginning of phase 1b the green bars indicate that the first 20 million phase 1b courses go to adults age 65 plus the orange indicate that those initial phase 1b courses go to adults with high-risk medical conditions and the purple indicate that those initial phase 1b courses go to essential workers the bracket in each group represents the difference in the averted percentage by allocating those initial phase 1b doses to those age 65 plus compared to high-risk adults these results indicate that if the goal is to avert more infections than initially vaccinating high-risk adults or essential workers in phase 1b averts approximately one to five percent more infections compared to targeting persons age 65 plus the difference is greatest in the left-most scenario where the vaccine is introduced before incidents rises and there's a very small difference in the rightmost scenario where the vaccine is introduced as incidents falls while the overall numbers of infection averted drops in the sensitivity analysis where we assumed reduce ve in older populations the findings of initially vaccinating high-risk adults or essential worker in phase 1b averting more infections holds next slide please this slide shows the population-wide averted percentage of deaths assuming an infection blocking vaccine and that older adults receive full protection or efficacy from the vaccine as younger age groups the bar chart now shows the percentage of deaths averted by the phase one campaign over the six-month horizon following the introduction of vaccine the timing of the different vaccination introductions is the same as before as are the colors for each group initially receiving the 20 million doses at the beginning of phase 1b the bracket now represents the difference in the averted percentage by allocating those initial phase 1b doses to those age 65 plus compared to essential workers these results indicate that if the goal is to avert more deaths than initially vaccinating adults age 65 plus in phase 1b averts approximately one to four percent more deaths compared to targeting high-risk adults or essential workers as before the difference is greatest in the leftmost scenario where the vaccine is introduced before incidents rises and there's a very small difference in the rightmost scenario where the vaccine is introduced as incidents falls next slide please this slide shows a population-wide averted percentage of deaths assuming an infection-blocking vaccine but now the vaccination protection our efficacy in older adults is half that of the younger age groups the bar chart continues to show the percentage of deaths averted by the phase one campaign over the six-month horizon following the introduction of vaccine in this sensitivity analysis we find that initially vaccinating high-risk adults age 65 plus or essential workers in the phase 1b averts a similar percentage of deaths across the scenarios next slide please my final results slide now shows the population-wide averted percentage of deaths assuming a disease-blocking vaccine with full protection or efficacy in older adults as in younger age groups in this sensitivity analysis the overall height of the bars which shows the percentage of infections averted by the phase one campaign over the six-month horizons horizon is lower compared to the scenarios with an infection blocking vaccine however the relative findings remain similar these results indicate that if the goal is to avert more deaths than initially vaccinating adults age 65 plus in phase 1b averts approximately 2 to 11 percent more deaths compared to initially allocating those doses of vaccine to high-risk adults are essential workers as before the difference is greatest in the left-most scenario where the vaccine is introduced before incidence rises and is approximately two percent in the rightmost scenario where the vaccine is introduced as incidents falls next slide and next slide this analysis is subject to several limitations most importantly all the characteristics of the vaccines were assumed and the efficacy and ability of the vaccine candidate candidates to prevent transmission as well as the time the vaccine may be may become available are currently unknown as shown in this analysis these assumptions can change the results significantly it's also important to note that modeled epidemic trajectories are only for illustration and are not forecast it's currently unknown what magnitude and how many future periods of increasing transmission will occur and the timing of vaccine introduction relative to those periods in addition the overall averted burden should be interpreted cautiously for at least two reasons first these values are very sensitive to the future trajectory of the epidemic we only took a six-month horizon meaning that infections and deaths that were averted but beyond the six-month window were not counted second these findings also reflect an idealized rollout with minimal delays and 100 uptake among the groups importantly we assume equal administration rates among the three groups but there could be meaningful differences in the speed with which groups could be vaccinated i want to emphasize that the overall aim of the study was to inform discussions about the relative impact of different initial vaccine allocation strategies not to estimate the absolute impact of the campaign which will be difficult to accurately do until we know more about the vaccine characteristics and the time they will be available next slide please in addition to the limitations just noted the following inputs were assumed and will require reassessment as more information becomes available one all infections confer protective immunity two immunity whether naturally our vaccine acquired doesn't wane significantly within a year of infection or immunization three given exposure younger age groups are just as likely to become infected as older age groups meaning susceptibility is independent of age four individuals with comorbidities are just as likely as their peers to practice social distancing and other protective measures and five there is no reduction in ve among those with high risk medical condition next slide please in summary we found that initially vaccinating a doll to age 65 plus in phase 1b generally averts the greatest number of deaths and there is approximately a 1 to 11 increase in averted deaths across the different timing scenarios we considered that initially vaccinating essential workers are high-risk adults in phase 1b generally averts the greatest percentage of infections and there's approximately a one to five percent increase in inverted infections across the different timing scenarios considered that earlier vaccine rollout relative to increasing transmission the greater the averted percentage and differences that were found between the strategies these findings indicate that the differences are not substantial and near zero in some scenarios especially in scenarios where vaccine is introduced as incidents falls i think these findings can help emphasize the need to continue efforts to slow the spread that the greatest averted burden percentages are found when vaccine vaccine is introduced prior to increasing activity finally these findings are consistent in the sensitivity analysis we conducted where the percentage of the population infected prior to vaccine introduction was varied which were not shown in the presentation due to time constraints next slide please in addition i also want to draw your attention to a literature review of peer-reviewed and pre-publication studies that was included as a handout this review summarizes the impact of vaccination under different initial allocation strategies that were identified by the cdc modeling team during a review of studies that model the impact of vaccination under different initial allocation strategies this handout includes the summaries of a republican studies and provides a further description of the study methods population excuse me the vaccine strategy evaluated assumptions and results in general this review found agreement between this analysis and the literature review summary results similar to our findings to minimize deaths initial doses should be allocated to the oldest age groups those with high risk conditions and our older essential workers to minimize infection earlier doses should be allocated to younger age groups younger essential workers and school-age children i think it's also important to note that like our study many groups conducted sensitivity analysis and the results varied by the timing of vaccine availability and number of doses available differences in susceptibility in ve by age and the mode of action of the vaccine and whether it was infection or disease blocking uh next slide that concludes my presentation but i'm happy to take any questions thank you very much for that informative discussion uh presentation so let me begin by warning um uh the uh the boarding members liaisons ex-officios and public that we are going to run long um and i think that it's we're looking at about an hour projected uh extending past the projected deadline or the end of this meeting which was 4 45 eastern time and we're doing that because we think the questions and the discussion is very robust and we don't want to cut it short so keep that in mind and we'll begin with uh questions for dr biggerstaff and i see that dr hunter is up first thanks can you hear me we can um i think the uh from my point of view uh both uh clinically and from local public health uh medical consultant um the assumptions you're making in your models makes sense to me um in general i think the the the vaccine efficacy may be a little bit high but um it's reasonable um but what i'm taking away from the especially the sensitivity analyses is that introducing the vaccine earlier prevents more lives and that the time of introduction of the vaccine has more significant impact on the number of infections and deaths averted then who gets the vaccine first the other thing that seems to have more of an effect if i'm reading your graphs correctly is that whether or not a vaccine is disease blocking versus just an uh isn't is just disease blocking rather than infection blocking makes more of a difference too um am i looking at the graphs correctly and making that comparison correctly yes i mean i would agree you know i think uh sort of the findings here and and are consistent with sort of uh influenza sort of uh modeling liter uh kind of analysis that were conducted does show the sort of timing of the campaign is a really important uh factor uh and sort of uh the potential impact of vaccines i will sort of again caution sort of looking at those absolute values as sort of um uh meaningful on their own but i do think the relative values do provide meaning and and sort of when considering potential populations you know if there are benefits to speed uh it's a sort of reaching administration that may be a consideration that those sorts of findings uh help uh inform i i do think those findings could also sort of help inform discussions of sort of how do you send a vaccine out uh potentially as you sort of think through um that relation to the epi curves but but uh you know that those are sort of harder to do uh when we're sort of making lots of assumptions about sort of everything at this point and and your point about disease versus infection blocking is uh spot on they uh definitely uh there will be less potential overall impact if if the vaccine isn't able to sort of block onward transmission versus sort of reducing the severity of illness thanks dr talbott um dr bearsath thank you immensely because um this is an incredible amount of work it was more than just one model and i greatly appreciate all of the effort i have a question and i don't know um how easy it is to answer and so i understand if um you cannot um if we are adults first and continue to keep schools closed because our essential workers cannot be vaccinated can we model the impact of poor nutrition falling behind in school um possible abuse and neglect in these kids is there a way to look at that that's a great question i mean there are frameworks and approaches where you can sort of try to add on some of these additional considerations beyond just that the health outcomes that that we focused on in this analysis i think um where those get tricky and sort of highlighted by the assumptions we even make for sort of more knowable things like uh vaccine efficacy is sort of what's the risk of sort of those outcomes uh how are they distributed are there sorts of you know factors that increase the risk which i'm sure there are so so it's possible i think um it's just they need to be more complex uh frameworks utilized that sort of move at the agent-based level so where they're actually trying to model people and then think about what happens to the individuals in terms of the epidemic and also with some of these uh kind of social uh and and societal outcomes of interest so it's it's possible i won't say it's um uh incredibly easy to sort of integrate those into analysis like this yeah i think it's really easy as someone who participates in covenant it's somewhat easy for us to determine who has died while hospitalized but it's been really hard for us to determine the impact of this disease outside of the disease and i think that's an important part of when we decide who to vaccinate to include so thank you very much dr solaji you go next i inadvertently lowered your hand yes thank you dr bigger staff this is this was a very elegant analysis and an enormous amount of work and i congratulate you i have two questions um have you considered modeling hospitalizations in addition to deaths and i asked that because of the improved healthcare medical care that we see now compared to even just several months ago and then secondly have you modeled a uh vaccination of adults and congregate care facilities skilled nursing facilities as a very small group particularly if there's a very limited sample and there does seem to be effect efficacy in very old populations yeah so with the um the the first question which i was in the process of writing down and then uh slipped on can you repeat that just to make sure have you modeled hospitalization absolutely yes sorry thank you uh so we just initially started with infections and and deaths because those estimates um are a little easier to come by than sort of uh kind of the infection hospitalization ratios but we're you know trying to come up with approaches to sort of uh have robust estimates for that so i think that's something that can be um integrated into this sort of framework uh pretty easily i would imagine that most of the sort of qualitative findings won't be that different since sort of the you know age group is most at risk for hospitalization will follow um at the sort of mortality risk but we uh can uh definitely integrate that in in future um versions of this and then uh back to your your question about sort of looking at um persons in congregate uh settings this was presented uh back um in uh august uh acip and that work was led by uh dr uh rachel slayton um so i'm going to sort of summarize uh potentially some of the takeaways from that um talk but it really found um that that vaccinating uh the staff in in these congregate settings uh may be more uh beneficial than just vaccinating uh the residents and that's likely uh because of some of this uh you know dis uh infection blocking action and you're not introducing uh this um uh the virus in into nursing homes but you do those uh august 26 slides as well for a little more detailed uh results of that dr gluckman thank you and thank you very much for a great presentation i'm the uh liaison from the american health insurance plans uh given the evidence of worse outcomes in uh people of color and low-income uh populations um did you do any modeling uh to uh assess impact in prioritizing uh people of color or low-income people as well and if not should that be considered we we haven't uh done an analysis in that that yet but that is something that that um would be possible it would take you know i think a little bit of work on the back end of the models again sort of bringing in the the needs to have good sense of sort of how um risk and and sort of um you know mobility or contacts might vary by the different groups but it is something uh that that could be uh incorporated if that would be of of use uh to the acip in the future dr bell do you want to offer any comment on that because i know the work group thought about this issue and i don't mean to put you on the spot i'm sorry it would be easier if you're in the room i can shoot a glance at you but i can't do that um i think that we have considered a number of different ways to reflect the disproportionate impact on disadvantaged populations and i think including for example using a geographic indicator um something like a social vulnerability index or other index that is perhaps similar and i think that um you know we felt that it is important to reduce to reflect on the disproportionate impact on disadvantaged populations but for any reason some of which i think you'll see in the context of the um equity and ethics presentation that is coming after this break that focusing on race ethnicity exclusively is probably not the best approach thank you for those comments are there any other questions or comments okay so uh not seeing any um what we'll do is we'll shorten this next break and go to make it a 10-minute break we will come back at 23 minutes after the hour uh 14 seconds 23 minutes after the hour thank you very much
