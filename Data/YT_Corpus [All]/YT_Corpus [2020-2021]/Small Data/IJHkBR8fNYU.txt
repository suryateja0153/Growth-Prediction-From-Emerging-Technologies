 Hi people and hello from Lausanne, the city I moved to, let's say in the 20th century, but honestly, it still feels like it was yesterday. It's just incredible how time flies. Today, I would like to share with you my point of view regarding the hype around big data or machine learning. I mean, yes, big data offers a valuable but incomplete solution. Harvard Business Review studies and Martin Lindstrom, a branding expert and book author of small data agree that to fully understand your customers, you need to integrate both big and small data. The power of small data is in teasing out clues to what consumers really want by spending time in focus groups listenings online research communities or most effectively, homes watching. Martin Lindstrom says further; intriguingly, we're now turning the tables on the internet by circling back and finding human, not digital insights about ourselves based on our own unconscious online behaviors. Without understanding how your customers think, feel and act, you are unable to deliver an exceptional experience. Bottom line today if you want to make the right decisions for your business, both small and big data combined, need to be applied in order to enhance the customer experience. Hopefully this video is valuable for you. And as always, don't be shy and reach out to me to discuss your marketing challenges. I would be more than happy to help. But remember, as long as the Matterhorn stands everything is going to be alright. Well people, cheers from Lausanne and I talk to you soon again from another Great location.
