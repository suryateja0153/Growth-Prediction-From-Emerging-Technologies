 [MUSIC PLAYING] JOHNATHAN ELFALAN: The midsize, three row SUV has to do everything-- provide enough room for the family, enough storage for their stuff, enough engine to carry everybody, and enough value to make it affordable. The Kia Telluride does all of this and with style. The Telluride has the fundamentals down, but it over delivers on appearance and feel. It's simply good looking inside and out, with detailing that rivals, or maybe emulates, much pricier and upscale luxury SUVs. Available in seven or eight passenger configurations, this large and quiet interior has tons of storage space with the seats folded. When unfolded, the normally kids-only third row, can carry two adults comfortably. We also like it's family friendly options, like the driver intercom system. MARK TAKAHASHI: Smooth V6 and all wheel drive make sure the Telluride is capable and sure footed. It's not optimized for towing, but can still pull a decent 5,000 pounds when equipped with a tow package. It's a great value to buy or lease. it comes with the strongest warranty in the industry. No wonder why our consumer reviews are so positive. Sure, other SUVs may excel in other areas, but none are as comprehensively accomplished as a Telluride. [OUTRO MUSIC]
