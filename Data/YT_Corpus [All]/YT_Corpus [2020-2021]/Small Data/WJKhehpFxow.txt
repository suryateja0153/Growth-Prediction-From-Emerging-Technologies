 so about that mammogram I've been putting it off for weeks just like you we're busy people I'm a mom of two I just don't have the time plus I am a little nervous I have no idea what to expect but the truth is it's just smart early detection does save lives so here's what I did I made myself an appointment at Johns Hopkins medical imaging I went online to my chart I picked the date time and location so simple so I'm going and you're coming with me here at Johns Hopkins we support that women at average risk for breast cancer should start annual mammograms at age 40 we think that's really important because we know that annual mammograms has the greatest chance to detect breast cancer early and when we detect breast cancer early through screening we know that that's when it's the most treatable have an appointment okay I just need you to sign in right here on this computer okay we know that this type of exam can make women nervous from the moment you walk in the door we aim to make you comfortable okay all right [Music] thank you everything you're gonna use right here in your dressing area caps down everything's gonna be to you jump away stuff off we also have a row for you putting on - honey - holder chilly okay and did you have any dealer at your pattern at all - no I was told not to wear perfect wonderful well I'm gonna have you go ahead and get cheese I'll be right back with you in a few okay okay sounds good thank you every single technologist is trained and specialized in this type of exam and that is all we do priority we're gonna start with the right side okay I'm just gonna come around you here okay I'm gonna have you take your right arm I just want you to grab right here for me bend your elbow and I want you to lean in on this corner perfect just gonna come underneath just after doing mammography for many many years we are trained in little tiny tricks and how to move the patient's breast around how to move them in perfect position how to compress them a little differently so that they are very very comfortable but it's going to be very having a really experienced technologist performing the mammogram is very important for us the positioning I can't emphasize enough is crucial to us being able to interpret the mammogram appropriately are you doing okay yes all right I'm just gonna ask you to hold still just like that for me we're gonna take a quick picture and just hold your breath [Music] when a woman gets a mammogram for total pictures are taken two pictures of each breast each of those pictures on a 2d mammogram is just one picture to look at on a 3d image you're able to scroll through that image and see multiple layers within that one image so a 3d image really helps clarify for us as radiologists whether finding might just be overlapping tissue or whether there could be a mass under there you may breathe so bad doing okay yes thank you fabulous we're actually Hopkins all of our breast imagers are breast imaging specialists and that's important because it's well known that radiologists who exclusively read breast imaging and read a higher volume of breast imaging have a higher cancer detection rate and that means that we're picking up more cancers what was that worried about I have no idea it was so fast so easy it was just a little squish for about four seconds the tech told me everything that was going to happen which was awesome if there's any additional findings on your mammogram we will actually call you to let you know so we can bring you back in four and just remembering that you might need to after a patient has their mammogram to spread by the radiologist usually the next day in 90% of cases the images look great and normal and the patient was notified by mail in about 10% of cases we need to clarify an additional finding so the patient used to come back to return for additional imaging once the radiologist has read through report there is also going to your doctor within 24 hours a screening mammogram takes less than five minutes not that uncomfortable and it saves lives you know what I could totally do that once a year it feels good to know what's going on with my health [Music]
