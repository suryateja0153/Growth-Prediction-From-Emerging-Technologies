 Well good evening ladies and gentlemen  and welcome to tonight's webinar   from small data to big data and back again. My  name is Jonathan Schramm and I'm the director of   admissions for undergraduate and one year master's  programs here at the William and Mary Raymond   A. Mason School of Business which includes the  Masters of Science and Business Analytics program   which is our sponsor for the night, so it's my  pleasure to welcome all of you, our attendees,   and just as large a pleasure to welcome  and introduce our distinguished speaker   and guest for the night Dr. Joe Wilk. He is a  clinical associate professor in the operations   and information systems management department  at the Raymond A. Mason School of Business.   He is also the director of business  analytics programs at Mason.   He's been teaching analytics operations research  and engineering since 2006. His research is in the   area of applied optimization and analytics and has  been funded by the National Science Foundation,   Department of Energy, and the Defense Advanced  Research Projects agency, among others.   He is a registered professional engineer and  an active member of the institute of industrial   and system engineers institute for  operations research and the management   and the management sciences and military  operations research society. His most recent   faculty position prior to coming to William and  Mary was at the United States Air Force Academy   so please join me in welcoming him tonight and  Dr. wilk you have the floor. All right thank   you Jonathan and thank you for being here uh can  I just get a confirmation that you can hear me. I can definitely hear you all right good all right  so let's go um so welcome again and uh what we're   going to do tonight is I'm going to kind of walk  you through kind of uh I thought leadership if   you will about big data and uh but first we need  to think about small data okay and why small data   is important um and you know we got this far with  it so let's think about what this means and how   we have uh evolved as organizations and also as  humans when it comes to small data so what I want   to do is define small data here and small data is  small enough for human comprehension and it's in a   format and a volume that makes it accessible  informative and actionable in other words   you can make a decision with small data okay so  that's kind of the thought here with small data. Big data though it's multifaceted all right  it's gonna vary by industry it's going to   vary by context and we're going to explore  some ways that big data is characterized   over the next few minutes and we're going  to keep in mind our definition of small data   with the goal of course and we are a  business school and we are a business program   um our goal here is to make  better decisions with data   so we we eventually want to get to something  where we can make a decision or you know   take a you know an action if you will so that  we can do something better for our organization   so the first facet of big data is volume  volume means scale the data okay so you   know how much is it um so just thinking about  a YouTube for example over 300 hours of YouTube   are uploaded every minute so the amount of  time it takes me to go through this slide   300 hours of YouTube videos are uploaded you'll  never be able to watch them all 5 trillion photos   taken in in 2017 and obviously many many more  since then over 10 billion connected devices today   with the expectation that there will be over 50  billion over the next few years so if you think   about it you probably have a number of connected  devices um in your residence or maybe even you   know on you maybe it's a computer and a phone  I know in my house for example we not only have   one Alexa we now have three because our kids  want them as well so they can we can use them   almost as an intercom system so again multiple  connected devices now per person in per household. The next facet of big data is velocity so  velocity in this case means the speed of the data   and really what it means for us um from a  business standpoint is our ability to analyze   the data as it comes in so streaming data can we  analyze it what can we do with it and how can we   use this information to make decisions so for  example modern vehicles have over 100 sensors   and of course they're the the standard ones  like monitoring fuel level and tire pressure   but there's also some other ones that  are perhaps you know could save your life   or you know let you know that hey you  need to pull over your car is about to   um be severely damaged so forth and so on  so there are a number of sensors constantly   working on your vehicle and essentially  the computer the brain within your   your automobile is keeping track of things and  letting you know as the driver what you need to do   um in one trading session of the New York Stock  Exchange over one terabyte of information is   exchanged and so that's every single session um so  you can imagine just the the size of the data that   we are producing um and there's more than just  the New York Stock Exchange there's there's many   others um so we have 10 billion network devices  but we actually have multiple network connections   um so this is essentially meaning that there's  two network connections per person on the planet   so if you think about it for myself as  an individual I actually have a number   of network connections you know through my phone  through my residence at my job um so many people   um have multiple connections um so not just  devices but the actual their internet footprint   if you will and connections and all of this is  leading to streaming data I'm sure you've been   in a situation where you saw an advertisement on  your computer um when you were logged into your   account and then later that day when you were  logged in on your phone you also saw a similar   ad for the same type of product or from the same  company everything streaming everything is being   collected and used in real time so the other  facet of big data is variety um so this kind of   comes from the diversity of the data the different  forms that the data can take on um so from a from   a structure standpoint there's structured data  so think about this in terms of something like   databases or like an excel spreadsheet okay so  you have columns and rows of data all right but   most data is actually unstructured it doesn't  come in a database and all of these different   types of devices now are giving us different  types of data so for example there's wearable   technology a number of folks I don't have one  on but a number of folks have the Fitbit watches   and other types of wearable technology um or  apple watch or whatever it's called um there's   also video so video um all the different video  recordings um that is data but it's not structured   video was considered unstructured likewise  healthcare records that would be unstructured data   and then trying to convert that into a form  in which we can use it and later on in a   few minutes we would talk about tweets and that  tweets are also unstructured so any type of text   or video would be considered unstructured  even if it's tight it's still considered unstructured so at this point you're  probably seeing the the alliteration   with all the v's um and that's just kind of the  way it worked within this business of big data   but the next v is veracity so veracity is  the uncertainty of the data you can kind   of think of this as the variability um so  you know nowadays we live in a realm where   you know a lot of times is the data accurate  um and and I'm not talking about fake news   I'm just talking about like is the data you know  accurately measuring what you want it to measure   what's the quality of the data is it recent you  know is it still relevant um also what about   inconsistencies and a lot of your time spent as an  analyst um we'll be dealing with inconsistencies   in fact in my classes I will often give students  data that has known problems and that's the step   one is to kind of fix and clean some of the  data because that's real world real life you   have to clean the data and then of course there  is the trust aspect you know do you trust the   data source is it coming from a reputable source  are you sure that um you'll be able to use it   to again um reach some sort of business  conclusion so again veracity um is the   uncertainty of the data or the variability  of the data and and how we can go about that   so that brings me to a question and um  I realize we're spending a lot of time   indoors right now because of COVID but um this  is a picture from campus at William and Mary   some of you may recognize it but this is just  down the hill from the business school building   um there's a little um wooded area behind the  business school building and it goes down to   Lake Matoaka and this is the amphitheater  at Lake Matoaka and this is about 150 yards   down the hill from the business school building  and it's quite lovely um there are actually some   folks teaching classes um in this space this  semester because they need to teach them outside   so it's actually being used as a classroom  as well but in any case um William and Mary   has a weather station and so my question to you  is how's the weather and so let's let's have a   look at what this weather station is capturing so  give me a moment here I'm going to switch over. All right so here is the keck lab and this website   um it's it's affiliated with the national weather  service um they record weather observations every   10 minutes and this website updates every 10  minutes and you can download every single bit   of data that they've ever collected um starting  from 2003 when they put out the weather station   now there were a couple of days or hours where  they had a hiccup and so they don't have data   but for the most part for 17 plus years now  they've been collecting data and they did a   reading every 10 minutes from the weather  station at Lake Matoaka and as you can see   they're keeping track of temperature humidity  dew point wind whether it rained or not   um all sorts of fun stuff and so my question to  you so let me flip back my question to you is if um this weather station is reporting current  conditions every 10 minutes that's 144 reports per   day you know six per hour that would be 52 560  reports every year and it includes a number of   different measurements and whatnot so my question  to you um is is this big data or small data so um   I don't know if we we have a poll set up but  maybe uh people can jump into the chat for   a second and just or the q a and say do  you think it's big data or small data so   one one weather station 144 reports per day 52 560  reports per year is that big data or small data. Uh-oh Jonathan I've asked a question they  weren't ready for this quiz no I don't think   they were yeah you should be able to you should  be able to take big or small in the q a feature   if you have a yes 50 50 chance right all right we  got somebody we got somebody saying big somebody's   saying I like it we're already having a debate and  nobody's yelling at each other I love it all right   um so I like it it looks like it's it's bouncing  around um we're getting a little bit of both um   so here's here's the catch so I would argue that  one weather station is still small data because   in 10 minutes I could take that information look  at it and make a decision I can make a decision   of whether I need to wear a jacket today or not  or whether it's a good time to go out for a jog   or not um you know that sort of thing but once you  take into account so essentially you're both right   once you take into account that we have over  250 000 weather stations in the united states   and some of them actually report measurements  more than every 10 minutes that would mean   we have at least 13 billion reports every year  okay so at least 13 billion reports every year   clearly that is big data okay I mean  you're getting a report constantly   um so you're both right if you said small data  perhaps you were thinking about the one station if   you said big data or perhaps you're thinking about  all the weather stations that you've ever seen   um you know all the different elementary schools  and middle schools that have weather stations and   whatnot that report back to the national weather  service um all of those would add up to big data   so so what do we have here what are we doing  with this so let's think about another example   and how and how this kind of sorts itself out  so oftentimes um when it comes to big data   your you have to think of it in terms of of you  know you're going to have some cases where you   have a large volume of data but you also  have different types of sources of data or   different type of structures and so typically  what you have is you have this interesting menu   where the columns are actually really long I'm  just showing you kind of the first four rows   but typically the columns are very long you can  have lots of different types of data you can have   different style sources different industries and  the other thing to keep in mind is you may pick   more than one from each column so for example you  might have a large volume of data that is coming   in continuously okay um and maybe it's coming in  through video so for example if you were the New   York City police department and you have all these  videos um cameras throughout the city um then that   would be large volume continuous flow video  okay um or you know if you're uh GE and you're   manufacturing um um airplane engines you know  perhaps you have sensors on some of your machines   um so you have large volume continuous flow  and sensors you know so it kind of depends on   the application and then of course the different  industries that can be impacted and the different   function areas within the business that are also  impacting so keep in mind you kind of have a   mixture of all of these different things whether  it's veracity velocity or volume um you have a   mixture of all of those different things kind of  happening at once the multifaceted aspect of it   um so what does this uh look like you know  perhaps um in a different um stage so you if   you think about it um from a big data standpoint  and from a perhaps a data science standpoint   we do a number of different types of models we  create a number of different types of models   and we're doing this at the system level so you  know all the way through the system but oftentimes   you're also trying to apply these models  to individual entities uh within the supply   chain or within the production system or what  have you and so for example if you're you know   GE perhaps you are trying to implement predictive  maintenance on some of your machines that you use   in your manufacturing process um so you know  maybe you want to make sure that you're using   your your machines as best you can and you're  allocating your resources and assets as best you   can I'm in leveraging those um perhaps you're also  trying to increase your yield or your throughput   um and then finally maybe you are using  optimization or analytics at kind of   the system view and in this case um perhaps  you're thinking about um what kind of products   do you make um and and oftentimes you know a  company might have multiple products that are   in the same product family you know maybe they for  example if you're Nike you might have this style   of tennis shoe and this style tennis shoe and this  style tin shoe well how much do you make of this   one versus this one versus this one and you have  to make those decisions and then of course you   know hopefully you distribute those correctly  to your vendors and they're able to sell them   so all of these different things kind of lead  themselves from different types of models so   that brings us to the last v and this in my  opinion is the most important and that's value   in order for big data to be valuable we have to  turn the data into value through insights okay   and those insights have to be small enough for  human comprehension in a format and a volume that   makes it accessible informative and actionable  that's the same definition of small data   essentially we have to turn big data into small  data in order to extract value in order to be able   to make a decision or to perform a business action  uh to lead to a decision um so that's kind of the   the point you know we've come full circle here um  I do want to jump in on one example um so let me   uh flip screens here again I'm sorry for bouncing  around on you but that's just how I roll so this   is going to be an example that I would typically  do in like a class and although I would typically   use python in this particular case I'm using  Scala that's a different programming language   but that's neither here or there the big data  application or the app and we do use this in one   of the courses is spark so and again typically  we use python to code in spark and then the   context of here is Twitter so we're going to see  what's going on in the Twitter world right now. Um by the way um here's the here's the code and again I'm not  here to show you the code um I just want to   you know show you that I didn't just make this  up so let me um run an app that I've coded up in Scala and it takes a second to load and I  have a back door into Twitter um have a developer   account with them and what you're seeing here  are every second 10 random tweets and so Twitter   will give me between 40 and 50 tweets a second and  then I'm just printing out 10 random tweets every   second and what you'll notice are these tweets are  not all in English in fact the majority of them   are not in English and quite frankly they're going  so fast I can't really tell what's going on um   so um my question you know and you don't have to  type this in the chat room just kind of talking   out loud here my question to you is do you  find this information this data useful and   quite frankly no I mean it's coming too fast  I can't decipher what's going on here um   you know I would need to kind of  frame it or package it in such a way   that I can make some sort of use out of it so that  I know what's going on so I'm going to stop this per second so what's beneficial about  Twitter is they actually have a way for us to   kind of know what the the key word is or the key  words of a tweet are they include the hashtag   so perhaps we can use that feature to allow  us to learn more about what's going on so   what I'm going to do is I'm going to take the data as it comes in every second and I'm going to  keep track of the hashtags and I'm just going   to keep track of the of them as they come in  and keep a count and again what you notice is   the majority of them are still not necessarily  in English but now we're starting to see some   kind of take shape um you're starting to see  um hashtags that are more frequent than others   some of them um are dealing with the election  um at least one of them is dealing with K-pop   big surprise by the way K-pop is normally always  number one but obviously with the election going   on um perhaps they're not the number one thing  on Twitter right now um looks like Pennsylvania   is trending um probably due to the election and  then of course the masked singer so you can see   where our priorities are on Twitter um I'm just  I'm having fun um speaking of this though and this   is actually quite serious um when I was coding  this up originally a few years ago um I was in   my office um it was it was like late afternoon  early afternoon I can't quite remember the time   and um I I got it working and I was just kind of  looking at it like I am now with you guys talking   and it was the day Notre Dame cathedral had caught  on fire in France and I saw the hashtags it was   like Notre Dame Notre Dame is burning or something  like that and I'm like what in the world does that   mean like I thought it might be slang or something  and then of course I you know go go to the news   and I see what it happens so this type of analysis  does work if you're trying to keep track of what's   trending following Twitter believe it or not  even though it's a lot of random junk but once   you keep track of what's trending it will actually  be quite informative so that's taking big data and   then turning it into something that's actionable  or at least insightful um so that's kind of the uh   the kind of interesting example here so I've  stopped it now and let me go back to my slides. So in closing um because I want to give  us some time for commentary and questions   um in closing the way we view um data in this  program is we view this as kind of the new oil   okay I have been on the record saying that  I think the Masters of science and business   analytics is the MBA of the 21st century I think  this degree is going to prepare you better for   the workforce than a general management degree  and keep in mind I say that knowing that I teach   in MBA programs all right so just you know for a  full frame of reference I teach in both programs   now what's interesting about oil though is once  you use it it becomes less valuable okay because   you know as obviously once you burn it and use it  it becomes less valuable but the thing about data   is the more you use it the better it gets and the  more valuable it gets so data is the new oil is   actually not 100 an accurate metaphor or analogy  because data actually gets more refined and better   and more valuable as you use it and learn  more about it and understand it and then   make business decisions with it so um this is a  quote from Forrester research um businesses are   drowning in data but starving for insight okay so  it's kind of like you know being in the middle of   the ocean there's water everywhere but not a drop  to drink and that's where we come in our program   is teaching folks how to transform that data into  insights okay whether it be through modeling or   simulation or data wrangling data cleaning or  big data applications like I've shown you here   um so the other thing that you have to keep  in mind though we are a business school   and this is business analytics so  we do we don't just teach the skills   we teach the system view okay and  we teach the communications as well   and so we are also teaching you a systematic  way of turning data into action all right   so um that's also important as well is we want  you to kind of walk out of here with a playbook   of what to do how to approach a problem and  so forth and so on and not just a bunch of   technical skills so we we try to kind of you  know walk that line of being able to do both okay   so um with that um I want to open it up for  questions um and again my name is Joe wilk I'm the   faculty director for the program um it's been my  pleasure working with you tonight um and we have a   couple of admissions officers I'm I apologize for  not putting their like formal titles on here but   for all intents and purposes um Mr. Bracelin  and Mr. Schramm they're the folks that you're   you would be working with in terms of completing  your application and and whatnot um and and I'm   kind of the hired gun for the evening in terms of  showing off some of our fun stuff in the program   so I I'm ready for questions let's have that  so while I'm waiting for a question um I have   another example I I usually um also include  uh when I talk about this sort of example   um and that's um enterprise rent car now I did  take I took it out of the presentation tonight   because um due to covid enterprise rent-a-car um  the business their business model of course is   a little bit um distraught right now because you  know car rental agencies are not as needed anymore   um but um you probably have heard their slogan and  it's we will pick you up so we'll pick you up and   that didn't just come to them okay so  enterprise rent car a number of years ago   they looked at their data and they realized that  even though they had you know booths at airports   and train stations and other places where you  get people from out of town they realized the   majority of their customers were local okay  and if you think about well why would a local   person want to rent a car well I mean your car  is getting worked on and you got to take your kid   to soccer practice or your mom to their doctor's  appointment um or something like that or maybe   you're in between vehicles or leases or something  so enterprise rent-a-car decided to kind of build   off of that model so they made it a motto we'll  pick you up um so to to help with that convenience   but the other thing that they did and this  was a key business insight is they made sure   that they were strategically located either near  auto dealerships or body shops or at least had   their business card prominently displayed at the  auto body shop okay because you know nothing's   worse than having to to take your car in and  realize I'm not gonna have it for a few days   now I gotta rent a car I don't know who to  call and then I look down I see the business   card hmm enterprise rental car and in that moment  you're not gonna call two people you're gonna the   first person you call and you get on the phone  that says yes I have a car that you can rent   that's the decision you're gonna go with them  you always go with the first one you call   that's how it works so strategically placing their  business cards at auto shops insurance companies   places like that maybe even making deals with  those organizations to kind of be their preferred   rental a car situation whether  it be an insurance company or a   car dealership it really helped their business and  that was an early part of their business model. By the way I am a little surprised we didn't  see more tweets about the election but   we'll see how it goes. So Joe I'll I'll try to shoot a question out  to you so some of the programming um you were   using the actually we've got a question here so  maybe we'll take this one next but uh some of the   programs you were using at what point in the MSBA  program do students who maybe don't know how to   code or program or anything to that effect are  coming to us fresh out of say you know a liberal   arts or a stem background where they didn't really  have a lot of experience in business do they start   learning how to to find actionable insights out of  these large data sets does that start immediately   in say one of the boot camp courses or one  of the introductory courses in the fall   um so let me let me answer that by saying  that I believe that you got to spend at least   50 hours in a particular software before  you become competent enough and confident   enough to use it to do something okay and the boot  camps do that the boot camps get you to 50 hours   all right and I would say that you really need  to get to perhaps 100 hours to really be able   to do something like I just did all right  now with that being said in our very first   regular course of the program so not the  boot camp or the prerequisite courses but the   the very first course in the program is  called competing through business analytics   and the professor that teaches in that course  his name's Jim Bradley he's excellent um in fact   some of his teaching evaluations like  people say like this is the best course   I've ever taken in my life you know that  sort of thing he has a module where he does   web scraping and so you actually get very good  at doing web scraping and and that's a teaching   trick okay so when it comes to teaching uh we have  the you know ability to teach you a lot of breath   or we can pick a topic and dive deep into it  and make you really good at that one thing and   for for Jim for that course he does a lot of  breath for a lot of different things but for a   particular coding application he really does dive  into the web scraping and then for me for example   I teach in the spring and I teach the course on  big data we actually have a course called big data   I do a lot of recommender systems so recommender  systems uh would be something like amazon or   Netflix and you know once you've bought a couple  of these items they recommend you buy this other   item or once you've watched a couple of these  shows they now recommend that you watch this other   show and so I teach students how to build those  types of systems using the software that we're   doing in the course um and and the program um so  we do you know deep dives on certain applications   um but the purpose of it is to kind of get you  using and familiar with the software so it is a   teaching kind of trick and that leads us to the  question so one of the questions from the chat   room here is um the MSBA program covers a lot of  different programming languages and tools uh which   ones um are utilized the most during the entire 10  month program so the two primary tools that we use   are r and python and I like to tell students that  by the time you're done with the program um you   will have spent a thousand hours an hour and a  thousand hours in python now that doesn't you're   going to spend some of that time before you get to  the program because you're going to have to do the   prerequisites or the boot camps but throughout  your year with us you will spend a thousand   hours an hour and a thousand hours in python okay  you'll get to that limit and by the time you've   used a particular software for a thousand hours  you are you're very good at being able to teach   yourself how to do something so maybe if even if  you're not an expert you will have the ability to   take something or you know watch a YouTube video  or something and then be able to teach yourself   how to do something else so you you will be very  very confident and and highly skilled in those two   softwares some additional software that we use  we use tableau for data visualization uh we use   Alteryx for database management we use Gurobi for  optimization and I think we do a little bit of   stuff in excel but excel is kind of like um to be  honest um it's it's a great software I love it but   it's not really at the level we need it it can't  handle the big data capabilities so I would say   the R and Python are number one and number two  or number one and one a one b and then tableau   Ultrix Gurobi now in terms of power bi which is  a Microsoft product we don't we don't really get   into that one but you could a lot of the stuff  you do in tableau is transferable to power bi   um we also use some cloud so we do some stuff  in AWS um and again that's amazon's cloud but   there's also google cloud and Microsoft's cloud as  well and so some of those skills are transferable   um so you know you learn one and then you just  kind of have to learn where to click for the   others but once you figure it out you're good to  go so hopefully that answers your question um. Yeah it's really satisfying for me I've you know  over the summer you know after the semester ends   you know in may and um students who you know  they get jobs throughout the school year   um but students will email me over the summer  or kind of late in the fall and they'll say you   know something that you taught me in class really  helped you know or really it I I didn't I didn't   see the point of it then but now I'm seeing it now  in my job and it's really great to hear from them   and you hear about and and we we get those kinds  of emails all the time and what's interesting is   pretty much every faculty member gets those  emails and what that tells me is you know   you know for this one student it might be you  know course a that really helped them in their   job but for this other student is course  d okay and so really what's interesting is   um our program um is teaching students to be  highly skilled in a number of areas and then   that allows them to go into different fields  and make impacts and it also allows them to   kind of pursue what what's really good for them  um because some folks you know want to go in to   more of a coding role some folks want to go  in more to a management or an analyst role   um some folks want to go into like a small  business startup type situation and really be a   key contributor to a small team or a small startup  and and we're seeing you know everything all   different industries um so it really does allow  students to kind of pursue what they want to do. Awesome well are there any other questions   tonight we'll go ahead and wait  a couple more seconds here and put everything to a close go ahead well I have  a question for you I'm gonna put you on the spot   but okay when are the next deadlines and and and  what do I got to do to get get my application in   sure well Joe we definitely would love to have  your application you probably uh do really well in   the program you seem like you know your stuff um  so we've got we're right in the middle actually we   just started our December 1 application deadline  on November 2nd so November 2nd to December 1 is   basically our second round and students can  get decisions by December 20th so before the   new year we know if you're admitted into the  MSBA program as far as the preparation goes   uh we mentioned tonight a little bit about the  boot camp courses we do have some prerequisites   and I guess a bit of a skill set or at least  academic exposure that we expect our students   to have before they come in we've got some  flexible ways to complete those so if you're not   so basically we have eight prerequisites  one of them is probability and statistics   most students have that before they're applying  and that's the only one that we really don't offer   through a boot camp we can help you find  different opera options or opportunities that   to complete that before you come into the program  but if you if you aren't taking it it's a little   hard to do that but for everything else a  lot of our business students will come to us   already with the business foundation courses  which are introduction to corporate finance   introduction to financial accounting introduction  to marketing and intro to operations management   if you don't have those we have links on  our website and we'll definitely provide you   through the admissions process we do a really  great kind of screening process if you think   you've taken courses in these different areas  uh Mike Bracelin who Joe mentioned is basically   our frontline admissions counselor so  he will work with you to make sure that   you're getting everything counted and if  something's kind of on the line he'll help you   evaluate that um so there are certain courses that  you've taken that could count as prerequisites   um but the three main ones that we see people  needing as they're coming into the program are the   technical prereqs which are linear algebra python  programming and our programming and so we offer   those through a face-to-face boot camp typically  we're planning to do the bootcamp face-to-face   this year all all systems go at that point but if  not we've we've developed some pretty great online   delivery options and we actually were able to  deliver those I think in a really great fashion   Joe you taught one of the boot camp courses so  you could speak better to that than I can but   everyone seemed happy um I just uh just to say  a word about that so the boot camps um obviously   this past summer summer 2020 we were in a rough  spot with the with COVID um but the boot camps   went well um in fact you know doing them online  actually might have opened up some doors for um. A different way of approaching them next year  so at least a couple of them might be more of a   hybrid style where the lectures will be  available online as well as the face to face   so like you could get a sneak peek at the lecture  if you wanted to or come into the face-to-face so   um it really would be kind of uh interesting  um to see how that how that goes in the future   um and most of the students thought that the  content having it online was very helpful   um because if there was a trouble spot  they could go back and watch it again   you know something like that so there's  actually a big benefit to having some of those   videos ready to go and keep in mind our videos it  wasn't just like somebody like me sitting in my   you know closet taking a video like these videos  were produced you know professionally and they   looked really good um you you almost felt like  you were taking like a professional online class   so um it really does help we actually do have a  question now you might be able to answer this one   though yeah I saw that thanks for that um is  it varus or fairs sorry if I'm mispronouncing   I shouldn't probably even try but um I can I can  certainly share you know there's definitely still   some uncertainty out there as far as uh where the  entire world's headed so I don't think it's just   just the William and Mary program um but as  far as more like Ferris okay good thank you   um so I would say that we're so we we had a  lot of applications for students last year who   you know because of the pandemic weren't  able to attend and we we count those as   apple applications still we count them as  deferred to the 2021 cycle so if you look   at those together with the applicant pool from  last year we're trending just a little bit ahead   but we're definitely still open  and very open to applications   especially from from international  students at this point in time. But I would say that the the visa  restrictions and the travel restrictions   uh we'll for this early  deadline we'll probably see   a lot of those people applying when things  become a little bit clearer in the spring   but don't wait because the the longer you wait the  the more the the pool fills up and um dot dot dot. Yeah I can speak to that just kind of anecdotally  um I I teach in the undergraduate program as well   and I have a handful of students  that are applying to graduate schools   they're graduating this year and one of them  is waiting to apply but the majority of them   their faculty and some of our colleagues  across campus including Jonathan have   encouraged them to go ahead and apply now  to various programs because we do anticipate   you know hopefully I mean we're all optimistic  here um but you know once the pandemic kind of   gets behind us and people get healthier that the  the schools and more applicants are going to come   in and that just makes the competition harder not  that you all aren't excellent candidates and won't   get in any ways but you know it can't hurt to  get it be first in line right I will stress that   we have been able to to have in-person classes  throughout the fall and throughout the spring on a   a hybrid method we also give you gave students  the option to choose fully online but very few   actually did that so I don't know how  we stack up against other universities   out there but we have managed to hold  in-person classes throughout the program   yeah I I took my mask off but I actually  had three classes today face to face   so I'm in the building the the big the big  difference um and and don't let this deter you but   the big difference is um we're we're not supposed  to get within you know six feet of a student so   the perhaps the biggest difference is um all of  my office hours are virtual okay because I I can't   really talk to someone one-on-one um unless it's  you know from six feet away um but other than that   you know the classes are face to face um or mask  the mask if you will because we all obviously wear   a mask and whatnot and the other thing to keep  in mind about William and Mary and I'm very proud   of our students for this um William and Mary  our number of covid cases is actually very low   we we have 50 cases for the entire William and  Mary community 50 out of and we have over 8 000   students um and so I know 50 is a number you know  it's not it's more than zero but on the other hand   our students are very respectful of each other  they are following the rules and they are keeping   themselves healthy and also their their community  healthy and I'm very proud of our students   um and I've I've I've I'm very happy I'm shocked I  mean I would have assumed it would have been more   students that would have gotten sick but they have  done an excellent job and we as a community are   keeping each other safe and we're holding each  other accountable so you can feel safe here. I concur yeah. All right well if there aren't any other any other  questions um you can definitely feel free to reach   out to me or Mike after the session tonight you  can certainly email me directly and I'd be happy   to answer any questions you want to ask offline  but I definitely do want to thank you Dr. Wilkes   for your time tonight that was really extremely  informal informative and also entertaining and   thank you to all the attendees who came tonight um  I hope you found Dr. Wilkes talk as enjoyable as I   did again the program tonight was sponsored by the  MSBA at William and Mary so we hope that you all   maintain your interest and again if you do have  questions please reach out to me directly but if   if none remain I will let you all go and thank  you again have a good night everyone be safe.
