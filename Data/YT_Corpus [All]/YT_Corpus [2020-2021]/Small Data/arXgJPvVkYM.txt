 [Music] I've always been curious about the world around me inspired by the details of life that most people overlook if you really want to develop a powerful brand you have to feel the heartbeat of the consumer you have to see things from their eyes I do that food travel 300 days out of the year upwards of 70 countries tourists shopping eating and living with consumers what I'm searching for is the kind of emotional death that might lead to a brand opportunity or product innovation big enough to impact an entire generation life becomes multi-dimensional a more meaningful when you can see things from every direction the more you observe the more you know the more fulfilled you are this is what branding is all about he makes you second-guess the things that are the obvious and he always turns our heads to a place where everyone isn't looking he's been very much a fertile mind in the field of consumer behavior the most powerful product innovation share only one principle they combine to honor things in a completely new way every company require a different strategy and a different approach and every year I spend millions of dollars forecasting the trends of brands so that my clients are future proof Martin is really intuitive and that one of the things I appreciate about Martin's work is his understanding that what he did and what he said in 2000 and what he's doing and saying in 2015 is different and those are a reflection of his processing of what is the evolution of us as a species human desire is a puzzle my job is to put together the pieces in a way that creates an entirely new and undiscovered picture this is how to create a groundbreaking brand this is what I do [Music]
