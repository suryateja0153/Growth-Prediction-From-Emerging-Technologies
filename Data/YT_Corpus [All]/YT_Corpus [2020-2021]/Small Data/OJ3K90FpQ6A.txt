 Android studio version 3.5 is now available for download on the stable Channel this release is the culmination of the project marble a fault which means more stability better performances and polished features in the IDE and bail system it also includes updates from IntelliJ 2000 19.1 during the past few months our engineers fixed hundreds of bugs and memory leaks resulting in fewer interface phrases especially when editing data binding expression xml and two times faster linker analysis performance Andras to do has a maximum memory heap size of 1.2 gigabyte by default when you work on large project of this amount it may not be enough with Android studio 3.5 the IDE will recognize when new project needs more RAM and notify you to increase the memory heap size in a notification if your machines configuration allows it thanks to user report we realize that recent antivirus programs on Windows included Android studio build and installation directories as active scan targets since these folders have many small files created and removed all the time the i/o and CPU were partially taxed which in turns impact the overall building performance of Android studio with the 3.5 release and rich studio will now check various directories that could be impacted by this slowdown and compare them against the list of excluded and virus directories it finds that any of these folders are not being excluded you will see a pop-up notification and link to help you guide through the optimal setup on the emulator side we found out that Google Play services were aggressively running in the background because of the default power settings we switched the default to battery mode and background CPU usage declined by more than three times which avoids having the cooling fans triggered even when the emulators IDO we polish numerous features that are critical to Android developers Gradle sync was sometimes failing due to a cache issue when dependencies were periodically deleted to save disk space the layout editor experience is now smoother especially when you work on constraint between elements with constraint layout we also made it easier to upgrade to project imported from the previous version of Android studio with guided fixes to help you with the process finally for project including C++ scene makes built can now be up to 25% faster the deployment toolbar also got a nice UI tweak with a new target device drop down it helps you switch easily between them whenever you run your application and if you care about build speed and you probably do the Android Gradle plug-in 3.5 brings incremental annotation processing for data binding you need to set Android data binding incremental to true in your cradle properties check the great old documentation website to find other compatible and notation processors incremental annotation processor compilation wasn't available for cuddling until now with the newest coupling plug-in version you can add this line to your Gradle property file to enable it we had your feedback on instant run and we re implemented with a more practical approach from the ground up we call this new tool apply changes it use platform-specific api's from android oreo and higher to ensure reliable and consistent behavior unlike in central apply changes does not modify your apk you can read more about it on our blog post linked in the description below now application sizes are always something that's on our mind that's why we added support for conditional delivery for app bundles it allows you to set certain device configuration requirements for dynamic feature modules to be downloaded automatically during app install you can set conditional delivery based on hardware features such as OpenGL versions support for augmented reality API level or even use a country if you're running on a Chrome OS device starting from version 75 you will be happy to hear that we have now a dedicated depth file installer for Android studio 3.5 what's more it now supports deployment and debugging on USB connected vice we want to thank all the developers who helped us by sharing metrics and usage data anonymously on Android studio you can help us as well opting in the system settings data sharing section enjoy Android studio 3.5 and remember that we are listening to your feedback on our bug tracker check out early builds of Android studio 3.6 on the canary channel see you soon
