 it's so good to meet you so great to me it's really great hello come in it's so great to meet you my team and I are really excited that you've joined cumulus thank you I brought a presentation for visually maybe you can help me we need to be thinking about how to engage customers in a way that suits them but how do we actually do that let me walk you through it Salesforce for marketing allows us to put the customer at the center of everything we have a ton of marketing data but we can see it all in one place what can you take action on it yes for example we just got alert looks like we're missing an opportunity for pipeline and our Explorer credit card we use trusted data to find new target audiences like this frequent flyer persona oh that reminds me there was this customer who had a terrible experience with his bank know what I just went to cancel he posted about it on social and it started trending was it us know some other Bank but how can we keep that from happening to our brand for starters marketing sales and service all have a unified view of the customer and we can engage them in the moment with yes but how the key is to use data and AI to reach them with the right content on the right channel at the perfect time when they land on our site its personalized based on where they came from no matter what channel device or department they engage with we know it's the same person and our sales reps have the context that they need to personalize the conversation you're all set at the heart of everything is the Jurnee it's how we create seamless experiences at every stage of the customer lifecycle by connecting channels and business units from the first time they see an ad to the first time they sign up for a service to the moment they become a raving fan raving fan I like that but what if something goes wrong that'll be 3:25 let's say your customers traveling and their credit card gets stolen then we've got them covered they can alert and they can respond to it and text with a real person right away to get it resolved the service rep knows what country they're in what card they have they know who they are Hey look at this what is it a customer just posted about us Oh God he lost his credit card while he was travelling but we got him a replacement card the next day in the new country he was travelling to he already has more than a thousand likes he has 3 million followers this was great throw some time on my calendar I'd love to see that presentation you made [Music] you [Music]
