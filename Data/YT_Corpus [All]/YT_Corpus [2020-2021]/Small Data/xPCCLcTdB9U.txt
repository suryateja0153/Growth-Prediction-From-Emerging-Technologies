 not so long ago hybrid cars with the reserve of environmentally conscious school run parents people living or working in London's congestion charge zone and mini cab drivers looking to save a bit of money on fuel today everyone from Toyota to Porsche sells one they are increasingly becoming a realistic alternative to conventional petrol and diesel models and for many their more appealing than electric cars that have a limited range so in this top 10 list we're going to name the very best and worst hybrid and plug-in hybrid cars on sale right now and remember if you want to buy a new hybrid or any other new car head to the new car buying section on whatcar.com to find out how much money we could save you and subscribe to our channel to keep up to speed with the latest car reviews and advice Toyota didn't invent the hybrid powered vehicle but after many years of offering hybrids it knows a thing or two about making them there are four Toyota's in this list and first up is the Toyota CHR the striking small SUV combines a 1.8 litre petrol engine with an electric motor and it's a seriously cheap company car around town at low speeds when it's running on electric power alone it's very quiet but the downside to this car is when you ask for even gentle acceleration thanks to its frustrating CVT automatic gearbox the engine noise gets a bit grating if you want hybrid power in a slightly smaller package than the CHR then the Toyota Yaris hybrid is pretty much your only choice it combines small car nimbleness with hybrid efficiency so it can make a lot of sense for buyers living in big cities you get generous standard equipment as well as a spacious and practical interior plus in our real world tour mpg testing which you could read more about by clicking on the link in the top right hand corner it recorded the best town mpg of any car we've ever tested it's just a shame the interior design doesn't inspire much the BMW i8 shows that hybrids can also be fun to drive and hugely desirable this high-performance plug-in hybrid delivers serious pace and low emissions you can think of it as an efficient alternative to models like the Porsche 911 and Audi r8 but if you can keep the battery charged regularly to make good use of its all-electric range which should be around 20 miles in the real world then the BMW i8 s running costs should be a frat of its conventionally powered competitors it remains a truly groundbreaking car but it's number eight in this list because it's still very expensive to buy you were probably waiting for this one the Toyota Prius is like a Hollywood a-lister in the hybrid car world and for many it's become the default hybrid choice it's the first car on everyone's lips in this market and that's because it's one of the founding fathers of low emissions motoring in its latest fourth-generation form it competes directly with cars like the Ford Focus and Volkswagen Golf it offers excellent fuel economy brilliant refinement around town and low company car tax but it also has grabby brakes poor rear headroom and feels a bit sluggish out on the open road combining luxury car comfort with low emissions motoring seems like a no-brainer the S 560 II is a plug-in hybrid that keeps everything we love about the regular s-class like it's long-distance cruising comfort and interior luxury and adds a 3 liter v6 petrol engine under the bonnet that works with an electric motor that means you can travel for around 30 miles on electric power alone or use the electric motor to boost acceleration for luxurious low emission motoring look no further Honda's large SUV is now in its fifth generation and it's ditched diesel power altogether and replaced it for the first time with a hybrid option it's powered by a 2 liter petrol engine and an electric motor and while it might not score highly in the driving excitement stakes it's comfy refined and spacious you also get a decent amount of kit and an excellent driving position we are big fans of the BMW 5 Series for lots of reasons it's brilliant to drive beautifully classy inside and has an outstanding infotainment system this plug-in hybrid version the 530 II can cover about 20 miles on electricity alone in real-world conditions and the incredibly competitive co2 emissions which means lower benefit in contacts make it a hugely appealing company car choice if you do lots of motorway driving bear in mind a 520 D will offer better mpg though and the 530 is battery produces boot space by a fair chunk - now for the top three and in third place the Volvo xc90 t8 this plug-in hybrid version of the Volvo xc90 has an ace up its sleeve while there are rival plug-in hybrid SUVs like the Range Rover Sport P HEV and Porsche Cayenne Hybrid they have just five seats the t8 meanwhile is the only plug-in hybrid SUV on sale today with seven seats the xc90 t8 is generally more comfortable than those two rivals offers more standard equipment for the money and we say delivers the best package overall it's also the quickest xc90 you can buy by some margin and it doesn't compromise what makes Volvo's biggest offering so appealing in the first place it's really classy and spacious interior and it's huge boot in second place the ione die ionic it's an ideal hybrid choice combining low running costs and a relatively low price its main rival is the Toyota Prius but the ionic is more practical and smarter inside plus it's quicker and more fun to drive so overall it's a better all-round package we recommend the standard hybrid version of the ionic but you can also get it as a plug-in hybrid and as a fully electric model and in first place the very best hybrid car you can buy right now is the Toyota Corolla it's a fine family car with two hybrid versions that offer exceptionally low running costs even the lower powered 1.8 liter setup offers adequate acceleration for most situations while the more powerful 2-liter model is pleasantly punchy it's comfortable benefits from Toyotas exceptional reliability record and comes with loads of standard equipment if you want a family car and don't quite feel ready to go for something fully electric the new Corolla offers a hugely compelling reason to go hybrid but although these 10 cars are all brilliant examples of efficient low emission motoring at its finest there are some hybrid cars that aren't quite so recommendable the Infiniti q50 hybrid puts performance before efficiency with a combined output of 359 brake horsepower from its v6 petrol engine and electric motor it's certainly fast but the ride is too firm and the q50 isn't anywhere near as much fun to drive as its rivals then you've got the Lexus ct200h which compared to the best hybrid cars is unrefined and uncomfortable it does offer low company car tax rates but you're still better off looking at other hybrid examples in our list so there you have it the best and worst hybrid cars you can buy right now head to Walker comm for our extended written reviews on all of the cars mentioned here and don't forget to check out the new car buying section to see how much money you could save on your next car purchase and if you've enjoyed this video give us a like and hit the subscribe button to keep up to speed with all the latest new car reviews and buying advice [Music]
