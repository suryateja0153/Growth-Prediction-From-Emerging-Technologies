 Gregory, your friends are worried about you. They're here with me. Please come out. Gregory, I may have lost my temper earlier, but it was just a glitch. It won't happen again. It's been such a difficult day for all of us. Why don't you come home, and we can play a game together. It won't happen again. [SNIFFLING] It was just a glitch. Gregory, be still. I think she's found us. [SCREAM]
