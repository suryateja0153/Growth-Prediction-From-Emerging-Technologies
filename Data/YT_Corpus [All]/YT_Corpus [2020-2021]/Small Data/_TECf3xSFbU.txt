 Welcome to another MedCram COVID-19 update. Wanted to talk a little bit about the CDC data. We've been getting a lot of requests to comment regarding the weekly updates by select demographic and geographic characteristics and specifically this is the data that shows that apparently six percent of the patients who died that had COVID-19 written somewhere on their death certificate had only COVID-19 written on their death certificate so six percent of those only had COVID-19 written on their death certificate there's been some questions about that and what's raised so much attention is this section called comorbidities and says here table three shows the types of health conditions and contributing causes mentioned in conjunction with deaths involving COVID-19. It goes on to say that for six percent of deaths COVID-19 was the only cause mentioned now I think some have gone on to say that the true deaths from COVID-19 are only six percent of what we thought they were and what I want to show you is exactly where they're coming from and what does this mean so I want you to imagine that somebody comes into the hospital this gentleman here hypothetically has diabetes type 2 and unfortunately he gets a cut on his hand and some bacteria that lives on his skin called streptococcus pyogenes or some other streptococcus or even staph gets involved and it causes a skin infection a cellulitis but because he's immunocompromised because of his diabetes he develops a very bad case of what we call necrotizing fasciitis essentially what this is is flesh-eating bacteria he has to go into the hospital to get surgery but unfortunately despite antibiotics and full dose medications and attention develops septic shock he develops renal failure and finally unfortunately goes into cardiac arrest and he dies so let's look at a death certificate potentially and you can see here this death certificate is actually from the state of hawaii but it's pretty similar to the one that we use in california and i'm sure not too different than the other 48 states so the key here is you need to put down the immediate cause the final disease or condition resulting in death that's the most proximal cause here to death and then they say here to sequentially list conditions if any leading to the cause listed on line a enter the underlying cause the disease or injury that initiated the events resulting in death last now it's interesting because i got this example from the state of hawaii as for the guidance for certifying COVID-19 deaths let's talk about that in a little bit but if we go back to our example of this type 2 diabetic who developed necrotizing fasciitis came into the hospital had septic shock renal failure and then cardiac arrest the most proximal thing that caused death was the cardiac arrest although most cases cardiac arrest would be the most proximal cause but reporting agencies like us to use more descriptive terms in terms of what our patients die from the heart is always going to stop and that's going to tell you when death occurs except in rare circumstances but here clearly one of the things towards the top of this would be necrotizing fasciitis and then you might be able to say that maybe type 2 diabetes was an underlying contributing factor because we know that type 2 diabetics are more immunocompromised but the key point here is that if you were to ask somebody hey mr. smith what did he die of? well did he die of type 2 diabetes? no he didn't really die of type 2 diabetes it's not like he was going to die of type 2 diabetes anyway this was something that was a major turning point. He was a control type 2 diabetic and all of a sudden he developed necrotizing fasciitis so that's something that's really important but clearly it's not like septic shock just coincidentally appeared no it was caused by the necrotizing fasciitis same thing with the renal failure the renal failure was caused by the necrotizing fasciitis and the cardiac arrest ultimately was caused by these other things but they all go back to this inciting factor of the necrotizing fasciitis so let's go and take a look at the COVID-19 stuff and clearly here you can see that people who die of COVID-19 as far as i know and i've taken care of many patients with COVID-19 all of them who died had abnormal chest x-rays and therefore could be said have pneumonia even asymptomatic people with COVID can have abnormal chest x-rays and then of course if it gets so bad that they die they go into cardiac arrest or they have acute respiratory distress syndrome or ARDS, they go into respiratory failure now it's not as though this pneumonia just sort of happened coincidentally in COVID-19 patients. no, in fact this is just like the septic shock or the renal failure with the necrotizing fasciitis COVID-19 causes pneumonia don't miss that COVID-19 causes acute respiratory distress syndrome these are comorbidities in the sense that yes they're there happening at the same time but make no mistake they are not usually there coincidentally they're there because they were caused by COVID-19. and so you can see here clearly that if you follow the recommendations of these state reporting authorities that really COVID-19 should never really be at the top line becauseCOVID-19 kills through doing things you can go back and look at our videos how coronavirus kills and for the most part it's people who go into ARDS or acute respiratory distress syndrome now of course there's other exceptions to that people can get strokes people can go into just fulminant cardiac arrest certainly that happens and we know that they can get blood clots pulmonary embolism so certainly that can happen as well but COVID-19 should really not be on the top line here and how do we know this we know this because people come in that are not really that sick and they go to the regular floor and as they get worse in terms of their oxygenation we start to see that they go into ARDS the ARDS happens after the COVID-19 positive test so if we go back to the CDC website and of course we'll put a link in the description below we can see what these other conditions contributing to deaths involving coronavirus disease are let's take a look at these influenza and pneumonia that's a co-morbidity in the sense but it can be caused pneumonia could be caused by coronavirus here's chronic lower respiratory diseases obviously these are going to be there before coronavirus so that makes sense adult respiratory distress syndrome here we go again actually the term here is acute respiratory distress syndrome they've actually used the wrong term here on the cdc website but acute respiratory distress syndrome is caused by COVID-19 respiratory failure and respiratory arrest is caused by COVID-19 so they always should be there together what about circulatory diseases certainly hypertensive diseases can be there before coronavirus ischemic heart disease can be there before coronavirus cardiac arrest unfortunately something that is caused by the coronavirus cardiac arrhythmia the same thing heart failure the same thing cerebral vascular diseases like stroke same thing sepsis same thing these all can be caused by covet 19. obviously malignant neoplasms are not caused by COVID-19 they're a co-morbidity diabetes is a comorbidity obesity obviously is a comorbidity and the list goes on and on and on so the bottom line is if you look at this the fact that six percent of the deaths COVID-19 was the only cause mentioned please explain to me how COVID-19 kills somebody without causing an pneumonia without causing a cardiac arrest without causing a stroke please tell me how that happens what does it look like when someone dies of only COVID-19 the reason why i ask is because the bottom line for why six percent of the deaths COVID-19 was the only cause mentioned in my humble opinion is that the death certificate was filled out incorrectly they should have put a more proximal cause a cause proximal to death something like pneumonia or cardiac arrest because COVID-19kills because of organs that shut down and no longer work that's practically how all infectious diseases kill they cause an overwhelming infection which causes multi-organ dysfunction and either cardiac arrest respiratory arrest or some other devastating injury so despite that understanding some people have put forth the notion that the six percent figure is the true COVID death rate because all the other things were comorbidities that people were gonna die of anyway so if that were the case and you were to look at total mortality for the united states let's look at the first graph here if in fact it was misclassified as a COVID death when it really shouldn't have been a COVID of death it was a death that was going to happen anyway we know how many people die on average every year in the united states and so what it should look like this graph is it really should look no different than any other year so you'd have the small increase and this would represent the six percent of all the COVID deaths where only COVID is listed on the death certificate but what is the trend that we're actually seeing with the data and remember the data was looked at back in may by the washington post with a article titled excess u.s deaths hit estimated 37,000 in pandemics early days far more than previously known and here's the seasonal average as it starts to go down after the regular flu season notice this is sixty thousand fifty thousand forty thousand and you can see here that there's the reported COVID-19 deaths but in fact the death rate is actually higher so there's an excessive death rate other than those reported for COVID-19 so it appears that these deaths would not have happened anyway here's data from the united kingdom notice here on the y-axis that we start at 0 and we go to 20,000. and so you can see here that the blue is the average deaths over the last four years that's 2019 all the way back to 2015. and then for 2020 we can see here that the deaths almost doubled at a certain point there in the spring so i don't think that these people were going to quote die anyway unquote so my thoughts on it are if you want to know what the impact is of COVID-19 on the death rate in the united states then look at the excess deaths a lot of you also asked about this bradykinin hypothesis of COVID-19. now apparently this computer analyzed a number of genes and highlighted the renin-angiotensin system which we knew was involved because of SARS-CoV-2 hitting the ace-2 receptor which is involved in the renin-angiotensin system but we also know that bradykinin which is a polypeptide is also metabolized by the ace enzyme and that this may not just be a cytokine storm but also a bradykinin storm as well bradykinin being this molecule which can cause a lot of these issues and problems including swelling including fluid retention etc and as it says here in the article in the kinin system bradykinin which is the key peptide causes blood vessels to leak allowing fluid to accumulate in organs and tissue and in COVID-19 patients the system was unbalanced as we've talked about people with the disease have increased gene expression for the bradykinin receptors and for enzymes known as calacrines that activate the kinin pathway and they publish this paper and we'll give you a link to it in the description below and what they show in the article is a very complex system of interactions that may explain a lot of what we see in COVID-19. one of the points that was brought up in the article that i found very interesting was where it says here that Vitamin D may potentially be useful because it's involved in the renin angiotensin system and may reduce levels of REN, another compound involved in the system and of course you know that we've been talking about Vitamin D for some period of time now and speaking about Vitamin D there's a very interesting article that was published and i'll give you the reference to this article that looked at 76 consecutive patients that were randomized to aggressive Vitamin D analog supplementation versus placebo as it says here this was a parallel pilot, randomized, open label, double masked, clinical trial, and this was done fairly early on, because at the time, the standard of care was a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin but these patients were allocated in a two-to-one ratio for calcifediol to no calcifediol calcifediol is a Vitamin D analog that actually gets better absorption and is more potent it's used often by nephrologists for patients with parathyroid issues and in this case the patients received a pretty hefty dose at 532 micrograms on the first day and then a repeat of 266 micrograms on days 3 and 7. now in this case 50 patients were treated with calcifediol and 26 were not treated so to show you in terms of a flow sheet what happened they took 76 patients 50 of them were randomized to calcifediol and 26 no calcifediol of those 50, 2% were admitted to the intensive care unit and overall zero percent of them died and all of them were discharged whereas those that did not receive it 50 percent of them went to the ICU and 7.7 percent of them ended up dead and in terms of the differences between these two they looked at uni-varied analysis and multi-varied analysis and there was statistical significance so the conclusion of the authors were that calcifediol seems to be able to reduce severity of the disease but larger trials with groups properly matched will be required to show a definitive answer. And what they're referring to there is that the number of patients in each group was small enough that there wasn't a perfect match in terms of the differences in populations they do say here that the randomization generated groups with comparable percentage of unfavorable risk factors as there was no significant difference in subjects with at least one risk factor, except for high blood pressure and diabetes mellitus, known risk factors for unfavorable disease progression, which were more frequent in patients not treated in calcifediol however even considering these factors calcifediol significantly decreased the need for ICU admission in COVID-19 patients in a way not previously reported they also go on to talk about calcifediol (which is a prescription medication) versus just Vitamin D itself. Notice what they say here furthermore to correct Vitamin D deficiency in severely sick patients much higher doses of Vitamin D than usual are needed. Our study does not include a comparison with cholecalciferol the native Vitamin D3 form and nutritional substrate for calcified calcifidiol so we cannot conclude that calcifidiol is superior to vitamin d itself nevertheless calcifediol may have some advantages over native Vitamin D it has a more reliable intestinal absorption and can rapidly restore serum concentrations of 25-hydroxy Vitamin D (25OHD) as it does not require hepatic 25-hydroxylation. So, I thought this was an interesting article because we've been giving our patients in the hospital daily supplementation of Vitamin D and if you want to learn more about Vitamin D I suggest that you look at our update 97. Also look at one of the very first videos that we did on this way back five-six months ago in update 30, and check out what I use in terms of supplementation in update 59. Also don't forget to check out medcram.com. We cover topics like EKG, how to read a chest x-ray, how to interpret a CBC, and, coming soon, how to interpret a basic metabolic panel.
