 Potential COVID-19 Treatment Breakthrough Led by Pitt Scientists Scientists at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine identified the smallest biological molecule to date This extremely tiny molecule was found in antibodies and was successfully isolated Despite being 10 times smaller than a full-sized antibody, it could neutralize SARS-CoV-2 with higher potency than its larger kin Study author John Mellors said: "Ab8 not only has potential as therapy for COVID-19, but it also could be used to keep people from getting SARS-CoV-2 infections" The tiny antibody fragment is the variable, heavy chain domain of an antibody type Scientists found this fragment in over 100 billion potential antibody candidates, which are intended to be bait for the coronavirus They created an experimental drug based on this fragment This lead has been motivated by the convalescent plasma therapy for COVID-19 Since there is a problem in convalescent plasma, they looked into genes of several antibodies capable of blocking the virus The genes might enable the massive production of synthetic antibodies The fragment, Ab8, was one of the therapeutic antibody candidates assessed from antibody libraries These libraries were made using data from human blood samples Among candidates they tested, Ab8 had the best potency against SARS-CoV-2 In non-animal tests, Ab8 completely blocked the pathogen at very low concentrations In mice models, they tested the efficacy at different dose concentrations All doses resulted in the pathogen being blocked by Ab8 Even at the lowest dose, the tiny fragment decreased the levels of SARS-CoV-2 in mice by 10 times, compared to untreated mice They utilized the same dose concentrations in hamsters The fragment successfully prevented and treated SARS-CoV-2 infection in hamsters The team already designed a prototype of the Ab8-based experimental drug They called it PittCoVac, a vaccine candidate for COVID-19 The prototype resembles a spiky Band-Aid-like patch to eliminate the need for refrigeration and needles Other design concepts include the inhalable and intradermal drug versions These concepts replace the intravenous drip delivery mode normally used in monoclonal antibody therapies Researchers think that the small size of Ab8 improved its flexibility in drug delivery It may be easier to aerosolize the antibody fragment without decreasing its potency This may lead to a preventative form of the drug In a real-world setting, a device may aerosolize the drug in hospital areas considered hotspots The method may protect healthcare workers from SARS-CoV-2 infection The results were published in the journal Cell
