 next we are going to learn how to organize and summarize quantitative data what will change when we consider the small discrete type of data consider the following data set obtained from asking 20 students how many hours they worked per day note that this discrete data is classified as small discrete as rarely a part-time employee works more than 8 hours per day can we treat this data set the same way we treated qualitative data sets previously the answer is yes we can list all possible values do the tally find the frequencies and the total and then compute the relative frequencies so we can construct a relative frequency distribution table for small discrete data the same way we did earlier for qualitative data can we construct the frequency bar chart for small discrete data the same way we did it earlier for ordinal data the answer is yes and how about the relative frequency bar chart the answer is yes as well however there are a few things that we are going to do differently this time since quantitative unlike qualitative data is associated with real number line we will draw the bars touching each other so that no number on the number line is left uncovered unless the corresponding frequency is zero to highlight these differences between the quantitative and qualitative data we're going to call this type of charts histograms instead of bar charts as expected a histogram that uses frequencies on the vertical axis is called a frequency histogram and similarly a histogram that uses relative frequencies on the vertical axis is called a relative frequency histogram we discuss how to visually summarize small discrete data in short we can treat small discrete data the same way as qualitative data except the fact that the bar charts are now called histograms and the bars must have no gaps in between unless the corresponding frequency is zero
