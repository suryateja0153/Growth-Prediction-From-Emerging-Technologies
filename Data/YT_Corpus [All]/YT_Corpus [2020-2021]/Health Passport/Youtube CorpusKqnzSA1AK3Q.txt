 and tom already there are questions about whether could people could be required to get the vaccine what's the latest thinking on that yeah so president-elect biden has said he would not make it mandatory but we may see some schools and healthcare facilities require it you know 24 states already require health care workers to get the flu vaccine all 50 states have certain vaccine requirements for students and some companies may require their employees to get vaccinated osha has said in the past that employers can require flu vaccines but you can imagine that could create some conflict if that becomes an issue over the next year yeah i think they're hoping people will just want to get the vaccine and get that protection tom thank you you
