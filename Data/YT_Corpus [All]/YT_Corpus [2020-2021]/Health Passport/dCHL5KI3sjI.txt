 Yeah... This is one of my most awaited moments in this trip Since I get to visit the famous Santiago Bernabéu stadium The home stadium of Real Madrid The ticket is 25 EUR/pax Let's go! On the taxi, I tried to ask the drive to help me pronounce the name of this stadium, but it's way too difficult for me "Santiago" is easy, but the rest is... Ber... na... bell.... bow... I've tried like hundreds times already but still haven't got it right I don't know how we say it in Vietnam, perhaps something like Ber-na-bell or beau, etc But it's correctly pronounced as "Berna-bEh-oo" Well, at least I tried, it's still understandable though At first, I thought 25 EUR is an expensive price for a ticket, but now, I think it's worth it As in the catalog, there are 11 categories and areas that we can visit among other activities and exhibition And the first of the list is the Panoramic View of the stadium from here As Real Madrid is entitled "The Best Football Club in the World" Our next stop is this trophy room with the exhibition of all the trophies and medals they have won Such a fortune! So impressive! And on my right are the videos of memorable moments which give me goosebumps This is the trophy of 1982's season They seem to liked big trophies in the past This one is even bigger than me, how can they hold it? But it's stunning There's another one in here shaped like a galleon It's from the 1989's season The Colombino Trophy Walking in this room, we get to know the club's achievements and why they are entitled "The Best Football Club in the World" As you can see, on the wall are the club's logos in periods of time Starting from 1902 until 2001, and also the club's current logo In room number 3, we'll experience a unique feeling We'll close our eyes and just listen to the beat It's like the heartbeat I'm so excited already This room will help you feel the thrill and excitement of this wonderful sport Can you hear it? In front of me are the special trophies for outstanding players This is the Golden Shoe trophy That's Ronaldo Ronaldo received another Golden Shoe in 1997 That's the Golden Ball Zidane's over here That's Michael Owen These 3 trophies are belonged to Cristiano Ronaldo in 3 years straight 2008, 2011, and 2013 And another trophy of Cristiano Ronaldo over here Wait, all of the trophies in this row are his Here we have the Golden Glove trophies for the best goalkeepers in entire Spain This one belongs to the legendary Casillas who helped Spain won the FIFA World Cup in 2010 These all are other trophies of Cristiano Ronaldo How cool is this? So many trophies In room number 4, we'll get to take photos with the trophy And of course, you'll have to pay for those photos I'll pass that room Let's move on to room number 5... oh, it's the pitch The pitch isn't so pretty as it's not in the season now Just like the Atletico de Madrid stadium in my previous episode Number 6 on the list is watching the game in the V.I.P seats Unlike the regular seats, the V.I.P's are more comfortable with leather Now, number 7, we'll get into the players' dressing room This is also the health station in case of injury Number 8: sitting in the area for the coaches and reserve players It's quite comfortable with the shade But sitting here makes me nervous Number 9: we'll "travel" in the players' bus These "windows" are actual screens to help us feel like a real star player with fans and reporters outside The bus's "moving" We're even escorted by the police Behind me is the registration booth for Real Madrid's fan club It would cost 20 EUR to create a fan account Number 10 is the Communication room You can take photo on the stage up there And now is the time for Q&A section That's the entire stadium tour The last place on the list is the souvenir shop Gosh, the shop's huge We can find anything in here Look, these uniforms have player's names on them After a tour around the stadium with history lessons and emotional moments, we'll surely want to have some souvenirs And where's the better place to buy them than this But the goods are worth every penny since they are all unique and cannot be found elsewhere After the tour, I suddenly want to be a professional soccer player Perhaps in another life, I'll be a famous player
