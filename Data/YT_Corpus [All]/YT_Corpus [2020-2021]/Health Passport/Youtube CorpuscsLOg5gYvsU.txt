 I HAD A FUN TIME CAN WE CAN WE CLOSE OUT WITH THIS BURGER KING'S STORY THINK PEOPLE THINK ALL RIGHT. BURGER KING HAS ANNOUNCED NEW PLANS TO REDUCE COW METHANE AND IF YOU'RE WONDERING WHAT THAT IS ACTUALLY HOW I HAD A SORT OF FAIR YET. YEAH. YES, THEY WOULD LIKE TO HELP REDUCE KHALAF ART WITH A SMALL CHANGE TO THEIR DIETS THIS WILL HELP REDUCE METHANE EMISSIONS FROM COWS WHICH ARE ONE OF THE KEY CONTRIBUTORS TO CLIMATE CHANGE. ACCORDING TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 50 TO 65% OF ALL METHANE EMISSIONS COME FROM HUMAN ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING FACTORY FARMING. HURRICANE HAS PREVIOUSLY USES BLACK SHUT MENU ITEMS THAT PROMOTE SUBSTANTIALLY IN AND HEALTH INITIATIVES, IT'S AIMING FOR ALL OF THEIR FOODS TO BE FREE OF ARTIFICIAL INGREDIENTS BY THE END OF THIS YEAR AND STARTING TODAY, THE PHRASE ON THE NEW DIET IS AT SOME RESTAURANTS AND WHOPPER SANDWICH IS AND SELECT A BURGER KING RESTAURANT IN AUSTIN PORTLAND, NEW YORK MIAMI AIR. BUT RIGHT HERE IN LOS ANGELES. SO YOU CAN GET A WHOPPER THAT DOESN'T HAVE A COW FARTS IS BASICALLY THE MORE ON THIS STORY I WONDER IF IT TASTE DIFFERENT. I HOPE NOT. OH IF I WAS GOING SAY I HOPE SO. NO I HOPE THAT PART OF THE TASTE OF A BURGER KING BURGER IS NOT THE CALIPH ART.
