 ochio koto Couture and welcome to this afternoon's briefing I'm pleased to report that today there are no new cases of covert 19 in New Zealand so our total number of cases remains at 1,150 three that's confirmed cases and the total confirmed improbable at 1503 and other five cases have been categorized as recovered and that then brings the total to 1450 - which is 97 percent of all cases there are no additional deaths to report and today there is just one person in hospital still in Middlemore hospital and not requiring intensive care yesterday our labs processed six thousand one hundred and thirteen tests our grand total now is two hundred and forty four thousand eight hundred and thirty-eight completed I want to give a reminder today about flu vaccines and to encourage Kiwis to get their vaccine especially as the weather noticeably starts to get a bit colder you will recall that this year we had all ordered a record number of 1.7 six million vaccines of the southern hemisphere vaccine and that's now I've been open for everyone to be able to get vaccinated for the last two and a half weeks we are still asking our immunization providers though to just keep back some of that vaccine for our high needs groups who may need it over coming months for example pregnant women we have also employs a secured with far make an extra three hundred and sixty thousand doses of the northern hemisphere vaccine which were available those have arrived in the country they have passed through the regulatory process and have been approved for use in healthy people aged three to 64 now this vaccine is not quite the same four components as the southern hemisphere vaccine it's an absolute match for two of the four components provides some partial protection for a third and the other strain of virus that isn't it is not a match for the existing southern hemisphere scene however the advice has been very clear from our experts that this would using this vaccine would afford useful protection to Kiwis and that will now be available to be used once the supplies of our southern hemisphere vaccine have been all given to people so that vaccine as I say is available and for order from this week and I would encourage Kiwis again to go and get the flu jab and that will mean we'll have a total of around 2.1 million doses of flu vaccine available to be used this winter it is of much more value in people's arms then it is sitting on the shelf so please do go out and get your flu jab just a comment on funerals and tangihanga since we moved to a little of all to just over a week ago funeral directors have been able to register funerals in tangihanga to enable groups of up to 50 to participate if they can confirm that they've got public health precautions in place and I'm pleased to say that since the start of alert level to around 650 funerals and tangy house have been registered some of these will be relate to the same event because they there may be a registration for a service at a church and also one at a crematorium by really pleased to see that that system has been working very well and enabling families and friends to get together in grieve for lost family members an update on the New Zealand covert tracer app we continue to be encouraged by the number of Kiwis who registered as a time a day to day 236,000 registrations for the app so if people haven't downloaded I continue to encourage you to do so it will help us in our overall efforts to contact you quickly if we need to say no to noting that identifying tracing and isolating contacts as already quickly is a very key part of our overall effort businesses are going through the process of getting their QR code and to date 6500 QR codes have been generated by businesses understand yesterday some people with some phone models head trouble locating well some people locating the app in the Google Play Store we've worked with Google to make sure it is much more obvious and can be found more easily and also there were some phone users who had trouble either downloading the app or registering we've already done updates to try and fix any bugs that were there and this is something that of course happens when a new app has made available we did some user testing beforehand but of course the airport tried on every single model of phone but we are addressing those issues as they arise and also today we've published draft standards in the related specifications for developers of other apps who will then if they use those standards and specifications be able to have via app use that single New Zealand business number related QR code so there will be only then a need for businesses or president premises to display that single QR code that is related to the unique New Zealand business number and just to confirm a word on privacy the personal information that people provide when they register with the app is held only in the Ministry of Health only for contact tracing and any other data is held only on your phone and you release it if requested and if you wish to if you are contacted on a final note is you'll be aware bars and pubs reopened today and really level to mind you while we remain an alert level to they do so under the same requirements that are already in place for hospitality venues that is to protect everybody's health and make sure we are not compromising the gains we have already made with code 19 so that includes of course limiting physical interaction between patrons from different groups and of course between staff and customers it will be a great chance to catch up with a friend and support your local business so this may not however be the time to publicly try out any new dance moves you have learned over the log down so do have fun if you're heading out to a bar or pub in coming days but do support the staff by ensuring that you do so from your seat and you within your small group and just finally a word on the contact details that you will be or really being asked to provide when you visit a hospital tality venue please ensure you give the correct details the whole purpose of this is to ensure that you can be contacted to protect your health and of course the health of your family and the wider community should it be necessary I'm open to questions so since well there are two hundred and thirty six thousand registrations total and I think when I spoke yesterday was around ninety thousand so it's about another one hundred and forty six thousand of my Mets is correct as many as possible and just a word on that I know there's been some articles about the limited functionality of the app at the moment and I agree however even by registering even by registering that means that we have up to date contact details for people who have registered that we can use so that is of benefit to every individual who has already downloaded the app the QR code functionality will be of increasing value and of course we are adding further functionality over coming weeks to make sure that the Epis of even more value to individuals but also to businesses which will mean then they won't need to continue to record people's details not as you know I think it's it's good progress there is a bit of a process they need to go to through of course not all businesses are open at the moment but I'll just equally encourage businesses to go through that process download the QR code and display it and that will help both you and other Kiwis design your own bespoke solutions and did you consider acquiring any existing apps buying the rights yes we we didn't consider buying any companies however we did consider the full range of options here and we were looking to see what other countries were doing and I can say that we had many many offers of solutions however we did decide to go down the route of developing our own app because then we could be confident about what what information was being collected what was being done with that information and of course it allowed us to then develop and EDD through the functionalities once people had downloaded that app and I know there's also been some commentary that it's taken a long time I daresay when a government agency develops a net that is not the same as a private provider we have to go through a very thorough process of course particularly around privacy issues ensuring it links with other government priorities and approaches and of course in this case getting Kevin at approval to go ahead with an app like this which was very important so I think it's a it's a good solution and it will be even more useful now the intention is that it works with all versions four days running no new cases one patient hospital it all sounds pretty promising it is very promising and I'm feeling encouraged as we all showed by that and I think that then means we're in a good position to provide advice to cabinet to make a decision next Monday about the the possibility of increasing the numbers and groups and of course the key thing here is that because as again we've had quite high numbers of tests being done of both symptomatic and asymptomatic people where we just increasingly are confident that there aren't these hidden pockets out there and that really then does allow us to start thinking seriously about what would have moved to a Louisville one look like well the intention was even when the decision was made to go into a little - to review that after two weeks and I think you will be able to infer from the numbers that everything remains promising remembering that it's not just the time we've spent in a Louisville - but actually the preceding time in a Louisville three so I think all the indications are positive I think it's it's a really good outcome and the you know the thing here is that even those active cases are ones from some time ago so we we are increasingly confident that we have successfully broken that chain of transmission here on shore and it gives two things from that one is that's that's a good an outcome as we might have hoped for from the lockdown and Aleut level four and again we were able to do that for a shorter period as possible and open up it means we can open up more rapidly I think the second point is that then means we've got an even stronger focus on ensuring our border is very robust in our measures there but also a focus on how we might put in place the systems and processes that would allow us to start to open that cautiously with Australia and then potentially beyond not especially and I have talked to that already this week so the aim would be to move as quickly as possible to open up group size for all group activities and of course our church and faith-based gather gatherings are a really important one and I know there's a real keenness for some of those those groups to get together as soon as possible near future where the testing volumes will run out of people so that's a good point so as we move further into a loot level - and think about a loot level one the testing will will be still on - two distinct groups first of all symptomatic people so people with respiratory symptoms now we know because of low levels of viruses circulating in the community there will be less of those now then there might be in a couple of months time when we start to head into winter so those people will all be tested however we are reviewing the case definition at the moment there are two technical advisory group just to make sure it is appropriate for a situation we find ourselves in where we've got very low or what appears to be no level of the virus circulating inside the country but we still want to make sure that we're not missing any cases if they do if people do present with symptoms but alongside there is this other surveillance testing which is will be particularly targeted at groups who might be at higher risk so people walking working at the border in particular a mule - made airline international airline staff and as well as their peps people working and healthcare and other institutions racing well one of the things on public transport now is that most of the most of the journeys are taken by people using the card some sort of payment card to get on and off and I know here in Wellington for example even though public transport is free at the moment for example on buses and in the theory's people required to use their snap account to clock on and off so that does provide a record of use of public transport that can be used for contact tracing purposes will your snapper is registered to an individual bender mandatory though I think they've received they will be mandatory so you don't have any potential well two things here one is yes oh I understand in a family member who's been on the bus they didn't hit a snapper and that's I think so I think that's helpful but the important thing here is of course if someone has a case or a contact that they can recall where they have been so what I would imagine is that it doesn't leave a gap because people will remember where they hit we're and when they may have traveled over the last few days at the moment we've got a detailed plan being developed with proper epidemiological advice about the sort of sampling we can and should be doing and we're and so we'll make that plan available next week surveillance testing no we haven't had any other concerns relayed and Auckland Regional Public Health is our biggest Public Health Unit at serving the biggest population so yes it will be a challenge the scale up that will be required there and we are working very closely with them and there is additional funding that the government has signal will be there to do that so we're working very closely with Auckland Regional Public Health and the other public health units about how they will scale up and there's also because we've asked them all to put a plan and they've all got good ideas about how to do that and how to be able to scale up that capable very quickly I can't speak to the later point that I'm happy to have a look at that yes they are engaging and one of the areas we've asked the public health units to look at as they develop their plans and really to scale up is to think about how they can work much more closely with Maori and Pacific providers and communities who will be able to assist with that contact tracing and those communities if required yes we do ask people to record ethnicity so that that will and that just helps us get a picture of who is registering and then of course if there is a case and we need to trace contacts it's very important and very useful for us with our planning and deployment of resources to know people's ethnicity because it helps us to target funding and service provision and communities that might need it yes so the registrations are coming through from funeral directors who will be working with with Mirai and so on around tangihanga and of course we do have some dedicated Maori funeral directors there's a group of those so they're amongst those who are registering those tangihanga quite a while since we've had the less covered the 19 related death do you expect that we've seen the last of that or is there a risk of mulling it's my great hope that we have seen the last of those and as you'll be aware those deaths have all occurred and people with in older people many of them are so shattered with our ages of intial care outbreaks so my hope is that as time goes by those people will have recovered and are therefore unlikely to to read to our states there I should also say that over the last few months in any cases where there's been an unexplained or sudden death in the community and that becomes a coroner's case in those cases covert 19 testing has also been done as part of just checking that we're not missing any cases out in the community and all those tests have come back I would think for the time being that would be several thousand a day we would we would be wanting to do quite high levels of Sentinel testing right across the country it may be somewhere between one and two thousand but that will be very much a part of the advice we give to each of the public health units about where they should be testing and how many people they should be testing and for some groups for example all those working in border agencies that might require actually just regular testing of the same people in fact you might want to test all those people working at the border over a period of time I guess specters are feeding into it like I suppose concentration of previous cases or address populations that sort of stuff one of the main issues that you're trying to okay well different from the testing we have been doing to date which has been still testing widely in the community to see if there is asymptomatic infection out there or people who may have been infected and are still have residual virus we haven't found any of late years you know so different from there this will be particularly targeted at areas where we think there is higher risk and again that would be largely around the border that will also be perhaps people who are working in healthcare settings and it will be alongside the testing of people who are symptomatic with with the relevant symptoms not necessarily if we're in a situation where we're very confident there isn't virus circulating out in the community what we will be wanting to do though is make sure that all populations have access to symptomatic testing very readily and that was a big part of our effort over the last few months so the mobile testing our C backs out widely in the community well on the first question we're asking all providers to hold some vaccine back for their for example older people or pregnant women who they haven't had a chance to vaccinate yet although we're been seven weeks now since vaccination opened up to those groups we will also be holding back 20,000 doses in our national store to be that can be ordered if there are people in those groups and on the second question this is because the the northern hemisphere vaccine is a is a good that not full match with the four strains in the southern hemisphere vaccine and so we want our people who are most vulnerable to flu to be able to get the vaccine that's got the fall for strains covered GPS be required to tell their patients yes that will be part of it and providing information about what it doesn't doesn't cover that again one of the the main reason that we went ahead and ordered this vaccine when it was offered was because the specialist advice was very clear it's it's much better for people to have some protection than no protection and it will be absolutely useful for and provide you know good protection for Kiwis who do get that northern hemisphere of the the southern hemisphere vaccine though that had all all gone it's all actually it's essentially manufactured to order at the start of the season so we were very fortunate to get those extra three to four hundred thousand doses we did get ahead of the season colleague at what point do you think it could be safe for non New Zealand passport holders to travel here the exception to be made for example for athletes to come through the quarantine process and come into New Zealand well that's one of the issues will now be able to look at if we are confident about how things are on shore but then we are also confident about our border arrangements that we've got good robust quarantine and and supervised self management our supervised isolation procedures in place and then is also we are looking at the role of testing in that setting and we will be moving to testing everybody before they leave that even after the 14 days or before they leave self isolation or isolation or quarantine well we need to be again we need to be confident in our border processes and also that there's there's a need for people to come in and I think at the moment it's it's restricted to New Zealanders and and New Zealand passport holders or permanent residents but the opportunity will be veered in to start opening it up begin as long as we're confident we can control the risk at the border that will be the key thing no I don't have any timeframe you're planning on testing everyone not just from quarantine but also from managed isolation that's right before they depart from that and in here off to their business yep so there will be one of the things we're doing just again as a as part of their being really confident we have got everything nailed down at the border thank you very much
