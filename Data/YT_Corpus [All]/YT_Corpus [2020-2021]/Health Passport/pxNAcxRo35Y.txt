 Travel can be an empowering experience, but it can also be one that tests you in ways you never imagined. Being diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease changed how I see the world ...and how I navigate it. I find road tripping is freeing, it’s a way to cover a lot of ground, but at my own pace. This is what’s special about slow travel. Yellow is a color of warmth to me. It’s the rising sun over the desert, or its many tones hitting Cathedral Rock. It means agency and the chance to shape my own journey. There's no denying that life has thrown me its challenges, but yellow reminds me to face life with joy and curiosity. I saw some of America’s most spectacular wonders and never worried about what I might encounter next. Nature is truly the best medicine, and exploring it with confidence means I can see it, and myself, at its most radiant. I’m Anne McIsaac, this is what yellow means to me.
