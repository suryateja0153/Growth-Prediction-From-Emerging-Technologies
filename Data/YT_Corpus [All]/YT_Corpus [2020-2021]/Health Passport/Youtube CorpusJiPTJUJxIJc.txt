 antibodies are a major sticking point throughout the twists and turns of this extremely peculiar pandemic but just how important is the role of antibody testing in battling the spread of covet 19. take a look months ago during the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic our country had a major testing shortage to detect active coronavirus infection but antibody tests were widely available so people flocked to get one however there is still confusion about what an antibody test really is antibody tests check your blood by looking for disease specific antibodies which may tell you if you had a past infection with the virus that causes coping 19. antibodies are proteins that help fight infections and can protect against getting a disease again but antibody tests won't tell you if you have a current active coping 19 infection so how reliable our antibody test our investigative producer leslie marcus reports kobit 19 antibody tests like this one are often seen as the passport to coronavirus free life but they're not always accurate so today i made appointments to get several antibody tests all from different manufacturers to see if i in fact have antibodies now i don't know if i've ever had coronavirus but i might have been exposed due to traveling so i'm very curious what my results will be i've arrived at my first test here we go there we go it's gonna be a little quick okay one two three i got my first test results back and they're negative for coronavirus antibodies so i'm on my way from my second test dr zugoni tell me about the antibody test you're going to be giving me today yep so this is a rapid antibody test by helgen it has 100 sensitivity and over 97 specificity which are some of the best i've seen in the industry we're looking at two different antibodies so igg is past infection igm is current infection although there is still that initial window where we might not pick it up because the antibodies aren't developed yet a nice deep breath in poke you're a good bleeder there we go what could be causing these false positives on these antibody tests it's because most of the tests out there could be cross-reacting with a previous coronavirus or cold also see less accuracy as if they have other severe diseases as well a negative result again next i met with pathologist dr brunet bezai to find out what the fda is doing to police the influx of antibody tests that get on the market there were so many antibody tests the lateral flow antibody test on the market because the fda allowed them to basically be in use while their application was being reviewed and then the fda decided to retract that so now there's a list of tests that are on a do not use list and then they're the tests that you're able to use another antibody test down another negative result now i'm going to quick stop urgent care for my following test i'm here with dr pozeki and he's going to administer my antibody test we can have patients start with the antibody test and if they need to progress to the pcr test so essentially if you have positive igm antibodies then you would want to get a pcr test to see if you have active covet yeah that's the most accurate test i just got another negative antibody test result so i'm off to my final test i'm here with dr jeffrey tulle and i'm about to get my blood drawn a real blood test for the antibodies why do you want to do that versus these quick tests those tests don't quantify exactly how many antibodies you you have so that's one part of it and since so many were approved through the e-way process it's it's a little bit tough to know which ones are as accurate as these machines like a blood draw where we can really figure out if they're accurate or not so that's a wrap for my long day of coronavirus testing i got poked and prodded a lot but i should have my final test result back in a few days [Music] you
