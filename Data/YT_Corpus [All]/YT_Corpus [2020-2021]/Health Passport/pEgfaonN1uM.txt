 we covered doogie howser we covered friends next up is another one of my favorite shows seinfeld there's got to be some medical scenes in there that are medically accurate right definitely i think i'm having a heart attack i don't think that's it i'm not kidding what does that mean i think what he's trying to say is that he's having a heart attack oh he's having a heart attack penis come on shortness of breath oh this is ridiculous radiating waves of pain those are three classic symptoms of a heart attack but there are some that are less common pain radiating to the jaw to the left arm we oftentimes have people describe feelings of indigestion when in reality just radiating or referred pain from the cardiac region while there are classic signs of a heart attack it's important to know that some signs are more subtle so if you feel like you're having a heart attack it's definitely time to call 9-1-1 hey how you doing buddy you need anything why does he have a naso-gastric tube right now i'm really confused that's a really weird looking nasogastric tube maybe this is what they did in the 90s or 80s whenever this was that is not how nasogastric tubes look like do you use hot water in the shower yes stop using it there's some truth there if you use hot water too often or for a long period of time you could actually dry out your skin dry out your hair so take a cold shower it'll wake you up in the morning i haven't seen nor held a paper chart seven years and even when i held it it was to go into a filing room of old records that were growing cobwebs on them but cobwebs don't grow now a patient would have to hack into my electronic health record which is protected by four passwords that change every 30 days and must be 20 characters in length include a capital lowercase middle case letter a number a special character a super sub special character along with a combination to my high school locker that can i can only change each month with my credit card that must be connected to my phone that has google authenticator and phone verification on as long as i have my passport number that i can then call and verify by phone by my using my voice recognition if i am able to go to the i'll stop you know i noticed that someone wrote in my chart that i was difficult in january of 92. i don't think i've ever written in the chart something like difficult patience i've definitely had difficult encounters and if someone was being unprofessional i definitely documented that i told you one of my patients uh started telling me that she's communicating with my dead mother and that's why she was there to see me not for a medical condition that was strange i've had patients come in requesting controlled substances when they knew that they shouldn't be getting them them storming out and getting really mad and cursing at myself and the staff all that is documented outside of how ethically wrong that is that the doctor is getting a nitrous oxide high before performing a procedure he touches his nose and mouth the most transmissible mucous membranes to the device before applying it to the patient oh what are you eating junior meat you want to know take one i don't want another good dig i don't want it just keep one no stop it we've left all types of surgical devices in patients scalpels pads i've never heard of a snack though what did they do they sealed them up with the mint inside they left the junior mint in him yes well i i guess it can't hurt him i think it could really hurt him because it's not like it's inside his intestine it's inside his cavity where bacteria are gonna feast on it and as a result multiply and cause an infection causing a peritonitis which is a surgical emergency or antibiotic emergency oh my god oh my god i'm sorry i thought this was the baby's room i'm really sorry that's just rude i was in the pool i was in the pool medical term for that would be vasoconstriction in order to preserve body warmth it redirects blood flow away from non-vital organs and brings it to your vital organs in fact your testicles actually come closer to your body because you got to keep your gametes alive your spermies the rest of the male genitalia actually shrinks it vasoconstricts because blood flow to that area when you're really cold and shivering is not of utmost importance your kidneys your liver your brain your heart that's where the blood flow needs to stay and heat needs to be preserved jerry what brings you here i don't know this looks like hives where do you suppose that could have come from are you suggesting i somehow infected you on purpose i want the antidote pimple popper did you say pimple pumper shout out dr sandra lee how did she infect him hives are an allergic reaction caused by an immune overreaction to something usually harmless so what did she infect him with something he's allergic to open your mouth open your mouth open it open it sure fire way to get someone to choke what are the pills of these anyway for smuckers may cause panting and loss of fur these are dog pills please do not take your dog's medication thinking it's gonna work for you the same goes for the other way around like do not give your dog medicine that you take use a species-appropriate doctor you know there's actually a condition called hot tub folliculitis where your hair follicles can get an infection uh usually with the bacteria pseudomonas which tends to live in hot tubs and it could be a nasty nasty infection don't google it don't google it a little wetter see i didn't believe it what what's with the fake sneezing yeah we're going down to mount sinai hospital see the higher actors to help the students practice diagnosis that's true by the way we actually have simulated patients where actors are paid to pretend they have medical conditions we ask them questions we even do parts of the physical exam on them there's a special set of actors that we use for prostate and gynecological exams this is mandatory training because otherwise if you're uncomfortable being in a room with a patient how are you supposed to deliver good care and are you experiencing any discomfort just a little burning during urination okay any other pain the haunting memories of lost love why do they have the med students all in there at the same time and the simulated patients in there in the same time and x-rays there's so much wrong with this scene what happens is you actually have a set of 10 rooms with 10 different simulated patients and you have the students rotate through each of the rooms you have a set number of time that you're allowed to be in the room and a set number of time that you spend out of the room writing your note that's actually part of your board exam your licensing exam that you take that you have to show you're capable of taking the practical portion of it that you're capable of interacting with people and so we danced and i burned for her much like the burning during urination that i would experience soon afterwards gonorrhea gonorrhoea you don't just guess the patient's illness to their face without doing any other questions outside of hearing burning on urination why wouldn't he say urinary tract infection that could be there too you should ask about discharge sexual partners unprotected protected sex all those are important questions i'm gonna make people feel my gonorrhea have you ever seen a doctor prank a doctor check it out here i actually prank three of them including mama dr jones and of course check out my medical scene review of friends the also popular competing show with seinfeld as always stay happy and healthy
