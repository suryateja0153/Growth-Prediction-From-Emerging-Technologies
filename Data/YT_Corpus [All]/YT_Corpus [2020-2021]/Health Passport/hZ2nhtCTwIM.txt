 this is just a mess something that we did not expect obviously a Florida family is stuck on a cruise ship well they say their four-year-old son is in need of urgent medical attention people from all over are following this Facebook feed the boy's mother says just a day into the cruise her son small cut developed into a major infection and even though he's getting care on the on the ship from the medical center there the family says he needs a hospital there's just one problem we're not getting off the boat because we're not gonna be stranded the family doesn't have passports they're afraid if they get off they won't be able to get back on night sighs Josh adorbix is here with me and how is this even possible well I don't know that many people realize I know I didn't before tonight hear that on some cruises as long as they begin and end in the US and in the same port you technically don't need a passport which is exactly what happened to this family attempt a travel agent says sure you can do it but she highly recommends you do not he says this Florida family's unfortunate situation should serve as a lesson to all of us emergencies can happen from illness and injury to even something going wrong with the ship and you don't want to be stuck facing down a scenario where you may literally be stuck says generally you can always count on the nearest US embassies or consulates for help in a situation like this however it just might take a while and she recommends before any international trip you register with the smart traveler enrollment program so any US Embassy anywhere in the world will already have your trip information on file so bottom line she says obviously getting the passport the easiest way to avoid any and all of this but as for that little boy and his family well according to mom's Facebook they are at sea right now they are due back in port early tomorrow
