 so what's just happened is the government has agreed the prioritization for when the vaccines come in we have a group of experts called the national immunization advisory committee nyack they did a report for the national public health emergency team nephit it went from niacc to nephi to me i brought a memo to government to say this is what the experts recommend so we've now got agreement on who would get the covet vaccines first who gets the covert vaccines first essentially the experts ask the really important question which is how do we save as many lives as possible and how do we stop people getting really sick from covert so using those two questions and then four ethical principles they came up with 15 different categories and essentially what they've said is the first group of people who need to get the vaccine are people who are over 65 years of age who are living in nursing homes or other long-term residential care facilities why remember back to the first wave more than one in every two people in ireland who died from this awful bloody disease where people over 65 living in these settings so they're first the next group of people is health care professionals front line workers who are dealing directly with patients remember we've had quite a lot of covert cases that healthcare workers have got one in every five coveted cases is from a healthcare worker we need to protect them we need to protect the healthcare systems that they run so they're next from that then it goes down in terms of ages how vulnerable people are how likely people are to get it right through the categories what's happening next is this there's a task force has been brought together to figure out exactly how we distribute the vaccines bring them in from overseas get them out around the country and ultimately administer them to people they're doing a lot of detailed work now this week they're reporting into us on friday we're going to look at that very carefully bring that to government next week and then publish it for people to take a look at when are we likely to see the vaccines a lot of people are asking so our regulator is the european medicines agency the first vaccine they're looking at is a vaccine from pfizer and they've said that they're going to meet up on the 29th of december at the latest and give an opinion as to whether or not they are saying yes or no to the pfizer vaccine if they say yes and we've seen the uk regulator has said yes if our regulator says yes then it'll only be a matter of days before we have the vaccine ready to go and obviously we'll be starting with at the highest priority people with that vaccine how much is the vaccine going to cost for people zero what we did with the flu vaccine is the high priority groups they got the vaccine for free but other people could pay for the flu vaccine if they wanted with the covert vaccines the answer is the state will pick up all costs involved what should we all do now well the advice that i'm going to give is the advice that the public health doctors give me in the department here every single day which is keep following the level three measures keep following the basics even in the last few days the number of cases has begun to go up again in ireland now we knew that was going to happen when we moved from level five to level three but what the public health doctors are telling me every day is that we all need to keep following the advice and even though we need to live well we need to enjoy december we've still got to manage our social contacts and meet people in the right ways so how are we doing in ireland and covent the answer is we're doing incredibly well so we've had the biggest fall in covet cases in europe right now we have the lowest 14 day incident rate in the european union we also have one of the biggest falls in covadets between wave one and two anywhere in the world it's an incredible achievement the thanks goes to the people of ireland for following the public health advice for taking care of each other from minding each other what the public health doctors are saying to me every day is we need to keep that spirit up keep looking out for each other through december and into the new year
