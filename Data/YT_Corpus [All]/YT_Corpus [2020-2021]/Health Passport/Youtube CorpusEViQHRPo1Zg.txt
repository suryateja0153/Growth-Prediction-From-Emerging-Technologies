 as this virus continues to strain our health care system it is also causing prolonged economic pain especially for the travel industry so what's being done to keep passengers safe and how will things change once we get that vaccine ed bastion ceo of delta airlines is with us this morning ed good to have you back thanks for your time this morning great to be with you craig thanks let's let's start with uh delta airlines new voluntary contact tracing initiative you're working along with the cdc as we understand that this is going to be specifically for international travelers coming into the united states how exactly uh is it going to work well one of the things that's really important in our industry is that we start to reopen as it's safe international travel particularly to europe given the significant links between our our country as well as with the european nations and one of the things that the cdc has been adamant about and i fully support is the need to have international travelers as they enter the country for the cdc to be able to have contact tracing capabilities so they can identify in the event there was a need to contact customers on board a flight in international flight when they arrived into the u.s any customers in vicinity of someone that could potentially have been affected so we've created the capabilities working with cdc it is a voluntary measure for our customers but i think it's a really important one ed let's talk about vaccines for a moment because it would seem as if multiple vaccines are on the horizon would delta consider mandating employees be vaccinated in order to work or even passengers be vaccinated in order to fly well we haven't decided that yet craig we are looking at and certainly talking to the authorities about first and foremost how do we get our our employees vaccinated i think for international travel it will become a requirement whether it's the airline does it or or some international authorities do it we're going to strongly encourage that airline employees all get vaccinated airline employees are front-line workers and will be given priority as a front-line worker to access to the vaccine myself i can't wait to get vaccinated and we're going to strongly encourage all our people to make sure they get that that that protection that inoculation from this deadly virus uh the airline industry including delta airlines they received quite the stimulus package early in the pandemic there continues to be reporting that the airline industry is suffering mightily are we looking for additional relief from the federal government and if so how much on a larger scale the economy certainly continues to suffer there's a lot of hurting people out there within our industry we're continuing to lose money we've got at delta fortunately we've been able to get through this with no furloughs of any of our employees which which is great and we expect to get through next year in the same condition but we know within our industry there are many there's tens of thousands of employees who have been furloughed at other airlines the stimulus program for the industry would enable those employees to get their jobs back which we support and encourage congress to act on this measure but to those ed who would say um there are so many other industries restaurants for instance uh that are suffering tremendously as well other other businesses small businesses municipalities uh that are suffering to those who would say that that some of those industries should be bailed out before the airlines again what would you say well the the airline stimulus is not a bailout because portion of the the the monies that we're receiving we are paying back in the form of loans and secondly the industry stimulus that was received earlier this year required us to keep all of our employees on the payroll so it's really a an ability to continue to pay the payroll of people that are essential deemed essential workers to our national economy i'm not going to try to judge the other uh industries in need clearly there it's out there and that's why i said at the start of my comments we need a broader stimulus package for this nation really quickly ed before i let you go 737 max as you know has been approved by the faa to fly once again after being grounded for 20 months after those two fatal crashes this delta plan to fly the 737 max again here in the near term we don't own that airplane we decided not to purchase that plane when we looked at it a few years ago it wasn't for safety reasons uh for other reasons uh you know in the future as people get more familiar with the airplane and it and people are comfortable flying that plane we'd consider potentially purchasing it but uh no plans to operate or own that plane at the present time at best uh delta airline ceo ed thanks as always sir thank you thank you you
