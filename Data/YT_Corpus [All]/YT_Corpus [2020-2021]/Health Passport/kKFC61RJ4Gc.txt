 breaking news now UCI cycling's governing body ban Armstrong for life and Mary and Jonesy would stow steroids in the refrigerator I have no one to blame but myself over the years scientific progress has made easier and faster to detect athletes who don't but it's also helped make it easier to dope fewer court so what's the real story behind doping in sport just explain to me warm anti-doping agencies are up against yeah they have an impossible task essentially which is looking for a huge list of substances and then looking for the the classic ways I'm doping are using anabolic steroids that's that's really what they started with but it's not the most refined way of doping so then on top of that you have human birth these are still being used today a lot more self sophisticated now blood doping they were talking about it so EPO which is a drug that thickens your blood I'm so inconsistent the number of red blood cells in your system and oxygenate your muscles every day essentially there's a new set of plugs that are being designed combinations and cocktails I've been designed science has always played catch-up to the ways athletes and coaches avoid detection of drugs in sport for most of the history of anti-doping the focus was on trying to identify particular chemicals in urine we went to talk to James Tosa who writes about sport here at the economist to find out how the science has moved on 10 years ago and the aim there is not to find specific substances but rather unusual changes for as long as the Olympics have existed athletes have cheated but it's only since the International Olympic Committee started testing for doping in 1968 that the cheaters have been officially caught the game changed in 2004 with the introduction of a bio bank allowing the storage and retesting of athlete samples over an eight-year period then in 2009 Kim biological passports since then more than athletes have been opened but that's not the full picture in an anonymous survey at the 2011 World Athletics Championships an astonishing 44 percent of athletes admitted to doping within the last year but typically only one to two percent of samples test positive and most doping has in fact been detected years after it happened and had it not been for the admissions of two Russian whistleblowers and other intelligence many of those cases could still be unknown [Music] [Applause] a leader watt is a British Parliament and former world champion as an outspoken critic of doping in sports we wanted to hear Alys take on how big the gap between doping and it's so why have biological passports not lived up to their promise as the way to stamp out doping and what's the alternative there's a scientists in the South of England who seems to have an answer so we headed to Brighton to meet him the athlete's biological passport system it's a very clever concept it's weakness at the moment is its that it's based on a handful of biomarkers compounds within the body that reflect the fact that there's been a change in one's red blood cells for example but it's very very clear that a large number or evading detection because the the markers can also be easily easily manipulated and one that's going to separate Yanis bitsy laddus is on the medical and scientific commission of the IOC the International Olympic Committee he spent more than a decade honing a new method to spot blood doping it's an approach that might eventually be used to test and help stamp out doping of any kind will they have stored it as whole blood yeah but how much do they have do you know so what we are pioneering here in this laboratory is trying to utilize newer technologies like these gene chip technologies where we can where we can look at every single gene that switched on and off in the human body to see whether we can use this approach to the detection of drugs in sport [Music] Yanis plants add thousands of biomarkers through genetic sequencing there are around 21,000 genes in the body several hundred switch on when an athlete takes a blood thickening drug or has a blood transfusion and this changes the athletes genetic signature by analyzing these changes which can be detected weeks possibly even months later Yanis can spot blood doping the method used and even roughly when it took place but the final stage of Alice's research could be the most challenging it will be labor-intensive and time-consuming require access to a DNA sequencer and a supercomputer and it will cost an estimated four million pounds I must acknowledge that I am one of the most funded scientists in anti-doping and I'm extremely frustrated so far Yanis is secured over half a million pounds from sponsors and wada the world anti-doping agency and a Chinese company has agreed to lend him a sequencer let's demonstrate even a small way that we can detect one athlete scientifically I'm confident this is the way forward Yanis is struggled to secure funding is typical of the wider challenge facing anti-doping researchers it's very clear to me that wada needs more money and the question is ways that money gonna come from what really struck us when we talked to Yanis wasn't just a science it was this funding gap organizations that say that they want to read sport of doping haven't always put their money where their mouth is so we've made another film to find out why and to untangle the politics around the world's foremost anti-doping agency we need to understand that water as an institution is weak there was resistance from the Olympic movement where there was a desire to have more control is basically a naked legislator it produces rules that it has absolutely no power and capacity to enforce to learn more about wider the IOC and the structural
