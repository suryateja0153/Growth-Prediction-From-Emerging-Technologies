 the greatest challenge for us at kingston public hospital initially was the fair as we planned and we prepared under the stewardship of the ministry of health we were also watching the unfolding of events in other countries and so once we got over that fair are under the training we sprang into action we are grateful for the support certainly of the u.s government through the u.s aid and its partners in supporting the activities not just of the government of jamaica and the minister of health and wellness but certainly the kingston public hospital and the jamaicans that we serve you
