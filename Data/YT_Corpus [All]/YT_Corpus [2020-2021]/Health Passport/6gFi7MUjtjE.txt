 THE SALE IS GIVING MANY NEW HOPE.  THIS CAN BE VERY GOOD NEWS. THIS IS THE FIRST STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. DENI: THE SALE OF PASSPORT HEALTH CAME AS WELCOME NEWS TO COUNCILWOMAN BARBARA SEXTON-SMITH. SHE REPRESENTS DISTRICT 4, WHERE TWO YEARS AGO, THE HEALTHCARE COMPANY BROKE GROUND ON A NEW HEADQUARTERS AND HEALTH CAMPUS. BUT THE PROJECT AT 18TH AND BROADWAY WAS PUT ON HOLD WHEN THE FUTURE OF PASSPORT’S MEDICAID CONTRACTS WITH KENTUCKY WAS PUT IN DOUBT.  THE LAST THING IN THE WORLD WE NEED IS ONE MORE DISAPPOINTMENT FOR THE FOLKS THAT LIVE IN AND AROUND WEST LOUISVILLE. DENI: MOLINA HEALTHCARE, A CALIFORNIA-BASED COMPANY THAT CURRENTLY OPERATES IN 14 STATES, WILL PAY $20 MILLION FOR THE PASSPORT NAME, OPERATIONAL AND CLINICAL INFRASTRUCTURE, AND THE WEST LOUISVILLE PROPERTY. MOLINA WAS ONE OF FIVE COMPANIES AWARDED A MEDICAID CONTRACT BY KENTUCKY IN 2020. THE COMPANY SAYS THE ACQUISITI OF PASSPORT WILL HELP MAINTAIN CONTINUITY OF CARE FOR THE 315,000 PEOPLE PASSPORT CURRENTLY SERVES.  I WANT EVERYONE TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO SEE THEIR SAME DOCTOR, THEIR SAME MEDICAL PROVIDERS, AND HOPEFULLY MOLINA WILL SEE THE VALUE OF THAT. DENI: MOLINA WILL HAVE TO GET REGULATORY APPROVAL BEFORE IT CAN BEGIN OPERATING IN KENTUCKY. SEXTON-SMITH SAYS THE COMPANY DOES INTEND TO BUILD A HEADQUARTERS IN WEST LOUISVILLE AND WILL ALLOW CURRENT PASSPORT EMPLOYEES TO KEEP THEIR JOBS. SHE’S HOPEFUL THE DEAL WILL ALSO CREATE NEW JOBS IN HER DISTRICT. WHEN YOU HAVE GOOD PAYING JOBS, GOOD HEALTH CARE, YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE BETTER HOUSING, SAFER NEIGHBORHOODS, AND THAT IS WHAT WE ALL WANT. THAT IS WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT. DENI: DENI KAMPER, WLKY NEWS. JENNIFER: THANK YOU, DENI. MA
