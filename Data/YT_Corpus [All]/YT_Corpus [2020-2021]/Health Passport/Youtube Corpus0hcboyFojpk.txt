 hi my name is Christophe welcome to European studies are you ready so let's jump right into it this video is about the EU bringing countries closer together in this lesson you will learn 1 what is the single market and 2 what is the Schengen area the EU wants to promote free trade between its members there are two main obstacles to international trade one tariffs tariffs are taxes on imports and two regulations there are many rules and regulations about safety health environment labelling and each country has its own set of rules and regulations tariffs are not such a big problem they can be easily removed harmonization of regulations is much more problematic the EU has created a single market where there are no tariffs and everybody applies the same regulations so one product made in the EU can be sold as it is in any country of the EU for instance France had a specific regulation regarding car safety all cars were required to have yellow headlights white headlights were said to be too bright and could blind drivers in oncoming traffic so as a result car makers had to produce cars specifically for the French market and this goes against the idea of a single market so the French were forced to change their regulation to comply with EU standards now there are only white headlights in Europe this is the CE Marking if you look around you you will see this mark on many products it indicates that the product meets EU standards regarding health safety and environment and it can be sold in any part of the EU and the same goes for people if you are a nurse from Romania a dentist from Poland an architect from Spain you can practice in any EU country in the single market people goods services and money can move as freely as within a single country the four fundamental European freedoms are freedom of movement of people freedom of movement of goods freedom of movement of services and freedom of movement of money big companies love the single market it allows them to relocate their factories to low-wage countries look at these beautiful cars you think they are made in Germany well think again they are all made in Slovakia Slovakia may be a country you have never heard of before well Slovakia is a small country with a very big car industry in fact Slovakia has become the biggest car producer per capita in the world of course the U.S. and Japan produce more cars but they have much more larger populations many German car makers moved their factories to Slovakia because guess what the salaries are much lower in Slovakia the Slovakian worker earns 1/3 of what a German earns the third no wonder German companies decided to invest heavily in Slovakia and it is not only Slovakia it is also the Czech Republic Poland Hungary Romania today only 40% of German cars are produced in Germany here is a map of the single market you have 27 members of the EU plus Switzerland Norway and Iceland these 3 countries don't belong to the EU but they have access to the single market what about the UK well the UK has left the EU January 31st 2020 its future relationship with the single market has yet to be decided and now a few words about the Schengen area most European countries belong to the Schengen area it is the largest free travel area in the world there are no border checks between the members so you don't need a passport to travel inside the Schengen area it makes it easier and faster to move around in Europe in the Schengen area borders look like that or like that or like that there are no border posts so if you miss the sign you may not notice that you have entered a different country this is the map of the Schengen area as you can see you can travel from Portugal to Norway without having to show any ID 26 countries belong to the Schengen area all EU members are part of the Schengen area except for Ireland Romania Bulgaria Croatia and Cyprus why didn't Ireland join the Schengen area Ireland used to be part of the United Kingdom most of Ireland left the UK in 1922 and became the Republic of Ireland Northern Ireland remained part of the UK since 1922 Ireland and the UK have maintained a common travel area with passport free travel for their citizens the United Kingdom refused to join the Schengen area so Ireland had to follow to maintain its special relation with the UK what about the other countries like Romania and Bulgaria the EU found that they are not ready for membership indeed the EU has concerns about corruption and organized crime in these countries many countries in the EU fear an increase in smuggling and trafficking Schengen members need to trust each other Trust is very important because once a foreigner is allowed to enter one country he will be able to move around freely critics of the Schengen area claim that a free travel area may be good for tourists and businessmen but criminals terrorists illegal migrants and viruses can take advantage of open borders in 2015 there was a terrorist attack in Paris 130 people were killed and more than 300 wounded the terrorists came from Syria if they had been border checks they might have been stopped and that brings us to the end of that video I hope you found it useful and learned something from it have a great day see you soon
