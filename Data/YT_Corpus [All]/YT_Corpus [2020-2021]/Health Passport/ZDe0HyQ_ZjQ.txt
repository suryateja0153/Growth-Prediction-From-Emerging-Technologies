 Oh kya tokoto Katella welcome once again to the Ministry of Health and thank you for your support and including sign language interpreter and the crane can I just begin with the important point that we have no cases of confirmed coronavirus nor any suspected cases of corona virus code 19 and New Zealand over 60 people have been tested and those who will come back negative there's been quite a lot of interest in what's happening at the border here in New Zealand and I thought I just have a quick run-through for people's information because there are still a lot of people coming through the border from a range of countries and also several hundred from China or who have travelled through China so let me just describe what happens at the border so people traveling from or through mainland China anywhere in mainland China actually been screened prior to boarding a flight to New Zealand and anyone who is not a New Zealand citizen or permanent resident or from one of the realm countries is actually not allowed to board the flight in the early days of the border restrictions the early day to do we're a small number of people who arrived and then were stopped at the border and went back to their that to where they had boarded we've had public health officials in Christchurch and Auckland International Airport the centre's the 27th of January and there are also public health staff at Wellington Airport which receives a small number of international flights we're constantly monitoring what we're doing and be in court and our cheeks and controls there are in line with what other countries are doing particularly Australia but also others and also repeatedly looking at the whu-oh advice on us so just to reassure people about what their procedure is many people arrive so is the instances all messengers come off flights arriving for example at National Airport they move through the airport and they arrive at the customs lines if they have a passport they can use the e gate then they go into the e Gate line and when they get here they get asked the question when they scan their passport it says have you been to or through mainland China in the last 14 days now this is a statutory declaration if people say yes they have then they are required to go they are pointed in the direction of the customs officials and they join the line with others who are not able to use the egauge the customs officials check their passports for stamps that would indicate there have been in China and Gwyn and if they have been in China since the 3rd of February or anywhere in the who Bay province in the last 14 days then they are directed to cut off staff that are right there to check them and other words have a chat to them provide them with information about self-isolation reiterate the expectation that they will self isolate for 14 days and that information also includes the phone number for them to call to self register so people everybody who has been in all through China China is receiving that information if someone is unwell there is a nurse here to check them including take their temperature if it's necessary so there is a very well development for surprises now the border and one of the things we like to do is we're going to do a walk through that out on an video that in the next hour to and will provide the footage of that so you can use that stories that you may want to run so we'll be doing there through the Orlan Airport and making that that you are available there are also electronic signs right through their journey and some banners and here I've got one right behind me here you can see it's very clear so these are very clear or so than the airport at a number of points so we are taking the broader responsibilities very seriously another issue people are interested in and they also relates to the border is around cruise ships and maritime traffic I spoke to this briefly yesterday and I talked about this process of pratik we're a ship coming in whether it's a merchant ship or a or a passenger ship this direction to be cleared so the ship's master or doctor has to Radio ahead and declare if there is anyone on board with a notifiable infectious disease you'll be aware that cocoa vat19 novel coronavirus is the notifiable disease in new zealand so we have a good process in place I should also point out that they are pratik process is something that he long flights to as well so pilots have to radio here if they have anyone unwell on board and there's a very well-established process for those flights being met by health staff at the airport means people being dealt with appropriately so I guess in summary this is a record Lee evolving situation if I reflect back three weeks and I was going back through some of the situation reports three weeks ago there had been less than 300 cases of this disease they were all largely in who Bay province they have been 60s reported so here we find ourselves three weeks later with a much different picture and our response over that period has been very systematic very well-planned and we continue continue to evolve it and adapt it as the situation evolves and one of the things I would like to do is extend an invitation to you after this if you would like to come down and look at our National Health Coordination Center in the basement and just get a feel for the intensity of effort and in work that's going in there that is leading the cross government effort to respond to us still emerging still evolving situation so thank you very much and I'm open to questions you have mentioned on cruise ships and on cruise ships are they any cruise ships under suspicion there are no cruise ships under suspicion we have here a cruise ship I think there's a cruise ship heading towards tow dhaniya and the Fiji authorities have been in touch it was someone who was unwell on that ship but there is no suggestion that this coronavirus on its ship and of course as you can imagine especially with the situation of the cruise ship that's effectively in quarantine in Yokohama Japan there is a high level of awareness around cruise ships and as I described earlier either the ship's doctor or the master of the ship has to Radio ahead to the port if there is anyone unwell or suspected to have a notify the disease taking any extra safety measures worth it to cruise ship that arrives tomorrow Erika said given that why not the passengers died of flu like symptoms well we will be expecting that the doctor the ship's doctor will master will report on and give a full report and again quite a routine procedure if necessary local public health staff will go out and meet what should stop to end assess the situation do you think it's enough given the symptoms were sailors to their of it of course in all these situations we have to rely on the professionals who are looking after individuals it's the northern hemisphere flu season we know that the symptoms of CO vat19 are very similar to those of influenza and indeed other respiratory illnesses as I say just to go back to my point given the situation there is a high level of awareness for anything that might be at novel coronavirus but of course it's important it's not possible for someone to have corona virus as they haven't got any history of having been exposed to it it's far more likely about kalyan times and just with the influenza how are we able to let know that it's simple winds have given them quite similar with corona virus well again we rely on the clinical picture the history is the routine then assessing any person for any illness and it would be a low bar for getting testing done if there was any suggestion that recently being exposed if there was a question behind I just want the diamond party so my understanding is that the Japanese officials are requiring everyone to stay onboard that ship for the full 14 days there is clearly a large number of infections that confirm your people then we will be relying on the Japanese authorities around the time of release that they think the risk is low in foreign affairs both will be working with New Zealanders on that ship to support them if they require it to to get back home and all these cool thousand people today that heavy so here's a midnight last night around two and a half thousand people had self registered and I know that health liners working through the bounce of people who have come into the country in heaven aired or haven't had the opportunity to self register so by working through them as fast as possible when I have spoke to offenders later and actually he did an interview this morning so that's the chief executive of of health line he said that noticed staff hadn't reported that people weren't self isolating and again just to reiterate because this came up at the discussion yesterday this is a high trust arrangement and that is typical of any of these situations it's a unique situation I can't recall a point in time even in 2009 for example doing we get the swine clipping limit that we were asking people to yourself isolate for 14 days but the sense is in effect over two and a half thousand people are self registered as they are self isolating and I think there's a really really strong a sense of common purpose around keeping the community safe here so I think that's an impressive response so well the balance and there will be several thousand and they'll be working through those just to be clear has a little being defined detail not that we are not just looking at Maysles and necks reading over tucson why are we doing enough in this situation to protect under so that magazine so it's a very public mind issue for us and it's one of the key inputs into the decision around the current border measures here and we're also in close discussion with our Pacific neighbors many of them have implemented their own border restrictions any well known some well it give us some are in particular clearly very concerned given your experience with measles last year so the fact that New Zealand is a is a jump-off point of view million of surprises is a strong motivator and likewise you will recall it most of the people who are non New Zealanders the 59 people who are open and from Okinawa are from the Pacific Islands and so we're supporting those countries to keep those people here and situation before that go home necessary to stop kids going to school that have not been in mainland China but traveled and other area services no I was just on the two who have two New Zealanders who have been diagnosed with coronavirus who were on the diaper consists show what information as the Ministry actually getting from the Japanese Ministry of Health on how those people are doing and how they are coping at the hospital I mean have you even received information on what their condition is at the moment whether they are improving getting worse I mean what kind of communication it's happening the end you know so the lead agency for that as Foreign Affairs and Trade in fact and I know their costs or you know they're constantly phobia are in close contact with those who are in hospital or to New Zealand and the other ones who are monitoring their condition in providing support is required we don't receive information about any responsibility does the Ministry of Health have the power to do anything about people who want so i swear like employers well this is a whole of society here that and i think that some what we've seen as a sayers is a really similar response from people i can't people understand the rationale i think employers understand the need for us to do this and what we are trying to avoid here is a sustained community outbreak of a over 19 in a rapidly evolving situation as I said yesterday medical offices of healthcare powers to require people to isolate will be quarantined it's very unusual to use those and you talked about the World Health Organization we're asking and catches it to be aggressive in their response to this would you call usually those response agree sit look I think it's permissible it's very it's precautionary the fact that we have these travel restrictions on at the border again first time I can recall those being implemented in this requirement and expectations on Kiwis returning from China to self isolate is a very significant response I think it's proportionate and it's part about in response we continue to evolve it is the evidence emerges it's the Ministry of Units in during the travel restrictions yeah not at this point in time because the number of cases and other countries are still very small but um it's evidence that we continue to watch and of course there are countries that have less well-developed health care systems where they made it a small number of cases but their ability to respond and contain local area might be basically and countries with well-developed health systems we're watching them quite closely it's not the plan at the moment but you know it's we're keeping all options open it's one one more question if there's anything else if not can I just reiterate that invitation yeah just that they're just steps around and I think what will be beast as if my colleague Ellen will be here so you can leave me to be stuck here and just carry your hand or cameras down I'll just go hear them lips but know that we're just about ready true and Paul will take them downstairs ish great so thanks very much once again for your interest in your support on us and hope you enjoyed the visit down to the national health promotion seen that
