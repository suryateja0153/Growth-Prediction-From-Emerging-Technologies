WE KNOW THAT PEOPLE ARE STRUGGLING TO KEEP THE LIGHTS ON AND MAKING INCREDIBLE SACRIFICES BY HELPING CANADIANS STAY SAFE BY FLATTENING THE CURVE AND TEMPORARILY CLOSING THE DOORS DOWN. WE HAVE SEEN A SEVERE DOWN TURN IN BUSINESSES WHERE YOU HAD TO CLOSE THE DOORS TO COVID-19, DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOUR COMMERCIAL RENT PAYMENTS HAVE HAD TO STOP. WE'VE PUT HELP OUT THERE TO HELP WITH EXPENSES BY DEFERRING CUSTOMS DUTIES AND TAX PAYMENTS CREATING A 75% WAGE SUBSIDY AND A VARIETY OF LENDING SUPPORTS BUT WE CERTAINLY HEARD LOUD AND CLEAR FROM SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS YOU NEED HELP FOR YOUR RENT.

[ Speaking FRENCH ]  Voice of Translator: THIS IS ABOUT SUPPORTING SMALL BUSINESSES. AND ENTREPRENEURS. FOR THOSE WHO NEED OUR HELP THE MOST. [ End of TRANSLATION ] WHO MADE THE TOUGH DECISION TO CLOSE THEIR DOORS TO NOW BE HELPED WITH THEIR RENT PAYMENT. ALSO MEANS THAT THAT LOCAL FURNITURE STORE THAT USUALLY RELIES ON MAIN STREET FOOT TRAFFIC CAN STAY AFLOAT TO COVER THE COST OF THEIR WAREHOUSE SPACE OR SELF EMPLOYED BEAUTY SALON OWNER WHO CAN'T TAKE ON CLIENTS RIGHT NOW, SHE WILL BE ABLE TO KEEP UP WITH HER RENT UNTIL IT'S SAFE TO OPEN HER DOORS AGAIN. OUR WORK IS FAR FROM OVER. AND WE'RE GOING TO KEEP LISTENING, WE WILL KEEP ACTING. AND WE WILL KEEP SUPPORTING YOU EVERY STEP OF THE WAY THROUGH THIS CRISIS. AND I WANT TO THANK CANADIAN SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS FOR YOUR RESILIENCE DURING THIS PERIOD. MERCI.  THANK YOU VERY MUCH MARY. NOW, WE WILL HEAR FROM THE MINISTER OF INNOVATION SCIENCE AND INDUSTRY NAVDEEP BAINS. NAV, PLEASE.  THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD AFTERNOON EVERY ONE. [ Speaking French ]  Voice of Translator: I'M HAPPY TO BE HERE TODAY TO UPDATE YOU ON OUR INDUSTRIAL MOBILIZATION EFFORTS. IN ADDRESSING -- [ End of TRANSLATION ] THE SAME FROM THE START. COMPANIES REACH OUT TO US ONLINE THROUGH OUR PORTHOLE. NEARLY 6,000 SINCE THE START A MONTH AGO. AND WE LOOK AT THESE OFFERS AGAINST THE NEEDS OF CANADIANS. WHEN THERE'S A PROMISING MATCH, WE SIGN A LETTER OF INTENT. THEN WE WORK WITH THE COMPANY TO SUPPORT RETOOLING AND OFTEN THIS MEANS BRINGING COMPANIES TOGETHER IN NEW PARTNERSHIPS AND SUPPLY CHAINS. FINALLY WE FINISH BY SIGNING A CONTRACT FOR PURCHASE. I'LL START WITH SOME PROGRESS ON LETTERS OF INTENT FOR MEDICAL GOWNS. WE FACILITATED THE TRANSFORMATION OF CONSTRUCTION HOUSE WRAP FROM INTER TAP POLYMER THAT USE THE STRICT REQUIREMENTS NECESSARY TO USE IN THE MANUFACTURING OF MEDICAL GRADE GOWNS. CONNECTING THESE TWO FIRMS FROM CANADIAN APPAREL MANUFACTURERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY THEY SW MEDICAL GOWNS WITH MADE IN CANADA FABRIC EFFECTIVELY BYPASSING FABRIC SHORTAGES WITH ENTIRELY NEW SUPPLY CHAIN. THIS HAS ENABLED US TO MOVE FORWARD FROM LETTERS OF INTENT TO CONTRACTS, SURVIVAL, GEORGE COREY AND YOGA JEANS. THEY JOIN SEINFELD AND CANADA GOOSE AND CANADA APPAREL COMPANIES STEPPING UP TO PROVIDE CRITICAL MEDICAL GOWNS. IN TOTAL, CONTRACTS WITH THESE 7 COMPANIES HAVE RESULTED IN MORE THAN 18 MILLION GOWNS WITH DELIVERIES STARTING THIS WEEK. I'LL SHARE ONE MORE EXAMPLE HOW THESE KNEW PARTNERSHIPS IN CANADIAN INDUSTRY HAVE HELPED US IN THE FIGHT AGAINST COVID-19. LUMI ULTRA A PRODUCER OF TESTING AGENTS IN NEW BRUNSWICK WAS IN SHORT SUPPLY OF CHEMICALS FOR PRODUCTION. HAVING REACHED OUT TO US WITH THE PORTHOLE I MENTIONED EARLIER WE CONNECTED THEM TO CHEMICAL SUPPLIES IN CANADA SO THEY COULD KEEP ON PRODUCING REAGENTS CRITICAL TO TESTING. NOW LET ME MOVE ON TO RETOOLING EFFORTS ON FACE SHIELDS AND MASKS. CANADIAN MANUFACTURERS HAVE STEPPED UP IN DIFFICULT TIMES TO RETOOL IN THE FIGHT AGAINST COVID-19. AND MANY OF THEM ARE FROM AUTO MOTIVE SECTORS, SECTOR THAT I'M VERY FAMILIAR WITH. I STARTED MY CAREER IN THAT SECTOR. WE'RE WORKING ON CONTRACTS MORE THAN A DOZEN COMPANIES THAT WILL DELIVER MILLIONS OF FACE SHIELDS INCLUDING THE LIKES OF WINDSOR MOLD, DYNAPLAS AND INK SMITH. THIS ALLOWS US TO MEET CURRENT REQUESTS FROM PROVINCES AND TERRITORIES WITH CANADIAN SUPPLIES. WE ALSO SIGNED A LETTER OF INTENT WITH GENERAL MOTORS. THEY'RE WORKING TO RETOOL THE OSHAWA ASSEMBLY PLANT TO HELP WITH THE MASS PRODUCTION HERE IN CANADA AND WE'RE ASSISTING THEM IN THIS PROCESS. [ Speaking FRENCH ]  Voice of Translator: I APPLAUD ALL OF THE COMPANIES WHO HAVE RETOOLED TO ASSIST IN THESE EFFORTS TO STRENGTHEN OUR DOMESTIC SUPPLY CHAIN. [ End of TRANSLATION ]  THANK YOU NAV. AND NOW HEAR FROM THE MINISTER OF PUBLIC SERVICE AND PROCUREMENT ANITA ANAND. [ Speaking FRENCH ]  Voice of Translator: THANK YOU. HELLO EVERY ONE. [ End of TRANSLATION ] BEFORE I BEGIN, LET ME SAY THAT AS SOMEONE BORN AND RAISED IN NOVA SCOTIA, MY HEART GOES OUT TO EVERY ONE WHO LOST LOVED ONES AND FRIENDS THIS PAST WEEKEND. THIS TRAGEDY COMES AS WE WORK TO CONTAIN COVID-19. MAKING IT EVER SO DIFFICULT TO GRIEVE TOGETHER. FROM SPENDING THE FIRST 18 YEARS OF MY LIFE IN NOVA SCOTIA, I KNOW THAT NOVA SCOTIANS ARE VERY CLOSELY KNIT GROUP. IN THESE TRAGIC TIMES, KNOW THAT I AND ALL OF CANADA STANDS WITH YOU. [ Speaking FRENCH ]  Voice of Translator: AS WE CONTINUE TO FIGHT THE SPREAD OF COVID-19, MY DEPARTMENT CONTINUES TO MAKE AGGRESSIVE AND PROACTIVE PURCHASES. OF THE PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT AND MEDICAL SUPPLIES THAT WILL HELP SEE US THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC. [ End of TRANSLATION ] I WILL BE ADDRESSING INTERNATIONAL PROCUREMENTS, DOMESTIC PRODUCTION, AND I WILL PROVIDE AN UPDATE ON OUR PROCUREMENTS. GIVEN THE INTENSE GLOBAL DEMAND FOR EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES, WE ARE FACING MANY CHALLENGES. MUCH OF THE WORLD'S SUPPLY IS MANUFACTURED IN CHINA. AND MOVING MATERIALS OUT OF THAT COUNTRY IS HIGHLY COMPLEX. WE HAVE EXPERIENCED CHALLENGES AS THE PRIME MINISTER DISCUSSED EARLIER THIS WEEK. I WANT TO REASSURE CANADIANS THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO ADJUST AND REFINE OUR LOGISTICAL AND DIPLOMATIC APPROACHES ON THE GROUND NOT JUST IN RESPONSE TO SUPPLY CHAIN CHALLENGES, BUT IN ANTICIPATION OF THESE CHALLENGES. THE AGGRESSIVE APPROACH THAT WE ARE TAKING TO EXPEDITIOUSLY BRING HOME SUPPLIES MEANS THAT WE ARE BUILDING IN CONTINGENCIES. OVER BUYING IN SOME CASES AND IMPLEMENTING RIGOROUS PROGRESS PRODUCT TESTING. PROGRESS IS BEING MADE. WE HAVE RECEIVED 6 PLANE LOADS CARRYING SUPPLIES FROM CHINA SINCE LAST FRIDAY ALONE. AND OVER 10 CARRIERS HAVE BROUGHT GOODS BACK TO CANADA OVER ALL FROM CHINA. THEY HAVE HELPED TO CARRY MILLIONS MORE N95 RESPIRATORS AND SURGICAL MASKS INTO CANADA THAT ARE NOW IN THE PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCY FOR TESTING. I WANT TO THANK AIR CANADA AND CARGO JET FOR CONTINUING TO STEP UP AND DELIVER. LAST WEEKEND, WE ALSO RECEIVED AN INTERNATIONAL SHIPMENT OF AN IMPORTANT BASED CHEMICAL NEEDED FOR REDUCING REAGENT AS MY COLLEAGUE MINISTER BAINS MENTIONED AT LUMAN ULTRA IN NEW BRUNSWICK THAT WILL ALLOW FOR MORE COVID-19 TESTING. THE COMPANY IS NOW GEARING UP TO DELIVER REAGENT FOR UP TO 500,000 TESTS ON A WEEKLY BASIS. [ Speaking French ]  Voice of Translator: IMPORTED PRODUCTS UNDERGO RIGOROUS TESTING BOTH AT THE SOURCE AND IN CANADA. WHERE THEY ARE INSPECTED BY THE PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCY OF CANADA. QUALITY ISSUES WHILE UNWELCOME ARE NOT UNEXPECTED GIVEN THE SURGE IN GLOBAL DEMAND FOR THESE GOODS. [ End of TRANSLATION ] ONLY COMING FROM ABROAD DOMESTIC PRODUCTION IS RAMPING UP AND CANADIAN COMPANIES ARE DELIVERING. I AM PLEASED TO ANNOUNCE WITH MY COLLEAGUE MINISTER BAINS THAT THIS WEEK WE HAVE SIGNED CONTRACTS WITH THREE MORE CANADIAN COMPANIES INCLUDING JACOBS AND THOMPSON OUT OF TORONTO, WINDSOR MOLD GROUP OUT OF WINDSOR, ONTARIO, TO PRODUCE A TOTAL OF 16 MILLION MEDICAL FACE SHIELDS. THE THIRD COMPANY CANADIAN SHIELD OUT OF KITCHENER HAS MOVED FROM 3D LASER -- 3D PRINTING TO LASER CUTTING TECHNOLOGY TO PRODUCE MASKS THAT CAN BE EASILY SANITIZED FOR REUSE. THESE ARE GREAT EXAMPLES OF CANADIAN INGENUITY AND INNOVATION. [ Speaking FRENCH ]  Voice of Translator: I AM INSPIRED BY THE WAY THAT THESE AND OTHER COMPANIES HAVE RISEN TO THE CHALLENGE. AND I AM PROUD TO SAY THAT WE CONTINUE TO ADD TO OUR CANADIAN LINE UP. [ End of TRANSLATION ]  SOME PARTS OF THE COUNTRY MODELS SUGGEST THAT THERE MAY BE FUTURE OUT BREAKS. EVEN AFTER WE GET THROUGH THIS FIRST PEAK. IN TERMS OF OUR PROCUREMENTS, THIS POSSIBILITY MEANS THAT WE ARE STILL PREPARING FOR ALL EVENTUALITIES. IN LIGHT OF THIS REALITY, I AM PLEASED TO ANNOUNCE THAT STRIKER, A COMPANY HEADQUARTERED IN WATER DOWN AND WITH PRODUCTION BASED IN QUEBEC CITY WILL PROVIDE US WITH 82 STERILIZATION UNITS THAT HAVE BEEN APPROVE BY HEALTH CANADA. THESE MACHINES ALLOW FOR THE STERILIZATION AND REUSE OF EQUIPMENT LIKE N95 RESPIRATORS, EXTENDING LIFE CYCLE OF THIS IMPORTANT PIECE OF EQUIPMENT IN HEALTH CARE FACILITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. [ Speaking French ]  Voice of Translator: I AM PLEASED TO ANNOUNCE THAT STRIKER, A COMPANY HEADQUARTERED IN WATER DOWN AND WITH PRODUCTION BASED IN QUEBEC CITY, WILL PROVIDE US WITH 82 STERILIZATION UNITS THAT HAVE BEEN APPROVED BY HEALTH CANADA. THESE MACHINES ALLOW FOR THE STERILIZATION AND REUSE OF N95 RESPIRATORS. EXTENDING THE LIFE CYCLE OF THIS IMPORTANT PIECE OF EQUIPMENT IN HEALTH CARE FACILITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. WE HAVE ALSO SIGNED CONTRACTS TO MEET THE POTENTIAL NEEDS FOR UP TO 10 MOBILE HEALTH HUBS. THESE UNITS WHICH ARE BUILT SPECIFICALLY FOR PROVIDING RESPIRATORY CARE SO THAT LOCAL HEALTH AUTHORITIES CAN ADDRESS OVER FLOWS OF PATIENTS IF NECESSARY. [ End of TRANSLATION ] WE ARE TAKING EVERY PRECAUTION TO KEEP CANADIANS SAFE THE COVID-19 SITUATION IS VERY WORRYING AND STRESSFUL. CANADIANS WANT TO KNOW WHAT WE ARE DOING TO PROTECT THEM. WE ARE TAKING NEW STEPS TO BE AS TRANSPARENT AS POSSIBLE AND TO KEEP CANADIANS UP TO DATE ON OUR WORK. TODAY, WE ARE LAUNCHING AN ON LINE REPORT DETAILING THE PROGRESS THAT WE ARE MAKING ON PROCURING KEY COVID-19 SUPPLIES. THIS RUNNING INVENTORY WILL BE UPDATED WEEKLY. AND GIVES INFORMATION ON KEY SUPPLIES THAT HAVE BEEN ORDERED AND RECEIVED. OF COURSE, THESE NUMBERS ONLY TELL PART OF THE STORY. AS OUR PROVINCES, TERRITORIES AND HEALTH CARE CENTRES ARE ALSO PROCURING SUPPLIES ON THEIR OWN. WE ARE DEALING WITH MASSIVE QUANTITIES OF GOODS. BEHIND THOSE NUMBERS IS AN ARMY OF HARDWORKING CANADIANS WORKING HERE AND OVER SEAS. DOING ALL THEY CAN TO DELIVER THESE GOODS. [ Speaking French ]  Voice of Translator: I WANT TO PERSONALLY THANK THEM FOR THE EXTRAORDINARY EFFORTS. [ End of TRANSLATION ] IT IS FULL STEAM AHEAD AS WE WORK TO SECURE THE SUPPLIES THAT BUILDING OWNER IN THAT WAY. THE BUILDING OWNER WILL RECEIVE ASSISTANCE FROM CMHC TO ENSURE THAT THEY WILL BE REIMBURSED FOR 75%. WE WILL RECEIVE -- WE WILL BE PUTTING MORE DETAILS UP ON THE WEBSITE IN THE COMING HOURS. AND THAT WILL HELP PEOPLE TO FAMILIARIZE THEMSELVES WITH THE AGREEMENT REACHED BETWEEN THE TWO PARTIES.  Voice of Translator: FOLLOW UP QUESTION. THANK YOU. THE PRIME MINISTER SAID EARLIER THAT HE HAD NEW INFORMATION FOR AN ASSISTANCE PROGRAM FOR LARGER BUSINESSES. CAN YOU TELL US ANYTHING MORE ABOUT THAT? DOES THIS CONCERN RENTS FOR LARGER BUSINESSES TOO?  Voice of Translator: THANK YOU. WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE ALSO CHALLENGES FOR LARGER BUSINESSES. WE HAVE ALREADY IMPLEMENTED SOME MEASURES, THE WAGE SUBSIDY IS ALWAYS IMPORTANT FOR LARGER BUSINESSES TOO. WE ALSO KNOW THAT THEY LIKE LARGER BUSINESSES NEED ACCESS TO CREDIT. THAT'S WHY WE'RE TRYING TO CONSIDER HOW WE CAN COME UP WITH AN ASSURANCE OF SUFFICIENT LEVELS OF CREDIT FOR THEM. SO THEY CAN BRIDGE THIS PERIOD UNTIL WE COME TO A BETTER SITUATION. SO OVER THE COMING DAYS, WE WILL HAVE MORE INFORMATION TO GIVE YOU. [ End of TRANSLATION ] THANK YOU MINISTER. NEXT QUESTION.  NEXT QUESTION FROM LAURA FROM "THE CANADIAN PRESS". PLEASE GO AHEAD.  THANK YOU. MINISTER FREELAND YOU SAID IT FEEL LIKE A VERY LONG TIME AGO THAT MAY WOULD BE A TIME WHEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WOULD BE REOPENING DISCUSSIONS ABOUT HEALTH TRANSFERS WITH THE PROVINCES. ARE THOSE DISCUSSIONS STILL EXPECTED TO HAPPEN NEXT MONTH? AND HOW IS THIS PANDEMIC INFORMED THOSE DISCUSSIONS?  THANKS FOR THE QUESTION LAURA. AS WE HAVE HEARD FROM THE PRIME MINISTER THIS AFTERNOON AND JUST OVER AN HOUR WE WILL -- THE PRIME MINISTER WILL HAVE A FIRST MINISTERS' MEETING THAT I WILL ATTEND. I THINK THAT ONE OF CHIEF SUBJECTS WILL BE A DISCUSSION AROUND PRINCIPLES AND STANDARDS ACROSS THE COUNTRY FOR REOPENING THE ECONOMY. I AM CERTAIN WE WILL ALSO CONTINUE TO DISCUSS THE HEALTH CARE RESPONSE TO THE CORONAVIRUS AND THE COSTS OF THAT RESPONSE. SO THAT IS AN ON GOING DISCUSSION WITH THE PROVINCES. IT INCLUDES BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO THE PROCUREMENT WORK IN THE MADE IN CANADA WORK WE HAVE HEARD ABOUT FROM ANITA AND NAV JUST NOW. IT ALSO INCLUDES SOME EXTRAORDINARY EFFORTS BY THE CANADIAN ARMED FORCES THAT WE'RE SEEING IN ONTARIO AND QUEBEC. THE PRIME MINISTER SAID SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT AT THE GOING OF THE CORONAVIRUS CRISIS WHICH IS THAT WE WERE NOT GOING TO QUIBBLE ABOUT FEDERAL AND PROVINCIAL RESPONSIBILITIES. WE WERE NOT GOING TO BE LIMITED IN OUR RESPONSE OVER QUESTIONS OVER WHO WOULD BE PAYING THE BILL WHEN IT CAME TO PROVIDING URGENT HEALTH CARE TO CANADIANS. AND THAT IS OUR APPROACH RIGHT NOW TO THIS URGENT SITUATION. IN TERMS OF THE LONGER TERM, I THINK THAT WE ARE STILL IN A SITUATION WHERE OUR HOUSE IS ON FIRE AND ALL OF US NEED TO BE REALLY REALLY FOCUSED ON PUTTING THE FIRE OUT. BUT THERE FOR SURE ARE SOME LONGER TERM LESSONS THAT I THINK WE ARE ALL LEARNING RIGHT NOW. VERY CENTRAL IN MY MIND AND I KNOW THAT OF MANY, MANY CANADIANS IS THAT COLLECTIVELY WE NEED TO DO A MUCH BETTER JOB OF CARING FOR OUR ELDERS.  LAURA, FOLLOW UP.  THANK YOU. AND FOR MINISTER MORNEAU, WE'RE HEARING FROM SOME SMALL BUSINESS FEDERATIONS WHO ARE CONCERNED THAT THE PROGRAM TO SUBSIDIZE RENT FOR SMALL BUSINESSES IS VOLUNTARY ON THE PART OF THE LANDLORD. AND SO EVEN IF A SMALL BUSINESS FEELS THEY REALLY NEED THE HELP, THEIR LANDLORD MAY NOT WANT TO PLAY BALL SO TO SPEAK. WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THEM?  WELL, LET ME START BY SAYING WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT MANY OF THOSE SMALL BUSINESSES ARE GOING THROUGH ENORMOUS CHALLENGES. THE LANDLORDS ALSO HAVE BEEN GOING THROUGH CHALLENGES BECAUSE IN MANY CASES BUSINESSES HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO PAY. SO WE THINK THAT THIS PROVIDES A VERY GOOD INCENTIVE FOR BOTH PARTIES. FOR THE SMALL BUSINESS THEY WILL HAVE 75% REDUCTION IN THEIR RENT. SO THEY WILL BE PAYING 25%. FOR THE LANDLORD THEY WILL HAVE A GUARANTEE OF 75% OF THEIR RENT BECAUSE 25 WILL BE PAID FOR BY THE SMALL BUSINESS AND 50% IN A FORGIVABLE LOAN BY THE CANADA MORTGAGE AND HOUSING CORPORATION. I THINK THERE'S A GOOD INCENTIVE ON BOTH SIDES. WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS BEING A SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM WORKING TOGETHER OF COURSE WITH THE PROVINCES AND ENSURING THAT PEOPLE WORK TOGETHER TO GET THE RIGHT OUT COME.  THANK YOU MINISTER. OPERATOR, NEXT QUESTION, PLEASE.  THANK YOU. MERCI. OUR NEXT QUESTION IS FROM CANADIAN PRESS. [ Speaking FRENCH ]  Voice of Translator: YES, HELLO EVERY ONE. MY QUESTIONS ARE ALSO ADDRESSED TO MINISTER MORNEAU. PLEASE FEEL FREE TO ANSWER IN ENGLISH IF YOU WISH. WE'RE ALL CONNECTED RIGHT NOW. WE'RE ALL TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW THIS RENTAL PROGRAM WILL WORK. COULD YOU EXPLAIN TO US STEP BY STEP LET'S SAY I'M A BUSINESS OWNER OR THE OWNER OF A BUSINESS OF SMALL BUSINESSES TO WHOM I'M RENTING. HOW EXACTLY IS IT GOING TO WORK? WHERE WILL THE MONEY COME FROM?  Voice of Translator: WELL, AS YOU -- I WILL ANSWER IN QUESTION. [ End of TRANSLATION ]  THE LARD LORD WILL COME TO AGREEMENT THAT TENANT WILL GET 75% REDUCTION IN THE RENT AND LANDLORD BY ALLOWING THAT WILL BE ABLE TO GET A LOAN FROM THE CANADIAN MORTGAGE AND HOUSING CORPORATION. THAT LOAN WILL BE FORGIVE . FOR 50% OF THE TOTAL RENT. THAT WILL BE FORGIVEN WHEN THEY SHOW THEY HAVE GIVEN THAT REDUCTION TO THE SMALL BUSINESS, TO THE TENANT. SO THAT'S THE WAY THAT IT'S INTENDED TO WORK. IT'S ADMINISTERED THROUGH THE CANADA MORTGAGE AND HOUSING CORPORATION THROUGH OUR MORTGAGE SYSTEM. AND WE KNOW THAT THAT WILL ENABLE THE LANDLORD TO HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT IN THEIR SITUATION, THEY'LL GET 75% OF THE RENT PAID. AND THE SMALL BUSINESS TO KNOW THEY'RE GOING TO GET A 75% REDUCTION. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL BE PICKING UP THE FORGIVABLE LOAN, SO 50% OF THE COST, AND THEN WHAT WILL HAPPEN IS FROM THAT LOAN, THE PROVINCES WILL BE PAYING 25% OF THE OVER ALL COST. SO THAT'S THE APPROACH. THAT'S HOW IT WILL WORK. AND WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING A VERY POSITIVE SITUATION FOR TENANTS AND ALSO FOR LANDLORDS WHO CAN NOW HAVE MORE CONFIDENCE THAT THEIR TENANTS WILL BE ABLE TO STAY IN THE PROPERTY AND BRIDGE THE TIME THROUGH THIS COVID-19 CRISIS SO THEY WILL BE ABLE TO GET BACK TO BUSINESS WHEN WE'RE THROUGH IT. [ Speaking FRENCH ]  Voice of Translator: FOLLOW UP QUESTION.  Voice of Translator: THANK YOU. THAT IS MUCH MORE CLEAR. MY NEXT QUESTION IS ADDRESSED TO Ms. FREELAND, I'M NOT SURE IF YOU HAVE FURTHER DETAILS ON THIS. Mr. TRUDEAU SUGGESTED EARLIER THAT THE MINISTER OF PUBLIC SAFETY WAS GOING TO SEND TROOPS TO QUEBEC AND ONTARIO. I WONDERED IF WE COULD GET MORE DETAILS AS TO THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT WILL BE SENT. ARE WE TALKING ABOUT 1,000 PEOPLE PER PROVINCE? AND WHEN CAN WE EXPECT TO SEE THEM IN THESE LONG-TERM CARE RESIDENT RESIDENCES IN THESE PROVINCES?  Voice of Translator: I'M SORRY, CAN I NOT SHARE SPECIFIC NUMBERS AT THIS TIME. I DISCUSSED THAT ISSUE THIS MORNING WITH MINISTER HARJIT SAJJAN AND BLAIR ARE COMMITTED AND WORKING WITH CLOSE COLLABORATION WITH QUEBEC IN ORDER TO ORGANIZE THE CORRECT TEAMS, THE RIGHT NUMBERS, THE RIGHT PLACES TO SEND THE CANADIAN ARMED FORCES MEMBERS. WE UNDERSTAND QUEBEC'S NEEDS AND ONTARIO'S NEEDS. BUT WE HAVE TO ORGANIZE EVERYTHING PROPERLY. WE NEED STAFF WITH TRAINING -- PROPER TRAINING WITH MEDICAL TRAINING SO IT WILL TAKE A BIT MORE TIME. NOT MUCH MORE TIME. BECAUSE WE ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT EVERY HOUR COUNTS TO HELP PEOPLE. BUT IT WILL TAKE A BIT MORE TIME TO ARRIVE AT EXACTLY WHO WILL BE SENT AND WHERE THEY WILL BE SENT. I ASSURE YOU. I WANT TO ASSURE THE PEOPLE OF QUEBEC AND ONTARIO THAT WE ABSOLUTELY UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS A VERY, VERY SERIOUS SITUATION. AND THAT CANADA WILL BE THERE TO HELP QUEBECERS AND ONTARIANS. [ End of TRANSLATION ]  THANK YOU MINISTER. JULIE A QUESTION FOR CBC THE QUESTION FOR Mr. MORNEAU. I THINK EVERY ONE UNDERSTANDS THE NEED TO HELP CANADIANS IN THIS CRISIS. I'M WONDERING IF THERE IS A LIMIT TO HOW MUCH YOU CAN OR WILL SPEND. AT SOME POINT DO YOU JUST HIT A WALL? FOR EXAMPLE IF WE'RE IN THE PANDEMIC THIS TIME NEXT YEAR, CAN YOU CONTINUE TO SPEND AT THIS RATE?  WELL, THANKS JULIE. THE WAY TO THINK ABOUT THE CHALLENGE WE'RE FACING IS THAT WE NEED TO HAVE AN ECONOMY WHEN WE GET THROUGH THIS CRISIS. SO WE ARE SUPPORTING INDIVIDUALS, WE ARE SUPPORTING BUSINESSES TO GET TRUE THIS TIME TO ACTUALLY HAVE THE ABILITY TO GET PEOPLE BACK TO WORK RAPIDLY AND CONNECTED WITH THE EMPLOYER AND BUSINESSES ARE ABLE TO FUNCTION AND ABLE TO GET BACK UP AND RUNNING. WE THINK THAT THE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS THAT THE CANADIAN GOVERNMENT HAS MADE IN SUPPORTING PEOPLE, IN SUPPORTING BUSINESSES WILL PREPARE US BETTER AT THE OUT COME TO HAVE A STRONGER ECONOMY. WE THINK IT WOULD BE IMPRUDENT OF US TO NOT SUPPORT PEOPLE NOW AND LEAVE OURSELVES WITH A BIGGER CHALLENGE AFTER. SO THAT IS OUR FRAME OF REFERENCE IN EVERYTHING THAT WE'RE DOING. OF COURSE, WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MEASURES WE TAKE ARE CREATING THE RIGHT INCENTIVES AND CREATING THE RIGHT LENGTH OF TIME FOR THE BRIDGE THAT WE NEED. AND THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO DO WITH EVERY PROGRAM TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE COST EFFECTIVE AND THE RIGHT VALUE. BUT MAKE NO MISTAKE, WE THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS TO ENSURE WE HAVE AN ECONOMY COMING OUT OF THIS, THAT WE HAVE GREAT JOBS, THAT WE HAVE STRONG BUSINESSES, THAT WE HAVE NOT FOR PROFITS CONTINUED TO HELP PEOPLE IN THE SERVICE THEY'VE BEEN PROVIDING FOR YEARS. AND THE ONLY WAY WE CAN DO THAT IS PROVIDING MEASURES LIKE THE ONE TODAY THAT ALLOWS SMALL BUSINESSES TO GET THROUGH THIS TIME WHILE NOT HAVING TO PAY FOR THEIR ENTIRE RENT IF THEY HAVE NO REVENUES. THAT WE SEE AS CRITICAL TO HAVE AN ECONOMY THAT WILL FUNCTION AFTERWARDS.  SO IF CANADA'S CREDIT RATING GOES DOWN, WHAT WILL THAT MEAN FOR HOW MUCH IT WILL COST TO SERVICE ALL THE DEBT THAT WE'RE PILING UP AND TO THE VALUE OF THE LOONIE?  AGAIN, I THINK THE WAY TO THINK ABOUT THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO OUR ABILITY TO BE FISCALLY SATISFACTORY AND SUCCESSFUL IS WE HAVE A STRONG ECONOMY COMING OUT OF THIS. SO THAT IS ACTUALLY WHAT'S GOING TO BE THE FOUNDATION THAT WILL ALLOW US TO PAY DOWN DEBTS, THAT WILL ALLOW US TO CONTINUE SUPPORTING CANADIANS AND ALLOW US TO COMPARE FAVORABLY AGAINST OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD. SO THAT IS THE FRAME THAT WE HAVE TAKEN. YOU HAVE SEEN, I THINK, THAT CANADA IS REALLY A LEADER AMONG OTHER COUNTRIES IN SUPPORTING INDIVIDUALS AND SUPPORTING BUSINESSES AND WE THINK THAT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO TO GET US THROUGH THIS.  IAN WOOD, CTV NEWS. MINISTER MORNEAU, I WANT TO PICK UP ON THAT. THIS NEW PLAN LIKE MANY OF THE OTHER PERSONAL AND BUSINESS EMERGENCY PLANS HAVE BEEN PUT IN PLACE IS SET TO GO THROUGH JUNE. WHAT'S THE PLAN AFTER THAT BECAUSE WE'RE TOLD WE'RE NOT OUT OF THE WOODS YET? SO ARE THESE GOING TO BE EXTENDED INTO THE SUMMER? OR PEOPLE ON THEIR OWN COME JULY 1ST OR WHEN EVER THE PROGRAMS END?  I THINK WHAT YOU HAVE SEEN IN ALL OF THE MEASURES THAT WE HAVE TAKEN IS THAT WE HAVE TAKEN MEASURES THAT WE THINK ARE APPROPRIATE FOR THE MEASURE WE HAVE RIGHT NOW. SO THIS MEASURE IS FOR THE MONTHS OF RENT FOR APRIL, MAY, AND JUNE. WE BELIEVE WE HAVE INFORMATION TO MAKE DECISIONS BASED ON WHAT WE THINK IS HAPPENING IN APRIL, MAY, AND JUNE. WE TOOK A SIMILAR APPROACH IN PROVIDING THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE BENEFIT WHICH GOES FOR 16 WEEKS. AND WAGE SUBSIDY THAT GOES FOR 12 WEEKS. SO AS WE HAVE INFORMATION, WE'RE TAKING DECISIONS, WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE TAKE THOSE DECISIONS AND RECONSIDER THEM AS WE HAVE MORE INFORMATION. SO AS OF NOW, WE BELIEVE THIS IS THE APPROPRIATE DURATION FOR THIS PROGRAM. WE BELIEVE IT PROVIDES VERY STRONG SUPPORT FOR SMALL BUSINESSES, 75% REDUCTION IN THEIR RENT, AND STRONG SUPPORT FOR TENANTS -- FOR LANDLORDS WHO NOW HAVE 75% OF THE RENT WILL BE PAID GIVING THEM THE ABILITY TO PAY THE MORTGAGES TO KEEP THE PROPERTIES FUNKAL. -- FUNCTIONAL. WE'LL CONTINUE TO CONSIDER ALL THE INFORMATION THAT COMES IN AND OF COURSE WORK WITH ALL OF OUR PARTNERS TO CONSIDER WE PROVIDE THE RIGHT BRIDGE TO GET THROUGH THIS.  MY SECOND QUESTION FOR MINISTER FREELAND AND Dr. TAM, ARE YOU CONCERNED ABOUT THE PATCH WORK APPROACH TO LOOSENING RESTRICTIONS THAT SASKATCHEWAN IS OPENING UP THINGS LIKE GOLF COURSES AND PARKS AND MUNICIPALITIES SAID OTHER THINGS AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS THEIR APPROACH. ARE YOU CONCERNED ABOUT THE PATCH WORK APPROACH TO LOOSENING RESTRICTIONS? ARE WE GOING TO SEE NEW MODELING DATA THAT WAS EXPECTED THIS WEEK?  SO LET ME START AND THEN I'LL ASK Dr. TAM TO OFFER HER THOUGHTS TOO. AS WE HAVE SAID, THERE WILL BE A CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE FIRST MINISTERS THAT I'LL PARTICIPATE IN TOO THIS AFTERNOON. AND ONE OF THE CHIEF SUBJECTS TO BE DISCUSSED WILL BE APPROACHES, AN APPROACH TO RESTARTING THE CANADIAN ECONOMY. OUR VIEW IS THAT AS A COUNTRY WE SHOULD HAVE SHARED PRINCIPLES AND SHARED STANDARDS THAT HELP GUIDE US ALL IN KNOWING WHEN AND HOW TO APPROACH THE RESTART OF THE ECONOMY. AT THE SAME TIME, WE ALSO ABSOLUTELY UNDERSTAND THAT WE ARE A HUGE AND DIVERSE COUNTRY AND A HUGE AND DIVERSE COUNTRY THAT HAS HAD AND CONTINUES TO HAVE VERY DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES OF THIS GLOBAL PANDEMIC. AND SO THAT MEANS THAT INEVITABLY AND QUITE RIGHTLY, WE WILL BE SEEING A DIFFERENT TIMING, A DIFFERENT PACE OF THE RESTART ACROSS THE COUNTRY. SIMPLY BECAUSE THE EXPERIENCE OF THE PANDEMIC HAS BEEN AND CONTINUES TO BE DIFFERENT ACROSS THE COUNTRY. WE HOPE AND I HAVE A LOT OF CONFIDENCE THAT IN MOVING INTO THIS NEXT STAGE AND I DON'T THINK WE'RE THERE YET, IN MOVING INTO THIS NEXT STAGE, WE WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE A REALLY COLLABORATIVE APPROACH BETWEEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THE PROVINCES AND TERRITORIES AND AMONG THE PROVINCES AND TERRITORIES AND THAT ALL OF US WILL CONTINUE TO BE GUIDED BY THE THING THAT MATTERS THE MOST TO EVERY ONE, WHICH IS THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF CANADIANS. Dr. TAM.  ON THE PUBLIC HEALTH SIDE, WE COLLABORATE ON AN ONGOING BASIS WITH ALL CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICERS OF HEALTH. AND WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO IS ESTABLISH THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES AND CRITERIA FOR EACH OF THE PROVINCES AND TERRITORIES TO CALIBRATE THEIR SORT OF PATH TO THE NEW NORMAL. I THINK EVERY ONE AGREES THAT WE HAVE TO BE EXTREMELY CAUTIOUS BECAUSE WE CANNOT AFFORD TO HAVE ANOTHER UPSWING IN A BIGGER WAVE. SO THAT'S THE CONCERN. SO THE TYPE OF APPROACH THAT WE THINK EVERY JURISDICTION WOULD FOLLOW IS ABSOLUTELY MAKE SURE TRANSMISSION HAS COME DOWN ALL THE WAY TO THE BOTTOM OF THAT CURVE. AND SOME OF THE CRITERIA THAT GOES WITH IT THAT THE HEALTH SYSTEM CAPACITIES ARE IN PLACE AND HAVE THE ABILITY TO SURGE SHOULD WE SEE ANOTHER CLUSTER OR OUT BREAK THAT OUT BREAK RISKS ARE MINIMIZED IN SPECIAL SETTINGS LIKE THOSE OF LONG-TERM CARE FACILITIES AND OTHER MAYBE CONGREGATE HOUSING AREAS LIKE PERSONS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS, FOR EXAMPLE, AND THAT THEY HAVE ADVISED THEIR WORKPLACES IN TERMS OF THEIR PREVENTATIVE MEASURES THEY CAN TAKE SO THAT THEY CAN REOPEN SAFELY. AS WELL, I THINK ALL OF US RECOGNIZE THAT THE IMPORTATION RISK IS ONE THING THAT WE WILL TRY AND PREVENT. AND IT'S NOT UNTIL THE DOMESTIC SORT OF TRANSMISSIONS HAVE ALL BEEN UNDER CONTROL THAT WE CAN EVEN BEGIN TO LOOK AT THOSE. SHORING UP IMPORTATION APPROACHES. AND ALSO KEEP ENSURING THAT OUR PUBLIC IS ENGAGED. SO THOSE ARE THE KIND OF AREAS THAT WE ARE WORKING THROUGH AND AGREE ON ESSENTIALLY. BUT THEN THAT ALLOWS, I THINK EACH OF THE JURISDICTION TO ASSESS THEIR PARTICULAR SITUATION. AND WITH ALL OF US MOVING SORT OF CAUTIOUSLY THROUGH THAT PATH. SO ABSOLUTELY I THINK CANADA IS SUCH A BIG COUNTRY. YOU CANNOT SORT OF HOLD UP CERTAIN AREAS OF RESUMING CERTAIN ACTIVITIES WHILE AT THE SAME TIME OF COURSE ANOTHER JURISDICTION THAT STILL TRYING TO GET OUT BREAKS AND CONTROL MUST CONTINUE TO DO THAT AS WELL. BUT COORDINATION AND SHARING OF INFORMATION IS ACTUALLY VERY IMPORTANT. SO THAT PEOPLE ARE AWARE OF WHAT'S GOING ON ACROSS CANADA.  [ INAUDIBLE ]  YES, WE ARE READY TO DO THAT. JUST A TIMING FOR WHEN WE CAN SORT OF QUEUE IT IN AS IT WERE. THANK YOU.  HELLO MINISTER FREELAND. A RECENT SURVEY SHOWED THAT HALF OF RURAL ALBERTA DOCTORS IN 44 LOCATIONS WERE PLANNING ON WITHDRAWING THEIR SERVICES FROM HOSPITAL S BECAUSE OF CONTACT DISPUTES WITH THE ALBERTA GOVERNMENT. DOES THIS CAUSE ANY CONCERN TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DURING A PANDEMIC?  YOU KNOW, I WAS VERY PERSONALLY MOVED BY THE POEM THAT Dr. TAM READ TO US THIS -- EARLIER TODAY. I THINK PROBABLY A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE. MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS ACROSS CANADA ARE TRULY HEROES RIGHT NOW. AND WE NEED ALL OF THEM. I PERSONALLY HAVE TREMENDOUS FAITH AND CONFIDENCE THAT THE MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE TODAY HONOURING THEIR MOST IMPORTANT OBLIGATION, WHICH IS TO SAVE CANADIAN LIVES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. I KNOW THAT IS WHAT THEY'RE DOING. I AM GRATEFUL TO THEM. OF COURSE, THERE ARE SPECIFIC POLITICAL ISSUES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. BUT I THINK RIGHT NOW, EVERY ONE'S PRIORITY NEEDS TO BE AND I THINK IN REALITY IT IS TAKING CARE OF AND PROTECTING CANADIANS. AND I CAN SAY MY DAD IS GETTING READY TO GO OUT IN THE FIELDS IN RURAL ALBERTA, HE'S 75 YEARS OLD. I'M A LITTLE BIT WORRIED ABOUT HIM. I SAID, DAD, HOW DO YOU FEEL? HE SAID HE FEELS PERSONALLY GREAT. AND HE HAS 100% CONFIDENCE IN THE MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS IN NORTHERN ALBERTA.  THANK YOU.  DO WE HAVE TIME FOR ANOTHER ONE?  MAYBE ONE LAST -- IT'S 12:56.  DO YOU HAVE ANY ADVICE ON HOW TO RESOLVE THIS SITUATION FROM THE FEDERAL LEVEL?  I -- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR ALL OF US TODAY TO BEAR TWO THINGS IN MIND. THE FIRST IS THERE IS OUR HOUSE IS ON FIRE. AND ALL OF US NEED TO FOCUS FIRST AND FOREMOST ON THAT. REALLY BELIEVE THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF CANADIANS ARE DOING THAT. SECONDLY I JUST HAVE TREMENDOUS RESPECT FOR ALL OF CANADA'S HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS. I THINK ALL OF US SHOULD BE GUIDED BY THAT TOO.  NOW 12:57. WE ARE JUST GOING TO TAKE A MOMENT TO REMEMBER THE VICTIMS OF THE NOVA SCOTIA SHOOTING. IF EVERYBODY COULD PLEASE. [ Please Stand BY ]  THANK YOU.  (Voice of Translator): THIS BRINGS TODAY'S PRESS CONFERENCE TO AN END.  HELLO AGAIN. YOU'RE
