 Sophie Preston we we wanted to find out really who this mute beauty was so we did some checking because you look at documents as any one should you're quite right to do that mm-hmm and you said you did look at her passport yeah and we did the same thing now what we have here this is a passport that is real this is that we know this one for sure and I'm not saying this one is understand we know this one sure because he works with us here and I've known him for 20 years so I know this person's for real and so I know this is a legitimate passport and so I'll put it up here so we can compare between the two now one of the things that bothered me here is that there are two different names on this passport now we had to block this out up here because we don't want to actually show the name but this name starts with a J up here where they signed the passport but the name on the passport down here that has been typed in is Sophie Preston but the person that signed this passport is not Sophie Preston it's up here and it's a name that starts with a J then I looked at the picture and we've blurred the picture out because I'll get to that in a minute but you notice the picture is on top of the United States seal in the actual passport the seal is on top of the picture and the reason that's a significant finding is because it tells you that this picture has been pasted on top of an existing passport because it's covering up the seal whereas the seal encroaches on the picture in a real passport can I comment on this I didn't say the race okay the passport you have I know that that's fraudulent but in the research that was done in sending documents to your people I was sending a lot of stuff so anything I found in my internet I was sent you know my computer I was sending that out I know that one's fraud there was another one I'm not sure I ever found in the speed of things I set that one out I know that one's fraudulent myself and I know why it's further kill me she's had two attorneys okay the first one her first attorney wanted to get me convinced to move this along because he had money issues himself when I confronted her in this guy basically she said I've never seen that before so I I said okay well she's probably lying to me but I said let's find out when I confronted him with it he basically said he made it up into his fraudulent so I did know that was fraudulent already another was sent to me though that I don't think is fraud and I son fortune I didn't get that one - oh you just forgot to give us that one no I didn't find it we're talking about we're talking about in a few days putting hundreds of things together I'm computer look I can't help you if you just keep shooting yourself in the foot don't tell me about a document you have that you didn't send me I didn't find it I found that when I forgot I had to yeah well remember it next time okay this is fraudulent you see this is clearly fraudulent the lines down here are red we are these fraudulent real ones are blind in a different form okay let's move on to something that you did send us on purpose okay I sent that to you on purpose too but I did look at it closely when I did it oh this is a really fraudulent this is a driver's license yeah that was that's what he said - okay you know this is fraudulent okay so she said you have a fraudulent passport and a fraudulent driver's license she didn't send it to me actually this attorney did show me a document that's not fraudulent well I don't have it on me do you understand that your assistants were asking for information at a rapid-fire rate over a lot of people in a very short period of time yeah because they care a lot about what happens to you yes and I was not prepared at that moment to do it I had to do it very quickly and while I was doing it more requests came in I was doing that as fast as I could so if the mistakes were made yeah they were good yeah you were busy being belligerent is the reason you were having trouble getting all your dogs yes that is a fact
