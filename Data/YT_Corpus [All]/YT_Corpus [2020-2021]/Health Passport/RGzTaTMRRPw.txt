 hey john thanks for doing this man i appreciate it thanks for asking me we're going to talk about the show in a second but curious what you've been up to for the last six months you like the rest of us kind of hunkered down at home watching movies and baseball games well finally baseball games came back and both most chicago teams are doing great so looks like they're going to both be in the playoffs so that's pretty exciting but um it's very strange you know to sort of not be able to go to the games and all that but yeah i've been sort of hunkered down and reading and writing a bit and catching up on a lot of old movies it's definitely a time to sit and watch movies and watch series and people are going to be going crazy for utopia i mean we were just talking a minute ago about my gosh how it touches on themes that we see today shot obviously before this pandemic but touching on all the things that we've seen around it so how do you describe this this show to people i went in cold which i think is a good way to watch a show the best way to go and just bam and it hits you right out of the gate so john how do you explain this rather complicated complex show to people well there are um the british series which gillian flynn has updated and included a big biotech um angle which i'm kind of a part of with another part of the story but the original show was um that there was a comic called uh dystopia that had in it these nostradamus like predictions about future events and calamities and um kind of all the conspiracy theories and that are sort of known to man but that are under the banner of what governments and corporations are doing to people without their knowledge right so it's half rooted in reality like if they say there's the jfk assassination and then there's a lot of people who go crazy about it but it's rooted in at least half of the truth that jfk got assassinated so this comic book has all these truths in it and then it emerges that there's a sequel called utopia and that's when the story begins and as soon as this new comic with all these secrets and it emerges the fanboys and girls and all these sorts of forces come in to try to get hold of it because i guess the information is quite valuable to many many different factions and again i don't want to reveal too much about the show because people are going to love digging through it but we're talking about a pandemic which obviously we're going through now um you couldn't have predicted that when you were shooting the show they were conceiving of the show but do you see all the resonant themes throughout the show of what we're going through today not just the fact that we're in a pandemic but all that follows from that disinformation confusion all of those things yes and and you know a lot of those paranoid um thrillers of the you know 70s that were so great like like like marathon man you know those kinds of things um so yeah all that's in it and um since the theme is uh that the world is sort of hurtling towards you know kind of extinction mass extinction if on if left unchecked with climate change and nuclear wars and viruses all those very dark things that would keep people up at night uh all the time um there's no way to sort of avoid the fact that that is the theme of the piece and that was in the original british piece as well but uh it's i guess surreal would be the only word you could use to describe the fact that what happens in the show you know you look out your window and um and look at the television and read the papers and it seems like it seems a little bit too eerily similar especially with the west being on fire and climate change and floods all this terrible terrible these terrible tragedies hurricanes in the gulf it's coming from every direction you touched on conspiracy theories which i thought was so resonant as i watched the show specifically to what's going on right now you talk about a half truth being part of a conspiracy theory and what's happening today is there tends not to be a truth around it it just tends to be something that's floating out there for people who are looking for something to grab onto so what do you think is at the the heart of a conspiracy theory not just in your show but but what we're seeing right now is it fear is it uncertainty is it a lack of solid information what makes a conspiracy theory take off well i think there's you have to sort of separate you know there's the classic conspiracy theories and thrillers um that you can see in in novels and and films that have to do with uh people's relationship to power so you know uh daniel ellsberg releases the pentagon papers and all this you know if you if he would have said what he had said at the time that they'd say oh you're crazy no one would believe that then he releases the documents right so there's people who want to know what the government is doing in their name or people who want to know what giant corporations are doing in their name right and so there's that element to it that is kind of straight up it's about the imbalance of power and the abuse of power but what we have now with sort of surveillance capitalism is the algorithm just keeps reinforcing people's fears and prejudices and hates and you have you actually have um propaganda and artificial reality coming that is based in no truth it's not exploiting a truth or anything like that so this is the utopia is firmly in the other camp you know it's trying to figure out what corporations governments are doing and little people trying to figure it out and figure out the story and figure out the truth um but it inhabits a world that has all that other things in it as well which is a which is really a truly terrible reality we're all living through the um you know the social media companies are really data mining companies masquerading as social media companies and they're selling off our information and it's very unnatural for a company to know more about you and i than we know about ourselves that's very interesting dark dystopic reality and um so you're you know the first fourth and seventh row kind of all of those are really compromised at the point of contact with a lot of these with these platforms and hopefully there'll be some accountability and some of them will be broken up and regulated so as i looked at your character dr christie i wondered about what inspired him what did you go to in our real life culture if you did to find a sort of a puppet master type character somebody who has the ability to control what's happening in the culture in our society yeah i mean sometimes uh um you can go back to like just myths and i don't know if you ever remember that great the power of myth the joseph campbell series you know yeah yeah but when you read through mythologies you know there's uh in a story when you go when you go meet the dragon or you go meet the troll under the bridge or you go meet the devil right they know all your secrets and they're going to put you through an initiation of sorts and they seem to have an omnipresent kind of understanding of knowing exactly where what your secrets are and how you what makes you tick and um so i think it's it was along those sort of that mythological level that i sort of took some of it from that's how i interpreted and then there's plenty of people i've been kind of you know like you have had a fortunate life where you grew up in evanston near near i think where you grew up yep but yeah we've you know gotten to travel the world and meet all sorts of people you know from people in positions of power to everyday people on the street and um so you know i've met a lot of those people over my travels who ended up being big tech you know movers and shakers and uh and i've spoken to some some people who are pretty powerful over the years and so you catalog catalog those conversations and try to remember you know the human being within the power and the power structure and then what that power does to their their personality maybe over time and um so there are a couple ones especially um some of the biggest moguls of today are very conscious of having a public branded face to whatever they're doing whereas before i think you know rockefeller and you know in the old days they didn't you know you didn't talk to anybody unless they had to all right teddy roosevelt was calling him into congress right they were like right way out front and they really want to make sure that they have a brand that is multi-racial pluralistic democratic empathetic but of course what they're doing underneath it might be another story so what do you think drives dr christie or perhaps those kind of characters that we're talking about right now is it ego is it money is it power is it some combination of those things i think it's always probably a different combination depending on the person and it's hard you know you don't want to make blanket judgments about people as a stock character architect but i think there's certainly an element to um christie and some of the people you've met who are very successful but they're incredibly driven you know they're visionary and that sort of obsession and that commitment which is almost like a stalinist commitment um can appear you know heroic and perhaps insane at times depending on where you're where you're standing in the river you know but um so i think you know it's i've met a few of them yeah and talked to a few of them they're always interesting too the the billionaires of that level are they they want to be liked yes they want you to know that they're not bad guys or women and they want to be understood and they're very insecure about what you think of them which i found was just interesting psychologically because you think you know if you have that much power and wealth you might you know be able to be sure of yourself in some ways but they actually end up you know being quite confessional about it because i think nobody actually really believes that they're worth or have made 80 billion dollars they don't believe it no no they want you to know somewhere that they know they shouldn't have it all but they're they're good people and look at hear the good things we're doing hey yeah it would be quite an ego trip if you thought you deserved that much money right and of course you don't deserve it and you didn't make it you made it by looting the commonwealth and and by by partnerships there's always um socialism for the one percent and rugged individualism for the working class but corporate socialism has been a constant so they know that too and they sort of know that other people know that so i find it interesting that they're very kind of very insecure and very aware of their image um not all of them but some that it meant i'm so interested john because you are so selective and have been over the course of your career about the characters you play and the roles you take what was it about this one that said yeah this is worth several months or a year or whatever it's going to be of my time to go out and make a show because i'm sure stuff comes your way all the time that you're like what was it about this i would i would challenge that assumption really yeah of course you know it's like uh this this was um it was quite the opposite you know if you can get a great role you know if you can work with the david cronenberg or if someone asks you to play brian wilson at 11 mercy that those are very easy things to say yes to but if you can't get a great role then you sort of do a job or try to get one of your things funded and if you can't get the money you know you don't work as much and you work on other things but this was one of those things where you get a call and say you're in chicago saying gillian flynn is going to redo this great british show utopia she's going to not just remake the old thing she's turning it into something new she wants you to be in it we want to send you the eight episodes you're saying what a lovely phone call to get one morning you're very flattered and it's nice to be wanted and so um i had very high expectations and i i got all the scripts and i got a cup of coffee and i you know it started at about two o'clock in the afternoon and i finished it at about 10 o'clock at night and i it was just an absolute page turner it's a certain kind of architecture in the writing that's very rigorous and very hard to pull off that i think gillian is kind of a master of which is you know you can always see who in the first act is around and think all right maybe they're going to be the people there but gillian sets trap doors that you can't see coming and you're constantly being shocked and surprised and then in retrospect it seems inevitable but only after you've gone through it all and she keeps having the anti and each episode there's more and more trap doors and you end up down different rabbit holes looking at a different cheshire cat and by the uh the final one like whatever whatever you've known about the first seven episodes in the eighth episode all of it gets thrown into a blender and it's pretty wild stuff so i i also was just loved the sheer uh ambition of the writing you know of the project so it was an easy it was a no-brainer for me it was nice to be asked nice to be wanted and nice to get a great role and work with great people so i guess the quite my question then was what's the threshold for you to say yes and it sounds like it's writing it's page turner great script writing uh you know who who's going to be running you know gillian's going to be running the show and there's a great company doing it that was going to do it with a healthy budget and all that stuff so yeah this was just sort of an easy no-brainer and if i was being if i appeared to be selective before it's probably because i couldn't my own things financed or didn't get good offers okay i gave you a charitable assessment then right you're giving me too much credit but i appreciate it do you ever john take a time and look back at your career starting you know as a young actor in chicago and a family of actors do you think back or do you ever stumble on cable on better off dead or say anything will you stop and watch those and say man look at that teenager who didn't know what was coming in his life yeah well i it's it's weird it's like having your um your yearbook uh your yearbook pictures on cable all the time it's kind of strange strange one no i'll uh i don't really look back too much but um if i find it sort of it's nice that people still are actually thinking or talking about some of those old movies and they want to screen them and sometimes they'll ask me to go to a q a afterwards a screening of an old movie and so in that sense i'll i relive them but um yeah i remember once i stopped because i had made a film called the grifters with angelic houston and stephen freer's and annette bending and it was a jim thompson not one when i saw it the first time i thought oh everything's great but i i screwed it up i didn't i wasn't good and then you know time came on and i i was going through the cable and i stopped and all of a sudden i started watching it and i saw something different and then i thought oh okay maybe i you know i didn't have the right set of eyes back then i thought it was better it was better than i remembered i thought the movie was very good i just i couldn't see something that i hadn't wasn't able to see before so you will see i'll only stop for like 30 seconds i would like to say you stop quickly and move on yeah because all i think about is the mistakes or something you could have done better you know of course people don't know what you what you were intending but you know does it ever get old hearing about the boombox people coming up to you on the street yeah but they come up about other things too and then i figure you know it's kind of a that's a kind of a champagne problem if you really look at the right if that's you know as tough as it's going to get for me i'm a pretty lucky guy yeah i was i was re-watching last night high fidelity too which by the way has been 20 years i don't know if you can believe that where you got the golden globe nomination and all of that when you look back on that film where does that fit in sort of your pantheon of movies in terms of experience you had and being able to watch it again and enjoy it and appreciate it well that was one of the um i don't know how many but i produced and written and a lot of a lot of them that i've done and that was one of them that i was able to do and that was um at an interesting time in the business so um joe roth was uh the executive and at disney he would have a slate of 30 films that he would do and 25 of them were designed to make money and very commercial but he would you know have seven or eight slots of his slate each year and he would just give them to filmmakers and was the best friend of filmmaker ever had so he he gave uh he gave me uh money to do gross point blank and high fidelity gave wes anderson the money to do rushmore spike lee got to make summer of sam you know these were all kind of mid-range studio movies with big budget so i felt very lucky to be uh working in hollywood in that 60s 70s era of of studio filmmaking was still still a little bit there um so i remembered uh just having an incredible amount of support from from them and from kathy nelson the music supervisor because uh the requests for music in that movie were herculean the fact that she was able to make all those deals and get all all the best music that we wanted um was really amazing and yeah i remember it being a very a lovely time i'm gonna make another assessment that you can disagree with which is that if you look over the course of your career characters that have the vast potential to be unlikable on paper are made likable and interesting by your performance is that a thread that you see through some of your characters i think i would think probably um in that you know you just want to make the characters as human as you can and then um and i think maybe connected to a different era of filmmaking where ambiguity is a virtue rather than something to be run from at all costs so you know when you look at some of the films that you really love you know like even i was watching carol reads the third man and everybody in the movie comes into the narrative exhausted feeling like they failed at everything almost existentially suicidal and they know everything they know all their faults they know everything that they failed and there's just that sort of you know the characters admit that they're deeply human and flawed right and that's sort of the opposite of branded you know movie star performances and stuff so i think i was always very interested in that ambiguity and and the fact that somebody would say is this character kind of is he likable is he not likable you know it's more like is it is that true like you know somebody tells a joke and it may be a truth that you really don't want to deal with but you laugh because it's true or it hurts or it winces so i think there's sort of an instinct just to run into that kind of trouble cinematically because you know drama has to do with problems yeah i mean way it's like you know it's a man versus himself whatever it is whatever the theme is but you know you're always going to be doing a story about a man with a problem or a woman with a problem it's interesting even there hearing you talk about hollywood for someone who's been as successful as you've been and who's got the name that you have has been in all these great movies that you have i don't know if contempt is the right word but in some ways just for the hollywood system of be a big star do the big movie do all the marketing all the things that come you strike me as somebody who just wants to do a good job in the performance and not deal with everything else that comes with it is that fair to say yeah hopefully i'm not contemptuous because um that you know i'm very fortunate and that's the truth um i'm one of the luckiest people you'll meet um so i hope i'm not contemptuous of it but i do think the idea of um ambiguity and doing something uh very human is at odds with the idea of a commodity or turning something into a product you know you know if you go to a fast food restaurant you the whole idea is you know exactly what a big mac tastes like and you're going to get it every time you go there and that's cool right but that's also not art so i think there's a little bit of a natural schism between those two things the idea of making a commodity and a commercial commodity out of a film and also wanting to do something that's just kind of absolutely unique and human and merging those is is not so not so easy sometimes and sometimes the selling of the films can be you know i remember when you'd be making these films and they'd say oh well you know we're going to try to get you in a best actor nomination or a best supporting actor nomination and you know then you court the golden globes you do all these things and then you have all these small films that are trying to buy for this kind of a seed in this luge of the academ the award cycles right free publicity and it's not any of these films faults but they all of a sudden they have to be the most profound greatest thing that ever was the other the greatest thing since sliced bread and instant classic revolutionary and you know you feel this marketing presence and it starts to like make you not like the film so i i started to um you know not watch any of the films around that time it's just so i could see them just as the filmmakers what they're trying to do so i don't have to respond to being told you know open up here's a you know a 40 millimeter howitzer we're going to blow this film down your throat you're going to look you know sometimes it got a little i don't know if that's contentious but it was just processed a little uh tiring right has have you paid any price for that view of the hollywood system in your career do you think i mean if there are things that you haven't been able to do because they said well he probably doesn't want to do it anyway i don't know i i i don't i don't think so i don't think anyone really has much of an attention span or memory about that kind of stuff you know yeah i would i also went and did all the you know i mean there's always a you know you're doing a dance a little bit so you'll try to make something that makes money and then leverage that into there's you know they call the foreign sales market so they'll pre-sell a thing based on your name so you have to make money in order to go do a project you love for less money so there's a dance but then you know i'll go do it and make the film try to make it as best i can make big films where you fly around the world you know promoting it and it helps if you have nice fun people to be with because i can a little bit you know after a while those junket days long don't like redford at the end of the candidate where he spread like man a little bit so the celery is not as quite uh doesn't it's not it's not as enjoyable right as doing it i think probably got to ask you before i let you go about uh politics you're very active on social media talking about what's going on in the country in politics and in corporations as we just had that conversation um what's your expectation for what happens this fall in november and for what comes after i i hope i hope i hope i hope i hope um that the trump administration's let them eat cake like they don't give a about anybody right they're fascists but the democrats are let i want to have my cake and eat it too right so they mobilized to kill sanders campaign and i understand that the democratic establishment every four years has to pretend like they haven't seen the ken burns documentaries on fdr i understand that game but the ken burns documentaries on the roosevelts do exist the new deal did happen and that's exactly what we need now so i think the democrats don't embrace some of those core principles in this climate now i think they're going to lose to trump and that's what i'm most frightened of that they feel like they can fight neo-fascism by return to the same neoliberalism pre-trump but the problem is is that the pre-trump landscape is the landscape that gave us trump so there has to be a correction and the billionaires have to pay they have to pay taxes they have to pay taxes that we can't have a permanent underclass of people who are in medical debt student debt who can't afford a 400 emergency who are being massacred because we can't take on the nra and our schools i mean there has to be a correction and has to come in an fdr style way in my in my opinion with all humility so i just hope that the democrats don't think that they can uh squeak by without doing the structural change that's needed so is your concern that progressives who supported bernie sanders for example like yourself um won't come out to support and vote for joe biden or no i i don't think so but i think you're dealing with i i think everybody knows what the stakes of the election are and they know it intellectually and they sort of know it emotionally but you have you know kind of a neo-fascist um administration with you know a lawless ag destroying the post i mean this is not this is like lawless criminality and these people will lie and do anything to stay in power so you know you don't just need to understand that emotionally you need to mobilize your base and give them something to vote for and it's you know how on on god's earth can you not say during a pandemic we are going to make sure you have health care you you get sick in a pandemic and you might get a 70 000 bill you have to bust up these trusts and these corporations and they have to start paying we cannot just go back to pre-trump you know landscape and think that's going to be enough there's been too much damage done so i just hope i believe that you know i do believe that bernie sanders has a relationship with biden i believe he believes that he's going to get a minimum wage hike he's going to get some debt relief they're going to expand obama's medicare program i do believe bernie believes that because i don't think bernie lies i think he tells you he tells the truth you know um but i i just hope that biden and the democrats tell the truth we can all watch the ken burns documentaries this wasn't this didn't happen in the 1500s this was like not that long ago you know we these course corrections and we have helped a lot of people we can do it again but corporations have to pay bernie's done a good job just for the part from the party same point of circling the wagons but he did come out a few days ago and say i think he said let's not forget about us yeah yeah um and i think um you know as always the the identity politics are great but they cannot be an end in themselves where we never address class because if you have if you have um billionaires making 40 40 50 billion dollars in the pandemic and yet we can't get food rent money places to live i mean just there's an enormous amount of suffering out there so um i mean i can remember very clearly um just when my father passed away and you know it was very hard obviously it's everybody goes through it and i was aware that um when the insurance company said we're not going to pay for it but i could pay for it because i was a successful actor right so i knew that that was the truth but i thought to myself i couldn't imagine what the families were going through when they were trying to get care for their loved one and you know they were getting the brutal cold shoulder from the insurance companies you're like saying i'm sorry if you're sick go see a doctor we just take your money and don't pay you know so uh and you know friends family so there's just you know there has to be a correction it has to be a new deal style correction and you know they can choose whatever language they want but you know let's just rewatch those middle of the road ken burns documentaries let's not pretend like we don't know what we need to do we've done it before we can do it again that's i just hope that they start communicating that to the american people um and you know believe it i think someone do but i i'm just not sure you know i don't think i don't i just don't know you know you got to make wall street mad at you yeah they're going to have to be upset they'll still be they'll still be really rich they're just going to have to pay some taxes right we'll see if biden can pull that off well if nothing else john you've inspired me to watch the fdr series then i'm going to go back to vietnam and basically that's a great one but you know the roosevelts on teddy and franklin are really as relevant for today as as anything you can watch since you're sitting in chicago i just want to ask you about um growing up in the family of actors working with joan what what was the first inspiration to be an actor as you were growing up um well i think in my family um my father um always uh he loved uh theater and art and um film and you know cinema and stuff and my mom was more in the social activist part so then that was sort of how we sort of grew up that was their interests i guess that they shared with us and um you know in the summer i'd always go to the old art house movies and watch the week full of you know curacao ones or the film noirs or truffauts all those things and you know you'd be playing baseball and then you go to the art house cinema and see all those old movies so i sort of fell in love with that and then when my sister and i were teenagers they started making some films in chicago about teenagers which weren't really a genre at the time um so she was in a film she got a part in a film called my bodyguard which was a tony bill produced or tony bill directed i believe who was the producer of the sting he made one in chicago and then the next year or so john hughes made one called 16 candles and so we both got small parts in that and that's how we kind of got into it is it a cool thing to work with your sister to be on a movie set and look at her and say wow that's the girl i grew up with in our house for making movies yeah with my sister ann and yeah woman yeah and some friends yeah it's always wonderful with her it's the best because um you know when i'm producing a movie i know i can get her cheap [Laughter] and so i want you to do it and she just pretends like she doesn't hear me i go take a script and i leave it by her door and i just go you just read that okay and you're gonna come come by and call me in this scene okay and she just pretends like she doesn't know what i'm talking about and that just comes on the set and you know like wiley coyote just like just runs you over and you're just like a flat pancake and then everyone's really happy it's usually the funniest scenes in the movie and then you know you can do it again so yeah it's always a delight to work with my sisters she is so good she's so good john thanks so much man i appreciate it congrats on the on the show too it's really good thank you good work go cubs all right man all right good to see you you
