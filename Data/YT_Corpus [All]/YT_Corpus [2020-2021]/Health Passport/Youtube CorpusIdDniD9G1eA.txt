Teresa Tim the deputy chief public health officer dr. Howard knew by video link the Minister for small business export promotion international trade marrying a Laplace a long to constitute I saw Jean Yves du Clos dr. Tam please hello everyone and bonjour to tattoos I'll start with the latest numbers on kovat 19 in Canada there are now 47,000 327 confirmed cases including 2006 in 17 deaths to date labs across Canada have tested over seven hundred and seventeen thousand people with about seven percent of these testing positive another week is upon us and I know that we're all weary and the longer days and warmer weather are making us or feeling increasingly antsy in fact these past weeks have made the words of millions of kids ring true as they shout from the backseat are we there yet I think I speak for all of us when I say we have never felt more like that kid though I'm sorry to saying they're not quite yet and though we are getting closer all the time we can't let go of the wheel yet my reflection this past weekend was very much on the bigger picture so when I think about where we are right now without brakes and vulnerable settings and under served populations driving the epidemiology of kovat 19 I am reminded of the critical importance of addressing in equities this pandemic has exposed the fragility of some of our populations especially those living in long-term care homes group housing those experiencing homelessness of vulnerable indigenous communities it has also highlighted the basic subsistence challenges of those working in our essential services who cannot self isolate such as our health care workers in those growing delivering and stocking our food medicines and other vital supplies the bad bugs are not going away so if we are to end the tragedy of increased disease and death rates in vulnerable populations we need to make things right right now this is not just someone else's problem or someone else's sorrow inequities touches all they affect the health and social well-being of all Canadians just as they diminish our humanity that means we need to look beyond the health system to the expanse of the public health social cultural and economic fabric of our society and this approach needs to be woven into both our cautious descent down the epidemic curve as well as going forward to living with code with 19 to put this virus in a corner where we manage it and not the other way around we need to adapt our daily lives to the need for hand-washing physical distancing and other control measures and at the same time we need to build protective supports into our social fabric to provide long-term protection against future waves of Kovan 19 and future pandemics of emerging disease last night Canadian luminaries from the worlds of music sport science advocacy television and cinema brought us together virtually through the stronger together special in addition to being extremely emotional and entertaining it raise much needed funds for food banks across Canada and allowed us to pay tribute to the heroic efforts of our frontline workers during this crisis stronger together is how we are going to get through this thank you thank you very much dr.

Tam you mentioned that over 700,000 Canadians have been tested with about a seven percent confirmed positive but there are concerns that the swab testing the rt-pcr testing has a high false negative rates because you know it can be tricky to get a decent sample i'm wondering what does your data show about the prevalence of false negatives so I think the PCR test in general actually have a good specificity and quite a high sensitivity in general but I think you've just mentioned that taking a swab is not a completely simple procedure you have to take it using the right technique at the right time etc to detect the virus and I know that also that sometimes people need to have more than one test taken if there's some degree of suspicion that someone actually has the virus but was tested negative the first time will then perhaps need a follow-up test as well so I think you know absolutely this is a potential issue we do know that of course we do not have a full accounting of all people infected in Canada and that is part of the work that we'll be doing as part of the immunity task force as well to actually ascertain what level of infection has actually occurred in Canada follow it and that was going to be yeah that was not going to be my follow up story that you know the NIH and CDC have started the serological testing to try to get some kind of handle on who's been exposed and what kind of immunity levels there might be I'm again I'm wondering what assumptions you're working with when thinking about what proportion of the population has already been expected you know is it ten times the number of confirmed cases 50 100 I'm wondering what assumptions your agency is working with I think that is the part of the work going forwards and to actually determine through different methodologies the different areas of Canada maybe the hot spots versus the ones that didn't have as much reported cases the age group structure or so all of that it will be part of the forward-looking design some jurisdictions are also already planning these studies to answer specific questions so exactly the type of question that you're asking as well we also are looking at a design that is more longitudinal because because of some of the serologic tests are not necessarily again half the high and their specificity or sensitivity and so by looking more longer to delay even if you didn't detect something in the first time maybe you would detect something as a later date as well so some of all of these questions are part of the this will go into part of the design of the studies for going forwards thank you dr. operator next question please thank you the next question I present is so it did not drip there are - Arjun Kapoor we don't you madam Freelander let's go on Electra snow palace in cement Quebec who people mm compression dosa concept unity collective loss my mother wanted a shoulder to cry I met Nicole Google murugu who that Solomon Power Company key content we seek the concept the integral activities they saw the so nativity of mama percocet in case yonder Seals Juve dimande a doctor noon dr.

Tam considering what the w-h-o said that you can get kovat nineteen you can recover from it and then it doesn't make you immune from getting it again were you surprised by that and how much of a setback is it actually I don't know that we know the full answer that question I think we know that people who the infected will cope with nineteen will develop some kind of antibody response and that will probably provide some level of protection we just don't know what level of protection how strong that protection is and how long it will last I think that's the sort of scientific discourse right now so that's why those studies need to be done and that we should be cautious about how we interpret the results for example of some of the serologic testing but i know that so many countries in the world and now including canada with immunity task force we're going to try and get to the bottom of those answers but right now we just don't have enough information okay I'll just make a little comment then I'll go to my second question so it doesn't sound like you agree with the whu-oh but now my second question and that would be for know you know wh oh hey what is that we don't know for sure what's happening and I think that's I think you can locally with including the debate show but you know all the scientists around the world you're just trying to gather this information we can base our knowledge about past knowledge of infections with certain respiratory viruses but that doesn't mean it's the same with Koba 19 so I think we're still trying to discover the answer to those questions I I do think we expect some level I mean this is just again how strong that is and how long it last is unknown and but we will get to some of these answers and if I can just add I think my interpretation of what the wh o is saying is that it to be careful those countries and jurisdictions that are thinking that you could issue an immunization or an immunological passport it was a written response I mean look at countries all around the world are trying to figure out a way out of this and rightly so and I think the warning from the w-h-o is exactly as dr. Tam has said it's far too early to be giving out any kind of certificate that says oh you've had kovat and therefore you are now immune because that is a dangerous line of thinking when we haven't the science yet caught up to what the evidence actually says and so it's very important I think to all citizens who've had Cova to know that there's a caution around assuming just because you've had it that in fact you are now protected and that is exactly why we have an immunity task force in Canada and many other countries are studying serological prevalence so that we can understand first of all what the extent of exposure is but also what the extent of immunity is both very important questions Julie follow-up thank you for being so fulsome and my first question the second question is about testing I'm not sure if it's for dr. Tam or for patty hi dude but we know that testing is very important in terms of reopening economies and we've had problems with testing in terms of lack of swabs recently in the past couple of weeks backlog of cases in Ontario and Quebec and other provinces I'm wondering if it's as if it's resolved to your satisfaction and considering that economies are starting to talk about reopening it was you know within the province is very soon I'll do a two-part answer again with an overview and then turn to dr. Tam about the conversations I think obviously Canada can do better and we've done a lot and we're very happy with the growth of testing that's happening and the capacity of provinces and territories to increase capacity of testing over the last several weeks part of that is domestic production of some of the equipment that you've mentioned including something called reagent which is essentially the chemical the fluid that is required to complete the testing and now we have a local manufacturing source for that reagent which is making it a lot easier for provinces and territories to get that component of the testing done but there is more to do and and of course I will also say that testing is one layer of a what I would call a health safety net that we will need to be putting into place so that provinces territories and communities can in fact get back to the new normal or arrive at the new normal if you will that testing strategy has been evolving and we're extremely encouraged by the work of the provinces and territories as they've looked for innovative ways to resolve many of the challenges some of those that you've identified and I'll turn to dr. Tam maybe you can speak a little bit about the special committees work on testing yes and it will keep on undergoing evolution as we move into a mixed reality if you like so right now I think many jurisdictions are still increasing the capacity and including Ontario and others have really ramped up the testing and broadening testing of course to focus on say long term care homes because systematically testing all of them and much more widely is very very important so you see some of the rise in numbers as a result of those systematic testing approaches and in terms of some of the going forwards is make sure we widen our testing criteria certainly to look at a broad broader array of symptoms even mild symptoms right now the very few people are showing up to be tested given that we are not getting the respiratory illnesses so I think looking at how we still broaden the net while people are actually not showing up with with with illnesses as well and really make sure that any outbreaks as I said as we descend down that epidemic curve is too busy rapidly identifying cases their contacts and any kind of outbreaks particularly in vulnerable settings where you have to actually cast the net wide in terms of testing some of the areas for sure as we as we go forwards but I think we are continuous evolve the strategy right now and it all involves actually increasing capacity and I think we're all looking to plan for all eventualities for example what might happen next winter so I think making sure we gear up and be prepared it is a very very dynamic situation and very complicated from every aspect of the sourcing of these different components a lot our testing but I think that we're pulling out all stops including domestic you know options so I think we're working or towards increasing lab capacity for sure thank you dr. Tunde make charles turn Esther thanks um dr. Tam on Friday you talked again about the need to be extremely cautious in the reopening xand one of the factors you talked about was your concerns around importation and I want to understand what you were talking about there and what now that you've seen that the US has nearly a third of global cases what is your concern there and how soon do you think that that border can be reopened so Tonya I'll start and then I'll turn to dr. Tam in terms of that you know everything that we do in the next phase will be done carefully and in terms of the relationship with the United States and partnership with the United States and I think the defeat of Prime Minister and many others for their hard work on making sure those relationships stay strong and that we can have those conversations that is part of the work that we're doing now as the government is to sort out how we do it better job when we begin to see an increase in travel whether it's Canadians going abroad and then coming back which they will always have the right to do and how we manage those reentry's carefully so that we can continue to prevent numbers of cases from arising from countries that perhaps don't have a very good handle on what's going on in their country from infectious perspective or that maybe have outbreaks that that will create a health and safety concern for Canada but I can maybe turn to dr. Tam about some of the conversations around borders that are happening at the committee well we will be extremely cautious about doing any changes to our international Public Health approach it is dependent on looking very carefully at the what's happening in other countries for sure but it our sort of approach though is to make sure we get what is inside Canada well managed well controlled and moving towards that new living with kovat 19 asked of primary step before we can consider what we need to adjust from an international perspective and I noticed today you haven't in at least a little while ago if the websites hadn't been updated with the new infections picture in Canada yesterday new cases seem to have picked up a bit and I am unclear on what the national picture is you say all the provinces manage their own data but in the federal government gets that data you are not releasing provincial data I'd like to understand a what the actually what is the national picture right now from your perspective have we successfully flattened the curve are where are we on the curve and have you asked the provinces to allow you to release their data or they tell you you not you're not allowed to release their data so we have been publishing than that national picture and updating it every day so in in in terms of our website what we do want is a sort of deeper dive into more details as it pertains to the different cases that have been reported so you will see the map of Canada you will see the numbers that are updated in real time as well as of course the tragic deaths that have been reported as well what we do want to get to and I think we are improving as we go along is the a deeper dive onto the actual knowledge of who is most severely impacted I mean we all know long-term care facilities and certain that risk populations are impacted but we do need more granular data on some of that for sure I think that interestingly from from my perspective it is I would say part of those stronger together theme actually what I was thinking about it is that F from a public health and cheaper course perspective partnership is strong but we have to invest in our public health capacities and infrastructure and how we do data collection and sharing in a way that is more efficient for the frontline who are busy trying to work on all sorts of things while still getting the national data that we need so I think there's a lot of room for moving forwards to really enhance that and I certainly hope that you know as we get through this pandemic together we don't forget Public Health and the need for Public Health and what that capacity requirement is to provide something else what people think is simple which is data data comes from many different sources from healthcare from labs from Public Health all these important they need to come together and we need to look at the most efficient way that we can do that and and it is an area that we need to address but you know we we do have to differ Rachele picture going on across the country with some provinces that do not have community transmission that has managed not to have it some that have had some community transmission and that are getting address but of course our four biggest provinces where most of the cases are coming from at a slightly different stage in the epidemiology and they've been reporting out on that as well so that does impact some of the details and the planning of that next phase and you will hear the sort of details from each of the individual provinces as well we at this special Advisory Committee level is looking at a broader set of criteria of how jurisdictions could go about moving into that next phase thank you dr. Mike Nick you would Buffalo has asked for military to exist assistant vacua shion's because of flooding and stuff will it be military be made available to help with this situation thanks for the question Mike and we are aware of the flooding in Fort McMurray and are looking right now very urgently at ways that we can help as we have known from the outset the fact that flooding season and in due course forest fire season is coinciding with coronavirus in Canada is posing some special challenges we have been gearing up for those from the outset and this is an issue that we are looking at urgently today okay could you help me understand what the Federals government's plan is to help in these secondary emergencies for municipalities and provinces and wherever they hit during this midday me you know every year in cabinet when spring comes for any Canadian Cabinet one sign of spring is that the Minister for Public Safety and emergencies briefs cabinet on plans for flooding and forest fires in that season this year has been no different with the exception of the reality that our government has appreciated from the outset that a response to flooding and in due course forest fires will be complicated by the reality that it overlaps with the response to coronavirus so we will respond as we always do we are very aware of this situation in Fort McMurray and are working on that right now Thank You Deputy Prime Minister we'll just take one question on the phone and one last question engine room operator thank you the next question no question disco admission in my club then I

Donna context of George Arthur they can only present Minister Mackenzie great from CDV doctor my first questions for you when Kovac started cruise ships were the big issue lots of Canadians were on cruise ships we had to get them off the ships put them into quarantine and cfb trenton and we determined that that was the best way to deal with people not spreading the disease and staying healthy why have we not applied similar logic to getting people out of situations where it was bad like it is in long-term care homes now and getting seniors out of long-term care homes and moving them into either hospitals or other quarantine sites to make sure that seniors in these long-term care homes who aren't infected don't get infected so yes the the cruise ship is a very high-risk situation was something that we had to deal with and even they the concepts of how we manage them might be changing as we speak as well I think again you know provinces and territories as well as the organizations that looking at actually responsible for long-term care homes are looking at all of those options it is actually quite difficult of course to move some of the patients out and looking at whether you move it's actually quite complicated in terms of the needs of these populations so you do have to have settings that are appropriate if you were going to move any one at all but I do know that some jurisdictions are actually already looking at some of those models and so but prevention still is absolutely key I think we're learning about how to you know test very widely when an outbreak occurs so that you can potentially cohort and know who to move where because you may not actually know unless the testing has been done as well so I think all of that is the sort of collective learning and that's going on kind of right now I think second question it's a two-parter I want to ask you about sports so there's lots of Canadians at home who would like to watch a hockey game or football doctor cam for you there's many leagues at the NHL right now as there's reports saying that they want to come back in July having four cities where teams would congregate there and they play without fans in those situations do you think this is a good idea and what medical steps do you think leagues need to put in place to make sure that safety of the players and the other administrators in there and for miss Hydra miss Freeland considering that there are so many other issues going on in society writ large right now do you think that it is appropriate for sporting leads to restart playing when things are going on maybe we'll reverse the order and I'll do the political overlay and then turn to dr. Tam I think the sporting sector is not unlike many other workplaces and I think the next step as we talk about how return to the new normal or approach the new normal is the deeper dive on workplace settings and how workplaces whether it's you're a member of a sporting facility or you're a team or whether you were working a meatpacking plant or whether you are working in retail and you have a very small shop all of those kinds of thoughts are going to have to happen rapidly certainly at health we're turning our mind to thinking about how we can support that deeper dive for all kinds of employers and sectors to look at how they change their practices and build in the safety that will be needed not just for the safety of their workers and themselves by the way but also for the business continuity because you could imagine if for example four teams decide to come together and have a regular series of games and one or two people have kovat and they're not very symptomatic how quickly it could take out all four teams those are the realities no matter what sector you're talking about and so I see professional sports much like the same as any other sector there will have to be considerations that were based on science that are worked out with the with the employer and with the employees in this case to make sure that the people in that sector are kept safe and that the people that are interacting with that sector are kept safe as well that's not easy and I think your question around sports is a particularly profound one because there is a high degree of contact and a high degree of exhalation and a high degree of sort of potential of of droplets if you will spit and all kinds of stuff you know entering each other's bodies and that makes that particular sector very challenging dr. Tim I don't know if Sports has come up for you but perhaps it has not just yet in that specificity I think some of our initial so the first cautious step is ensuring that people again can get outside and get the type of physical activity that they need while maintaining public health advice and so but I think in terms of different sectors we provide certain parameters we you can do a risk assessment of course of the different sectors as in the number of contacts intensity of context the ability for them to adapt but also I mean for from our perspective hit think wider than those teams they're connected to families and the families are connected to communities so you need to actually think of the risk assessment has been just not just beyond what is happening inside the game so I think that's really important and so I think our approach also is given certain public health requirements will they become of a plan that would meet them so I think the idea is to encourage people to think ahead submit their plans to public health and see you would actually meet public health requirements but I have to admit that we haven't actually specifically talked about that setting as yet okay just you my fellow corps feels depressed Oh Jorgie messy
