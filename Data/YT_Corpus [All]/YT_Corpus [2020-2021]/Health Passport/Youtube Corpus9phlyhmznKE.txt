 welcome to part 2 of our coronavirus Town Hall hosted by the Berkeley's of public health my name is Michael Liu I am the Dean of the school for one of this town hall it's about facts and fears giving you facts and addressing your fears we have a great turnout for the Town Hall 3000 in the live audience and more than 50,000 views we had lots of questions and got through about half of those so today we're going to pick up where we left off answer some of the questions that you still have but we named part to you of the Town Hall science and solutions because we want to start talking about solutions based on the best science and best evidence how are we going to solve this crisis and how do we get out of this mess that we're in right now so I'm pleased to be joined by an extraordinary panel of experts dr. Ramani Allen executive associate dean and professor at Berkeley School of Public Health dr. cocoa hours walk associate professor of public health at Berkeley and pediatrics at UCSF dr. Eva Harris professor of infectious disease and batten ology and director of our Center for global public health at Berkeley School of Public Health dr. nick jewel professor of statistics and public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and also at UC Berkeley dr. Maya Peterson chair applause statistics at Brinkley school public health doctor our triangle chair of Epidemiology at Berkeley School of Public Health dr. Leah Riley shared a big disease and vaccinology at Berkeley School of Public Health and dr. John Schwartzberg professor and former director of the UC Berkeley UCSF joined medical program now many of you submitted questions in advance so let's get started with them the first question goes to Nick Nick one are we going to peak in the Bay Area and in California thanks Michael it's a pleasure to be here today of course it depends very much or where you're talking about in terms of when the peak will occur we're certainly not yet at the peak in the United States as a country in California it's a different epidemic from from New York and other parts of the country and there does seem to be evidence now appearing that we may be at the peak if not slightly beyond the peak in terms of infections yesterday there was about 1100 new cases reported in California and a week ago it was about 2200 and it's oscillating up and down during that week but we're certainly showing evidence of a flattening the curve but even within California it's a very different epidemic in Northern California in Southern California even though we're growing at roughly the same rates in the north as they are in Los Angeles in Los Angeles they've had about 9,000 cases to date in San Francisco County about 900 and Alameda County about 900 so very different epidemics within California I would say in the bay area there is strong evidence that we are now at the peak or going down the other side of the peak expect Maya how much longer do we have to stay shelter in place and how will we know when it's going to be safe to go back to work yeah thanks for that great question so the short answer which I suppose won't come as a surprise is I can't give you an exact date right now what do we know I think what we know is we won't be able to go from shelter in place to nothing so obviously the transition is gonna have to be gradual we're gonna have to back out of shelter in place into a range of up with other public health interventions to help us keep this epidemic under control and so that's gonna include things like adequacy of access to testing contract tree saying surveillance etc the other thing we're really gonna need to know when it when it is safe to back at a shelter place is enough understanding of the current status of our local epidemics so in other words we're going to need enough data to know that shelter-in-place itself is working before we talk about easing back on a shelter-in-place and as Nick mentioned I think those data are are really coming together we're starting to see promising signs and so and those data continue to accrue in in Northern California in different parts of California is this something we're going to be able to follow closely what we do want to do is make sure we have a certain degree of wiggle room or room for error when we do back out of a place and so what we really saw at the beginning of the epidemic was the importance of taking early action in terms of our ability to control the epidemic and and Nick and his daughter Britta Jewish they were really nice piece about that from early on in the New York Times of the importance of acting earlier so we can kind of think about that same reasoning applied to when it's safe to back it out of shelter of your place you really want to make sure we're not backing out too early so that as we back out we're hoping that the interventions we replace shelter in place with are working to control transmission but in case they aren't we really want to leave ourselves some margin for error so that we can reinvent by interventions and not be in a position of you know acting early in a second wave to control the epidemic and I think then the final point is just to follow up on Nick's one which is like there's not going to be one-size-fits-all answer we've really seen this epidemic evolve differently in different parts of the United States and even different parts of California and I think as we think about what the right timing is for shelter in place and also how to make that decision safely there's really gonna be a real role for coordinated regional responses but also the use of regional and local data okay thanks so much Maya that's questions for arts the CDC is now recommending wearing face masks in public this cloth covering enough to protect myself in public or should I really worry and 95 so thanks for that great question and again I'm also happy to be with with you and with my distinguished faculty colleagues so I think the first point to make is that you're wearing a face mask in public to protect others not to protect yourself so we really hope that by wearing a mask in public reduce the chances that you transmit virus to others if you happen to be infected with the virus a symptomatically we would like to reduce the chance that you will infect someone else so that's the first point to make the second point to make is that if if by wearing a mask you stop doing all the other important things we want you to do particularly good hand hygiene you could end up in fact being worse off as a result of that so a mask is not a replacement for the things you can do to protect yourself which include good hand hygiene social distancing and things like that the third point I would make is we do not want you to go out and try and get an n95 mask if it will take them away from our frontline health care providers we seem as a rich country not to have enough and 95 masks for those credibly important health care providers so we don't want you trying to get an n95 because it will reduce the number that are available for doctors and nurses and other people working around sick patients so finally to answer your question what do we know about how well cloth masks work well the science so far is pretty limited there's some evidence that they reduce the large droplets that you might put out into the air and in fact other people with the evidence around much smaller particles what we call aerosols is frankly very very minimal and they may or may not protect fully against you putting out an aerosol great thanks are the next questions for Lee and you know we just heard art on said that we don't want you to go out and get a 95 mask but the question is if I have one and ninety-five mask already how long can I use it how can we sanitize a mask to reuse it and this way using the mask reduce its effectiveness okay so yeah thank you for the question I'm also very happy to be on this panel so CDC actually does have a guideline for the reuse of n95 masks specifically designed I think for healthcare workers so you can probably extrapolate from that for people who are not health healthcare workers so what they recommend is if there are no instructions instructions that come with a mask then if you're a healthcare worker working in a healthcare environment you can reuse a mask maybe up to five times so maybe you know non healthcare settings you can probably use it you know maybe even many more times but you know I can't really give you any numbers there's nothing out there and it no specific guidelines for non healthcare workers but the other important things to remember is make sure you wash your hands before you remove the mask and after you remove the mask and then when you're not using the mask keep the mask in some sort of breathable paper like a paper paper bag and then if the mass becomes damaged or becomes difficult to breathe through then then discard it for sure and then never never share the mask with anyone else thanks we got a follow-up question for you how can we better protect essential workers so for example if a janitor is being sent to clean an area where there was a confirmed case shouldn't they wait a few hours first ventilate the areas which is possible since I've heard that small droplets can remain airborne for a few hours so I guess that would depend on the type of room that the worker has to clean if it's a hospital room you know the the usually in the hospital's rooms have air recirculation and so you know I don't think you need to wait that long to go ahead of course you have to make sure you or with masks and gowns and gloves to go into the do the cleanup but if a you know hospital room intubation procedure was no or nebulizers we use them you might disseminate aerosols which will remain in air for a while if it's a droplet no the droplets don't really get remain suspended in the air for long now they were they were just fall and so now if you're cleaning some other types of rooms where there's no air circulation it's probably a good idea to wait you know I can't really say how long but again you know if you have to go in make sure you wear gloves and masks and just protect yourself and thankfully the next questions for John what can I do to boost my immune system to ward off the corona virus explain Cole eat a healthy diet don't use alcohol don't smoke get exercise try to deal with your stress we're all under stress right you know but try to deal with it as best you can that's the recipe there's no magic potion you can take it's going to boost your immune system save your money on on that and spend it on good healthy food if you can get it thanks John and and what's a typical timeline for a coven 19 John how long is the incubation period before you become symptomatic and how long does complete recovery take sure the the data is fairly clear on this now the incubation period ranges from two days to about 14 days that is from the period of the time you get infected to the period of time you get sick is in that range but the mean number is five point one days so for all intents and purposes you're going to see most people getting sick right around five days after they got infected after that the typical course for somebody if they develop symptoms at all because a lot of people we don't know how many don't develop symptoms but if they develop symptoms the typical course is going to be one to two weeks for the vast majority people after that a small much smaller percentage maybe about twenty at the most get sicker or they get sicker during that course of time typically the time between when you first get ill and you wind up being so sick that you need to go to the hospital is on average around seven maybe eight days sometimes earlier sometimes later but that's the period it seems to be where if you're going to really get sick that's where people tend to turn the corner and get a lot worse so that typically is the course if you are one of these people who gets quite a help you're in for typically a prolonged hospital stay could be as short as a few days but it could be as long as two weeks four weeks even longer sometimes and how about after you recover how long do you you lost they contagious after you after you recover well that's terribly important question for which we don't have a lot of good science at this point we know we can detect viral RNA the viruses RNA in for example the throat sore back the nose in people even a day sometimes even two days before they become ill and we also know that we can detect it after their well they can be completely well and sometimes a week longer we can still find the verse sometimes even weeks longer we can still find excuse me not the virus the RNA and that's an important distinction because we don't know if fighting the viruses RNA means that the virus is still there it may just be the remnants in terms of the RNA so this is a burning question from an infection control standpoint certainly from the standpoint of making plans for the public going back to work thanks Lee thanks John all right now speaking of people who are you know who had no symptoms even I heard you and your colleagues are launching a study looking at the prevalence of the infection among people who are asymptomatic can you tell us a little more about the study yes so we're very excited about this and it's a really about to launch very any day now what this is is an assessment the point Portland's meaning of people who are asymptomatic aliy infected at that moment meaning that they have RNA they have the virus in their saliva or oral swabs nasal swabs just of the nostrils and or they have been exposed and have been infected in the past and that you can measure by an antibody test meaning when you get infected with a virus your immune system will make antibodies and then after that you can then detect those antibodies so it's essentially like a fossil record an imprint of an infection in the past and we really have no idea of what that is in this population or really in any area in the eye states because we started testing so late so we didn't catch it early enough to know what the spread was at the moment and so what we need to do now is look backwards and that will give us a sense so what we're doing is a large study is going to be 5,000 people at five different time points so we're going to follow people over time and really importantly it's I'm going to name some words and then I'll go back and describe them it's representative it's randomized it's gonna be stratified and community based and what I mean by representative is that this is going to be a number of East Bay communities and it's going to be the type of demographic the age 18 to 60 the sex is so it's going to essentially be representative of the population as opposed to what we call a convenient sampling if you just like went to a parking lot in a store for instance so this we were going to have a really good sense of what the demographics of the population is and we're going to also stratified by zip code so we're going to make sure that we have a good geographic spread and then it's going to be this is going to be essentially you'll be mailing 300,000 flyers in English and Spanish to your doors and please if you're interested you just fill out and there's a secure website where there's just service that you're interested and then we're gonna make that that random stratified sample and then we'll contact you and at that point you get in your mail a little kit where you can take your own saliva and an oral swab and your nostril swab and then you take a little Lancet and a essentially a drop of blood and then use mail that back and we do this assay to see whether you have RNA from the virus that you're carrying at that moment or whether you you know whether you are essentially people in your neighborhood have had exposure and have antibodies and so that will give us exactly the information that Maya was saying which is not only what is the prevalence right now but also what as we lift those social mitigation strategies in a careful way since we'll be doing this every four to six weeks we'll be able to see what is the effect and and and in different areas where we're doing different types of strategies to back out of the shelter in place Thanks you know truly a very very important study the next question goes to Koko what do we know about Kovac 19 in children and teens thank you so much Michael I'm also thrilled to be here and hoping this webinar will help our community so fortunately as a parent and as a pediatrician I'm happy to say that the majority of kovat 19 infections in children and youth under 19 tend to be mild with very low chance of hospitalization or critical illness in fact there are so mild that most of them are undiagnosed so most young people who have kovat 19 never get the test and it will be unlikely that we'll have a good sense of how many and then really got infected it is important to note that some children are at higher risk chronically ill children especially those with cancer or autoimmune diseases or asthma may be at higher risk and we also from data and China are concerned about infants under 1 year of age being at higher risk there's no sign of vertical transmission for mothers who are infected to the fetus duh that's the medical information the biggest concern I have really is about the psychosocial well-being of children especially children who had the highest risk for negative outcomes I know are my epidemiology colleagues understand that shelter-in-place happens at a cost and those are particularly high for children who depend on adults who aren't in their family to keep an eye on them and protect them and so those shoulder and our higher risk for negative outcomes include children and households with fewer resources maybe families that were already struggling and are now newly unemployed because they've been struggling with mark you know multiple marginalized jobs parents who have insufficient support from other folks support folks with substance use foster children so I would say given that I'm hoping many people will see this webinar that I would encourage each and every one of you to reach out to a family with children this week and see what you can do to support them you can do it without seeing them face to face with phone support talking to parents who are stressed offering people resources food toys delivering food to their home delivering produce and there are good websites including the American Academy of Pediatrics has good websites and guiding parents on how to be able to work with children while they're trying to maybe work at home or how to go outside without being fearful and the Society for adolescent health and medicine also has good guidance a social distancing is probably haider harder on teenagers than anyone in the world and except maybe people experiencing homelessness but teenagers really have a hard time and so the website Adolescent Health org has great resources for families thank you for your question question for you after sheltering in place for a month can kids from two neighboring families have playdates as long as they are still avoiding outside exposures this is such a hard question the teenage version of that is my boyfriend and I have both been really good for the last four weeks and we promise we haven't seen anyone else can't we see each other and can't children have playdates unfortunately the answer is no the having playdates increase the risk for both families shelter-in-place means your may may not and be infected so far but there's nothing about shelter-in-place that means that you may not have a new infection including infections that are asymptomatic like I said already most children are not most but many children we don't know how many but a large percentage it appears have asymptomatic infections so that means children between two families could act as bridges of infection remember shelter-in-place doesn't mean we're living in a glass bubble we're all going out to get food we have interactions we touch surfaces out in the world and we may have family members at home who are vulnerable to increase risk so right now I think it's important to avail yourself of the resources you have through virtual playdates through the AAP web websites I shared an adolescent health or gather that could be fun that will alleviate your stress too because the best way to help yourself feel better will be to do things the best way to help your child feel better will be to do things that are fun for you as well Emami recent reports suggest that the pandemic seems to be hidden people color the hardest is that true and if so what why is that um thank you for that question Michael and like my other colleague said happy to be on this panel today well we know according to current data for the United States which of course we know is incomplete at the present moment that koban 19 is having a disproportionate impact on communities of color and so cos in low socio-economic communities and blacks in particular seemed to be most heavily impacted with some cities showing infection zatia and death rates that are two to three times higher than other groups so this is obviously a problem there are a number of reasons for that probably one of the primary reasons is pre-existing conditions which we know are much higher for blacks and they are among other groups and so you know blacks that test positive where where the group already has such a high prevalence of other pre-existing conditions are going to be more severely impacted especially when it comes to the severity of the illness and likelihood of death so I think that's one reason another reason is socioeconomic status which obviously impacts one's ability to effectively shelter in place or work from home which therefore increases the risk of exposure for these groups and in particularly in particularly blacks given that they comprise the majority of the essential workforce and then a third reason I would say is lack of adequate testing which we know is particularly problematic in communities of color which are the hardest-hit community so right now at least it does not look like resources are being distributed according to need and are not hitting the places that are being most severely impacted and so those are just three of probably many other reasons while we're seeing these disproportionate rates among communities of color but blacks in particular so moany what can we do to better protect communities of color well I think there are a number of things that we can do on first and foremost is collection of data by race I would also argue by income and occupation because those three things are not mutually exclusive they interact with one another and without complete data we don't have a complete picture of the groups that are being most impacted we know that some cities are seeing up to 64% of cases without any data on rate so it's hard to know what's happening in those areas and that's common across the United States and so first and foremost is the collection of data and some of these other factors second I would say is widespread testing we need to have an idea of who's positive regardless of whether they're showing symptoms or not I would say an infusion of essential healthcare services in areas that are being hardest hit and also the infusion of supports and areas support supplies in areas that are being the hardest hit so we gave orders for people to shelter in place without giving people the kind of supplies that they need to protect themselves and others while they shelter in place and this is key and although our data are incomplete we know enough right now to have an idea of where those hardest hit communities are and so from kind of a public health intervention perspective I'm definitely a staunch advocate for the distribution of resources according to need we know right now there are 330 million people in the United States with between 550 and 600 600 thousand known cases and we know that's probably an under report but from that perspective the the percent of the u.s. population that's currently infected is less than point 20 percent and so interventions that are interventions based on giving everyone the same thing really may not be the most efficient use of resources as opposed to really distributing resources again according to me and so that's a that's a strategy in public health that we have called proportionate universalism or that John Powell from our very own other and belonging Institute has called targeted universalism and it doesn't mean to take resources away from some groups but it does mean to target resources again according to me and that's more of an equity focused intervention approach as opposed to an equality focused intervention approach Thank You Omar coca what's going on with all the homeless people in the Bay Area during this pandemic where do they go during sheltering in place and are we doing enough to protect them well that's a question so appropriate to have after emani's excellent response so there are multiple intersectional factors that affect the health of people who are unsheltered that means that there is multiple ways in which unsheltered folks are have less access to resources including historical and structural racism so people experiencing homelessness are distortion especially people of color and particularly black they are also disproportionately older and disproportionately lack access to resources through their families to protect themselves during this time so unlike some of our young adult family members maybe who've retreated home to find a place to stay during that time they cannot protect themselves from infection and cannot protect themselves from contact with people who are infected through social distancing or transmission if they're exposed or and so they they are they are not only suffering from the baseline access of basic needs that they have but right now it's actually worse it appears from outreach workers that they're seeing actually more people who are homeless right now and more people who are needing shelter and that's really of concern to all of us because if we are going to properly shelter in place flatten the curve decrease access decrease the demand for services and protect our health care workers and lift shelter in place safely really everyone has got to be sheltered in place and and so right now tell me I'm sorry Michael give me to cut you off just so what's the bay area of communities I'll be doing yeah so absolutely so what we need to be doing right now and read my mind is that we need to get people out of forgets headings which we know aren't safe out of encampments and off the street and be who have them be moved to hotels where they can be protected from infection if they are not yet infected and for the majority of them now we think who are infected protect others from the infection that they have for the duration of shelter in place and probably thereafter given the predicted recurrences of infection and need for shelter in place so I think for individual citizens what you can do is encourage your local officials to do this and to do it rapidly and to also dinner donate generously to resources that are really struggling to care for people experiencing homelessness youth experiencing homelessness and families experiencing homelessness in your community and it's also if there are folks in your community who you know or you recognize who are experiencing homelessness it's totally fine in a really good time to perhaps share some food with them in a socially distant way I would not encourage people to go to encampments or do anything like that on your own but if you're passing by someone being kind and giving them some food in a way that protects them from infection possibly from you is totally appropriate we're gonna be sending out some guidelines from the School of Public Health we've already given guidelines to the board of supervisors in San Francisco will be sharing other guidelines and if you want to understand this from a global perspective I would really encourage you to read the lovely op-ed by Lee Riley and our mph grad Eva Raphael who wrote about the effect of kovat 19 in slums and really the encampments that folks live in here are our slums and which they pointed out and so I think this is really a global issue but one that we should be able to address as a wealthy nation thank you this next questions for Nick the University of Washington is to for Health metrics and evaluation projected last week that California will have one 783 virus deaths by the beginning of August Marvel open over 6,000 deaths predicted a week earlier do you agree with their productions well I and many of my colleagues have been very skeptical of many of the projections coming out from this model despite the fact that it's being widely quoted by the media and used my government officials as scientific evidence the California jump is just one the New York number of deaths that were projected cumulative number of deaths changed by over 60% within the first three days of the projections coming out and I'm peculiarly familiar with the situation in the United Kingdom where last week a week ago today I hme predicted 66 thousand plus deaths in the United Kingdom more that they were projecting in the entire United States within three days they half that number to about 37,000 deaths and three days later yesterday they were dropped it to 23,000 Plus deaths so I really questioned the value of predictions that are changing that much in a very short period of time I think in general the projections are qualitatively reasonable in terms of an order of magnitude maybe for a week or two out from the current day but they're very suspicious in several places beyond that so I would treat those projections with a very big grain of salt and this is a question for you and also for Maya do we have enough ICU beds and ventilators in the Bay Area you go first Nick well I think no I'm gonna let you go my I think you know about this much better than I do I would say we're not working with the entire Bay Area but in general right now we're doing fairly well and when we look at experiences in other parts of the United States such as New York and I think everyone's been following the Bay Area's story and things have evolved here quite differently I think what we do need to be careful of though is the false sense of assurance that because the epidemic is a volunteer differently so far that we're somehow qualitatively different and that we don't also run the risks of ever whelming our hospital resources if we act too early or without enough infrastructure in place and enough monitoring in place and enough of a rational data-driven decision system in place when we think about taking the next steps of gradually backing out of shelter in place I do you want to add something to them no I think I agree in general I have I know you have familiarity with San Francisco I have some familiarity with Kaiser Permanente I think Northern California in particular but also parts of Southern California took aggressive action relatively quickly compared to other parts of the country and this has led to exactly the goal of shelter-in-place which is to reduce infection spread and therefore reduce demand on the healthcare systems and the hospitals and healthcare workers and I think we're seeing evidence of that particularly in Northern California I think we're seeing the opportunity to then use the time that that has gained us to continue being on high alert continue preparations for any change infection rates adds as you point out as as people start to change behavior that we don't slip back into a an increase rate of infection so it's really quite positive news from the San Francisco Bay Area perspective despite the fact that of course we're still seeing some deaths and still quite a few infections day to day incident let's take some questions from our live audience pretty do you have any questions for you are you a mute hi sorry I'm unmuted now and we have many questions and here's one can anyone comment on the psychological toll that this pandemic will have on Californians I can speak to that I think that the psychological toll is significant and of course it varies it's the psychological toll is greater for folks who at greater risk including folks who have existing psychiatric illness who have had problems with depression or anxiety or dealing with that in their families this is going to add to that and make it harder for them to get the resources and support it will also have a greater toll on folks who have history of PTSD and trauma especially if it has a relationship to any kind of experience they're having right now and shelter in place it also does put people at more risk of psychological damage due to ongoing trauma at home either verbal physical or sexual abuse at home when people are sheltered with people who are actually a risk to their psychological or physical safety this is a huge issue and I was I heard last week that recently the national sexual abuse hotline for the first time got more calls for minors than it did from adults so we know that this is a very serious risk there's lots of things we can do however once again reaching out to folks that we know encouraging that resources go out to folks who at highest risk and taking care of ourselves by having a regular schedule by setting boundaries between our different activities if we're working at home and also caring for our family spending time outdoors safely being sure that we're sleeping and and also seeking spiritual sources of support either through our communities of faith or through meditation and of course exercise so all the tools that are available to us to decrease stress many of those are available to us and when we shelter in place sometimes we have to be a little creative or maybe take our yoga class online but those it's very important to do that and finally I think that it'd be good at some point for us to switch to saying physical distancing versus social distancing there's nothing about physically distancing that means that we shouldn't be talking to other and reaching out to others and I think many of us myself included are retreating socially to a degree that is not indicated there's nothing about talking on the phone or virtually that's going to increase your risk of infection in fact it's just the opposite so I would reach out to folks for support and also reach out to those you know who may need support there's so much to address in this question Michael but thank you for bringing it up Michael and Priya thanks so much Coco another question people I've heard that a tiger at the zoo got sick what do we know about human to animal transmission or vice versa what is that that tell us there was a tiger that Gus got sick we don't know if it got sick from from this virus but the virus was isolated from its nose and it smells there were actually other Tigers associated with that tiger that got sick as well there is no evidence that the other Tigers were infected with that virus so very well may have been another virus that was causing illness and we just happened to culture that virus in that particular Tiger that said it is very interesting that the virus is able to transmit from a human to the tiger and that would be the way it went we've seen that with two cats that's at least been written about in the literature and we've also seen it with dogs a couple of dogs all those situations have been from the owners heart did you want anything to add well I was just gonna say with other infectious diseases we know there's humid animal transmission certainly for tuberculosis there in outbreaks and zoo animals cause my transmission from a zookeeper so it's entirely plausible sure to a respiratory infection there's also some data that cats actually have ace 2 receptors for the virus and so civets also you know the original SARS also came from well people blew that may have come from civet exhibits are members of the cat family and so that is a potential biological you know link I think the important point for our listeners is that there's no evidence of animals that are infected infecting healers Michael shall we ask one more question hmm um what are the milestones we have to look forward to ensure citizens are safe to leave home and we've touched on some aspects of that that let me just add to that career that we certainly need to see the peak of infections turn so that we are seeing less infections and less deaths every day than the day before at least for some time and I would want to remind people that in some sense the length of time since the shelter in place EDX went into operation in California and across the country that's several weeks ago for us to even get close to the peak it's not unlikely that we'll have to wait that length of time after the peak to get back to where we were before and even in some particularly lower-income communities maybe even longer because there's evidence and in resource-constrained places that it takes longer to decline that it did to rise so we can't think of the peak as being the end of shelter place maybe at best it's halfway through and I would add to that Nick I don't know how you feel about this and certainly what we're seeing in California is different than what we're seeing nationally but when we look nationally again we have what 565 or so thousand cases with only about 60,000 people who have either recovered or died as a result of the virus so we have many more we're kind of still seeing cases the case number is much much higher than our recovery and death numbers and although the recovery the recovery growth rate is is greater than the case growth rate we still haven't seen kind of that flip flip flop yet that we might want to see to signal to us that it's kind of safe to go back to normal activity do you have any thoughts about that certainly not in the United States as a whole because there are staggered epidemics everywhere in the US and so that yes there's not evidence as a whole but as dr. Fauci said over the weekend returning to place and I think Maya mentioned this too this is not going to be a one-size-fit-all return to loosening shelter in place it's going to be staggered in different communities particularly when we know that we have the surveillance systems and the materials necessary to respond to any new infections that may reoccur after we loosen shelter in place and we're not there yet as a country and we're not going to be there for several more weeks and others on the panel can probably talk about the testing situation that we're not really ready even now to respond to resurgence of infections by using testing the way we should have been months ago the way other countries have been the United States has been woefully behind on its ability to respond to the testing demands and we're not there yet it's my understanding so just quickly elaborate on what Nick was saying I think the things we need are first of all states or local areas need to have a plan a thoughtful plan for what they're going to do secondly we absolutely need more testing preferably rapid point of care diagnostic tests where you can have a result in 15 minutes not three days and third we need to substantially beef up the public health infrastructure with the kind of personnel are going to be necessary to follow up on positive individuals and when appropriate isolate quarantine people and and we need to train those people and hire them and get them into position and just just so I strongly echo all of those points and I think I would just add to that or build out on one of those points which is we need sort of thoughtful data-driven regional at a minimum regional decision-making I think we were not going to have a one-size-fits-all approach because the epidemics developing so differently at the same time it shouldn't be an individual level approach where I'm watching the case numbers of the deaths and I think well you know what actually they've been going down for quite a while so I feel like I'm safe to go out and they may that may seem obvious but I think what we really will need is as part of our coordinated decision making some good analytic tools to make sure we're making the best sense out of the data we have available both the case counts the deaths and also hospitalizations and we've heard a lot about kind of the limitations of testing data to date but that does mean that it's hard to interpret changes in case counts it's hard to interpret them or compare them across different parts of the country it's hard to hear them across a given setting over time and so we're gonna see some improved ability to make sense I think of the testing data as testing comes online and crucially as population-based testing comes online I like the type and even described and you know there's additional initiatives starting up in San Francisco as well but we're also going to integrate careful as we take those data to look at them in ways that that quantifies how much uncertainty there is about really where we are in the epidemic I mean make sure that what looks like a flattening and a peak you know a flattening or a peak of the curve really is one with some degree of certainty and that we've really been sort of declining for long enough that it's safe to go forward and I think that's a place that mathematical modeling a data analytics is helping with and really can compete with yes we actually have a bunch of questions about testing and so just saw to help our audience better understand testing let me go leave first can you explain the difference between like serology testing and PCR testing sure before I answer that can I just follow up a little bit okay so you know as a nick mentioned you know the social distance orders went into effect maybe three four weeks ago and even longer here in the Bay Area and and so if we're seeing new cases right now that means the transmission for these cases occurred well after the incubation period okay so we really need to know who these people are we're still getting the disease you know are they happening in people who were not just who are not following the directives are they happening in first responders who have to deal with patients with COBIT you know who are these people I think we really need to get these data right now and then target that that population in the context of that population really understand why the transmission is still taking place the transmissions are actually happening after the these directives went into effect and so if you're going to do the testing now I can talk about testing you know I don't think Nick is right that we don't really we still don't have enough test kits available to to do what we need to do and so short of that we need to know we need to we need to at least have enough tests to test for these people who are coming down with a disease right now and then find context of those people and then isolate those people put them in quarantine so you have a more of a targeted testing approach as a monument you know it's not just targeting interventions but also targeting testing because we just don't have the type of testing capability that a lot of Asian countries have and then so in terms of serology and the PCR so you've actually discussed this quite well so the antibody test or serology test tells you when you were infected or are they so the past infection so it gives you a picture and a more sensitive picture what proportion of the population may have been infected with this virus whereas a PCR tells you whether you have the infection right now or not at the time either pre pre incubation period they are pre-symptomatic period or doing the symptomatic period and so these two tests give you a two different types of information both of which are quite useful and once we get the Anki body test down like eva is doing then we can go back and see how many of those people who who are antibody positive who are also tested with PCR where the PCR test was negative and that will tell you the sensitivity of the PCR test if many other people who are antibody posted or PCR negative that means of the test that they were using is not very good and so this is a very important data that the Eva it's been collecting well go ahead yeah I think we just saw answer the next question which is on top of a lot of people's mind is why can we just do serology tests on everyone and send those who's Phillip can antibodies against the virus back to work so and so ever yeah you are art John anyone who wants to answer that question which job is what we're hearing the law just just people for antibodies and send those were okay you move back to work let me let me start so right now we don't know enough about this virus to know where their immune response to this virus is indeed protected we don't have that kind of information now if you thought about use the data from what we now know about the original SARS virus it appears that people can mount antibody against restart the original clock size of ours but it takes about four four weeks for the the antibody level to peak and then it really doesn't stay that long maybe after about a year starts waning and this is also true with the common cold causing corona viruses very the the antibody may peak around two again to the to two to four weeks and then after about a year the antibody levels back down to the baseline level and so if that's true with this cold - no that's that's a little concerning maybe it will give you some level of protection for a period of time but maybe it may not be long lasting you know these are the studies with of course the SARS and worse we're done experimentally and you know we never had a chance to see if they're protective or not because ours completely disappear worse you may have information because you know it's still continuing to Middle East but I don't I don't know I don't have any data it also depends on what kind of antibodies and how much antibody you're making so for instance the antibodies that are directed to the receptor binding domain of the spike are very important because they can block the ability of the ANA by of the virus to interact with the receptor on the cell and so it'll block its ability to infect and but it's really important when we measure just in them by any advice that we associate that in other studies with the ability to neutralize infection and those are called neutralizing antibody titers and so what we can do is measure binding antibodies and then do a correlation with neutralizing analyse and then we'll know in one study will then be able to be applied to many many other studies we also need to then take those raising antibody titers and see whether they actually protect people that's what really matters so we need to essentially be able to do what's called it and see whether they're an immune correlate and those are ongoing studies because especially in healthcare worker populations where they're being constantly exposed so we can actually do in a much more rapid timeframe to understand whether the antibodies that we're interested are actually protecting people from infection Mico can I just add I'm putting myself in line as well and then we move on I just want to make a quick point that the serological tests that lee and eva be talking about are very important and very effective for estimating the prevalence of how many people have been infected in the population they're not very good at the moment in proving that you are immune because the tests aren't a hundred percent accurate and because the prevalence of the United States is still quite low meaning that only a small percentage of people have actually been affected to date if you come in and show a positive result on the serology tests there's certainly way more than a fifty percent chance that in fact you're not showing positive antibodies and are therefore not immune I could just as easily be infected if you go out to the workplace so this is not terribly useful where we stand now as a means of providing people with a passport back to work by having had one positive antibody test that shows that shows in principle that they were previously infected it's just the tests aren't that good for an at the individual level I wanted to get back to the important question that Lee brought up about who are these people who aren't sheltering in place I think that our school really understands the social determinants of health and that there are a lot of factors beyond people's individual decisions regarding whether folks can shelter in place Solis op-ed about folks in slums talks about this and we know that people in our own country live in similar conditions and in fact sheltering in place is a social determinants of health it's a privilege to be able to shelter in place I'm privileged to be here in my home and protected and know my family is protected and not to have to go out to make a living and provide for my family and so it's really important for us to understand that and know that because we have disparities and resources like Imani was talking about with disparities and the resources that families have in order to shelter in place that is going to affect the success of shelter-in-place overall and it also affects who not only who gets sick but who gets tested and there are many undetected tests undetected infections that haven't been tested right now it seems quite clear that well over 1/2 of folks in shelters in San Francisco are actually kovat 19 positive and so that would mean thousands of additional positive tests if they were actually being run and those folks aren't refusing to shelter in place they have no choice okay and Lima Geneva you mentioned look at the spike protein and we you mentioned the h2 receptors so Eva can you explain to us today what's the significance of the spike protein on the surface of the virus and whether its affinity for the h2 receptors have anything to do with why patients with diabetes and hypertension have greater susceptibility yeah absolutely so as I mentioned the virus has these spikes actually that's karana comes from the crown of spikes and that's what it looks like on the virus and so these Pikes are what interacts with a receptor to be able to get into a cell in the human body it's this sorry v2 has evolved you'd be able to interact with what's called the ace 2 receptor on airway epithelial cells in particular and and and other types of cells and and so that's very important for several reasons it explains in part some of the demographics or who's being infected because for instance elderly people have more h2 on the cells in their lower Airways so that's one reason where they're more susceptible and also there it also can be associated with diabetes and hypertension it's kind of a double-edged sword because when you have a lot of the ACE 2 then the despite the spike and then I'm virus can infect a cell when it does it brings that receptor inside the cell it turns out that the h2 is in balance with another receptor called ACE one or just ace and that's a very important balance for controlling the level of inflammation so when you go down with the h2 you end up with more and more angiotensin 2 and more inflammation and that can actually cause the disease pathology so that's these two points one is the namekian and the other is the pathology and inflammation that happens what's really important about diabetics and hypertension is that a lot of the medications that are taken for both diabetes and hypertension actually are ACE inhibitors and so they're gonna bring down the level of the ACE and they're gonna increase the level of h2 and that's going to then allow more viral infection into those cells and you might also heard that the core in the viruses they call SARS and MERS and now Koba 19 all came from bats so what's up with bats and why are they such good hosts or coronavirus it's really fascinating their host for many viruses and it has to do actually with their flight and they're nearly mammals that fly like and they have a very high metabolism and along with that they have very high levels of what's called innate immunity so interferons are high in bats and so when viruses infect bats they learn to live with these high levels of interferons and they adapt to that so interferons are traditionally what humans and many at cells use as a sense that our antiviral there are a defense and so when these really kind of super potent viruses then move into humans they actually are more resistant to the innate immune response in humans because we're essentially weaker than what they what they find in the bats and so in a way the bats are making these hyper potent viruses that can then just you know slam into the human populations and then I also heard that to spend a bit starting in the wet market in Wuhan so what is it about the conditions in these like wet live animal markets they increase the risk of an outbreak well the issue is that there are viruses in animals that we don't encounter in everyday life which are essentially game or wild animals which tend to caught and brought to wet markets and that are there in close proximity to humans otherwise wouldn't be exposed and as the viruses that are harbored in some of those wild animals can actually come from bats into these animals and then from there to humans it looks like an important element and the evolution of this article b21 is the ability to find the ace 2 receptor and that looks very similar to the region of the virus and pangolins which are a wild animal that are in some of these markets and so it could have been that essentially that that the virus picked up you know from the bat buyer has picked up a piece of genetic material from the wild animal the Pangolin or could be something else in intermediate and then that allowed it to then be able to infect humans because it was able to then and get into interact with the ace 2 receptor so that's what the what actually happens when we are in and that's why it's very important to be able to leave you know the animal habitats you know intact and and also regulate the amount of interaction with wild animals and humans Michael if I might add if you've ever been in a wet market you will know that enormous numbers of animals are closely packed together often sitting on top of a cages on top of other cages they share the respiratory secretions they share their feces so it's a perfect setup for animals to transmit viruses from one to the other and they're in very close proximity to the people who are selling them and the people who are buying them so ready transmission from the animals to people is very easy to envision or what's the latest on the reproduction number or the or not I guess that's the number of people who will catch the disease from one contagious person is that higher or lower than SARS or the flu well the nikkor Maya would be better people to answer this question but they are not is in most instances a theoretical estimate of how infectious an infectious agent is you know in a totally naive susceptible population on average how many people one infected person in fact prefer for this coronavirus it's not theoretical because 100% of the population is in fact starts out susceptible so for influenza viruses it tends to be in the range about one and a half 1.5 and 1.5 is plenty high enough to end up with a worldwide pandemic for this virus there are different estimates depending on which country and which time in the epidemic but the the most of the estimates are in a range of anywhere from from two and a half to five which means that this this virus is substantially more infectious than influenza Maya there's also this idea to call the re e or the effective reproduction number so what what's the significance of that and how is it different from they are not Maya yeah thanks so art said the are not really tells us something about the number of cases a primary case generates early in the epidemic in a fully susceptible population as we kind of move through the epidemic and also as we implement public health interventions we can move towards thinking about an effective reproductive number and really changes in this effective reproductive number over time so the effective reproduction number at a given time really tells us how many secondary cases on average is given a primary case at that time going to result in and that's an important concept because we can think about changing this over time by doing the sort of range of public health interventions that we've been discussing today from really decreasing the number of contacts through things like shelter-in-place decreasing how likely it is a given contact is going to result in transmission through things like masks we can talk about reduce things or the duration of infectiousness by identifying new cases early and isolating them preventing them from affecting other people and then you know as we think forward towards having a vaccine hopefully you know in in the coming months we can think about as well using that to reduce the sort of susceptibility of the population I mean so it really isn't a move forward this is we want to think about this as a as a dynamic quantity that we're actually able to take proactive measures to bring down and that's really one thing but our public health interventions are aiming to do thank you my and I guess back to you art what is the latest on locality and how does it compare with the flu swine flu SARS bird flu and Ebola so I think you were probably referring to the case fatality proportion and that's the percentage of people who get sick who die and so for people probably know that that really depends on several factors first of all how old you are second of all how sick you are in the first place with these various underlying health conditions third how good is the medical care you've yet but but leaving all of those fine points aside for something like Ebola certainly in the early outbreaks it was anywhere from seventy to ninety percent of people got Ebola dying so an incredibly lethal virus if you will the MERS also has a pretty substantial mortality of around thirty to forty percent of people who get it will die avian influenza it's also around 50 percent of people who get avian influenza typically straight from a bird will die so for for this particular virus there are there some disagreement but it's it's certainly well it's generally thought to be somewhere in the range of perhaps half a percent up to a percent of people who get sick with the virus will but will die let's take some more questions from our live audience period other questions you're muted for you hi can you hear me direct unmute so sorry okay so here are a few questions from our live audience what are why are there conflicting reports about code 19 symptoms I've heard pulmonary pneumonia - altitude sickness - no sickness at all John that's a perfect one for you thank you [Music] [Laughter] this is primarily although not exclusively a respiratory disease it's really interesting is that even others we're talking about in terms of the h2 receptors that clearly the virus it uses those to get inside of ourselves and that's where we see the print a predominant disease and that is lower respiratory disease shortness of breath coughing typically a dry cough is supposed to be usually very productive cough fever severe body aches looks like influenza to a large degree interestingly though a lot of people don't get that they get they may start with upper respiratory symptoms a runny nose sore throat and fever and then it may progress down into the Lord Airways or it may never get down there and then what's really curious is that people present in very different ways there are h2 receptors in the gastrointestinal tract it's hard to know what the significance of that is but some people present with abdominal discomfort bloating and diarrhea even sometimes vomiting with this so there are myriad symptoms that people can present with but the predominant ones are respiratory and of those it's predominantly lower respiratory disease it's really interesting with MERS that people have been talking about there are more receptors for MERS in the kidneys and the gastrointestinal tract and that's probably why we see more GI and intestinal and kidney disease in those patients than in this particular coronavirus okay two questions about how Kovac 19 survives what high temperatures killed the kovat 19 virus and how long can the corona virus survive in water and our water supply get contaminated so they tested that depends on the type of water if it's drinking water that's chlorinated the virus probably would not survive very long but if it's um chlorinated water probably survive very long by I'm saying within a matter of I would say hours temperature Oh temperature yes temperature will kill but of course it depends on how high but yeah that's usually probably the best way to inactivate the virus so you may have something well I mean the heat inactivation like in the laboratory at 70 degrees centigrade for 30 minutes for instance or even 15 minutes I think we don't really understand the relation with seasonality yet for this virus because it hasn't gone through enough seasons but you know there there are places you know south of the Equator which are very hot and we're not seeing as much transmission as we expected but we don't know really what's going on here yet with that so I think the jury's out I mean experimentally for sure you can kill the virus with heat the question is and and and that would be the same if you have very high temperatures so we're still really trying to figure out what relation with weather and humidity and seasons are with this guy you we had a few questions about this last time and few more today can the virus be sexually transmitted and if I'm a person with only one partner should I be abstaining from sex so you know I think first of all the answer is when people have sex they often exchange oral secretions so in that in that sense if you're kissing we're having mouth contact then close contact there could be transmission but if you mean is there transmission via sexual fluids I think we don't really have any data about the presence of the virus and sexual fluids I don't know of any case reports of sexual transmission may be either lead or jaundice I guess sex without getting very close to a person is an advice about abstention well the CDC says that you're safe a sexual partner is yourself I mean the bodily fluids that have a lot of virus my understanding are our blood and secretions and that in urine and [Music] sorry urine and some other fluids urine excuse me there is a lot in respiratory secretions and there's very little from blood and blood and urine there's more in feces so so you know given that feces are in nether regions that could affect things but it does seem that semen or vaginal secretions which most likely come from transmission through mucous membranes of plasma and blood it seems unlikely that those would have corona virus I didn't see data about those either but I would I would not counsel patients to be concerned about that we got a bunch of questions about prevent treatment and prevention and we got about 15 minutes left so let's do okay wrap it round the questions we'll start with you me can we use antibodies from the class we cover patients Cobin 19 well theoretically yes again you know as we talked about earlier if the antibody response is indeed protective that approach may work but this is a the issue of practicality you know how are you gonna do this for hundreds of thousands of people yes you might be able to do it and some people who may be able to afford to do this kind of thing but to make it into a a real therapy I think there's just no no no way and John the president has been talking a lot about hydroxychloroquine what's the evidence of effectiveness for hydroxychloroquine in a treatment of COBIT 19 but there's there are no control trials there's no good science to support it besides the in vitro data that suggested some activity the fact that it was promoted by the president should carry no consideration if you're thinking about taking you and I'm making a quick comment yep one randomized trial will stop today in Brazil because large numbers of patients getting high-dose Clark when we're having cardiac arrhythmias and this drug is not a perfectly safe drug at high dose there are negative effects of taking high dose Coralie Thanks how about ivermectin interesting it has if the drug that's used primarily for worm infections but it has activity against other organisms besides worms and in vitro that is in the test tube you can it shows activity against coronaviruses in general and there was one paper that suggested you had activity in the testing against Tsarskoe v to the current cause of our pandemic there is no human data and I would we have we would have to study it to see if it was effective or not so no human data to guide us at this point and our that there have been couple to recent reports that countries with universal policy for BCG vaccination which is a vaccine against TB have lower mortality rates from Coburn I team can BCG beat the ploy to fight against Koba 19 well they're actually a couple of trials that are started to look at that and so while I'm probably one of the world's most enthusiastic people about vaccination of children I would and BCG is a very potent nonspecific stimulator of the immune system I personally would rather have a vaccine against corona virus then try and use BCG to protect against corona virus but I suppose these clinical trials may or may not answer the question yeah I you know if you look at the data from different countries that use and don't use BCG there's really no correlation with the protection against current virus for instance you know a lot of the Western European countries stop using BCG in the mid-2000s so it hasn't been that long since there are those countries stopped using so why are we seeing so many corona virus you know deaths and secure diseases in Europe you know then you also expect that in Europe you will be the small kids who will be developing the severe disease because you know it's been about 15 years since the BCG had been was stopped as a part of the universal vaccination program Europe and so and that's not what we see if you look at Brazil now Brazil still uses BCG and we're seeing a huge increase in cases there in depth Portugal is the only Western European countries that still use use uses a BCG and we're seeing a large number of cases so there's absolutely no correlation that I can see the countries that use BCG if I might point out BCG is a live vaccine which shouldn't be given to immuno compromised people because it can actually be quite harmful and that's thank you I even what other novel therapeutics or researchers at Berkeley working on well there's a big effort right now we've just gotten our bio cepting level for me on our floor actually working with bornavirus too so there's now I think this week Sarah Stanley and others are launching a essentially screening 6,000 fda-approved drugs or the like so just to see whether they have activity at just infecting cells we have now susceptible cells and good file stocks that my lab and on there's you know but together are all producing and so there's a huge work community of scientists at UC Berkeley who have repurposed their their direction towards coronavirus SARS virus to and so one is looking at fda-approved drugs we have some that might have a potential that we're also testing there's a group also that's looking for small molecules that can inhibit one of the enzymes a cysteine protease it's called but one of the critical enzymes of the virus and then there's a number of other targeted approaches as well to stopping the translation of the rnh of protein and so like every group that ori works on this in another area is actually just shifting it and so there's screening going on in labs and the best candidates are moving up to the the biosafety level 3 capacity against the virus itself thanks about it and just saw tip 2 on to mention Sarah Stanley is on our Faculty of the School of Public Health and I'm just so proud to be at a school where so many faculty are stepping up to you are finding game-changing solutions to you October 19 now leave I've heard people's being working on something called the universal flu vaccine so what's the prospect of developing the universal corona corona virus vaccine to fight against all future pandemics caused by a corona viruses so my feeling on that is I think it's gonna be very challenging you know for decades you know many groups have attempted to develop the universal vaccine against the common cold caused by you know the common cold causing coronaviruses and they have really not succeeded I think it's gonna be very challenging you know there as you know we pointed out earlier there are many types of crown Avars that are found in bats and i and other animals the human the human common cold corona virus is bleed originated in bats and then he went through Cal and then enter the human population about two hundred years ago so so you know you know what to have a universal vaccine against coronavirus or future crown bears you really need to know what's out there in the zoonotic environment first and then we also need to understand you know what is it about these different strains of the currents that causes these different types of severe disease manifestations we don't really have good good information why this COBE to is so good on a although have to qualify that as art pointed out is virulent in people with underlying medical conditions and elderly people and so you know we just need to know a lot more about the biology of the virus to they be able to come up with a universal vaccine but i think it will be many many years before we will have something like that are you still optimistic that we will be able to have a vaccine against Kobe to available in 12 to 18 months I think we'll have a vaccine whether it's going to be effective highly effective or not I don't know so what Eva mentioned the this receptor binding domain that the virus uses to find today's ace 2 receptor one of the problems with this protein is it's a glycosylated meaning that this is sure molecule on it but when you have a sugar molecule on a protein it's very difficult for the human antibody to recognize those proteins so it's going to be challenging you know let's let's go from up response to prevention since pandemics usually begin when the buyers jump from animal to human in what's called zoonotic spell over how do we prevent such spillover in the future well I think that I mean there's certain points that were made about wet markets and you know more regulations at that point but very much an issue about just human encroachment into the virgin forests etcetera I mean and it's like a you know development brings humans into areas and takes away habitats where where animals live that and that's where you get this this crossover I think one of the really really important Jesus is the surveillance I mean I think it'll be difficult to know when where do every single virus may or may not jump but when as soon as there's a recognition of anything unusual I mean this for instance you know in China was there was there were cases what you know a month or so at least before the alarm was sounded and here also you know there wasn't testing I mean we knew there was circulation and people weren't testing for even when we knew what to be testing for so it's really really important we have the surveillance and in place and to be to sound the alarm early and also as soon as one knows it to really have that testing which was available implemented and widely disseminated and that's the only way they will be able to be to prevent because when there's just a few cases and you can do isolation and trace the contacts then you can really prevent this and in fact that's what happened also with the original SARS but that you know because this was more transmissible and the alarm was sounded too late it's the way it got out of hand so Michael could I make it's one other quick point so the wet markets are certainly a major issue in Asia in Africa The Situation's a little bit different many of the exposures throughout animals are people hunting for protein and if you're going to tell them not to do that you better have a way to replace that source of scarce protein for them because otherwise a day and their children will malnourished and I thank you Nick and Maya what could the US have done differently what lessons have we learned globally well let me start and then no and let my get the last word I I definitely I think the biggest lesson is we moved far too slowly we didn't pay attention when I say that there were a few people certainly sounding alarms in late December and early January but there was a general kind of attitude in the West in the developed countries that it was this was something that might impact China but it wouldn't really come here despite all evidence to the contrary that it was likely to come and so we didn't take advantage of the warning time we had to better prepare and once it did move into the United States we were still a very flat-footed about mounting public health response and that has caused a significant amount of additional burden or human loss and illness and death that we could have avoided and rather than looking back and trying to cast blame about that I would just urge that we look forward to protecting the population against any resurgence of the epidemic one side we get our arms around this this wave and that we learn from these lessons and that we invest in the public health infrastructure that art has talked about to provide the resources to fight off infections of this virus and other viruses in the future wait a second all those points strongly and I think we've been faced with a really fractured public health infrastructure in many places underfunded and understaffed and part of that as well is a lack of an adequate data sure Tibbals catch things early and guide the response and so I think and echoing Nick instead of looking backwards I think looking forward build a rebuilding our public health infrastructure ensuring we also build trust in trusting governments and Trust in communications around public health as well will be a key part of the message and I think that's another less that we can take globally from places that have been successful and so I think that's another key piece of the puzzle moving forward amalia as current as coronavirus spreads across the u.s. so has xenophobia and anti Asian racism what is that and what can we do about it so I'm looking at the clock right now it's six o'clock and I honestly don't think that the time left will allow me to justices question at all or many of the other things we could be talking about related to social determinants of health so I'll suggest that perhaps we consider that for a follow-up webinar yeah I'm getting a bunch of text from Korea right now that there's a follow up also we'll certainly do that Coco I'm gonna give you the last word and you've been co-lead in the effort to mobilize our faculty our students our staff to help out the bay area communities in this time of great public health crisis can you talk about what we're doing and how people can help we've had a fantastic response in the School of Public Health to mobilize together to provide support to our community we've done that in a number of different ways one has been just direct community support and having volunteers from our community who can safely do so working with folks to help get basic needs to them so for instance working with the basic needs center to get volunteer food delivery to unstable house or quarantine students who would not get fed otherwise we're also leveraging our skills in Public Health to support local communities and certainly other faculty members on this call are also doing that so offering our service to the agencies that are dealing and working with on vulnerable populations to try to shore them up we like I said are gonna turn in this policy analysis regarding housing and people experiencing homelessness and we're helping to link students to opportunities to in turn to support those agencies we are also providing a support to the needs related to clinical care so we've done work collaborating with researchers to address the need to be creative around PPEs and how to repurpose
