 Hi, my name is Jenn Gale and I am the Interim Administrator and Director of Nursing at River Valley surgery center in Norwich, Connecticut. We are a multi-specialty Surgery Center.  We see about 250 to 275 patients a month. Our main challenges with our  previous pre-admission process included the time that it took our nurses to collect  the information from our patients, the compliance from the patients, and also the inconsistency - or maybe incomplete - patient information. Our nurses were having to call up to  about 60% of our patients to complete that pre-op questionnaire. Some of the information was not accurate based on the types of questions that were being asked in the previous pre-op questionnaire and the patients were spending a lot of time on the computer as well as the nursing staff. Since using One Medical Passport, our providers are giving the patient the information and the website that they need to access to complete their history online before they come to us. Then, our nurses are reviewing that information and calling the patients on an as-needed basis to fill in any gaps or answer any other clarifying questions. The amount of time that it's saving is incredible. The nurses are not calling every patient to remind them. They're not spending the time tracking down things that maybe were not asked in our previous system. So, to another facility that's  considering using One Medical Passport, I have and will continue to tell them, "Go for it!" This is something that I would do over and over again without hesitation.
