 six people have been charged in an elaborate birth tourism scheme it's aimed at helping turkish women secure u.s citizenship for their babies and according to federal prosecutors it's costing american taxpayers more than two million dollars nbc news senior investigative producer anna schechter joins us now anna good to see you so first of all tell us more about this alleged scheme and how prosecutors say they pulled it off well this has been going on for about three years there was a ring of six people involved you had somebody in turkey helping with marketing to turkish women and their families they were running facebook pages websites with your baby should be born in america and this isn't anything new i've been tracking this for about 15 years actually and we've known about birth tourism as sort of an industry for about 20 years and turkish women have been coming but why this is so interesting is they were actually building medicaid so they had a couple people in the ring who were trained to help people sign up for medicaid and they were lying on those applications saying that these women actually were new york residents who were destitute but no money and so that would pave the way for all their health care being covered and the amount is staggering 2.1 million dollars at least that prosecutors could track so that's what's really interesting about this case i've never seen that before in all the years that i've been covering this where uh taxpayer dollars are coming into this usually it's wealthy women who are shelling out up to fifty thousand or a hundred thousand dollars u.s dollars um to come here give birth and they get that american passport which is worth one it's a status symbol two they the children when they're older can more easily attend university here and when they're 21 they can actually start the process to legally bring the rest of the family over to the united states now anna these are known as quote birth houses what more can you tell us about how the ring leaders allegedly set them up well they rented about six houses all over long island so the outskirts of new york city and they were operating so brazenly it's incredible they were actually signing up um 119 women at least using the same address so you see photos there up on the screen that's one of the houses where they actually obtained wiretaps and then were able to surveil and they would see pregnant women coming and going and you see the three three of the the sort of inner circle of the people who were operating um this team and they made tons of money because not only were they getting the medicaid money but the turkish women were also spending about 7 500 for this whole package which is actually and believe it it's a lot cheaper than a lot of the other other women who have come to do this like from china you see extremely wealthy people who just pay all in cash and they spend a few months and they get an american baby and it's really unique to the united states because of our 14th amendment if you're born on u.s soil you have access to get that u.s citizenship and other western countries like australia the uk they've actually failed back and changed their laws so that you can't do this but we have not interestingly president trump during his campaign in 2015 and uh he was calling to sort of shut this down it's a really tricky issue because the amount of babies that do get born and for this purpose is bird tourism is probably not that huge um but trump's inner circle like the stephen millers of the world they sort of waved this flag of birth tourism as being a huge problem but this is actually an extremely interesting case it's hard to find them and prosecute them and these prosecutors did a great job and laid out a very very strong case yesterday so anna now that we do have charges in this case what happens to these children and their mothers or their families the great question so the mothers and their families are treated as material witnesses so they are not facing charges they are jane doe one two three and so on you know going up into the hundreds actually um so this is traditionally how the feds have handled it we actually were at an fbi bus in la about five years ago for the first ever raid of one of these operations it was run by a group of chinese americans out in southern california um so it's actually rare to bring these charges uh so this is kind of a big deal and i think that you know the women are seen as they were sort of lord here they're marketed to you know you see the marketing there you see these pictures of babies with a us passport an american flag next to a turkish flag um they are not seen as the perpetrators of this which having met a lot of these women i think that's the right course of action to take you know this is big business this is a lot of money the people profiting off of this that prosecutors are going after anna schechter i know you've been
