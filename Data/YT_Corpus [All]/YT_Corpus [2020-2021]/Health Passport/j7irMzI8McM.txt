 I'm sorry about this. I was brimming with hope when I arrived in San Francisco, California. I stayed in the house of Angela's sister, Emily. Ma'am Emily treated me very well, as well as her mother, Ma'am Gloria, as her travel companion and caretaker. Excuse me. At that moment, I thought our luck has finally changed. Nena, there's something you need to know. The truth is.. my sister used our mother to bring you to America. You won't be working as Mama's travel companion. What? You're here to work as Angela's maid in LA. But, Ma'am-- Can't I stay here? I'll just look for a different job. I'm sorry, Nena. You need to go to my sister. We'll take you to the airport tomorrow. I'm really sorry. This is the master bedroom. And these three rooms are the guest bedrooms. I want the rooms to be cleaned every day. in case my grandchildren come over to visit. Come. I'll show you the kitchen. So, this is our kitchen. This was supposed to be the maid's room, but we converted it into a storage room. These are my dogs. This is where they sleep. You can sleep beside them. This is their bathroom. You'll give them a bath there. This is the one you'll use too. - Any questions? - No. Oh, before I forget. Where's your passport? Can I see it? So your visa will expire in three months. But don't worry. We will extend your visa. Okay? Ma'am-- I'm in a far away place. I don't know anyone. I don't have anyone to turn to. Although that wasn't the job I was expecting, I just thought that I won't lose anything if I do what my boss says. Kira, come here. These are the things you need to do. Okay. I'll be back at around lunch time. I expect the food to be ready by then. Ma'am, where are the spices here? Nena, you have eyes right? Then use them! Don't bother me with such stupid questions! If you have any questions, ask the dogs! Okay, Ma'am. Angela, let's go. Okay, baby. You be good, alright? I'll see you later, my love. Where's Maggie? Where's Maggie? Who's a good girl? - Angela! Let's go! - Yes, I'm coming! I'll book her for our next spa party! Alright? I'll see you soon! Bye! Ma'am.. I just wanted to ask if I can call my family. I promised them I'd call when I get here. Maggie! Kira! How are you, my babies? Come here, baby! Hi, babies! How are you, my loves? Did you miss mommy? Hello! Mommy will give you treats. Come on. Come on. Let's give you treats! Come on, Kira, Maggie! Oh, little ones! Look at you! You still don't have my money?! Do you know how far I have to travel just to go here?! You're teachers, right?! You should know how to pay your debts! We're really sorry. We really don't have anything. Please give us until the end of the month. - This again?! What's new?! - Tay. Bless you. - We can't always do this! - What's going on? Your father's asking for another extension! As always! We're really sorry. I'll pay the rest when I get my salary. Make sure of that! Tay, have you heard anything from Nanay? Not yet. Dear God.. Dear God.. What has happened to my daughter? I hope she is safe. Maybe she's busy there. She'll call eventually. - Stop worrying about her. - My poor daughter. We need to watch your blood pressure. Ma'am... What? I just want to ask about my salary. Oh. That. It cost us a lot to take you here. Plane tickets, visa. You won't be earning anything soon. We'll deduct those from your monthly salary. I'm shouldering Ma'am Gloria's plane ticket too? Of course. You wouldn't have gotten here if you weren't with her. But you never told me it would be like this. Because you never asked. You know, Nena, very few people can work in America. Other people have to pay huge amounts for their placement fee just to work here. We're only asking this much from you. You're lucky you're working for us, Nena.
