 introduction to mitigation mobility and epidemiology graphs kovat 19 mitigation refers to slowing the pandemic as much as possible in the absence of a vaccine or cure one way to understand how well mitigation measures are working in your country is by plotting a mitigation mobility and epidemiology or mmm a graph mme graphs tracks seven mitigation measures travel restrictions entry screening traveler quarantine mass gathering restrictions school closures business closures and movement restrictions data for mme graphs come from media reports u.s. embassy websites Google community mobility website World Health Organization and Johns Hopkins University the Mme graph shown here includes daily kovat 19 case counts for a country plotted on the Left vertical axis as gray bars and the three day moving average of new cases shown by a dotted black line across the bars the right vertical axis shows percentage change in mobility or movement compared to the preak ovid 19 baseline using the google mobility data changes in mobility are shown as a yellow line for workplace red line for retail and recreation and blue line for transit locations colored lines below zero indicate a decrease in mobility and those above zero show an increase compared to the baseline shifts in mobility may be seen around national holidays noted by a green star the vertical lines indicate when mitigation measures were implemented or lifted blackfur implemented green for lifted while shifts and mobility may immediately follow implementation or lifting of mitigation measures one would expect about a two-week delay before it would affect case counts due to the incubation period of kovat xix though Mme graphs do not show causality they can give a sense of how mitigation measures are affecting the kovat 19 pandemic for example if government restrictions lead to a decrease in mobility and two weeks later case counts also decline it is plausible that the restrictions contributed to a decrease in disease transmission rising case counts despite mobility decreases should be further explored and may be a sign of increased testing or outbreaks in subpopulations a few things to remember when looking at your data the number of cases on a given day may reflect new testing guidelines changes in testing capacity or reporting delays Google mobility data are collected from smartphones so may not include data for people in rural areas or those of lower socioeconomic status and just because a measure was implemented doesn't mean it was enforced mme graphs can guide understanding of how well mitigation efforts are working in your country and when they may need to be applied or when they can be lifted [Music]
