 (upbeat music) - Yeah, this health identification cards, Hi+card, it's an application where you can upload your medical records so you can use it whenever you want and in any language so it's quite safe. I used to travel with my mother. She has a diabetic, she has a (foreign language) so doctors need to know what she has in case of emergency. So I wanted to do that and now technology, blockchain and encryption codes, and the double authorization allow us to make a very secure way to store the very delicate data the medical records are. And then now with Covid we are doing more. Trying to help people to travel safely. We presented the app at the beginning of March to the secretary general of the United Nations world tourist organization just to try to tell him that we can use this application for the recovery of the tourism worldwide. And we can create a kind of link between the health sector to the tourism sector. So we can upload the certifications of vaccinations or immunity in case they are sometimes or the results of the P-C-Rs. So when the country ask tourists to have these kind of tests before traveling to the country they can upload this information and keep it very safely in the blockchain technology. So no manipulations allowed so it's the most safe technology that we can count now to keep these kinds of information. This is just the first step. In fact we are doing a kind of a test with the application. This is the better test of the application. At the end of this month we are working also with (foreign language). We are also organizing this kind of trip. And at the end of the summer we will have the proper application already launched. Oh the application is Hi+Card. It's health identification card and you can find it in the app stores in Android and iOS. (upbeat music)
