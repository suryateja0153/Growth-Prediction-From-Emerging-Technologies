 the coronavirus pandemic has been devastating for a number of industries the sports industry the restaurant industry and not to mention stouffer's line of frozen bat dinners and corona has been especially bad for travel i mean at the beginning of the outbreak the biggest trip most of us could take was from our bed to the toilets but gradually people have started to realize that they can still go on trips they just have to do it a little more old school a five-star comeback motel seeing a surge in business as more americans look to social distance during the pandemic motels may seem like relics of a bygone era but not in 2020 i prefer this over a hotel i can just walk straight to my room everything's clean i'm not touching a lot of things many of the motels offer their own little kitchenettes so you're self-contained in that area too you just go out get your groceries come in and stay at home motels are sort of built for pandemics one of the reasons they're becoming more popular right now is because you don't have to walk through a crowded lobby to get to your room you don't have to get on an elevator we're at a motel 6 by the way and your air conditioning unit is your own so you don't have to worry about the virus spreading through different rooms yes good news people you don't have to worry about coronavirus at motels which means now you can spend more time worrying about whether the drug deal in the next room is gonna go bad i think that's a pretty fair price for 10 kilos mr scorpion please just take it i also get why motels make much more sense than hotels right now i mean covert can't get you if you get stabbed in the parking lot first plus motels already have all the other diseases that corona is probably afraid to step on their turf yeah corona's like yeah you know what i'll just wait for you outside you know you think about it coronavirus is actually one of the most bougie diseases you know think about it think about where corona is what it's doing corona is like i like going on cruises and i love being in restaurants i don't like being outside and fitness classes oh my god i love those basically like anywhere with vitamin water so a road trip to a motel is one way to make vacations a little safer but safer yet is a road trip in a motel rvs have become the trendy way to vacation during the pandemic the demand is so high rv dealers say inventory across the state is low an rv is a socially distanced vehicle a socially distanced vacation and a way to corral or keep your family together this motorhome is 36 feet long and 8 feet wide about the size of a city bus no special license is required oh no i was a little tight with the uh that was my back wheel right with more rvs on the roads more inexperienced drivers are putting the wreck in recreational vehicle god damn that was crazy and i know what you're thinking right now trevor if my whole family is in that rv and we crash and die isn't that worse than some of us getting coronavirus honestly guys i don't know because if one family member dies we all have to go to their funeral but if we all die together then no one is sad it's also funny how that guy said rvs are a great way to keep your family together because is that really the problem we're having right now like who's sitting out there like guys i love that we're spending every waking moment together but what if we could do it in an even smaller space either way though this shows you why america is such a strange place because if you're forced to live in your car you get tickets the police hassle you people call you a blight but if your car has a stove in it oh then you're just living the dream so corona has made road trips great again but what if you want to go somewhere that you can't drive to well that's where things get tricky because although airline travel is surprisingly safe it's not just the virus that you need to be worried about a passenger gets kicked off a plane after a dispute over a face mask we're seeing incidents like this again and again more than 700 people are now on airline's no-fly list all because they refused to wear a mask while traveling tensioned aboard a newark bound flight as every single passenger is forced off all because one of them wasn't wearing a mask fists were thrown after a woman refused to wear a mask on an american airlines flight okay people i can understand why some don't want to wear masks outdoors right i can stretch my mind to understand why people don't want to wear a mask at a place like the gym but airplanes airplanes are the one place where your individual desires don't mean [ __ ] oh i don't feel comfortable wearing a mask on a plane uh i know nobody feels comfortable that's what flying is all about they tell you when you can stand they tell you when you can eat hell they tell you when you can use the bathroom flying is the only time after fourth grade where you need to get permission to go pee flying is not about your personal comfort it's about safety you think i want to take off my shoes huh and then walk through a machine that exists solely to take fancy dick pics of me and by the way i can't believe anyone is actually brawling on an airplane that requires way too much work especially if you're in the window seats because then you got to do that weird little shimmy out first what did you say to me [ __ ] excuse excuse me excuse me here let me hold i'll hold your ginger ale i just said what did you say to me [ __ ] and it's not just corona and [ __ ] that the airline industry is struggling with right now because as it turns out even if americans are willing to get on a plane they aren't allowed to go to too many places some countries have been easing travel restrictions in a bid to get their tourism industries rolling again but there is one country that is repeatedly being left off safe travel lists and that is the united states europe's famous landmarks and beaches are normally a magnet for american tourists and a major source of income here but travelers from the us will not be allowed into europe if you look at places for read where u.s citizens can travel right now the list is embarrassingly small before the pandemic this was a ticket to 185 countries but now with the u.s still struggling to get its case numbers under control an american passport is a ticket to almost no way that's right people because of how america has handled coronavirus travel to most of the world has been shut down so no more backpacking trips through europe sorry college students you have to pick up your fake accent somewhere else i got this one on netflix and you know right now i feel like most americans don't even realize how much they've messed up a good thing you guys are so used to being able to travel to any country at any time no questions asked that's not what it's like for most people in the world when people from africa or the middle east want to go on vacation abroad we need to get permission from that country first yeah americans can just be like my girlfriend susie went to london i'm gonna surprise her with a visit right now we can't do that where i'm from the rest of the world we get questioned like we're on the world's shittiest game show what is the purpose of your trip to france uh i've always wanted to see paris and what is it that is in paris i don't know the eiffel tower oh you want to see the eiffel tower here i googled it for you now get back on the plane bye-bye so your american passport may be useless for travel but don't worry americans the state department has just released a brand new psa about everything else that your passport can do the following is a message from the us department of state despite america's excellent handling of the pandemic our citizens have been banned from countries all over the world and you might be thinking i'll never use my passport again but don't worry because there are plenty of other uses for your us passport for example you can use it as a coaster or a barbecue napkin use the pages to draw where you wish you could go hose it down and it's a tiny little slip and slide you could even use it to hide a pornographic magazine practice flirting on it so do you come here often or whatever you won't even talk to me and did someone say origami or just duct tape it to your face and you've got a makeshift mask please don't tell president trump we suggested to wear a mask he'll get so mad your u.s passport not totally useless [Music] [Music] you
