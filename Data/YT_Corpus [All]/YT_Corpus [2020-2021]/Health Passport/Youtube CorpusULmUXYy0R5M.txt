 as the country grows more and more desperate for a coronavirus solution and end game just moments ago a cdc advisory panel voted 13 to 1 that the first doses of an authorized vaccine should be offered first to both healthcare personnel as well as residents of long-term care facilities joining our conversation right in the nick of time dr peter hotes founding dean of the national school of tropical medicine at baylor college of medicine dr hotez can you talk about can you talk about what these decisions mean are they do they have the authority to mandate this are these guidelines like the cdc guidelines about school or would they say does that go does that mean that these first vaccines will largely go to the frontline healthcare workers and residents of nursing homes and long-time long-term care facilities well nicole what not many people realize is that most of vaccine policies actually said at the state level uh and that that's the way it's been set up so it's the state that makes recommendations on school-age vaccines you know all the times have had to go up against the anti-vaccine people you have to do at times 50 because it's different in in each state it makes it very complicated and this is probably along the same line so the states as far as i can tell have the ultimate authority in this so that the acip recommendations are just that their recommendations now most states will likely follow those recommendations other states may decide that they want to tailor it specifically to certain populations depending on the state so for instance you know certain states that have highly vulnerable industrial workers uh ranging from meat packing plants etc may want to revise that some of those guidelines the likelihood is most will adhere to it somewhat closely but remember the states have been doing this now for a few months putting together the recommendations so it also depends on how far along they are how dependent are we on the manufacturing capabilities of these first companies to develop a vaccine yeah i mean the exciting part about these vaccines is you could go very quickly from discovery into the clinic that's the good part the the more complicated part is the brand new technology so the scale at manufacture is problematic and the frozen storage is problematic particularly the pfizer vaccine which requires minus 94 to 100 degrees fahrenheit storage the good news there is operation warp speed leadership in general gus perna i've been had a lot of time to think about this but it's it will slow us down uh somewhat both in terms of the number of doses that we have the hope is we'll have about 40 million doses by the end of the year which member you have to divide by two because there's two doses spaced three to four weeks apart so if you have 40 million doses that's 20 million individuals and we have around 20 1 million health care workers and 3 million assisted living nursing home residents so that pretty much takes care of the first lot and then the hope is that we'll have additional doses in the early part of next year and remember we have at least two or three other vaccines coming down the pike we have the two adenovirus-based vaccines from astrazeneca oxford you have the uh the j and j adenovirus vaccine you have the novavx particle vaccine and maybe even our vaccine which is now being scaled up uh and tested across india so by the second quarter of next year we'll be in being a very robust program of vaccinating uh americans and and then the hope is we can get to the point where we can even start looking at vaccinating most of the nation even possibly achieving hurt immunity by later in the year if we can uh get the studies going in kids to start vaccinating kids so the way to look at it is from now on in terms of vaccines every month is going to be better than the last month and so we'll see this gradual evolution we will continue to call on you throughout this um really remarkable phase with so much suffering right now but so much hope on the horizon dr peter hotes thank you for spending some time with us hey there i'm chris hayes from msnbc thanks for watching msnbc on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
