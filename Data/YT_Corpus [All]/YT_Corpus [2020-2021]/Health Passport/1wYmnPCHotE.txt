 I’m Hannah Milillo and I’m pursuing a masters of science in management in the Belk College of Business. I love traveling and Iove being immersed in places I’ve never been to. Meeting new people, going everywhere, seeing everything. So when I find something that’s inspiring to me, you feel that passion that the artist had when creating it and that’s what I love about art and art history is just being able to connect with someone or something that you would have never been able to see. I chose UNC Charlotte to pursue a graduate degree because I love the school, I love the city and the atmosphere. But also the MS in management degree is going to bring me what I need to become, hopefully, a Disney imagineer. I’m going to stay in a country, immerse myself in the culture, talk to people, take pictures, sketch, come back and create those places for Disney World. So I already have a passion for art and the MS in management degree is going to allow me to pursue this career and there’s so much out there, and there’s so much to learn, and I just can’t wait to see it. I’m Hannah Milillo and I’m a 49er.
