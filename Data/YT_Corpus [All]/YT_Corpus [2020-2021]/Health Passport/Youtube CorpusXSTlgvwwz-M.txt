 just like that you are rocking it today she's like if I do this you don't have to come back and do anything or you wait how about this one remember this goes on your arm do you want to touch it first okay we'll ship ready touch it remember this one's stretchy yeah okay it's gonna go on your arm like this watch what it gives a little hug look at you cool and then this one is cold will do music in a minute okay your arms gonna go straight like this and it's gonna be cold and they clean it high-five very cool and if you want candy we're gonna do some talking again okay can we do this one more time and then we'll try candy under your tongue good job get our drink and then we'll go do some music what is up guys welcome to the promised of video that we said we would do for you guys we're gonna go through some of his medical stuff and how bad deal with her aversion to it so as you guys saw to start with you know it was baby steps touch touch wiggle you know stim with the with the arm tourniquet things and you know very brief amount of time with a thermometer to where we gonna work up to where she will do all this stuff about this so many years yeah so if you don't know this is a this is a toilet hat or something I don't know the official term but it's for collecting a urine sample but something we you have to do for the doctor and Abigail kind of freaks out how much I to get a urine sample so yeah understandably so it's kind of weird kind of a weird thing you know you me to sit on that and what right it's weird like I imagine that imagine you when to use a bathroom you did not know what it was for you did not want know what was going on and that was there well the other so our bathroom you put it under the things put it the doctor they put it on top of it can you not put it under the toilet see the doctor I don't know I just solved it that's how she had that wouldn't help yeah under cuz there's a stability thing right well that's imagine this thing moves like this under your tongue ready listen it's gonna beep to you and turn it on it's kind of cool so what if you guys are practicing this are we just we until she'd come yeah perfect are you ready okay one two three okay so yeah I was like okay we're counting up this time then I thing was like well we count up and there's no end yeah because it yeah I kind of just started instinctively counting to see how long she would keep it right and then have the afterthought of if we kept it down I didn't know how long this thermometer if it was like a thirty second right yeah so there's also like oh well if we count down we may run out of numbers before thermometers ready so but if she gets to just the counting you could always start at 20 now how long would you do it how long would you do it just starting out would you just do it because I saw the first time that you do you when she was like okay I'm done that you let her be done yeah so this is so today was the first time that we've done this so I was kind of just seeing if she would even tolerate it being under her tongue and we're just doing a BA magic today rocking it today but realistically I mean I would whatever I would kind of see so the first time I think she tolerated maybe three seconds the second time was one second so I would probably just kind of average a few the first few probes and very much she would be tolerating on average and set that to kind of be our goal right so that she's getting a successful trial ever chime good job so since she did that and solve it at beach I think that I would kind of see can we get to that every time we talked about I don't know if you saw the video or not we talked about like with shaving armpits or brushing teeth like any of those types of thing and and not not just like you know self-care but but really anything that someone might have an inversion to yeah so with her was teeth brushing you know we we try to push for that end result we try to get to where the thermometers beep yeah and it's really like we tried to do that right out of the gate and not give him a chance to own up to it and that's the mistake we made with brushing teeth it was like you know we'd wrap her in a towel because the end result was having a clean mouth when the end result should be exactly yea the end result should be like can we touch the bristles to the teeth okay that's good it's a good day you know we've made progress so and I mean that's not to say so I've had families and adult clients not that this is like necessarily how I would do it but I mean we can't you can't let people's teeth be rotting in the meantime so sometimes we work on a desensitization program while parents also like estrogen and when they get a good clean and have to do what they try to do to get a good clean in so it really just depends on how how long the process takes yeah so if it's someone that's gonna take six months to fully get ya know where they're doing it well you can't not fresh your teeth for next month so sometimes two to keep things from getting too aversive or whatever we would use different toothbrushes are like the parents are using a toothbrush and during ABA we're using either a smaller softer like child's size brush more even some kids are so sensitive that we start with like a paintbrush or something soft just doing that so it's not a big plastic thing and these rough crystals in your mother just kind of I mean every every case has been so different so different toothbrushes then they're not associating yeah the terrible you know forced tooth brushing with learning how to brush teeth full time she like she got it and with like out like you'd even say Duggar you think she was like hey yeah I appreciate you providing a learning experience for all well done you and summer are gonna do dinner tonight to the other because we so I would keep doing this stuff in summer you guys are hanging out yeah you'll be all done for the day with me okay turn it on okay ready okay ready under the tongue so we'll do the same thing with the tourniquets just kind of work our way up with those you know starting with she just plays with it and Wiggles it and stuff like that and she lets us put it around her arm so you know we'll just lengthen the time that it's on her arm and stuff like that and just progressively without it being a negative thing that's it that's super important and you know I don't want my kid to experience discomfort when she's learning something that when there's no reason for it so but it'll make it easier for her because you do have to get those things done at the doctor's yep and it's so I know so much of this stuff you know it's longer time and it's tighter you know at first I was just kind of laying it across her arm in today she actually let me get I didn't tighten it but she let me get it snug around her arm although that we bought 400 alcohol prep pads and she really having a version of the perfect well you never know once you get the fold once we get to her wearing the tourniquet tolerating doing the prep pad touching a needle that's closed and covered and safe then you might end up actually going through this cool yeah they are good for cleaning yeah phone screens okay I hope that helps some of you guys we've got other things going on continuation of the regular vlog that we're seeing today at the same time so that's super confusing for me but I have you have any questions let me know down in the comments if we can't answer it well that's Brandi and get her help we'll see you guys next time bye your arm like this watch whoosh it gives a little hug look at you cool your arms gonna go straight like this and it's gonna be cold and they clean it and now you have all the skill sets for controlled substances yeah
