 [Music] hello and thank you for attending today's webinar discussing factors to consider when planning to purchase respirators from another country including k95 respirators from China a few housekeeping notes before we begin due to the volume of attendees your microphones will remain muted however if you need to reach out to us there are two ways you can do so please use the chat feature on your screen if you have any zoom related technical questions the Q&A feature can be used to ask questions about the presentations themselves though please note we will address all questions after the final presentation today a link to today's webinar will be posted on the NIOSH and BB TL website and with that I'd like to introduce our first speaker dr. Mary Ann D'Allesandro director of the CDC's National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health national personal protective technology laboratory good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today in our webinar today we're briefly going to discuss CDC optimization strategies for respirators and discuss the NIOSH and FDA roles concerning international respirators and here are some from some of our stakeholders on some best practices and guidelines from these two user groups next slide CDC recommends a series of strategies to optimize supplies of disposable n95 respirators in healthcare settings when there is limited supply so to get started today with the issues being observed with international respirators I first want to remind everyone that before you move to purchasing and using international respirators it is very important that you make every effort to consider both he conventional and the contingency capacity strategies described in the posted CDC covered 19 guidance these strategies include the implementation of effective administrative and engineering controls and the use of NIOSH approved respirators including filtering facepiece respirators elastomeric respirators and the peppers that you see on the left-hand side of the slide additional strategies include approved respirators that are beyond the manufacturers designated shelf-life or extending the use of your respirator next slide users can be confident that NIOSH approved respirators will provide the expected level of protection there are hundreds of NIOSH approved filtering facepiece respirators in the market and users can be confident in these products regardless of their country of origin you can tell if your respirator is NIOSH approved by locating the approval number which is indicated by the letters T C followed by a T for a for these filtering facepiece respirators and a series of numbers as you can see in the picture since 2008 NIOSH has required the approval number to be placed on the respirator itself or on the straps it's important to closely inspect your respirator in the packaging and as designated in the picture on the right make sure the NIOSH label is identified and that the model number is clear as well you can be certain that these devices are authentic if you are purchasing directly from a manufacturer or one of the reputable distributors you should be very cautious about random web searches though in an eBay for example there are some nonprofits out there who have very good intentions but are collecting respirators from donors and distributing them to healthcare organizations who may have respirators shortages while I applaud these organizations for helping our frontline workers be sure that you check the authenticity of these products if you have not purchased them yourself from manufacturers or a reputable distributor if you are unable to ascertain the authenticity of the respirator you may have to use it as a mask or a for source control so NIOSH has posted information on our counterfeit website that shows pictures of the products we found that are counterfeit and these products have one or more deficiencies and sometimes it is difficult to tell if the product is actually counterfeit so if you go to those website that website you can learn more about that information and see those products that to date we have identified as counterfeit a recent science blog identified here also provides additional information about some of these tips next slide if you are unable to obtain a not approved respirator and have no choice but to purchase a respirator conforming to an international standard we are very clear in the CDC guidelines about which standards are considered nearly equivalent to now n95 respirators these include standards from Australia Brazil China Europe Japan Korea and Mexico the first point to note when it comes to considering the use of these respirators from other countries is the fact that there are not approval holders or manufacturers of NIOSH approved respirators who also produce respirators conforming to the standards in these other countries and regions so if you're implementing this crisis strategy and are able to obtain a product from a manufacturer who is announcer approval holder we have confidence that the respirator will meet the requirements that they claim to meet the niosh-certified equipment list you could see at the bottom of this slide can be checked to determine if a manufacturer is a NIOSH approval holder if the manufacturer is not an approval holder you should follow several more steps before making a decision to purchase as will be discussed throughout the rest of this webinar and you will hear from several other speakers many other steps are needed to provide the confidence that you're obtaining a quality product CDC describes these points in our guidance and OSHA describes them in the information in their April third enforcement guidance for use of respiratory protection equipment certified under standards of other countries or jurisdictions during the Cova nineteen pandemic and another important factor when considering respirators from other countries is that those respirators have been issued in emergency use authorization by the Food and Drug Administration if the product is not on the FDA eua list it should not be considered for a purchase in healthcare organizations until a further discussion with FDA takes place and that particular respirator is considered for an EU a I would like to now turn it over to dr. Suzanne Schwartz who is with the Food and Drug Administration - the deputy director of the office of strategic partnerships and technology innovation Suzanne thank you very much Marianne FDA shares with CDC NIOSH an ongoing commitment to address the personal protective needs of health care personnel during the close of 19 pandemic we continue to keep a strong focus on increasing availability of medical products along with conducting surveillance of the global supply chain because the need for respirators has outpaced supply FDA is doing everything under its authorities to increase the availability of these devices and one way that we do this is by issuing emergency use authorization zouri UAE's for NIOSH approved respirators as well as certain non NIOSH approved respirators that meet comparable standards that can be used in healthcare settings today we have reissued the eua for non NIOSH approved disposable filtering facepiece respirators made in China this ei was initially issued on April 3rd in the next few minutes I'm going to summarize the changes to this eua our rationale for doing so and additional Public Health actions that FDA is taking working in partnership with NIOSH we've had concerns about the potential for fraudulent products or products not performing up to the standards necessary for respiratory protection identified on the market as K n95 respirators and for this reason we did not originally include respirators manufactured in China in the EA that we had issued in late March entitled imported non NIOSH approved respirators at the time we also encouraged importers and distributors to do their own due diligence and take the appropriate steps to verify the products often to prior to importing particularly those products not authorized by the FDA however in response to continued concerns expressed over respirator shortages supply chain disruptions and hearing from health care facilities who have been seeking access to these products we issued a separate eua for non NIOSH approved respirators manufactured in China on April 3rd at the same time recognizing the importance of putting in place additional safeguards under the April 3rd eua respirators manufactured in China such as KN 95 which has to have met at least one of three criteria to be authorised criteria one is the manufacturer is a NIOSH approval holder and FDA can verify the NIOSH approval numbers for the manufacturers other NIOSH approved respirators criterion 2 is that the product has a regulatory authorization under a jurisdiction other than China that can be authenticated and verified by FDA or criterion 3 that the product was tested by an independent test laboratory accredited to international standards and the test report demonstrated that applicable performance standards have been met working together with NIOSH we've come to learn that a growing number of respirators listed on FDA's appendix a that were authorized under this third criterion failed to meet the expected performance standard of greater than 95% particulate filtration efficiency when subjected to NIOSH testing under its modified version of nauseous standard test procedure and this was despite submitting passing test report results to the FDA in light of these findings today the FDA has reissued the EA for non NIOSH approved respirators manufactured in China removing criterion 3 of the April 3rd EA and thus removing all firms from Appendix A of the e way that were authorized based on submission of an independent test report all manufacturers and/or importers impacted by this change have been notified now we recognize that many of these respirators may still meet expected performance but out of an abundance of caution we are taking this action some respirators have already undergone additional NIOSH testing they've demonstrated that they meet the expected performance standard of 95 percent filtration efficiency and they are posted as such on the CDC NIOSH website in these circumstances the FDA has added the respirator back to the new appendix a firms that have had their authorisation rescinded because they've provided test report documentation criterion 3 of the April 30 way but they have as yet not been tested by CDC NIOSH can consider resubmitting a new request for emergency authorization to FDA within 45 days of the reissuance of today's revised UA and after the product has undergone testing by senior Yash and its performance results are posted on the CDC NIOSH website if the product passes a minimum of 95% filtration efficiency and there are no other authenticity concerns the FDA will authorize the product and listed in Appendix A additional changes to the reissued a way include that submissions of new requests for authorization can only be made by manufacturers themselves and manufacturers should list in their request who they're authorized importers are and finally criterion 2 of April 3rd EA has been changed to reflect the addition of Chinese national medical products Association registration certification once it has been authenticated by the FDA the FDA in collaboration with CDC NIOSH is increasing surveillance and sampling of all respirators imported from China to further ensure that products are performing as they should respirator shipments from China that come into the u.s. will be subject to random sampling by FDA and testing by CDC NIOSH to determine whether the respirator meets the appropriate filtration standard also the FDA is detaining shipments of products that CDC NIOSH has listed on its website as not meeting their labeled performance standard the continued surveillance and sampling will number one inform the FDA's decision to allow entry of products that meet the performance standard number two refused products that do not and number three identify situations where relabeling the products for use as face masks only in other words as source control is appropriate those respirators that fail to consistently meet a 95% filtration efficiency performance standard as reported on CDC NIOSH a--'s webpage can no longer be marketed or distributed in the US as respirators however again they may be relabeled as face masks by the manufacturer we also want to emphasize that a product sales testing it will not be allowed to be distributed in the US as a respirator regardless of whether it is in Appendix A or not as part of FDA's activities we've released today a letter to health care providers to make these considerations clear for all healthcare facilities that have these respirators and their inventory we've also posted a frequently asked questions or FAQ that walk through the considerations and actions I've discussed today next slide please this slide includes links to the reissued eua the letter to health care providers the FAQ s as well as the FDA 24/7 call center that we have stood up for coping 19 response I thank you for your attention and I will now turn the presentation over to John powers who will discuss NIOSH testing thanks Suzanne go ahead and advance to the next slide please so I would like to start today by covering some basics for evaluating international products the first step as we just heard is to verify that the product you are considering is listed on the FDA emergency use authorization when possible you should ask for samples of the product prior to finalizing the purchase for legitimate companies suppliers distributors this should not be an issue to receive samples the results of the international products that knowledge has been assessing are available on a results page I will discuss the results page a little bit more on my next slide NIOSH also recommends that you purchase respirators that have traditional head strap designs most of the filtering facepiece respirators being imported have ear loops it is difficult to achieve a proper fit with ear loops OSHA regulation 19 10.1 34 requires employers to develop and implement a respiratory protection program when respirators are necessary to protect the health of the employees or whenever respirators are required by the employer the regulation provides information on the proper selection of respirators medical evaluations of employees and training just to name a few the regulation also provides guidance on fit test procedures appendix a of this regulation contains the fit test procedures which lays out the eight exercises that must be performed during the fit test during the Cova 19 pandemic OSHA issued a memorandum temporarily suspending the annual fit test requirement as long as the employee continues to use the same model style and size respirator that the initial fit test was conducted for if a different respirator is used by the employee the initial fit test requirement still exists and should be conducted by the employer this would include switching from a respirator with head straps to a respirator with ear loops preliminary NIOSH assessments indicate that it is difficult to achieve an adequate fit when wearing respirators with ear loops several agencies have attempted a fit test with air loop designs and how anecdotally told us that they could not get a passing fit factor NIOSH strongly recommends that users do not purchase a respirator with ear loops without first conducting a fit test using multiple people with varied facial structures following the requirements of the approved respirator protection program next slide please since the beginning of April NP PTO has evaluated over 90 international products approximately 40% of the products achieved a filtration efficiency more than 95% this leaves 60 percent that have filtration efficiency of less than 95 percent so I'll elaborate a little bit more now on our results page the results page is an alphabetical order by manufacturer the model information is listed along with the international standard and the maximum and minimum filtration efficiency a copy of the report that was issued is also available the maximum and minimum filtration numbers on the webpage are for the ten samples that were tested the reports show the results for all ten samples and also includes pictures of the packaging and of the respirator that was submitted I encourage everyone to not just focus on the filtration efficiency numbers but to really look at the reports next slide please I would like to end my portion of the presentation by pointing out a couple of ways you can evaluate the respirator manufacturer every effort should be made to purchase NIOSH approved respirators there are numerous manufacturers that make NIOSH approved respirators including several in other countries these can be found by using the resources available on our website the niosh-certified equipment list is searchable using many different terms for instance you can select n95 which will return every manufacturer that makes NIOSH approved and 95s international manufacturers like to include test reports with their products as we we just heard from Suzanne every effort should be made to verify the testing laboratory that is shown on these reports you should check to see if the laboratory is accredited to ISO 17025 which is an internationally recognized standard for calibration and testing labs in fact our NPPL Laboratories are accredited to this standard another resource to check is the China national accreditation service for conformity assessment better known as Cena's there are several several respectable laboratories in China that are seen as accredited you can also check the European Union Commission website to find accredited laboratories while documents are a crucial part of verifying manufacturers it can be difficult to know which documents are real and which have been fabricated documents are very easy to falsify one final resource I would also like to mention is our MP PTO webpage for counterfeit respirators and misrepresentation of the NIOSH approval when we receive a notification of potential counterfeit products we always contact the manufacturer to have them verify and validate the information that we have receipts extras that we have added to to this counterfeit page we always provide pictures to aid users and spotting these products I would now like to turn the presentation over to Christina Baxter Christina you're on mute sorry I was talking to myself guys on you so I wanted to first thank John for passing the baton over to me and then talk to you guys a little bit about some of the experiences we've been having in the field of the problems with trying to validate some of the masks that are coming in as you can imagine there are a lot of different ones coming in for verification and it's not as simple as what we're used to which is go to the NIOSH website look up the mask and it's there so let's go the next slide and I'll walk you through some of the things that I'm finding for the different types so this first case is masks that are certified to the European Union standards and so the standard that we'll be looking for here you can see in the bottom in that teal block and that is en1 49 2001 with the update from 2009 so a couple of the things that you want to look for here and John brought this up earlier is first thing we want to do is verify the notifying body so in Europe they use what are called notifying bodies that are similar to test laboratories so if you want to look at it in a u.s. context for respiratory protection that would really be nice for us but if we're looking at some of the other PPE it might be underwriters laboratory it might be inter tech there's different facilities that we approve for different things same thing in the UK and in the rest of Europe so what you do here and I always find the best way to find this website is just to go into a google search that says European Union Nando na n do and that is their website for notifying bodies so then you can go in and there's multiple different ways to search you can search just by the name of the entity so if you have the name of the test lab just look that up or the country or you can look up by its number so when you see a mask that is marked with a see e mark it should have a number four digit number right next that is the notifying bodies number and you can just look up that number and it'll tell you whether they are approved to certify against PPE so some of the things that we see most the time I've seen lately is that sometimes that seee mark that we're used to isn't a CD mark at all and it's actually what's called it's a fake mark called China export so if you look at the bottom right you'll see that a c e mark is a trade mark that is specific to the European Union but what it does is the way it's always no matter how you spread it out however you change its dimensions the inside of that see if you firm if you made a perfect circle would actually hit the outside of the e if those letters are squished together closer then you know that it's not the actual trade mark from the European Union and one thing that we want to do is make sure that we look for that C e with four numbers after it that's a common pitfall that people have if they have a mask and it does not have that on there then it is not meeting the labeling requirements from the European Union things to look for make sure that notifying body is approved for doing personal protective equipment so verify the EU type examination certificate and I'm going to get to this one a little bit more and then verify that they're on the FDA exhibit one which is for the other types of masks that are not China that's under Appendix A so let's go to the next slide and I'll show you what an examination certificate looks like so in this case one of the things that I'm seeing more often than not is something called a certificate of compliance and everybody seems to be providing these with their masks but they actually mean nothing there is no legal authority to a certificate of compliance so it does not mean that it is an EU type examination certificate and that is what you're looking for in terms of how do you prove that it's real so you want to get the EU type examination certificate you want to be able to go to that agency that did the search vacation search for them make sure that they are a notifying body for the EU regulation 425 which covers all PPE and then you go further in and make sure that they can certify for respiratory protection equipment and the biggest thing I see with all of the European Union products coming in is this fake certificates and these certificate of compliance is which are well nice to have mean absolutely nothing so let's go on to the K + 95 experience of the next slide so in terms of K + 95 s John brought this up but there's a website for the China national accreditation service for conformity assessment and if you look up see Nass just CNAs you will find this website the nice thing about the website is I have a picture of it there in the top left if you focus in you'll see on the top right there is a column that helps you find an accredited body very similar to the experience you would have with the European Union it lists all of the people who are accredited to verify PPE for them and this is where you're going to find a lot of your mistakes that people are making fake certificates and they're not finding an accredited laboratory now right now because of so much problem in this area see Nass has made it really easy for us so that second red circle you see when you go to the website that is a direct link where they have packaged up a list of every accredited body in the cns Network in China that can do any of the PPE assessment so that list is divided out by respiratory protection gowns gloves goggles so a section for each one of those things so it's a fantastic one-stop shop for you to go and look and say does it pass that first sniff test so now one other thing you're going to do is once you find out that you have the mask and you find out the basic information about it one of the hardest things actually to find is the manufacturer name so find that then you're going to go to that FDA appendix which was updated today as Suzanne told us earlier and bear with us all of that was occurring just today this morning prior to this call so we did not have enough time to make any detailed information for you but you'll be able to find all of that on the FDA website one thing that I want to remind everybody of too is you'll see certificates saying FDA registration now one thing we want to everybody remember is that an FDA registration does not mean it's an FDA clearance and it definitely does not mean that it's allowed for use under this you a UA that they have out so you have to make sure that if it's a KN 95 and it is not made by a NIOSH maker so like 3m some of the other ones that make products they don't have a standard FDA clearance which means they'd show up on the NIOSH website then they have to be on this Appendix A for us to use and that just gives us the assurance that NIOSH or some an FDA have done their due diligence as well to help us make sure that we're gonna have the safety we expect with the product and one thing that we are seeing left and right are fake certificates and this is pretty much when I review these I would say right now at about 90% no success rate meaning that at least 90% of the masks that I am asked to evaluate have been fraudulent information can't say that that means they don't work but I can say that it means we can't tell you because we don't have the data now one thing I also want you remember there are gonna be three different markings you're gonna look for for in the Chinese realm of for filtering facepiece respirators the first is the GB one nine zero eight three - 2010 I want you to imagine that to be something like an FDA cleared NIOSH approved mask okay that one's made for the medical community where if you were to get body fluids flashed at you it would have resistance to those body fluids then you have the gb2 six to six which was updated in 2006 that's most common and that is more of an industrial respirator may not repel the body fluids some of a might and then you have the G B to six to six the 2019 version which is just coming online right now so you'll see some 2006 in some 2019 depending upon when they were tested so let's go to the next slide and here I'm gonna talk a little bit about the forgery experience and there's one thing that can help us here and that is verifying the Chinese business license and I'm not going to steal the thunder of Luke and Danny coming up because they've done some fabulous work on the validation of the Chinese businesses and things but the way I do is I go to this website and the website allows us it's called the national enterprise credit information publicity system and it's a website in China that allows you to look up business licenses and a couple of things that I like to go through and then look at here is the Chinese company name so just make sure that the name on your products and the registered address match what you've been given okay look at the incorporation date if something was incorporated just in 2020 I'm not sure that they've had enough time to build a process that is going to be ISIL accredited like Jon told you about for terms of the quality assurance make sure they're registered business scope is in line with what you're looking for the ones I was just reviewing earlier today the registered business scope is for a tool manufacturer and so I'm not sure that they really have the scope or the capability to make respiratory protection and then a really important thing is look at their registered capital how much money do they bring through that location and are they able to front enough money to be able to make and procure the appropriate materials to make the masks because you surely don't want to give them all your money upfront so some of the common forgeries that we see is that the company names not even a registered name in China the establishment Eight's don't match that you see it as an establishment date might say 1996 but were in 2020 and they've just forgotten their business license and then a lot of folks will change their capital to make it look like they have the ability to procure the starting materials when in fact maybe they don't so let's go to the next slide and this will bring us over to the Australian New Zealand ones and I didn't cover all the different types of masks I just covered the ones I've seen the most and in this case it's almost like we're back to our NIOSH experience where we have one-stop shop we one place to look in life is pretty good in this case you just go to the Australia New Zealand standard is 1716 it was updated in 2012 and it's soon gonna be replaced by the ISO 16 900 but the thing that we can do here is go in and verify the five Tech's standard mark so we're in the US we go and we approve make sure the NIOSH markings are correct in this case we go to this Web site in Australia which is sa I global and verify the product certification one thing that we do see a lot is that the product labeling is a problem but on their requirements it can be either on the packaging or on the filtering facepiece respirator and then I'm also seeing quite a few fake certificates coming from there as well so let's go to the next slide and what I want to remind you in this final slide is that this is a continuous process so as we start assessing the issues that we're having we need to assess that level of risk and make sure that the people that we're procuring the materials for have the risk assessment which then associates it to an appropriate level of respiratory protection then we need to go through and verify that the chosen product is certified to meet that necessary level of protection if you can't verify it through your standard searches as well as they're not a NIOSH holder I would recommend that you then go and see if you can get ten example products and provide them to NIOSH and have them test them for you that will give you the level of protection that it's going to provide and then you can follow that up with a fit test to ensure that you're going to get the protection you need one thing that we are seeing quite often is that most other countries allow an ear loop design that we don't allow in the US which tends to not give us as good as a fit especially if that face design was not made for the average American sized face and then remember operate following the best practices and keep doing that assessment product as you go and the one thing that's really important to remember and I think really comes home when you look at that NIOSH website that is about international mass that they've checked just because it's a fake mask meaning it's fraudulent in its markings or it has stolen somebody else's numbers doesn't necessarily mean it's not protective but the problem is that it does bring up is that we have no idea if it is or if it's not until it's actually been tested so just keep those things in mind as you move forward and I'm gonna pass this over to Luke and have him start talking about the great work they're doing over at his place hi my name is Luke Basso I'm the chief of staff of the Indiana Economic Development Corporation here in Indiana and seven weeks ago governor Holcomb tasked us with buying PPE for the entire state during the kovat crisis also be joined here in a few minutes by Danny Chan Danny is a consultant who does a lot of work with Hong Kong and China who has helped us develop some best practices when it comes to buying respirator masks next slide please so in Indiana one thing that we've learned and I think some we've heard today buying respirator masks is not an exact science in fact you know it's as you all know it's a very difficult thing so we established early some very baseline guiding principles that we would use when searching for respirator masks the first one being you know a bad deal is a bad deal if you wouldn't have done it prior to Coba 19 why would you do it now you know I'm sure like everybody else we get a lot of sure to make deals to put money up front if you don't buy now the mass go away well you know during this admit during this time with this immense amount of pressure to buy you also have to realize that bad deals are bad deals in dealing with in manufacturers in China or groups in China you also must be willing to walk away at the last minute we always sell ourselves the deal isn't done until the sort of document is signed we've walked away from deals at the very last moment because something has felt off about the deal and it's turned out to be right we asked a a enormous amount of questions and then we ask more questions and they're the same questions we have a minimum three contact rule in Indiana before we can make a deal you we must must hear the same answers they must be they must be right for us and if they're not we walk away from the deal we also speak directly to the manufacturer and we make sure we're speaking directly to the manufacturer they have to call us directly from their facility we do not or we have to be able to call from them and they have to verify that their facility is who they are and who they say they are and so they also wanted to bring up third-party vendors or as we call them third-party scams there are some people out there that the third-party vendors that are legitimate and helping out but a majority or not this is not a world where you can hop in today and go out and buy a lot of masks in fact these third-party vendors and third-party scammers are the ones who are really hurting all of us as we go through this so I can't stress enough today that in order to really defeat the this type of scam and these type of people we have to come together as a group and stop accepting third party scammers and buy a mask from them I'm sure we've all had these phone calls we've all had these emails you know again ask yourself if they're part of a multi-million dollar medical organization why are they emailing you from a gmail account if they have access to medical supplies why won't they put the money upfront to buy themselves rights mostly because they've never done with this group and they've heard it from somebody else and said hey I'm gonna try this today next slide please so on every mask we have we take samples so one of our sorry I forgot to mention one of our other guiding principles is we don't buy masks with ear loops now we've dealt with a lot of people who said they'll they'll send those masks that go behind the head or the respirator excuse me that go behind the head but as soon as we get those respirators we realize that they are over the years but we but so we do not purchase respirators that go over the years but we do ask for samples and if they aren't willing to send the sample we will not do business with them and once we have the sample we do our own fit test it's partly why we think that we've developed such a great process because we do the the fit test with the smell of smelling salt that makes you cough when it's not a real respirator or real fabric we let our doctors take a look at the respirators we have them compare it to stuff they use in the emergency room every day and then we also evaluate the boxes but this is becoming harder and harder and harder as the boxes are becoming the next level of the the counterfeit world but you can still see minor differences and you must be willing to take the time to evaluate all this if you don't you will get caught with some counterfeit masks I'm now gonna turn it over Danny Chan who will explain the rest of our process next slide please great thank you very much my name is Danny Chan I've been helping the state of Indiana for about six weeks previously I lived in China for over a dozen years working in private equity spending a lot of time on due diligence evaluations of Chinese companies for the past six weeks I've been spending about 11:00 p.m. to 5:00 or 6:00 in the morning speaking to Chinese manufacturers and Chinese sellers one of the first things I want to talk about is as you guys go through this process of dealing with companies in China it would help to kind of have a philosophical change so it could feel like whack-a-mole where you're trying to go through a checklist of a thousand items but it's very important to understand philosophically that when you deal with Chinese businesses that they just have a different set of rules of engagement so looking at documents asking for those things great all these things are great but those are more us centric business practices from a philosophical standpoint you need to treat or I would recommend you treat every seller from China as a no and having them work up to get you to say it yes because if you going up front and say here's the doctor the things that's exactly what they know we look for so they'll always have what we look for so you need to spend a little bit of time philosophically going into every deal going it's a no and you have to prove to me that it's a yes and so for Luke and I buying for the state where the first line of defense and very likely the last line of defense so all the upfront work that you're going to do is going to mean a lot ensuring that you get the legitimate PP that you're looking for and it's conducting a lot of due diligence making sure your counterparty is going to be correct asking for documentation and standard operating procedure we ask for documents not that the documents mean a lot but you do it because you go through that process you ask for samples and I should go through this course Luke touched on these third-party sellers some of them are American medical companies suppliers they're very aggressive they're very smart they use high-pressure sales tactics and sales methods that get you to commit and all of us helping the states and other organizations we're all doing our best to get the PP gear and sellers know that so they're using a lot of sales tactics so you need to be disciplined and kind of filter out that noise to not think about those things regardless of these sources I often often actually I shouldn't say often but we 100% have to speak to the company so the manufacturer in China we will not do anything unless we can speak to them that's going to help you eliminate some of the sellers because some of these sellers are buying or sourcing gear as not even the second or third middleman it could be the fourth or fifth so they have no access to the actual factory or company in which case asking to speak to them is going to have a good effect of eliminating some people now for Luke and I we had an experience with n95 see CDC NIOSH seller and so we asked to speak to the company the person we spoke to at the end of it I asked her a business card it was a digital business card with no company email no company phone number and more than like that person didn't work for the company so having somebody pretend to work for a legitimate company is something that could happen and so this is again why we have a lot of precautions in there to make sure that we're actually talking to the right person at the company that we're talking to and you know as you go through and make these transactions with Chinese companies know that the repercussions of a bad deal there's probably not much you can do and so again asking a ton of questions the people are gonna say you're being too diligent you know don't you trust me the answer is no we don't trust you but you need to earn our trust so American side we don't deal like that but when you deal with the Chinese companies you have to make them earn your trust the trust is not built in and they understand our rules of engagement I think it's very important as American looking for PPE gear that we need to understand more about China's rules of engagement the businesses and the companies as you go through the first group I want to talk about real quick are the n95 makers so the CDC NIOSH list I think those eight or nine companies are the gold standard the difficulty is a lot of people are running around saying they have access to those and the answer most likely that they don't and so you have to figure out how to get direct access to speak to the manufacturers I find it very unlikely and difficult that they will let you or have access speak to them so if they cannot then you shouldn't buy you should just move on to the next there are anecdotal evidence of people being able to obtain n95 from China and reselling them but usually those people are connected in some way to the company and it's the they're not easy to find and they're not out there calling people to sell because there's a network of people that know how to get a hold of them so if they're n95 from China you just want to be really sure that you can actually talk to the company because if you don't talk to the company then you have no idea if it's real or not and it's going to sound too good to be true and you just want to be really really careful about that list and then shifting gears really quick to the K n95 next slide please the cans right now are the wild wild west the cost of the fabric that goes into the KN 95 to create the respiration it's gone up from 6,000 RMB a ton to 780 thousand RMB a ton so that's about fifty-two dollars a pound up from about 70 cents so the cost of the actual Muriel has gone up significantly and so if you get pricing that's way too low there's something wrong if you get pricing way too high doesn't mean that it's real it just means they're making a lot of money probably more than they should but pricing will give you some indication on how real it is because if the deal is too good then you know there's a problem because there's a market price for this material and when you look at the cans the most difficult part of the cans are you could have a mass that passes the fermentation test so if you take the mask you send it to the CDC they test it it's 97 percent that's great the men you put on your ears you do a fit test it doesn't work so Indiana we've done these fit tests and if they're on the ears you will or at least the tests that we do you'll start coughing and you'll start choking off at the fit test so that's one of the things we do here and it's important that you guys do that as well I don't know as John Powers mentioned earlier I don't know how you can have your loot legitimate k95 fabric mask that passes the fit test and so that's something to be aware of is that even if the fabric is good with the ear loops you're not you're more than likely not going to pass the fit test there's been a couple companies in China that are moving to doing head straps the problem that I understand is the head straps require different machines from the year loose and that those machines are not in high demand and so people are trying to get them right now because they understand that American buyers are starting a request head loots which is good but at the same time there's going to be a delay from when they can have it so you just want to be really really careful that you know you're getting things I can pass the fit test because even if it's good material if the fit test doesn't pass then you have to ask yourself you know where are these masts going to and you know what where is it going to where is it going to go you just have to be really really careful about that and then some of the other things that to kind of anecdotally ask is companies in China when they change from one industry to another they have to do a change on their company registration so there was examples of a few companies that used to sell iPhone phone cords they switched into making respirator mass about 60 days ago so you should ask them provide documentation of your company registration when did you change did you just change to make people year when did you do that have you sold to US companies show me company that you sold to gives me custom documents that you've actually shipped from China and that land into the u.s. who are some of your American customers let me talk to them and these are things that I would ask the Chinese company as a post in the middlemen because the middlemen more than likely will have every answer that you want so it's important that you get a hold of the actual seller because many of these sellers don't think there's any repercussion if they sell bad things to America so for them you know many of these factories in China right now they're switching to PPE gear are having problems in their main business so they're moving a PPE gear as a means of survival and if they're trying to survive they're trying to make a profit they're probably not going to care about quality control they're probably not going to care about what any American buyers gonna do to them six months or a year from now so it's very very important that as you look at these Chinese companies that you look for ones that have financial strength and the register capital system in China is different from the US you set up a US company its par value you have a company that you create four thousand dollars and you raise money or you put up your own money in China the system is different on registered capital what register capital means shows how big your company is from the beginning it affects your ability to borrow from the banks it affects how people abused your company so it's a very good reflection if you have a company with a small amount of registered capital let's say a million US and you put in a 2 million dollar order for masks they're gonna need to put up about 1.7 1.8 million dollars worth of cash to buy the fabric because the fabric right now you have to pay upfront and this is exactly why they're asking the buyers to front half the money so they take half the money go buy fabric or put a order for it and then they end up getting the other half so you're basically fronting the entire transaction but what happens that the price of the fabric goes up which it has are they gonna go in their pocket and put up the money that is the difference to get you legitimate masks are will they blend legitimate fabric with fabric that's not so legitimate so that your permutations going to be lower all these things you have to ask yourself as you go through this process because if the company you're buying from doesn't have financial strength then if any change in the price of the fabric goes you're gonna be out of luck and there's not much you're gonna be able to do so it's very important that you look at the counterparty and ask yourself is this the kind of company that you want to do business with for what you're trying to buy I think it's very very important you look at that and what I first mentioned the call is philosophically you have to be very distrusting and have them prove to you that this is somebody you want to work with we also always ask for the Chinese companies owners ID and passport the reason we do that is once they give you the ID and pass for it they know that you know who they are and so it just adds a little bit of a layer of nervousness for them because right now a lot of the middlemen are insulating the Chinese sellers going hey listen I'll take care of it just give me the masks you need to take the control out of the middleman and deal direct with the Chinese manufacturer I know that's not easy because you're gonna need a Mandarin speaker and somebody who's Mandarin speaking that has done business in China just speaking the language is gonna be fine but a lot of these factories they know that if you have someone on the phone who just speaks Mandarin but does not in do business there they relish that so I just caution that you know you don't want to just get anyone you want to just you know if they speak Mandarin it's helpful but just have that mentality of they need to prove to you the buyer that they're gonna be a legitimate counterparty or the chances of them being a legitimate counterparty is higher and this is why we don't do upfront payments we don't do escrows we make sure that they have the financial strength to pay for the fabric and that we're more than happy to pay once we know the products fine but we don't front money for people to go do the purchasing of the fabric because that means they don't have the financial strength which makes it very very nervous from a buyer standpoint and so that's all I have there's other best practices that we're working on but it's important when you deal with the k95 to ask questions to ask again to not get pressured into it and just make sure that you know you really think about it and really really think you know is this the company that's going to come through for and also the middlemen company you want to make them on the hook so if the middlemen is coming in you should say if I buy and something goes around you the middlemen are financially responsible as well as the Chinese factory so you'll not see if you can get them into some sort of three party agreement where all you know the other two sides are responsible something goes wrong and again you want to make it so that you're such a hassle that if they're up to no good that they go you know what I'm gonna go find another buyer that's basically the philosophy that you want to have is you want to have them go this is too much work I'd rather go find another sucker and if you do that then you get to move on to the next seller which is hopefully the legitimate that one that you're looking for thank you guys very much Thank You Danny so the last slide here is talking about the fact that NIOSH will continue to prioritize the testing that we have been doing according to the scheme that you see on the right hand side we will continue to work with FDA that is the first priority in our testing because this testing will help the FDA and making decisions and putting information on to the EU A's it is not the only decision but it is an input into FDA's decision in making those EU A's priority two is working with other federal government agencies as we are seeing these products that are not conforming to the standards they claim to meet we are providing that information to agencies such as the FBI the Department of Justice and US attorney general's offices and FEMA and DHS and those agencies are looking at what actions need to take place next so we are very involved in those with those organizations as well we will continue to provide this service to state government agencies as well looking at products that not previously evaluated by NIOSH and those products previously evaluated by NIOSH and finally our fourth priority will be to continue to provide FFR users this service as long as that product is listed on an FDA eua I want to mention as John did earlier that every product that we evaluate is listed on our website the results in the test report and the pictures that we do receive from those submitters next slide here are some additional resources that you can reach out to if you have additional information all of the FDA e UAS that Suzanne mentioned earlier and then we have some additional resources as well recently CDC posted the information on factors to consider when selecting an International respirator a lot of the contents of the webinar today is listed on that product that's on the website and there are some other products as well that you see here now I would like to go to the Q&A s and reach out to the individual speakers to answer some of the questions we've received online so the first one I want to go to is looking at Danny or Luke if you could talk about a little bit more about how you verify you're working with a manufacturer since it is typically typical in China that they were that there are other agents and they don't have their own sales force at the factory how do you know you're working with a manufacturer um when I guess for the IDS what I can do is in some different provinces in China you can pull their shareholders from company records similar to how we have the secretary of state system so we grab the shareholder list and then we look at the ID they send and make sure it's the same person and so that's one way to check and then when we talk to them we spend a lot of time talking and letting them understand and then additional checks we could do is we can call the local government in China and say this is what we're doing can you let me know what this company looks like and again this is not easy for most people to do but it's possible if you have the resources to do that but um the ID coupled with the company registration that helps that helps and then again it's just asking just asking questions you know again you're being investigative and how you're approaching this so you don't want to go in there with okay I think they're real let me check you want to go in there with the mentality that this is not real and you have to prove to me and again just by having that attitude a lot of people a lot of the sellers just go away because they don't want to deal with it and so if they're not willing to deal with it then you're asking yourself do you want to buy from a company that won't even spend the time to prove that they are who they are Thank You Danny the next question is for John powers John the question is what action will not take to protect niosh-certified products if we identify a counterfeit product and we advise NIOSH NIOSH must take action to stop the sale of these goods you Oh as I said before the first action we take once we get a notification is to contact the manufacturer so as you can imagine with the time difference between the US and China everything's delayed by a day so we will send the information we have to the manufacturer we will ask for confirmation they typically check and get back to us within a day or two if they tell us that they believe it's counterfeit then we post it we also you know we have we have some manufacturers that have sent us a lot of pictures of what the what the actual product should look like little nuances of the box little things to look for that's the information we've been working with the FBI and Department of Justice and those folks on to try to find these products that are out there and being sold but we if we do find a non conformance to the NIOSH approval we will then work with that manufacturer through internal processes that we have that's within the guidelines of our regulation to have that manufacturer correct those issues thanks John you can stay off mute because the next two questions are for you as well can you explain the private label field in the NIOSH approval I will try my best so so the example this is going to be a manufacturer that makes their own product we'll call it product a and then they're approached by another company and they say hey we love product a would you make that and put our name on it so they say sure they submit it to NIOSH we look at it we issue a concurrence to that private label and now you have product B and then that continues so they're they're approached by another company approached by another company and so basically it's a very similar product with different labeling I kind of think of it as a brand name you see a lot of the so I have a lot of the international products that we get requests for people say the manufacturer is X and you look at the pictures and you notice right away that X is a brand name it is not the manufacturer of that product so to to me I think it's similar to what you would see as a brand name on the respirator so hopefully that answered that one yep okay thank you and MIT has recently published results of a test performed on a number of KN 95 is this a reputable study this is a reputable study and I actually had about an hour phone call with MIT two days ago so they they not only have they been performing these tests for the state of Massachusetts they did tell me that they tested five products that we had on our webpage and verified and validated that they got the same results that we got which was very good news we are working with MIT we are going to try to link from our page to their results once they get something up they were still working working through their university system to figure out the best way to get their results posted and once they do that we can link to them and they've agreed to link back to us so that'll be another source where people can go and check results for other international products thank you John this next question is for John Cristina Dani and Luke and I'll ask you each one at a time to respond so the question is are all K n95 respirators ear looped and I'd ask you all based on what you all have seen in your testing and evaluation so John first so we do see very few I don't have the numbers in front of me but are some with head straps at this time on our results page it's not easily visible to see that we've talked about maybe updating our table and putting you know heads track or ear loop but it is in the report so unfortunately right now you'd have to click through all the reports and see if it says it's an ear strap head strap design or an ear loop design there are only a handful out of the 90 Plus that we've done thanks John Cristina I'm seeing the same thing very few that are using two head straps almost everybody using the ear loops and the fits are just atrocious with most of the ear loop designs so it's still holding up true that the ear loops are something we're trying to avoid thanks thanks Christina and Danny or Luke I the answer is yes like from what I've seen most of the 1095 our lips and it's very very very few our head straps I mention a little bit earlier a lot of the people in China are trying to buy the machines to make the KN 95 head straps there's a it's very difficult to get those machines because the can they're just ear loops so for them to switch I think we're gonna see a delay I don't know how long that delay is gonna be but at some point maybe they're able to get the ear loops on and catch up but for now it's a lot of manufacture they're working on trying to do that but it's very difficult to get the machines to make that you're the head straps and to make sure they're strong enough so when you put them on it doesn't pop off Thank You Danny yeah that was Danny oh thank you Danny I agree with the other three okay thank you so other question here is it is not on the FDA list which is real short now but NIOSH tested it and it's greater than 95% can we use the respirator as long as it fits this is Mary Ann now answer that question so if it's not on the FDA list and it cannot be used in health care environments however OSHA does have these products listed in their regulatory memo so it is possible to use them in other industries however OSHA now is just saying if they authorize them to be used in other industries but as of this time OSHA is only having their guidance out there for health care is my understanding another question here how do they get away and then Christina I don't know if you have any information about this not sure if someone from the US could answer this but how do they get away with having a logo that is so identical to the European conformity logo can there be legal action taken for masks that are labeled with a fake ze logos so this comes into the trademark process in a trademark is what the Cee logo is and when you submit for a trademark you actually submit the exact spacing of your letters the colors the looks and what they've done is they've just changed one thing which is the distance between the C and the e and that means that it's not a trademark infringement anymore because they have changed that size they've made it look as close as possible but in terms of a trademark infringement would be the process they'd have to go after and there's really nothing they could do there because that's it's not infringing on their trademark it's slightly different in terms of them going after mislabeled products they can they will they have different websites that lists all the ones that they find so as we find them we try to send email saying hey this is what I found and they start updating it more and more and I think they're just doing the best they can at this point in time because reality is it was a non-issue in 2019 it's a huge issue in early 2020 and at this point everybody's trying to just make sure the right product gets to the right people versus worrying about how do we go after the people with the wrong products but rest assured everybody's planning for the future of going after and making sure that this doesn't happen again Thanks thank you Christina this next question is for Suzanne and it goes along with what I said earlier about the fact that NIOSH testing is one step in your process but the question is now Josh tested youngmen respirators and they were 98 to 90 percent effective but you said that this will not be on all respirators would be on Appendix A but it's not on the list so Suzanne can you again explain what is going to be on that list and why that one is not on the list I can't speak to the particular one but you just mentioned right now but I will I'll talk generally and that yes the the testing by NIOSH that is being performed is a critical component of what will be on that list but in addition to that for those products and manufacturers slash importers that were originally included on that appendix who came in through that third criterion as I described they are immediately withdrawn from the list and the means by which they would be put back on the list would include number one testing done by NIOSH as well as the request has to come from the manufacturer new request has to come from the manufacturer the manufacturer would list who they're authorized importers are but we will not be accepting requests from importers and so there is and I'm speaking hypothetically here there is a possibility that the product in question is coming from a source where it was an importer that submitted initially and as part of this process we have removed again any that were coming from importers Oh Sumerian I can add a little bit the the last version of Appendix A prior to today's update was April 24th young men was not part of the bat Appendix A so it wasn't on it wasn't one of the ones on there to start with therefore it when transfer to the new one a lot of a lot of the requests we have received the manufacturers were not on the EU a and and again maybe a handful have been on the EU a so a lot of the products that people are buying and using we're never part of the original EU a that the FDA posted correct John we add to that as well now that I have a little better framework of what we're talking about here we were aware of nine of the entire listing that NIOSH has has posted there were only nine that actually were on if you did the crosswalk on FDA's appendix a and it was seven of those nine that that failed in terms of their performance standards but as you you know so correctly stated given the numbers of products that do appear on your website that have been tested the vast vast majority of them haven't even been on the Appendix list which reflects the fact also that manufacturer or a previously an importer never came in with a request for that in that product Thank You Suzanne we have a question here about Patel sterilization will only sterilize n95 masks do you know if can 95s will be accepted for this process this is Suzanne do you want to answer from an FDA perspective and then I will answer a 4% yes that is an important piece that I did not speak to today but all of the EU A's that FDA has issued for respirator indicate within them that the respirator if it is authorized then it is also authorized to undergo decontamination with an authorized SDA decontamination system if therefore a respirator was removed from authorization it's no longer authorized as is the case of what occurred today those respirators which would include here can 95 are no longer under the umbrella of considered authorized for decontamination either thanks Suzanne and from a NIOSH perspective those systems that are currently authorized by the FDA are authorized for use in healthcare settings and then in other workplace settings it's expected that inhalation exposures may result in loading of the filter and soiling with other contaminants that have not been validated for decontamination so if these respirators are used in non healthcare environments and become contaminated with dust in addition to kovat or as Tsarskoe b2 we do not know how this will affect the efficiency of the cleaning method or affect the any of the performance of the respirator also if it were authorized for use in other workplace settings by OSHA you have to note that there are over there are several hundred niosh-certified models and many different models of can 95 s as well and each have their own individual set of construction materials and characteristics and if you look at these factors and you have to make sure that all of those factors are considered when determining if you're going to use these processes or not so NIOSH recommends that you work directly with the manufacturers to determine if their products are able to be used in these various decontamination systems okay so let's see so I'm going to ask John's answer this question as does the the person who is marketing the NIOSH approval have permission this is in the private label again have permission from the manufacturer holding the NIOSH and 95 approval to private label the packaging I believe no they can't just decide on their own that they're gonna put a different name on it it has to come back through our approval program for evaluation and they're just like I said there's a process in which we recognize that private label and then it gets added to the approval but they should not be able to debt so that would be something we would see as potentially counterfeit if if a name shows up on on a respirator with a NIOSH approval number so the NIOSH approval number is the TC - 84 a - four digit code 5-digit code that would be something that we would post as not being a valid now approved product okay thank you John and I ask all of the speakers this are there specific labels required on the KN 95s John I'll start with you if you have knowledge of that in my experience with what I've seen that answer has to be no and Christina the answer is are they on there no but the answer is are they supposed to be on there it should say KN 95 and either GB - six - six - 2006 GB - six - six - 2019 or I think it's the other ones GB one nine zero eight three which is the medical mask equivalent k95 so the fda cleared NIOSH approve so they're supposed to have the standard to which they're certified on the mask but as John just noted most of them don't Thanks thank you and if the model number on the can ninety-five has the first three letters of the manufacturers name in front of the model number but on the NIOSH website it only has the model number could this be a red flag and I would say based on what Christina said that yes that would be a red flag you have anything to add to that Christina I guess I was reading that question I was a little bit confused because that just to make sure we're talking about the same thing NIOSH does not approve k n95 respirators there are different websites that NIOSH has where we as users can search to say have they tested that one and if so yes you want to make sure that the markings match exactly because we have seen several cases where let's say the products should be JK but it's certified product for K and 95 that's allowable under the FDA Appendix A is JK 0-1 well then just a JK won't pass it's got to be that JK zero one so hopefully that helps but yeah it's the way they write it they're always little changes that you have to watch okay thank you for clarifying that I was reading that as if it was looking at our test results page not the NIOSH approved site and yes and I KN 95 would not be on the NIOSH approved to the site because we do not approve those products yeah I can elaborate a little bit more on that so when we get these requests model numbers are very hard to find on international products that I've seen so what we do is is we look at that box and the packaging as best we can so a lot of times we'll see it'll say something like um it'll say model and then it'll say K and I KN 95 protective masks non-medical so that's what we use for the model name when we post the results and that's what we put in the report very few of them actually have a numbering system for their models there are some that do but but very few so that's why the MU will see the model name the way it is on the results page thanks John you could stay off mute because this one would be good for you and and maybe Danny and Christina might have something to add as well so this is about whether or not there's been discussion on how to adapt the can 95s with a clip to pull them behind the users head if they are not if that is not part of the design John do you want to talk about some of the things we've seen sure so we we had this same thought we we actually had one of one of the products that was sent to us for evaluation the requests are actually put a clip some sort of 3d printed clip in the in the package with us and was asking a bunch of questions about it so we experimented with in-ear loop design we didn't have one of these clips but we decided to use a tie strap so an individual in our lab put it on we took the ear loops we took a tie strap the very first one he put on the ear loop ripped completely off of the off of the respirator so we were a little more careful with the second one got it on there he felt that it felt tighter on his face he started to then go through the exercises of the OSHA fit test got to the one where you bend over at the waist and the whole thing slid off of his face so I I don't we haven't done enough research on those to know for sure how while they work or if it would be something you know that can be can be could be used thanks John Christina do you have any knowledge about lips or extend ups I could see on there miss Kim has a comment on there about using the mask extenders for that purpose and the only thing I worry about is mask extent extenders are great for when you have that one person who can't get a fit but when we're doing a quick fit test of several different people to make sure that we can get a product to fit that just isn't gonna do it if we're already looking at mask extenders just to hit the basic testing and checking I don't think it's going to be a suitable alternative and what John said about the ear loops we're seeing products coming in today where the ear loops half of them are off before they even get here so please don't pull on the ear loops any more than you have to if you're using those thanks thanks Christina Danny or Luke do you want to add anything to that have you had any observations with these clips or extenders well you know in my experience when we did the fit test I think we had a 15 or 20 K and 95 s and you know Mary Ann I think I was telling you it was a smoke test and so you know basically we're in a room and we're coughing quite a bit and you know you told me that you know that's not necessarily good for you to inhale which I wasn't aware of but from our experience on the fit test with the euro loops it was it was tough like it was a lot of coughing for a long time okay thank you so one question here we have is it possible to use in 1995 respirator that is certified by NIOSH but not by the FDA and oh and so that question the answer is yes the FDA clears NIOSH approved device ffrs that also are cleared for protections against fluid resistance and biocompatibility and flammability but NIOSH in all other settings outside of healthcare the NIOSH and 95 approval does not have those components to the approval but is used in other workplace of settings so then another question here any guidelines or regulation to verify the fabric for any new manufacturer able to check if it can pass a NIOSH test parameters my knowledge we don't have those guidelines John do you have anything to add to that question no I mean manufacturers need to do the tests on their and to ensure that the fabric they're using meets whatever the standard is they're claiming that their product meets okay thank you and this next question is for Suzanne are the masks removed from the eua allowed to recondition and meet the recommendations in the enforcement policy the masks the respirators back are that have come off the appendix yes they could if they're reconditioned and relabeled as face masks okay but that you know if the caveat there is the critical piece so they cannot be marketed and distributed as respirators and this is where FDA working at the in the field working at imports would be looking at shipments for that and making those kinds of determinations FDA would work with the manufacturer of Records to determine whether that is the direction that the manufacturer wants to go or whether they you know would prefer that you know that the just the product not be distributed at all Thank You Suzanne and the last two the last question is since the ear looped KN 95 masks they are not sealing properly why are we approving them for use isn't this a big issue especially for health care workers I'll take the time to answer that question so NIOSH has mentioned earlier on in the presentations because of this shortages that we have in the crisis capacity strategy in which we find ourselves we did identify these various countries as having standards that could have products authorized for use standards are good standards if the products do conform to those standards and if you do have an ear loop design and you obtain a good fit it is a product that will protect you and that is the way the NIOSH guidance reads as well as the osha enforcement guidance osha did not as john mentioned earlier osha did not waive the initial fit testing requirements that still is a requirement that everyone achieve a proper fits but the annual fit testing requirements has been waived what that means is if you have not fit tested with that product to date then you still have to have initial fit testing with that product because you likely had were fit tested with another product prior to this crisis and I think with that we have still a number of questions we were unable to answer we are going to try to determine what the procedure is for answering those and putting those online with the the web site with the webinar information so I thank everyone for participating today thanks to all of the speakers and I hope you all have a great day thank you very much
