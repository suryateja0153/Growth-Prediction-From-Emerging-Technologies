 i'm gathering this uh afternoon session back in um so we'll begin um our first presenter will be uh dr doran fink who will talk about considerations for fda licensure versus emergency use authorization of covid 19 vaccines dr fink please thank you very much uh can we advance to the next slide okay so just to start and make sure everybody is on the same page in terms of expectations for licensure of cova 19 preventative vaccines the applicable statutes and regulations that fda has to follow require a demonstration of vaccine safety effectiveness and controlled and consistent manufacturing to ensure continued safety and effectiveness of the license vaccine in theory in perpetuity at this time given the epidemiology of copit19 and its trajectory we expect that at least the first cobit 19 vaccines to be licensed successful will be licensed under fda's traditional approval pathway and under this pathway we expect that the substantial evidence of effectiveness required to support licensure would be demonstrated in clinical disease and point efficacy trials that directly show that the vaccine prevents either covid19 disease and or sars cov2 infection some of you are surely aware that there are other fda licensure pathways that are applicable in certain situations these are the accelerated approval pathway and the animal rule licensure pathway however at this time these alternative licensure pathways really would not apply to cova-19 vaccines because first of all the sufficient uh incidents of covid19 disease to allow for clinical disease endpoint efficacy trials and also the limited and evolving understanding of star's cove to immunology and immune response biomarkers that might predict protection against protein 19. so because of these two current conditions the criteria for these alternative licensure pathways at this time would not be satisfied next slide so fda has received a lot of questions um and we've heard a lot in in the press uh about what level of vaccine efficacy will be necessary to support licensure of a covid19 preventive vaccine and certainly demonstrating efficacy is necessary it's critical but in and of itself it's not sufficient to support a licensure application and one reason is that a large efficacy trial conducted in areas of high disease activity such as has been initiated in the u.s this week could rapidly accrue enough cases to achieve the specified efficacy success criterion before additional data that are important to inform benefit risk considerations the review of the licensure application are available and these data could include among other things longer term safety data as well as data to support the manufacturing processes the abilities product characterization and also demonstration of lock-to-lock consistency this second bullet really relates back to the licensure requirement that there needs to be controlled and consistent manufacturing to ensure that vaccine produced ongoing in the future will continue to be as safe and as effective as the vaccine that was studied in uh typical trials to provide data to support licensure next slide please additionally the licensure review process takes some time and this is because it must address a number of statutory and regulatory requirements for approval the licensure review process involves review of complex clinical non-clinical and manufacturing data and when we say review of the data we're not just talking about review of clinical study reports and the applicant's assessments of the data we're also talking about review of the data sets themselves to ensure that there are no issues with data integrity and to ensure that our scientists and statisticians can replicate the results of the analyses the key analyses that the applicant has submitted to support licensure as part of this review process we often have back and forth exchanges with the applicant that include information requests and meetings to resolve issues and questions that come up there are inspections of facilities and clinical trial sites to ensure that adherence to good clinical trial practices and good manufacturing practices occurred there is um often a safety update with longer trip safety data sometimes all of the safety data that are submitted to a licensure application are available at the time the application is submitted but sometimes there are additional safety data coming in during the review and almost certainly that will be the case with covet 19 vaccines the review process also includes negotiations with the applicant for a pharmacovigilance plan to continue evaluating vaccine safety after licensure additionally we need to agree on plans to satisfy pediatric study requirements as you heard the ongoing studies for covid19 vaccines that have reached uh later stage development do not yet include pediatric subjects and so we will need to have a clear idea of when pediatric subjects will undergo participation in vaccine studies and which age groups will be appropriate to study and finally and certainly not least important for new vaccines we often convene an external scientific advisory committee called our vaccines and related biological products advisory committee vertpac to get their input on the data available to support licensure this this process is critical to ensure transparency in fda decision-making processes uh certainly uh there is a need for for transparency for regulatory decisions related to covet 19 vaccines and the downside of convening this committee though um is that it requires a lot of work both on uh the part of fda as well as the applicant and these are the same staff and personnel who are participating in the review so looking at all of these activities in aggregate the usual time frame for licensure review is on the order of 12 months for a standard review or eight months for what's called a priority review or expedited review certainly there are things that can be done to be flexible within this review process to have information submitted ahead of a licensure application to pre-position the review team to conduct a more expedited review that can be done to to cut down on this review clock time but even uh with with maximal uh adjustment to speed up a review uh i think it would be very difficult to imagine a licensure application review process that lasts only a few weeks or even a month so i think we need to be realistic in our expectations of how long the licensure would be processed will take next slide so there are other regulatory mechanisms for making vaccines available that do not involve licensure and one of these the one that is perhaps most pertinent to addressing the kovit-19 pandemic in the u.s is the fda's authority to grant emergency use authorization or eua euas are authorized under a set of qualifying criteria that are outlined in fda a guidance document also reflected in fda regulations and general law the qualifying criteria are first of all a declaration by the hhs secretary of an emergency situation leading to serious or life-threatening disease or condition uh we certainly have that now there has to be evidence of effectiveness for the product intended to address the emergency uh you saw in a couple slides back that the standard for uh licensure is substantial evidence of effectiveness the eua standard is worded differently uh for eua a product has to be determined uh that it may be effective well what does that mean may be effective fda has flexibility in interpreting that standard and it really relates to the third bullet here fda has to determine that the known and potential benefits of the product outweigh the known and potential risks of the product and the intended use of the product including the number of individuals to be treated under the eua as well as uncertainties in the risk and also uncertainties and the benefits and impact the application of the eua effectiveness standard so if you're talking about a drug that is being authorized to treat individuals with severe covet 19 disease and that drug has a very well characterized safety profile based on extensive experience either pre-licensure or post-licensure for a different indication then the maybe effective standard could be uh lower than the the standard required to support licensure but on the other hand if you're talking about a vaccine uh that is intended to be used in uh tens to hundreds of millions of individuals who are not infected at the time that they're vaccinated and there are much more limited safety data available for that vaccine and some additional uncertainties and risks then the maybe effective standard gets much closer to the type of evidence that we would need to support licensure of the vaccine the final quite qualifying criterion for eua is that there has to be no adequate approved and available alternative and all of those three words adequate approved and available are important so certainly if there's no licensed cova preventative vaccine then that standard is met if there is a vaccine that has been being used under an eua then that vaccine is not approved and so the availability of that vaccine does not count against that criterion similarly if there is a licensed vaccine but there's not enough of that licensed vaccine to address the emergency situation that also does not count against that qualifying criticism next slide so how does an eua work well it is uh requested by an entity outside of fda typically a government stakeholder such as cdc barda or department of defense or it could be requested by the name manufacturer and the eua submission to fda includes a number of items the list below is certainly not exhaustive but some key items are specific details of the requested product used under the eua including the specific population the dose and the regimen that will be used the submission must contain supportive safety effectiveness and manufacturing information upon which fda will make its determination of benefits versus risks and then also the eua needs to include fact sheets to inform patients and also fast sheets to inform health care providers of the conditions of the ua and the potential risks and benefits of the most used under eua and in our guidance fda also recommends that for health care providers more detailed prescribing for me that is now many of the detailed prescribing that is the same things many of the same things that we would review under licensure application he would also review under an ela request but the regulations and law allow for a more rapid review of the eu a request as compared to a licensure application if fda does agree to authorize emergency use this authorization comes with several conditions again this is not an exhaustive list but some key conditions uh include monitoring and reporting of adverse events to the extent practicable for very widespread use of a cloved 19 vaccine under a ua we would expect a very good safety monitoring mechanism conditions could also include the duration or will also include the duration of the authorization which can be renewed as necessary or terminated if the criteria for emergency use authorization are no longer met and there may be other conditions to the authorization as applicable for example those related to distribution of the drug product or advertising next one our guidance that we released at the end of june which i've mentioned several times now today does discuss additional considerations for mua one concern is that issuance of an eoa based on very preliminary safety and efficacy data from randomized controlled trials could reduce the ability to demonstrate effectiveness and assess benefits versus risk of the vaccine to support licensure so we've had some questions about could an eua be authorized just based on immunogenicity data could it be authorized based on a very early signal of efficacy that just meets statistical significance criteria and the fda thinking on those questions is is no we would really need more definitive data closer to what we would expect to support licensure one situation where fda thinks an eua could be considered is for a vaccine where there is adequate manufacturing information an eoa may be appropriate once studies have demonstrated safety and effectiveness of the vaccine but before the manufacturer has submitted and or fda has completed its formal review of the biologics license application and when we say demonstrated safety and effectiveness we are talking about to the standard required for an ua but keeping in mind that that standard may be very close to the licensure finally the considerations for eua licensure are going to be data driven no matter what what's the vaccine and so any assessment regarding any ua would be made on a case-by-case basis considering the proposed target population the characteristics of the product all available pre-clinical and human clinical study data and the totality of available relevant scientific evidence last slide so for everyone's information i've included some urls to fda resources including our guidance documents for novid19 vaccines as well as the guidance documents for emergency use authorization and finally a website that fda maintains with information about past and present worlds thank you very much thank you dr pink for that very informative presentation um please remember to mute your microphones um when not speaking um so we'll open this up at this time for questions uh dr frye thank you dr romero and thank you dr fink for that very nice overview of the eau i have a question that i'm going to ask because we received this question a lot from the public and would just like a better understanding of what my response should be but can you provide us with more specifics on how operation warp speed and the emergency use authorization has affected the rapidity and timing of the review of the phase one and two trials data for this very first vaccine that uh initiate a vaccine for which the phase three study uh was initiated this week and when i say a more specific information can you tell us maybe and maybe you're not allowed to i don't know uh what specific data was reviewed and how much data there was i don't know if that's a fair question and if it's not dr romero please advise i can i can certainly try to answer that question um so first of all i i don't think that eua considerations really play a role in our review of data to support initiation of phase one phase two or even phase three trials um those those are all you know geared toward uh advancing clinical development with the ultimate goal of supporting licensure of a safe and effective vaccine the the other uh question you asked was about the impact of operation work speed operation work speed is based on my understanding working to facilitate and de-risk vaccine development by providing funding by helping to harmonize amongst different vaccine manufacturers i'll leave it to folks who are involved in operation warp speed to address any more detailed information about about their involvement but needless to say the fda's role is entirely independent from operation warp speed we have been conducting our usual data driven with review process for our oversight of the clinical development of these vaccine candidates and the standards that we have been using are really not very different from our usual standards for clinical development of preventive vaccines in general it's just that things have been progressing much more quickly with seamless and adaptive clinical trial design and uh the view scientists uh and other staff at fda uh working uh much harder to review much more information in much shorter periods of time our guidance document that i provided the link to does provide more detailed information about the types of non-clinical and clinical data that we expect to see at each stage of development to support advancing on to the next stage and if you read these these bullet points in the guidance i think you'll appreciate that they they really are reflective uh and consistent with the types of data that we routinely require to support uh development of preventive action thank you uh dr solaji yeah thank you very much dr feng for an excellent presentation i have a question regarding the um specific target population groups and the extent to which the eua differs the level of evidence for efficacy and safety differs for specific age groups in other words um if the trials show significant amount of efficacy uh and high safety for a broader age group to what extent um are the is the guidance difference under the ua for certain age groups uh like by age or potentially underlying conditions or pregnancy etc i i don't think there's a meaningful difference in terms of um in terms of age groups or or other demographic or medical factors by which you might um classify a population the the difference really lies in uh in the standard where the licensure standard is safe and effective uh where effective means substantial evidence of effectiveness and for eua the standard is may be effective and known as potential benefits outweigh the known potential risks and again i'll emphasize that for uh preventative vaccines those eoa standards are really going to uh in in practice be closer to the licensure standard than for some other drug products that have been or would be considered under ua whether we're talking about licensure or the ua we do look at some populations and consider sub-population independently that doesn't mean that studies have to be adequately powered to meet statistical success criteria for specific subpopulation but there does need to be sufficient evidence of effectiveness to support the approved use or the use under emergency youth authorization for all of the populations included in the united states great thank you dr bell please thank you and thank you doctor i think that is a really very useful and helpful informative presentation and i really do appreciate fda's you know really expanding and helpful guidance and fda's um sort of responsiveness to the difficulties um and the trickiness that we face here um my question is sort of revolves around some of the you know concerns that have already been raised in general about uh public confidence and so i'm curious about what incentives exist for manufacturers to continue to speed the process of licensure once an eua is issued my understanding is that at least theoretically an eua could be continued for the extent of a um of an emergency and not to say that the manufacturers want to have a new indefinitely but um there are variations in um you know speed of uh submission and responsiveness to fda's requests and such and i i'm just wondering if there are incentives in place for the uh manufacturers to continue to really push hard for licensure if they've had an eoa issue that's a good question and i'm not quite sure how to respond other than to say that by the time an eua would be seriously considered uh for a coca-19 vaccine that vaccine would would likely be at a place that's that's very close uh to being uh ready for for a licensure application in terms of outstanding data that are still needed in the clinical development process thank you dr admar thank you dr romero and thank you dr fink for a very clear uh presentation i i have a question uh and i'm i i'm very pleased to see that uh the fda has considered what the potential impact on conducting and completing clinical trials could be by issuing an eua but i guess i want to get down into the weeds a little bit in that my understanding is for the phase three efficacy studies the planned uh follow-up period is a couple years and at least part of that would be as i understand it to address some of the concerns that dr edwards spoke about this morning from a safety standpoint a la dingy vaccine for example and it could be that later this year or early next year we have um substantial evidence of effectiveness of one or more of the vaccines being investigated that would occur well before the planned uh safety follow-up has been completed and and it may be an unanswerable question but how does one weigh you know the potential short-term efficacy that's demonstrated versus the unanswered uh and unknown safety questions that that would be answered by a longer follow-up thank you that that that is an excellent question and one that we thought about and struggled with quite a bit um that and the best answer that that i can give you today without uh being opaque is that we will really have to consider the totality of the evidence available at the time that we are considering a licensure action or decision and the totality of evidence um will of course include clinical trial data um from phase one phase two and phase three trials uh and looking at the extent of longer term follow-up both for safety and also efficacy uh that are available from from those subjects also we'll look at the non-clinical data that are available that will help to inform us about the potential risk of enhanced disease looking at the immune response biomarkers as well as animal models which might include for example challenge models with longer intervals between vaccination and challenge to help inform what happens when antibody tires wane for example and so we'll have to make decisions whether it's for an eua or for a licensure based on all of the available data and certainly i'm sure you can appreciate that if we were to uh wait you know a full year or two years before taking the regulatory action to make a vaccine widely available that would really be counterproductive to to addressing uh the current situation i agree thanks thank you not to cut the discussion short but we need to move forward um we'll take one more question uh if from the liaison representative if there is anyone if not uh dr foster thank you very much this has been great presentation uh quick question do you think is the acip allowed to make a recommendation for a vaccine under an eau uh which will have implications on people who operate understanding orders dr romero would you like for me to answer that question i was yes i was about to ask you sorry yeah so i'll answer that uh doran um yes so under um acip's charter there is a provision that in an emergency situation that we can issue recommendations under an eua or other type of approval that is not for licensure thank you very good we'll move on then so um we'll we will have uh dr masonier present next considerations for vaccine implementation uh dr messina please great good afternoon everybody um i think we all know that the success of our endeavor requires not just safe and effective vaccines but a safe and effective vaccine program and so i'm going to talk today a little bit about our considerations for the um vaccine implementation next slide you know as a starting place an effective vaccine program needs to ensure access and high coverage in all segments of the population and we need to start by appreciating that there are racial ethnic disparities in our routine immunization coverage especially in adults this is data that you all have seen before in other conversations but this is influenza vaccination coverage in adults by race and ethnicity with lower vaccination coverage in blacks and hispanics this disparity has existed for a long time and you know the current social situation likely exacerbates the issues that surround these lower vaccine coverage but as we start planning for immunization with covid we need to be mindful of this as a starting place and we need to take seriously that we need novel and more robust strategies to increase uptake of the copied vaccine once it becomes available next slide we find ourselves in a complex and evolving landscape for covid vaccine and we are not going to have all the answers that we need in order to start planning um and frankly even along the way the landscape is likely to change and so this just lays out some of the complexities um there are multiple products the products are some one dose mostly two doses and the products are not interchangeable the vaccines have varying presentations vaccine efficacy and adverse event profiles are different in different populations the cold chain requirements are different the initial um studies are are not being done in children and pregnant women and you know it's always been one of acip's principles to want early studies in children and pregnant women and we're not going to have the benefit of that for this vaccine our implementation plans needs to account for socially distanced vaccine practices adding yet another complexity to our program planning communication and education are always key parts of any of our programs but for this vaccine in this situation we understand that that need is greater than ever both you know even even now the rumors and misinformation about covid vaccines are circulating and certainly the need to move quickly although safely and effectively but the need to move quickly may lead folks to have un incorrect assumptions about cutting corners which we're certainly not doing and again the issues around communities of color and the current social situation also will exacerbate these problems some high-risk groups for covid19 from a starting place may distrust public health and we certainly have seen this in some of our early focus groups that we're already doing to get attitudes around covet vaccine so as i move forward understand that we understand that we're asking for planning in an incredibly complex environment and yet we need to start planning in fact i think many of us feel like we're already um already late and so need to move forward quickly even given the current environment next slide so um this um cartoonish figure attempts to show all of the different aspects of vaccine implementation and a vaccine program these are look like they're sort of in sequence but of course it clearly doesn't work that way and so starting in the middle in the blue on the left we appreciate greatly acip's work in helping to prioritize populations and the impact of the national academies but understand that this is going to be an iterative process and as we understand more about the vaccines it will impact prioritization which then impacts every other aspect of planning after prioritization we need to be allocating vaccine distributing it from a manufacturer to a distributor to a state administering it we appreciate the importance of gathering additional data on safety and effectiveness as well as uptake and of course the need for a second dose and finally for folks especially who have been through h1n1 we understand the importance of planning for vaccine recovery at the end of this in gray at the bottom you will see the data requirements and again i think that everyone here understands the importance of data in any vaccine endeavor but especially for this one we believe it's very important for us to have end-to-end vaccine tracking and dose level accountability that data is crucial to allow for flexibility and targeting in allocation and ordering and vaccine management and certainly data around adverse events and vaccine effectiveness post licensure is always important but it is going to be of increased importance for this vaccine especially as rapidly as we need to roll it out at the bottom you'll see regulatory considerations we appreciate fda's partnership and understand the need to consider how the regulatory requirements impact all of the other components of vaccine implementation and i put on we put on top this green bar the communication and stakeholder guidance at every level you know this is again always important and part of everything that we do but for this vaccine in the current situation um of increased importance next slide um one of the unknowns is what quantities of which vaccine with which characteristic is going to be available when um and i wish we would have more discrete data but you know we are in a world where as anybody who does vaccine development knows there are lots of uncertainties we are generally planning for sort of this idea which is at some point we expect that there will be a constrained supply that may be actually because there are limited doses or because although there is more vaccine available the doses that are released are somewhat constrained when there is constrained supply we will need to focus administration on some target populations and in general what acip has said but frankly what multiple other countries in who have said is that there needs to be some focus on populations where high coverage will be essential to public health and we look forward to continuing dialogue with acip about how to approach this issue but even when we have maximum supply available we will still need to target our our immunization program efforts so broadly um great when there's lots of vaccine available but the us government state and local health departments will need to focus their efforts on the places where from a public health perspective we think it's most important and so we also look forward to acip's guidance about how when there is greater supply they would propose that we focus our efforts at the same time of course we'll work to ensure physical and financial access for everybody to this vaccine next slide this is another cartoon to talk about an approach to covid vaccination and i guess what i would say is maybe start in the middle which is that in general we are planning for centralized distribution because we believe that it's the best way to allow full visibility and control and to be able to shift assets assets based on the available data to drive vaccine allocation we understand the importance of kidding making sure that ancillary supplies are available um vaccine will be allocated to jurisdictions as per our normal programs but in addition we all recognize that this is an unprecedented situation we are as a community being asked to do something that we've never done before which is um get vaccine out to the entire population in a very compressed timeline and therefore we're going to need to think outside our traditional boxes we need to rely on our routine systems but we also need to go beyond them so for example we will be planning for allocation to some private partners so that we can expand access in similarly we will be planning for administration sites in traditional sectors but we also believe we need to be planning for innovative sectors to reach certain target populations so with all of this again my message is of course we will be relying on our um traditional systems but we also need to learn from what has gone right and not right in the past and we need to think outside the box with turning over every rock and looking under every possible way in order to make sure that our systems are as robust as possible and really being open to lots of partners that um frankly are all wanting to queue up to help us figure out how to how to do a unprecedented thing and so i would ask that we all be open to the possibilities of thinking outside our normal traditional approaches next slide to distribute and administer a covid vaccine we have to leverage many partners and this just emphasizes it more there are public health experts and assets among across all of the us government federal state local the va the indian health service there are lots of ursa there are lots of groups across all of us that are part of the normal public health infrastructure but there are also a variety of private partners we work every day with private partners in our routine work and now here we really need to be able to expand those partnerships across distribution administration and also guidance and best practices so you will see coming to the table a variety of our traditional partners and a variety of new partners that we're working with in new ways and i think in the end it'll make a more robust covid vaccination program but frankly also we may see at the end of this that we find ways to expand and enhance our routine systems because of these new partnerships next slide a key part of all of our programs is always going to be monitoring the safety of the vaccine and this is just a cartoon that showcases the different stages of vaccine safety evaluation i think you all have seen this before it's a key part of cdc's program and certainly a key part of what we're looking to acip to help us with which is to continue to review the safety data both pre-licensure and post licensure and we certainly recognize the importance of a really robust system to monitor safety post licensure and are working with all of our usg and multiple other partners in order to build out a plan for for how will monitor safety and cdc fda cdc fda indian health service dod the va i mean those are just some of the inside government groups but we also are certainly relying on many of our private um partners that are already working with us in this space and we need to build out these systems now so that we're ready when vaccine is licensed and ready when it starts to be used routinely we need to be able to reassure the american public that we have our eyes on this and that we'll keep having a robust evaluation all along the way next side i'm going to end on this i i hope that you all will recognize this slide which you've seen before which is the program that cdc launched last year to really try to talk about um vaccine confidence as opposed to vaccine hesitancy and this is our strategic framework to strengthen vaccine confidence prevent outbreaks of vaccine preventable diseases with the idea that it has to be a whole um of community enterprise and i find myself going back to this slide as i think about what we're going to need to be doing for covid vaccination the um the concern we already hear in the public about covid vaccination frankly comes back to some of these same principles and our approach to it needs to be holistic that is it's not just about covid vaccination it's about the public's trust in our overall vaccine programs and their trust in the people who recommend vaccines and we really need to have a broad approach to stakeholder engagement so that we can make sure that we get the right information to the people who need to know it at the time that they need it and we also need to decrease any barriers to access to vaccines in every community but certainly cognizant back to that initial slide that we can already predict some of the communities that are going to have more resistance to vaccination we need to start now if we're going to make sure that those are communities are ready to accept the vaccine when it becomes available so it's a long road between now and when this vaccine becomes available and and frankly um you know it's going to take all of our partners um working all together to to to make sure that we're ready for it i think we at cdc are really optimistic by around the early data around these vaccines and we want to make sure that the delivery systems are equally ready when the vaccines become available we don't want there to be any gaps from the time that the vaccines are recommended by acip we want to be able the next day frankly to start mount um starts um these programs so that's why we're talking about scaling up now thank you thank you very much dr matanya um are there any questions from the voting members uh dr hunter thanks apologize in advance if there's background noise um i just had some comments um i'm can you hear me first of all we can thank you very much um uh i'm looking at uh flu vaccine events this fall as practice for covid event uh vaccine events um later um i'm i agree with dr masonier that that traditional mass clinics by local health departments that take place indoors and without social distancing um are not not necessarily the best model for what we're going to be looking at uh with kovid during the covid pandemic for any mess clinic any mass vaccination for flu or for coven and traditionally these kind of mass clinics take place at places away from facilities that have established vaccines or refrigerators such as like in schools rather than you know at or next door to pharmacies or clinics um finally i was gonna mention that i'm part of a community-wide effort in milwaukee in my role as a medical consultant for to the city of milwaukee health department and as part of that i'm encouraging um folks who are starting on pilots already to expand that idea of and what their pilots have include that i think are good are walk-through or drive-through events that occur outside um and adjacent to pharmacies and clinics so that's my personal way i'm looking at what's going to work in the world i work in and i just thought i'd mention that thanks yeah i appreciate those thoughts dr hunter one of the concepts that we've been talking about is something that actually we don't talk about in the u.s but globally those of you who have worked on vaccines are should be familiar with the concept of micro planning which is what happens when a country is planning for example for a polio campaign or a measles campaign it's much more detailed planning than we have traditionally done even in flu vaccines and that's what we think we need to be doing in this situation we need to be doing much more concrete micro planning with each state and local health department so that they can take into account their local factors and come up with creative solutions from our part we're also trying to work on some i.t solutions that would help for example um in terms of scheduling clinics and we're working with the variety of our partners across operation warp speed um in terms of creative solutions to how you might basically do mobile or mass clinics pop-up clinics and there are a variety of private partners who actually have some pretty innovative approaches to this um again um appreciate all the complexity and you know i can talk in generalities but in the end it's where the rubber hits the road it's um it's out to you all in the field who are going to have to operationalize this and that's why we want to get past where we are now quickly so that we can start that level of planning with again every locale because that's what we think it's going to take this is a huge challenge and it's going to require a lot of um a lot of advanced planning but also a lot of boots on the ground over thank you uh dr lee uh thank you dr mason i wanted to ask um regarding your slide that shows the ramp up versus uh i actually that that graphic was actually extremely helpful and although intuitive i find it useful for us to think about in part because um although we understand recommendations will drive implementation we're also cognizant of the fact that implementation is in our evidence to recommendation framework and some of those implementation considerations might impact recommendations in different phases so with that in mind my question to you is really around during the wrap-up phase versus the peak phase you had talked about traditional versus innovative delivery systems could you give us a sense of existing sort of uh what is the feasibility around implementation during the ramp up phase of traditional versus innovative and then obviously at a peak time our hope is that we'll be able to do all of it um but just again thinking about the um efforts it will require to be able to you know efficiently distribute vaccines to as many people as possible um your input yeah um this this slide makes it look um like it's simple and it's either one side or the other and we all know it's not going to be like this there are any um number of um of iterations that one could imagine and plan for um it reminds me a little of the of the language we talk about about um you know all models are wrong and some models are useful and i think that you're right we're trying to sort of show um just a paradigm to start thinking about it since we don't exactly we can't know all the possibilities um what i'm talking about in terms of traditional versus um innovative you know in some ways traditional vaccination in my mind is people going to the doctor's office to get vaccinated some innovative approaches would be for example if if acip recommends a focus on essential workers partnering with pharmacies to be able to deliver vaccine to essential workers in a way that decreases barriers to access many hospitals already do vaccination but frankly back to what paul said a lot of them probably do vaccination in mass vaccination availabilities we're working on some i.t solutions that would allow folks to um to sign up in advance to identify their eligibility and then to basically schedule a time to get vaccinated so i think some of that is perhaps what i was thinking of in terms of innovation um if um and and i expect that this won't be a black white either or approach but for example for long-term care facilities i think there are many complexities with vaccinating people in long-term care facilities one of which is the vaccine likely will have to go to them there will be issues about informed consent or ascent to vaccination and complexities in terms of underlying medical conditions that that that um frankly will complicate things there are some private groups that actually already have abilities to vaccinate in long-term care facilities and so we're looking at those groups to see if there's um and again many of these private groups are very willing and interested to do their part so trying to figure out how we can activate all the private providers and who are perhaps a little less traditional but could be part of the solution in these groups i hope that helps thank you dr finley please dr finley hi sorry i was on butte thank you dr mezzanier as a state program manager i want to acknowledge that many states are actively planning and coordinating with preparedness and our state emergency operation committee and we're building on the active structure in place we're making use of what's available because we're already in an emergency action to develop i.t communication and other pieces so this isn't something that we're thinking needs to happen uh many of us are actively uh working on multiple subgroups and moving forward with it yeah i certainly appreciate that and i think some states and locales are farther ahead and you know i um i've had a couple conversations with state health officers who frankly like sometimes at cdc it's um there's always the crisis of the day and frankly those crisises are huge and it's hard i think sometimes for folks to wall off a team to think about something that in some ways folks feel like is six months away and i think part of our messaging to state and local health departments is going to be the importance of starting this planning now i think some states have already embraced that and are doing in that and that's great and we're going to learn from your examples but we need plans in every state in locale and you know our goal is is should always be to be prepared before before the vaccine becomes available so appreciate that you guys are ahead not surprised about that we just want everyone to get to the same place where um where the plans are in place and ready to go shovel ready um when the vaccine gets here thank you dr dr marlonado yes thank you nancy that was a really nice presentation thank you for talking about the racial and ethnic disparities um and in particular i wanted to ask you a little more speaking to what you just mentioned about being prepared before the vaccine is available can you tell me a little bit more tell us a little bit more about who you're engaging with now are there focus groups who are your key stakeholders in communities of color particularly societies other partners i know we talk about local partners but national uh leadership and partners i know and the nam has a committee now to look at prioritization but i think we need to think about other partner organizations and the thinking about how to engage with them and their constituents and looking at uh focus groups and how to how to build out that trust that you mentioned early on so can you talk a little bit about what was and now yeah i mean mostly what i would say is to agree with you you know we have our traditional immunization partners and i mean we the royal we um many of whom are around the virtual acip table um but especially around communities of color we need to think way outside the box in terms of um who are trusted stakeholders and i think for me one of the lessons from some of the work that we've been doing recently is and frankly even um going back to think about the um measles outbreaks in um is that a year ago um it is how much of this is local and so i think we really need to get past the national traditional organizations and much more cognizant of of who folks of who we need to engage we need a much broader deeper stakeholder engagement than we already have and you know again i feel already behind but frankly this is where we are today and you know this is our call to action for all of you we need to get um we need to get moving on stakeholder engagement and so um many of you will be hearing from us very soon as we start to figure this out i think um organizing across so such broad and deep set of stakeholders and partners is going to be complicated and you know we will definitely be looking in for advice input and help from the traditional partners in immunization dr frey hopper uh thank you uh sandra freijo for american medical association uh speaking as a private practicing general internist a primary care physician um i've really enjoyed your presentation and i appreciate you thinking out of the box about non-traditional ways to distribute and admit and administer vaccination but please don't throw the baby out with the bath water don't leave off the traditional methods of delivery remember that physician recommendation is a major motivator of vaccination especially with this one the warp speed in which these vaccines are being developed raise concerns as you mentioned of possible cost cutting and right now especially with this vaccine physician recommendation is so important in getting patients vaccinated so please make sure that primary care physicians have access this vaccine thank you yeah dr farfa thank you for um articulating that i wholeheartedly agree with you private physicians are key parts of our routine immunization infrastructure and key partners in in talking to their patients about immunization so you will get no arguments from me about the importance of engaging engaging those groups and frankly when i'm talking about some of these non-traditional methods i i shouldn't have implied that i meant separated from private providers optimally private providers will be part of um of some of those innovations you know as as dr hunter said um in some cases vaccinating within their own health care sector um you know there may be innovative approaches to delivery but we would certainly hope that local health engages those private providers in thinking through what those options are and those private providers become major stakeholders visible stakeholders in implementing some of those non-traditional approaches so you know you have my complete agreement thank you um a quick word we're running a little bit behind so um there are two more uh uh questions in the queue that uh dr uh sorry miss mcnally and dr dushan and then we're gonna cut it uh at that point and move on to the next topic and i'll check with dr uh cohen to see if we're gonna have a small break here but please uh miss mcnally please go forward thank you dr matthew this information has been very helpful i'm specifically interested in understanding whether a vaccine becomes available through traditional fda approval or an emergency use authorization do you anticipate any changes to the current mechanisms that are in place for safety monitoring um yeah thank you for that question absolutely i wouldn't say changes as much as i would say enhancements and so um you know we're certainly going to rely on some of the tried and true systems that we use for monitoring adverse events but we need to enhance them in terms of for example speed and robustness and we need to make sure that they're penetrating all of the populations that may be getting access to vaccine part of the planning for us is imagining what groups might get vaccinated first and making sure especially in those populations that we really have built out adverse events monitoring certainly um adverse events in those populations could derail the whole effort and also we certainly have seen um incorrect adverse events derail immunization efforts and so it's really important that we have our normal systems building on them to be more robust and especially in the groups that might be vaccinated first i think we'll have more presentations to acip about this but you know it it's essential that um and you know we rely on acip to look at our safety monitoring plans and point out any holes that they see because we want to make sure that acip and our partners and in general the american public are confident in our plans and so we'll be i think talking more about this right yes amanda says yes we'll be talking more about this thank you thank you dr dr dusan thank you nancy thank you for your presentation and for what you're doing to support our vaccination program i was a little surprised to hear the discussion about detailed implementation planning given all the unknowns um is there guidance that has been issued to states and locals to guide us on what's appropriate to do at this stage given the unknowns and the limited resources and do you expect additional funding to come to support a local immunization program implementation yeah um thank you dr duchenne for asking that question even in the setting of so many unknowns we have to start planning and so um we believe that the moment is now to plan and planning needs to be flexible to accommodate the range of um of what we think the possibilities are in a parsimonious way in terms of which vaccines with which characteristics and how many doses are available so i wish i could say that if we waited another month you would have absolute clarity about those things but knowing that we won't we believe we need to get started in planning cdc has not yet put out detailed guidance this is for us really the launch of that next phase we will be um putting together more detailed guidance but frankly equally importantly we will be providing technical assistance to state and local health departments as they develop their plans and are working very closely with the variety of partners including our colleagues in the department of defense who have tremendous expertise in logistics and planning and ask us lots of hard great questions that that make us turn over more rocks and look underneath and make sure that there's nothing that we're missing and so our we'll be moving into the next phase of more detailed planning working with state and local health departments providing technical expertise but frankly also engendering more of a community of practice where states that have already started their planning we want to learn from them and we want to take those lessons and help states that are a little farther behind you know this planning is not going to be easy and we need to rely on the things that we've planned for already but the context of covet is very different and therefore we're going to need to be more flexible and we're going to need to be flexible up until the moment when those vaccines become available because frankly i um there are still many things that may look different on that day so it's not going to be easy but you know we're going to count on all of you as partners there with us thank you very much so we're running about uh 10 12 minutes late over time um so let's take a two to three minute break for you all to stretch your legs um walk around a little bit and then we'll restart expect me to call to order again in about two to three minutes we'll go on break
