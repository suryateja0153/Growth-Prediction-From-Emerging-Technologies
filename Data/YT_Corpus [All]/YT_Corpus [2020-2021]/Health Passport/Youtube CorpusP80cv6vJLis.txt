 Travel isn’t just about visiting a place or having a destination. It’s also about letting that destination inhabit you and change your perspective from within. Before this trip, I wasn’t open to the idea of solo travel but Barcelona has a warmth to it. Its vibrancy has a way of making me feel comfortable and at home. Working in the architecture industry has made me a more curious person. As a designer and photographer, opening my eyes to the world is really what inspires my creative vision. In my work, yellow is a tool. It’s the most noticeable color to the human eye so we’re always drawn towards it. It has the ability to enhance the positive emotion of a space. When it comes to design, I think about how to bring in and maintain light as much as possible. Not many people realize Barcelona’s streets are filled with natural light because of the octagon-shaped blocks. At La Sagrada Família, the light shines through the stained glass right before sunset and illuminates the ceiling. My experience here is completely different to other big cities around the world. Exploring the world through an architectural lens fuels my curiosity and motivates me to constantly push the boundaries of creativity. I’m Demas Rusli, this is what yellow means to me.
