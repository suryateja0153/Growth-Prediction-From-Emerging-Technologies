 let's bring in nbc news and msnbc medical contributor dr van gupta he's also a pulmonologist global health policy expert dr gupta you always keep it real and practical um i was um sad to read how many people had traveled and i get it i miss my family too um but what should we expect on the other side of the thanksgiving holiday good afternoon nicole for everybody out there that's watching this and i'm just gonna cut straight to the chase what we're really struggling with on the healthcare system side is enough adequately trained icu nurses respiratory therapists and doctors to care for patients it's no longer an issue about ventilators or having enough beds that's still a problem the bed piece but the big issue here nicole is will if you get sick will you actually have adequately trained people to care for you and and that's why we're playing with fire as a country that's why those people that are going home 50 million americans traveling if you have the opportunity to revisit your plans if you haven't traveled already it is not worth the risk fundamentally it is not worth the risk to get on a flight a plane uh train or automobile right now it is just not worth it because right now and i'll say this from my own personal experience and those i know of others that declines if you're asymptomatic with coping 19 or if you don't even know you have the disease these declines that happen that require icu care are unexpected they happen quickly and they often have mortal consequences here so none of us are spared it's its most deepest consequences here please cancel your plans if you've already made them dr gupta i want to ask you what people can do if they plan on even if they're not moving but they think they're going to maybe try to share a meal what should all those be outside should mass be born how do because i think everybody um i know everybody watching this show wants to be safe and wants to do the right thing but i think people really are confronting loneliness and sentimentality around the holidays and so i wonder if there's some middle ground where if you're having a small meal or have a neighbor that lives alone over how do you do that safely no nicole thank you for that that question here if you're going to have a meal with loved ones or say a couple outside neighbors for example do it first of all do the meal outside keep it to five or less individuals be socially distant around a heater what have you don't do it in an indoor tent i've seen people have heaters uh with an indoor tent around it it basically uh completely eliminates any any utility for being outside so have adequate ventilation keep it to five or less make sure you're all masked when you're not eating or drinking and then critically dis socially distant avoid at all costs any indoor gathering with anybody that's not in your direct household that's what we're really concerned about here so please don't do that for the college students out there people that are actually going home for thanksgiving and then going to stay put until maybe the spring semester i recognize that those individuals are going to hop on flights regardless of what i say because their college campuses are shutting down i've done this before i'll do this again please wear an eye shield one of these guys it's going to protect you especially in planes or if you're in the airport terminal wear at least a three-ply surgical mask so for those college students out there wear this guy once you get home to your loved one wear the three-ply surgical mask for at least seven days and then on the back this thing is constrained but try to get tested so that you can give yourself and your loved one some peace of mind here but mask for at least seven days eyeglasses or ice shield and a mask when you're in hey there i'm chris hayes from msnbc thanks for watching msnbc on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
