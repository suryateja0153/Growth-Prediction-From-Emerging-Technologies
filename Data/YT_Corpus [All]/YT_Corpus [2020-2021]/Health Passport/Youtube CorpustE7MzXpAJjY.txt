 what's going on everybody David here so the Democrats have a bill so they put it put together a bill it's 1800 pages it's a three trillion dollar bill so we're gonna take a look at it we're gonna see some of the key points I'm gonna talk mainly about the stimulus checks but we will talk about some of the other things as well but first off on this channel be talking about personal finance for travelers that sounds like something interesting to you please hit that subscribe button don't forget to the little bill notification so you can get future updates on my videos but I want to say this before we take a look at some of the key points of the bill this is just a bill that's in the house right now so it needs to be voted on in the house once they vote onto the house then they will send it over to the Senate and then the Senate will vote on it now the Senate can make changes if they want to make changes and then vote on a different bill then it will go back to the house so the house can see what the changes are and then make make a vote on it so this is the beginning stages so we're not and there's nothing that's been approved so the stuff that I'm gonna talk about right now it's still in the beginning stages but it's important for you to know that way if it goes to the Senate and some of the things have been taken out then you're gonna realize okay they didn't want this they didn't want that they didn't want this amount for the stimulus check they wanted less or they didn't want the stimulus check at all so it's important to kind of follow it through the whole process that's why it's important for you guys to subscribe to the channel because I'm gonna keep putting giving you guys all these updates when it comes to okay this is the bill that the house has this is the bill that the Senate wants and then then we'll just work it out and then it goes to the president and then the president has to sign off on it so I want to show you guys this let's go over the website real quick so we're looking at see CNBC and I'm not gonna go over the whole bill the bill is 1800 pages so it's easier just to go and look at a news article and pull up some of the key points now I'm gonna focus mainly on the stimulus check but I do want to touch on a few of these these key points here because so we're right now we'll skip the the stimulus check and then we're just going to talk about some of the other stuff so nearly 1 trillion and state and local government that's what they want to spend which I think I'm telling you I think that's a good thing we'll see where it goes when it comes to the Senate they've that this and the president have already said that there they're on board for some funding for state and local government they just don't want them to use this funding they want to use the funding for coronavirus related stuff they don't want them to use it for other things like bills that you know debt that they had prior to this that have nothing to do with coronavirus so one trillion dollars we'll see if that is a good amount when it comes to the cynicism I say oh that's too much or what-have-you so we'll have to see how that plays out and the second thing is the Stila sticks but like I said I'm gonna skip down and then we'll come back to that they also want two hundred billion for hazard pay for a social worker so they want to stick with this hero fund or are some type of funding for essential workers which i think is good and well i'm gonna go over some of this stuff i'll go over it in greater detail in later videos but i want to get the stimulus tech stuff out because that's what everybody really wants to know about but I think I think this hazardous paid would also be something that a lot of people will be interested in because there's a lot of essential workers out there right now that are working and they're gonna want to know how much they could get out of this this whole situation seventy five billion four corner virus testing so they are focused on the testing and the contact tracing they want to really start testing more and more people that way will have more confidence because that's what's going to come down to being confident to go back to work being confident to get out there as a consumer and go to restaurants and nightclubs and all that stuff you have to be confident so the way that you make people confident is you see that there's testing out there and they're not that many people that are new people that are contracting the virus and once we start seeing that I think people will be a little more open to doing things than normal activities and going to Disneyland and all that kind of stuff okay so let's move on here now the I put the I had put a highlight on these in yellow and then I put a highlight on these and more of a what is that pinkish color these are the things in the pinkish color these are the things that I don't think I don't think it's gonna it's going to pass the city and I think the Senate is going to make some real major changes when it comes to these so one of the things is $600 so the $600 per week the unemployment they want to extend that that will end July 31st so at the end of July that's when this ends so they want to extend it further I think they're the Republicans at least on the Senate side are not going to want to go for this the the focus is getting people back to work so if you're continuing to extend that unemployment then that's gonna hurt that process right most a lot of people are not going to want to go back to work or they might choose not to go back to work because they can stay on unemployment so I know the way that they set it up as if your employer calls you back and then you and then you refuse to come back to work then they can cancel your unemployment but that's a matter of them getting a hold of you and stuff so that's a whole different situation but extending that unemployment I think it's going to be real a real tough fight the only way I can see that happening is if if our numbers just continue to increase which might possibly happen and may if they increase even you could hire as far as unemployment then maybe that's something that they'll have to really think about because the numbers are just growing and growing and growing so that's the only way that I can see that that survives 175 billion in rent and mortgage utility assistance so this we'll have to see what they do with this this is this could be something that could could potentially pass but it's gonna depend on how how they negotiate that so and like I said some of this stuff I'll get in greater detail and I'll have all the all the facts for you but it's good I can't do that in one video so we want to focus mainly on stimulus check so let's move through some of these other things here so the Affordable Care Act subsidies for the Affordable Care Act so people who were working lost their job and they no longer have health coverage allowing them to have a special subsidy to to get the Affordable Care Act that the problem with that is you have Republicans that are adamantly against the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare so they that that's going to be a hard sell so the next thing here is more money for the SNAP program that's always going to be a tough sell I don't I don't see a lot of Republicans being on board it comes to that so I don't think that's gonna go anywhere okay and here ten billion dollars for emergency disaster assistance this might go somewhere this this grant might actually go somewhere it is for small business so I think there's a there's a good possibility that that will go somewhere but I put it I'm not exactly sure I need to look into it a little bit more to kind of know what's going on and and give you a better educated opinion when it comes to that the next thing here make voting easier for every vote by mail now we already know Trump is not really he's not really for that he's talked against it so that might be something that gets kids chopped off the the bill so we'll we'll have to see how they how they handle it and then the last thing here is the US Postal Service so the funding for the US Postal Service Trump has already said that he wants if that's gonna happen if they're gonna fund give the Postal Service more funding then they have to raise fees on companies like Amazon so that is that now let's get back up to the stimulus check so stimulus check $1,200 so that's what they're saying so it's gonna be pretty much just like the last stimulus checks will be $1,200 the the major difference is the dependence so it's gonna be 1,200 per person and then for dependents it's gonna be 1,200 per person or per dependent so you could potentially get and they say here's $6,000 so that goes up to three dependents so you can get 1200 for you 1200 for your spouse 1200 for one kid 1200 for another kid 1200 for another kid so that's pretty much the way to looking at so a family of five you're gonna get $6,000 which i think is I think it's good I mean if you have dependents that's where you make out when it comes to this whole set up however it's $1,200 again so how is that gonna play because this is your this is your proposal you're proposing $1,200 now this could be a really masterful play by the Democrats or could be a disaster because you put you set the bar at $1,200 the last time I was $1,200 I think most people would say $1200 is it's good but it's it's not enough for a month okay you can't pay your your mortgage or rent and buy food and everything with with $1,200 so I think if it goes any lower than that I think people will be really really upset and so that's one of those things where it could be it could be a good play the fact that you put in $1,200 it's probably gonna stay at $1,200 so we're not seeing anything the Democrats are saying anything about the monthly payments or anything like that just like I said I think one more check is probably the way they're going to go about it and then they'll look at it two or three months down the road and if they need to do some more relief then they'll they'll put another maybe another $1,200 in there at that point I'm thinking the fact that they put it at $1,200 they've already negotiated this out with with the white house and probably have talked to some of the senators as well so it's interesting that it's only $1,200 and I say only $1,200 you know $1,200 $1,200 but the fact that they didn't go a little bit higher to negotiate down is interesting maybe they could have started 1500 and then end up with 1,200 but yeah that's that's what we have here so I want to know you guys think though you think $1,200 is enough do you think it's that there should have been more maybe 2,000 or at least should the Democrats have gone higher and then tried to work their way down let me know down below if you like this video please give me a thumbs up please subscribe for more and I'll talk to you guys in the next one bye
