 hi I'm dr. battle of Mexico the medical futurist the last time we talked about how and when the copied nineteen pandemic will end and today I want to take it a step further and explore how life will change after we get through these trying times tag along life will never be the same crisis happened to push us on another path we have been having an enormous and blind trust towards the globalized world this is simply change after billions of people are under lockdown for weeks we will not be able to travel debt Philly or enjoy the supply chains of the verge so easily so sustainability solidarity and healthcare will finally take center stage that will be changed at every level of our lives maybe we should forget about handshakes forever maybe we will see people very masks everywhere and it will unintentionally keep our distance and be more cautious around or elderly you have it to the rise from properly washing your hands to a better overall hygiene and to entirely new travel habits first of all it's possible that while univ starts to recover the US will still yet to reach the peak the devastation of copied 19 will vary from country to country so our globalized world will remain closed down and it could become potential dangers when we travel to a foreign country airlines are fighting for survival as they are expected to lose almost 350 billion dollars this year so cheap air travel will not be back anytime soon but if the pandemic goes down on one of the worst scenarios you'll have to accept that our travel routines will change on an individual level - it will be the same when we had to accept airport security checks after 9/11 only this time around what if we would have to carry immunity passports to visit countries I know immunity passport has an interesting link to it but it's a very simple concept patients who have been infected with copy 19 produce antibodies specific to the virus and there are tests and development that can detect them these tests would show who has already been sick regardless of having had symptoms not and therefore who is probably immune enough to the virus to safely move around of course this will only be required if the pandemic goes on for many months even with current lockdown protocols then it would face an interesting word where a positive antibody test and a negative virus test would be a privilege - that allows people to reduce social distancing and travel again just a few days ago dubai-based airline Emirates has begun carrying out copy 19 block tests on passengers at the airport prior to flights this all leads to how are trusting the opportunities presented by the globalized world will be diminished seeing how virus can bring the entire world to the brink of collapse will surely take a toll on how we approach it perhaps it's the optimist in me but as we realize that our modern world should not be taken for granted we may finally understand that issues that seem far away can easily start a domino effect and decimate our lives the way one guy eating an undercooked bat can lead to toilet paper shortage in our local store we might finally realize how fossil fuel emmissions will make the planet inhabitable given enough time after all if you're tired of log downs just recognize this in most countries technically we can still go outside is just risky but if you let climate change get out of control in a few decades isolation will be the way of life not because it's risky to step outside but because of air pollution high temperatures and extreme weather it will be outright dangers or there will be no home to go back to self isolation and lock downs have already changed how we approach our jobs and the impact will be long lasting entire schools are online along with companies living their daily lives on zoom' and millions of people having business meetings with no pants on have you ever had a keynote like that someone has companies are forced to take noble approaches on how to keep things running and after we get through this they will have tons of information on how successful home office solutions are they will finally learn how many meetings could have been just an email it will definitely see a rise in remote working laughter it won't be necessary the office space is here to stay but perhaps companies will test the voters of three to four-day work weeks the way some Scandinavian companies already do giving more time to employees at home our reliance on home delivery will stay with us long after the pandemic ends - even if a vaccine makes coffee 19 obsolete how do you approach simple things like going to the shop will change forever we will try to keep limiting our exposure to risks and especially if you work from home contactless home delivery will remain the way to do it simply because it's safer and easier and all that will lead to more automation if this pandemic teaches us anything it's that our lives as it used to be is not sustainable for our planet now we only have to experiment with digital solutions it simply makes sense to make digital anything that's not more efficient in real life and to turn to AI to make supply chains and frankly entire industries more efficient for example I'm fully expecting AI to finally take a larger role in healthcare to make it more efficient we have been talking about this for over a decade but maybe this pandemic helped the message reach people's minds Healthcare desperately needs an upgrade in every term regarding its infrastructure its processes and technologies in the beginning of this pandemic it was an AI system that predicted a wuhan based coronavirus outbreak days before the first reports came in systems like that will be crucial tools for tracking and predicting outbreaks with apps already working to show us if we have been in places where a confirmed copy 19 person was I believe coming out of this pandemic we will have multiple apps on our phones to keep us informed about imminent outbreaks and to help us keep safe and away from harm's way but AI algorithms will help us with resource management - that's a huge issue in overloaded healthcare systems for example the AI system that predicted the wound outbreak accurately forecasted the virus's path for the following weeks - forecasting tools like that can help cities like New York prepare for a huge influx of infections before a first patient even walks through door frankly they shouldn't even have to go to hospital highly infectious but statistically speaking mostly my virus like coffee 19 clearly shows how important it is to think about healthcare differently I've been saying this for a long time the point of care has to switch from the hospitals to our homes or wherever the patient requires help this is going to be truer than ever going forward you shouldn't have to go to a hospital and be exposed unless you actually need hospitalization it was clearly demonstrated during the lockdown how a useful point of care devices can be Auto scopes digital stethoscopes portable ECGs and many more devices should swarm the market in the near future making the doctor patient visit happen only then unavoidable what I'm trying to say is that if there is any upside to the struggle that is covered 19 it's that it points out major flaws in healthcare systems and if you speed up the transition to a more efficient more modern system healthcare will finally come in to focus on the individual level and society we tend to neglect health care and prevention until the pain hits now hopefully our takeaway will be to invest in health care and appreciate and devoured our medical professionals because there is nothing more important to keep our word from falling apart than having a functional health care system because even in a peep copy 19 word overloaded emergency rooms and the general state of most health care systems worn down medical professionals resulting in a reduced quality of life for the medical community decreased levels of patient care and staggering levels of burnout after we get through this we can add PTSD to this list meaning that caregivers will require our help and attention it's now our time to care for them we also have to look at the top this pandemic clearly shows how leaders respond in time of a crisis and it helps us decide whose hands we want on the wheel because for decades now we have mostly been blessed with imminence but now we have a generation defining crisis and the only way to prevent the next one the to learn from the current one the old one of things to go back to business as usual but business as usual is partially what got us here in the first place instead of waiting for this to be over we shall now look at how we can get the most out of it together instead of wanting to go back to our old lives we should all focus on how to create a more resilient and more efficient world as the British screen says we will meet again but it's up to us to make sure on that day the vert will be in a better shape than how the coronavirus found it if you like this video I want to hear more about how digital health helps fight ko v19 subscribe below [Music]
