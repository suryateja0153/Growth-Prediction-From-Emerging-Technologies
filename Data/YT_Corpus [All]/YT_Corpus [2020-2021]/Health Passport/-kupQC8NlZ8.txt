 we begin this morning with the top story on everyone's mind the race for a covid vaccine we are even launching a special series this week we're covering every angle for you because it can't come soon enough i'm sure we all agree so here's what you need to know today is a critical day the cdc's vaccine advisory committee will meet to decide who should get vaccinated first with health care workers a top priority there are six promising vaccine candidates two are already under consideration by the fda for emergency authorization so once approved the military as we understand it is handling distribution and we do know the vaccine will be free but of course the big question this morning when will it all start how will it change our lives for that we turn to nbc medical contributor dr van gupta he's been treating covet patients really since the beginning of the pandemic and cnbc's senior health and science reporter meg terrell is also here good morning to both of you good morning dr gupta let me start with you as we mentioned the fda is now scrutinizing data on two possible vaccines how soon will we see a vaccine once they give their official stamp of approval good morning chanel we're expecting that hopefully about 20 million to 50 million doses depending on which vaccines get approved both get approved modern and pfizers in this calendar year might be available to americans by the end of this calendar year the point at which most americans will actually receive a vaccine will be eligible for it i suspect end of late spring so uh we're looking sometime in the march april time frame when most americans will start getting seeing access to it and then by the beginning of the summer season june into july hopefully anybody who wants vaccine can get a vaccine so dr gupta there's been this debate about who gets the vaccine first what what's the latest thinking on that al you know we're going to have greater clarity on that today with this advisory group that's really going to give guidance on that to the cdc but i suspect it's going to be those who are at high risk for exposure so healthcare workers frontline healthcare workers hopefully we broaden that definition so we can see the uh other essential frontline workers like teachers and grocery store clerks in that rubric there's many others and then also residents of congregate living facilities so nursing home facility workers and residents those are going to be i think the top two groups here that will receive the vaccine first meg let's bring you in here as someone who really knows the business of vaccines what can we realistically expect once the immunization process actually starts and i'm hearing there's talk about a vaccine passport what is that yeah so this is this kind of futuristic idea where we actually have a requirement to get a certificate of vaccination before we can do things so as dr gupto was talking about it's going to be a while before most of us can get a vaccine it's going to be the most high risk groups at the beginning because of limited supply and then folks like dr fauci are talking about spring and summer for everybody really being able to get access and so then what does life start to look like do we have to have that certificate of vaccination before getting on a cruise ship or getting on a plane for example experts i've talked with say that is a possibility but what about like going to concerts or going to a restaurant would you need a certificate of vaccination to do that that might be less likely but companies like ticketmaster are already thinking about ideas like that could they have a technology for example to link your concert ticket to proof that you've been vaccinated so these are the kinds of things that are getting talked about none of it is set in stone yet but experts are saying we should think about these things what life is going to be like with vaccines and they are warning that even as more of us get vaccinated we're still going to have to wear masks and socially distance for a lot of next year no surprise there i know you've been talking meg with a lot of experts have you talked to anybody about you know will we able be will we be able to choose which vaccine we get that's been a big question yeah so at the beginning probably not just because supply is going to be so limited it's going to be take what you can get whenever you can get it but if this turns into a vaccine we have to take every year like the flu shot or maybe every couple years by then there will probably be enough supply that like the flu shot there will be different options we can choose from for the flu shot there's a high dose version for people over 65 there's a nasal spray there are different options and you can actually call your pharmacy and make sure they've got the one you want before you go in so down the line we could see that for coveted vaccines but at the beginning it's going to be take what you can get dr gupta there was a kind of a what i thought was kind of a disturbing poll from the american association of nurses revealing that only 36 percent said that they would get vaccinated and i've got to imagine that extends out into the general population as and as we've heard it's not the vaccine it's vaccinations is is that going to be a problem going forward you know i suspect that once we have the data actually publicly available once this advisory group external experts levies their decisions and says that the vaccines are effective very effective in some cases and broadly safe that that that number is going to change you're going to see broader adoption i know all of us in healthcare clinicians public health experts are eager to see the data because we want a message on the data and say the data is is promising not only are we interested in getting the vaccine getting immunized but you should too to all americans out there so i do think that number is is subject to change al because everybody really wants this vaccine to work and meg i'm sure businesses just want to get back up and running the way they used to do you think they'll require employees to get covered vaccines so there is talk about that but it could be pretty complicated to do so here's the thing it's not illegal but there could be a lot of challenges to it we do know that you know things like the flu shot now especially for healthcare workers a lot of places do mandate an annual flu shot and other shots like the hepatitis b vaccine and of course for schools and day cares often vaccinations are mandated as well but there are always exemptions for medical or religious reasons and especially for a new vaccine like the coveted vaccine there could be more challenges but employers are talking about either considering mandating it or at least making it as easy as possible for their employees to get a vaccine perhaps by even having them on site if that's possible down the road definitely new territory for all of us make terrell dr vin gupta as always thank you for your time this morning it's a busy time thank you and stay with us here on nbc all week for more from our special series race for a vaccine you
