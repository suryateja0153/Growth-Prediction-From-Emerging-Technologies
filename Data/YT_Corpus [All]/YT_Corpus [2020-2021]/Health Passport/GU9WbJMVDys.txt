 [Reporter: Christine Birak] [Reporter] Some health experts are debating the idea of giving an immunity passport to those who've recovered from COVID-19. A document that could release people from physical isolation and return to their jobs. The question is would it work? [Doctor] There's at least a reasonable hope that people who get the infection and recover should be protected for a period of time but that's something that's gonna be looked at really closely. [Reporter] Personal trainer Chad Warren was knocked right off his feet by the virus in late March. Now he wants to know if he has immunity. I'm not one to sit around much so I'm looking forward to getting back to work for sure. [Reporter] Antibody testing uses droplets of blood to try and figure out who might be immune. If the test is sensitive and if the test is specific and those are big ifs because we know that some of these tests are not working as well as we'd like but if that test is working the way it should that will tell you you have antibodies to the virus. Which means you'll know if you had the virus or not. But experts say those rapid tests can't tell you how many antibodies your immune system made in response. And that's important because immunity often depends on having a high concentration of a specific antibody called IGG in your blood. Tonya Watts researches long-term immunity. We can't expect a large amount of the population to be immune for some time. So it's really a question of how do we judge when self-isolation ends? I don't think can be based on the immune passport yet. We're not completely sure of anything with this thing and it's all speculative because it hasn't been around that long. [Reporter] And scientists are moving quickly to find a key that can open the door on lockdowns as quickly and safely as possible. Christine Birak, CBC News, Toronto.
