 Interested in applying for a long-term 'Golden  visa' but not sure how to start the process?   Here is all you need to know about  it. The golden visa offers residency   for five or ten years, as opposed to  the standard two-year residence visa. Following the demand for longer residency  options in the UAE, the Federal Authority for   Identity and Citizenship launched a new website  allowing people to apply for a golden visa. The 10-year golden visa can be granted  to residents in the following categories:  PhD holders physicians Engineers in the fields of computer  engineering, electronics, programming,   electricity and biotechnology  Top achievers of accredited universities  in the country scoring 3.8 GPA and above. Holders of specialised degrees  in artificial intelligence,   big data, or epidemiology and viruses  High school top achievers in the  country along with their families. Investors investing at least Dh10 million  would also qualify for 10-year visas,   while entrepreneurs and special talents  would be entitled to five-year residency.
