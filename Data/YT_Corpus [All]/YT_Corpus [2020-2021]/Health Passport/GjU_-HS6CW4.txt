 good evening I'm Adrian Arsenal and I'm Andrew Chang tonight new coronavirus cases in Canada and some of them appear to have been infected here it is these community cases that give us some degree of concern and grief and Ottawa prepares to take action do everything we can to keep ensuring that Canadians are kept safe and Italy overwhelmed with coronavirus the situation is like a bomb that explodes hospitals so swamped with patients doctors are forced to choose who to treat I voted for Joe Biden sir Dayton a key race in Michigan can Joe Biden expand his lead she's about to be inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame now Jann Arden is really opening up about her family's struggles my brother was arrested for a first-degree murder in the same month that I was signed to a record deal and why this award means more than any other this is the National [Music] the pace of the corona virus outbreak in Canada is accelerating there are more infections in three provinces one new one in Ontario in Alberta cases doubled to 14 and in BC seven new cases to are especially concerning they appear to have been spread locally so in a moment we'll examine ottawa's planned response to the virus we'll take you to Italy or hospitals are struggling to keep up with the outbreak and will look at some of the drastic measures in places like New York or authorities are canceling school and calling in the National Guard but we begin with the concern in British Columbia Dina love green starts our coverage at the care home where Canada's first COBIT 19 death was recorded two more cases both health care workers they're both in isolation at home there's been a number of testing being done on people with symptoms health officials are still investigating how the virus made it into the care home and now two more cases of apparent community spread or under the microscope with these people are in isolation we know they're close contacts we can stop those chains of transmission so they don't continue in our communities there are more cases in BC now a total of 39 some positive news but of course some really challenging news for the families involved some have recovered including an 80 year old woman who is being cared for at the hospital but just across the border in Washington State more than 70 new cases in just one day so the number of people who are infected in an epidemic like this will double in the state of Washington unless we take some some real action here the virus has been detected at 10 different long-term care homes causing two more deaths new rules at Washington care homes have been put in place each patient is limited to one person or visit per day and every visitor will be screened for the virus alcohol scene is for living in care home setting they're more vulnerable there are worries the same kind of spread will happen here I'm concerned because that we know that homes is the home for many seniors in particular those who are more frail and you know and that number at this point I may even change further so it is a concern but with BC doing more testing officials are hopeful they'll stop the spread before things get out of hand Tina Lev Green CBC News Vancouver with the outbreak evolving in both Canada and abroad and with the economic impact spreading Ottawa has faced increasing calls for action David Cochrane has the latest on their plans going to be significant economic impacts for workers to this point the reassurances have been public but the details largely kept private we're gonna be talking very soon about measures that Canada is going to put forward to support people on the economic side it turns out very soon is Wednesday government sources say the Prime Minister will announce significant steps in Canada's response to kovat 19 it will include a boost to research funding to combat the virus and government's intention to waive the one-week waiting period for AI benefits for people who can't work because of the virus Canadians workers who need to self isolate to protect themselves and to protect their neighbors and while the province has run the hospital's Ottawa has the money and the financial means to respond so sources say Trudeau's announcement will outline ways to bolster health workers and provincial health systems whether it is any anticipated shortages that they might have for equipment or personal protective gear or even in terms of human resources you know additional supports that they might need and their hospitals or in their public health units these are the kinds of conversations were having the Prime Minister will also give a detailed account of what has been done behind the scenes to slow the viral spread and limit the economic contagion we're going to continue to act in ways recommended by the top experts by top medical professionals coordinate with other levels of government coordinate with the international community do everything we can to keep ensuring that Canadians are kept safe Trudeau's announcement will deal with the immediate pressures caused by kovat 19:00 there will be additional measures in the upcoming budget and more after that once the full impact of the corona virus is known David Cochrane CBC News Ottawa turning now to Italy a country locked down overwhelmed and increasingly desperate more than 10,000 people are now infected by far the most outside China more than 600 people have died and the latest death toll is also the highest in one day so far at 168 and as Rene Philip own explains doctors are now being forced to make some very hard choices covered head to toe and protective gear doctors work round the clock and compare the situation to a war zone at some hospitals emergency rooms and entire wards have been converted to intensive care units Italian doctors have warnings for countries like Canada your health system no matter how good how efficient how modern it is sooner or later will collapse because the number of patients is too high for the resources we have the situation is so bad one specialist told local media they are overwhelmed and are having to choose who to treat and in some cases older patients may not get the same level of care underscoring the crisis for a country with the second oldest population in the world a population most vulnerable to the virus the entire country is under lockdown no public gatherings no sporting events and no travel at train stations police are checking paperwork only those with authorized work or family reasons are allowed to travel CBC News met Canadian Kate Andrews in Milan last month at the beginning of the outbreak she is now under quarantine we're not worried about running out of food the neighbors are great there's people that are there to help us but it is a weird feeling being completely and in John the kindness of your neighbors in an attempt to control the spread Italian grocery stores are only allowing a few people in at a time and keeping shoppers a safe distance apart when I was paying they made sure that there was the the right distance between one person and another all of this has grave economic consequences in an effort to help Italians ride it out the government is considering suspending taxes mortgage payments and Bill's and will vote on those measures this week Renae Phillip Oney CBC News London so here now is dr. Tess lien in G you're an ER doctor from Humber River Hospital fresh off your shift so thank you for coming in we look at Italy's a wealthy country top tier medical system and yet it's overwhelmed so what is your er look like now so certainly we are seeing increased volumes we're seeing a lot more pressure on the emergency department system especially as people are coming in even just for screening if they've had travel history or contact and so we're starting to look at creative ways we can offset some of that volume in our emerge and in our hospital so that we can get to our sickest patients so that's gonna look like things like screening centers that are off site not in the hospital and you're gonna see I think an increasing number of those across the city and across the provinces and then we're also really talking about how do we get creative about creating capacity in a system that is already close to full capacity so we have surged mechanisms as we call them to get to that overage we see those in influenza times and now we're looking at that so how do we get creative about creating space and capacity within our system to see these patients and treat them so that means maybe putting off elective surgeries for example yeah that's a great question so you know what when we are talking about that when we need to create space we will do things like canceling elective procedures elective surgeries we can use virtual care mechanisms off-site screening things like that so what does Canada's medical system do you think actually need to stock up on at the moment yeah so when patients are coming in to the hospital requiring hospitalization because of Kovan 19:00 we're seeing a real spectrum in terms of what they need right from something just like supplemental oxygenation right up through an ICU bed and ventilation so we're really having conversations at the hospital level to look at what capacity have four ICU beds and four ventilators as an example and then what we really need to do is look at sharing right and so we do normally transport patients from hospital to hospital if we need to because one Hospital is at capacity one another isn't how do we do that safely and how do we do that when there's pressure on all of us as cases may continue to increase in number all the logistics are intense doctor named gee thanks very much my pleasure every day across North America we see more restrictions more cancellations more limitations on events and on travel as officials try to buy time Ellen Morrow looks at some of the more sweeping measures so far in this New York City suburb some of the strongest containment measures yet in the US schools closed large gatherings banned in New Rochelle home to most of the cases in New York State this is literally a matter of life and death that's not a overly rhetorical statement here's your grocery delivery in New Brunswick today one of the strongest measures in Canada any staff or students returning from international travel anywhere must stay home from school for two weeks this is a directive coming from government we expect people to comply with it because we live in a country that honors the rule of law this expert says banning some large events may make sense but officials need to strike the right balance I think you can definitely stimulate a lot of fear in people that were in a situation that might be worse than what we're actually experiencing right now there's been a domino effect with more coronavirus closures and cancellations every day Pearl Jam postponing its North American tour the popular Coachella Music Festival delayed until at least October wheel of fortune and jeopardy ditching their studio audiences and major US universities like Princeton and Harvard switching to online classes something this big that's just causing chaos around campus around the world it adds a lot of stress that stress spreading along with the virus but it's prudence not panic officials are urging this is a real problem but whether or not you should be fearful of of it you know I I don't find that a helpful response while Canadians wonder what cancellations and closures may be coming next officials are reminding everyone to wash your hands often and avoid touching your face Ellen Morrow CBC News Toronto 228 Canadians stranded by a corona virus outbreak aboard a cruise ship in California are now back in Canada so they've returned on a flight from Auckland and landed at the Canadian Forces Base in Trenton Ontario where they will be isolated for two weeks that base has become a rough and ready quarantine facility now for stranded passengers of two cruises and cruise ships have been singled out as especially at risk for spreading the virus Ottawa has warned Canadians that if you are planning a cruise skip it and stay on land Jonathan gatehouse explains why today is February 19 how dangerous was the corona virus outbreak aboard the diamond princess in February a new study modeling the on board epidemic reaches some sobering conclusions it started with a single passenger and quickly ballooned to a rate of infection four times that of Wuhan China left unchecked the study suggests the disease would have eventually touched 79 percent of those on board some 2,900 people however researchers also say that if everyone had been evacuated from the vessel when the first cases were discovered the outbreak could have been contained to just 2% or 76 people more than 600 people did get sick and seven have died the study concludes the key factor was the ship itself a floating petri dish where people from all over the world spend weeks and tight quarters putting their trust in the cleaning staff and everyone else's hand hygiene I would probably not advise anybody to go on a cruise for the foreseeable future until the situation settles down yet the cruise industry says that it's safe that they're initiating a bunch of new safeguards to make sure that everyone on board is healthy I mean that's a mixed message who should people believe at this point given what we've already seen in the last few weeks I think that it's a very difficult standard to meet some experts say the coronavirus crisis points to a need to reimagine the spaces where we work play and travel such as using materials that can better withstand vigorous cleaning if I told you that your cruise ship was going to have a vinyl headboard you might not think that sounds really luxurious but I assure you there are properties that we can put into vinyl now that allow it to be both comfortable luxurious and safe the cruise industry is trying to weather the storm making it easier to cancel and rebook while slashing prices the question is what will win out with consumers the lure of a bargain vacation or warnings from public health officials Jonathan gatehouse CBC News Toronto a day after the biggest US stock market plunged since 2008 and the worst drop in Canada in 30 years today markets made a partial recovery [Applause] [Music] the Red Cross rang the closing bell on Wall Street perhaps fitting for a market in medical distress the S&P and Dow both ping-pong before ending the day up nearly 5 percent it was the same story on the TSX but closer to 3 percent markets may have been responding to signals from the White House it will go away just stay calm we want to protect your shipping industry our cruise industry cruise ships we want to protect our airline industry very important because it's really working out a lot of good things are gonna happen Donald Trump is reportedly mulling over a broad array of measures including aid to Airlines support for paid sick leave and a huge cut to payroll taxes and as another major round of voting is underway in the race for the White House coronavirus concerns are making themselves felt both Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden have canceled rallies scheduled for tonight in Cleveland Ohio but still proceeding votes in Washington Idaho North Dakota Missouri Mississippi and Michigan that last one Michigan is the big prize with a hundred and twenty five delegates at stake so the outcome of that race has the power to determine the future of Bernie Sanders Ron Paul hunter is in Monroe Michigan tonight just south of Detroit oh yeah well Joe Biden seems to be doing it who'd have thought that just a couple of weeks ago tonight here in Michigan he's won it's a state rich in Delegates and in symbolism thank you could it be in the Democrats seemingly never-ending battle to find a challenger for Donald Trump that tonight they're finally honing in on it in Monroe City Michigan those we met were clear yes I voted for Joe Biden I voted for Joe Biden Biden why I feel he has the best chance to beat Trump for so many it's that simple to get back to normality it's painful for me to see what's going on in this country Nami Monroe a factory town southeast of Detroit is itself in the spotlight not least for its symbolism this county twice backed Barack Obama for the White House in 2016 it flipped and voted Trump Monroe also favored Bernie Sanders over Hillary Clinton as did all of Michigan but all of a sudden the landscapes changed I think we got to get Trump out and get a Democrat in and I think Biden has the best chance of doing it so all eyes are now on these voters Biden's been surging it's as if voters now know who it's going to be Joe mentum they call it Sanders who needs Michigan to reignite his campaign this week slammed Biden for being part of the so-called establishment does anybody really think that that is gonna be the campaign of excitement and energy that's gonna grow the base that we need to defeat Trump I don't think so I say that honestly is a friend of Joe's as for Biden he got cornered today when a factory worker accused him of plans to get too tough on hardening gun laws still it's not the kind of thing likely to put off voters dead set on getting rid of Trump even those who today voted Sanders underlined they'll back Biden if Biden takes on Trump I would vote for a celery stick you know she jokes Adrienne but that's underlining how Democrats see this election this isn't like other elections this is about one thing and one thing only the way they see it and it's getting Donald Trump out of office tonight in Michigan the key state of Michigan Democrats have said their guy to do that is Joe Biden all right Paul hunter in Monroe Michigan thanks Bob well today marks one year since the Ethiopian Airlines disaster and there's not a day that I don't think of her up next we return to the crash site and hear from the families of the Canadian victims plus a spot in Canada's Music Hall of Fame this is absolutely the biggest one why Jann Arden isn't showing any signs of slowing down ad later the end of the handshake who kind of been doing a little elbow bump how coronavirus fears are inspiring alternate greetings we're back into

villagers watched from a hillside my family was shattered Canadian Joan Vincent who lost her daughter Angela spoke and then shared with us we think constantly about the possibility so if what their life would have been about softening grief it doesn't hurt as much so even on the times that we we say their name now we don't maybe fall apart and yet and there's not a day that we don't think of her 18 Canadians died on this ground of the hundred and fifty seven from across the world families consider this place sacred ground the only things they have left of their loved ones a piece of clothing a passport came in boxes to their homes as late as October the government has buried small coffins here with remains that were too tiny to be identified so this is a special place clarice more struggled with her grief this week stuck on the date her daughter died it doesn't give me any comfort or anything but I just want to see it again the place where I know part of Danielle still here as

doing this she was a fighter and she she stood for justice and there's been a travesty here Chris Moore says the biggest question he still has is why Transport Canada didn't ground the Boeing 737 max eight four months earlier when there was another crash that one was also blamed on Boeing's flawed anti-stall system a House committee is holding public hearings into the Mac state but Moore says that doesn't go far enough he wants a full blown inquiry here's some of the other stories were watching across Canada tonight a six-year-old girl was seriously injured after a suspicious fall from a balcony this Toronto apartment building police say they received a call this afternoon and arrived to find the child and medical distress outside the building she was taken to hospital in serious but

ahead understanding your sick leave policies if your boss tells you to stay home you get paid but first it became my therapist and my friend and my solitude and my comfort my conversation with Jann Arden about her place and Canadian music and what leads her now welcome back after nearly three decades of heart-wrenching hits Jann Arden is cementing her place in the Canadian Music Hall of Fame she will be inducted Sunday night at the Juno Awards in Saskatoon so you might associate that sort of honor with someone at the end of an illustrious career but with Jann Arden you sort of get the feeling she's just charging faster and further ahead all the time we caught up at her home just outside Calgary long known for delivering devastatingly real songs Jann Arden is quickly becoming the hardest-working woman in show business she's the star of her own sitcom Jan but Arden isn't just diving into an acting career Jann Arden she also has a weekly podcast a new book a new album and an upcoming cross-country tour the headliner though the Sunday's Juno's and a ticket into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame the incomparable Jann Arden it's a big moment in a life of them but something or rather someone will be missing that night Jan's best friend her mom who died of Alzheimer's just over a year ago the grief still grips maybe always will and yet the humor and humility that make Jann Arden such a Canadian treasure still shine look at the geese you guys they're fun is so late to be going south you knuckleheads she's got a lot to say so we caught up at her home just outside count [Music] welcome to Jan's room thank you funny meeting you here yeah this is this your happy place when people talk about you know I need to go to my happy place I love getting out here and walking it is usually quiet you know we found Underpants along here I think I think this was it at one time a little bit of a lover's lane you know old country roads right so we since your mom has been gone so it's been about a year yeah she died December 19 December 29th 2019 thousand 18 2018 have you been managing you know I think I'm doing pretty good for the most part I mean I would do anything to have a weekend to hang out and you know have some food meet some potato chips and but no they were ready to go and my mom she left me with a sense of positivity it wasn't a bad thing so that's who I had as my my guiding light that led you well yeah they both did they'd be so proud of you now this Hall of Fame thing I think of all the awards you've gotten and I owe this thing but you know I have to say I was mind-boggled with the Order of Canada but I love the sentiment of the Order of Canada cuz it's about doing positive things for your country and I am a very proud Canadian okay so as much as I love that outdoors what do you mean what do you mean that northern winds gonna get by in just a little bit Terry oh girls I know let's go light a fire okay thank you oh my gosh it's deeper than you think it a little bit where's our snowshoes [Music] there you go well thank you for I mean thank you for letting us it's it's about - 12 - 13 yep I actually can't feel some of my parts but we're I'm okay with that for you it was it always going to be music that sort of set you free and set you on your path was that destined to be I don't know I mean I think I went into music because my dad was an alcoholic hmm and it seems like a weird thing but he was such a big drinker that in order for me to stay out of his way I went into the basement record player was down there all the records were down there my mom's little ol guitar sitting in the corner but she tried to learn to play and I became my therapist and my friend and my solitude and my comfort it I didn't recognize it at that time I was 10 or 11 years old but now that I get a chance to look back it's very clear of how music it transported me away from a very tumultuous family dynamic were you scared of him yeah I was scared of my dad we all were you could ask any of my brothers he was a fierce force to be reckoned with but I'm kinder about it as I you know he's been gone for years now four and a half years and alcoholism is a disease and I'm able to look at that now through my own eyes cuz I've had drinking problems myself my whole adult life but yeah scary scary guy how do you think after seeing that as a child alcohol seeped into your life I didn't want to I didn't want to be like that I'm not like my dad so much as a crime not a mean-spirited person did you like drinking I love drinking the fallout was terrifying I loved it and hate it ask anybody who's been a bender in their lives but you're completely sober now sober sober my mother's Alzheimer's helped me too because I couldn't be hungover and and look after her and I just knew I thought why am I doing this do you you know it's hard sometimes to reconcile is that there I feel like there are a couple Jan's so there's the Jan when I listen to your music and I you know I remember being in university and listening to your music and it was the salad where you think it was the soundtrack to so many heart of things that were going on in life right like it reminded you of some really tough stuff and that doesn't seem to to fit it doesn't crossover with with the sense of who you are I mean you're open and you're funny and you're positive and you know like part of a part of that is and it makes sense to me now was it was it was a form of therapy for me I was always a funny kid so I think when the stuff was happening with my family my older brother was in trouble he went down a different road than me and I just I had found music so I didn't want to be funny in the music but it was good for me to write down things that bothered me I did it without even knowing what I was doing I was secretly writing all these songs but it was almost like dear diary yeah for me it just had chords to it but there's an intersection as I understand it in your life where things are just getting great with your music and then they got really hard with your brother yeah in the same month yeah my brother was arrested for a first-degree murder in the same month that I was signed to a record deal so I often think about how my parents navigated that what happened with him he you know it was a litany of things he was sexually abused when he was a young teenager we didn't find that out until five or six years ago that he even spoke about it so my dad's you know a force of whatever he's doing and he picked Andre all the time Dre just drank and he said he would do any drug that he could find anything it started with you know duis and drug charges and assaults and choking with intent and I mean I could go on and on and on and I need to you know preface all of this by saying he's always client you know maintained his innocence with this murder charge and the innocence program at the University of British Columbia that's thousands of cases every year and they took him on a decade ago and are absolutely adamant in steadfast in telling our whole family that there's impossible that he committed this crime and I he's been there 27 years when my mom was in the throes or a disease I told her that he was out dizzy I said yeah he's in his apartment he's using all your doilies he is well he was such a homemaker and I was so glad that I lied to her about that how are you doing without her I really miss my mom but she just informs my every decision she was such a champion of mine like she just cheered me on my whole life and I wish she could have hung around like a little bit longer but been sane but I lost my mom my mom like ten years ago anyone that's gone through this realizes it's such a hard thing when they don't remember your childhood and they can't answer all your questions and I can't save you our parents are always supposed to save us and sometimes they you got to save them your new book called if I knew then yeah you knew what if I knew all of this if I knew if I could have told myself at 25 or 30 years old listen you got so much stuff to wade through but you're gonna come out of it the other side and who or what will be in your head in that moment at the Junos when you're inducted into the whole thing every single person that I ever met in my life that helped me or didn't help me and how valuable they both were sometimes it's all the people that aren't cheering you on that make you even more boundless thank you thank you cold but warm exactly same time after the break paid versus unpaid sick leaves what you should know about your workplace policies during this coronavirus I'll be right back with so much we don't know about the new coronavirus and the outbreak changing daily this message remains constant stay home from work if you're sick or were exposed but as Cameron Mackintosh tells us many Canadians can't afford that I made a lot during that quarantine at least Gary Lee you had time to perfect his cooking he's symptom free after 14 days of self isolation upon returning from vacation in China I have to be responsible for the community so that's why I'm stay home to do the quality he works in a federal lab turns out the isolation was unpaid and I was Awesomeness it kind of a ticket a sick leave this is know he's not the only one who's faced the question will your employer pay you turns out they don't have to in federally regulated industries employees are legally entitled up to three paid sick days among the provinces only Quebec legislates paid sick days at two for just about everyone else it comes down to agreements between employees and employers Winnipeg based power store furniture has deep ties to Italy and China all non-essential travel is canceled as for workers traveling on personal time they've been warned if they quarantine they may not be paid right now we have no other choice we have to try to be as cautious but as we possibly can as careful as we possibly can while some people can work from home many cannot like the service industry Fair Work advocates in Ontario are pushing for seven paid kovin sick days people have to make a decision as to whether or not they're gonna pay their rent put food on the table take care of their kids or stay home and not be paid the federal labor minister says it will be easier for quarantined and isolated workers to qualify for a I we have as you know as a government reduced the wait periods from two weeks to one week while it cost him in the end we use says he's still glad he did it you first spread out of the virus that would be very bad now for anyone planning to travel advise remains to watch for government advisories employers will likely use those to determine what kind of sickly to grant Cameron Mackintosh CBC News Winnipeg after the break searching for an alternative to single-use plastics what compostable doesn't always mean green that's next I'm Jamie puss Owen tomorrow on CBC's daily news podcast front burner Jason Kenney endorses federal conservative leadership candidate Aaron O'Toole we look at why Alberta's premier is taking sides and what it means for the party subscribe wherever you get your podcasts welcome back a federal ban on single-use plastics is coming and many businesses and consumers are already looking for alternatives but as to Shana Reed explains plant-based compostable plastics are not necessarily the greener choice they can be made out of corn or sugar cane cups cutlery and takeout containers designed to be tossed in the compost bin instead of the garbage here at this restaurant trade show in Toronto compostable plastic suppliers are at every turn certified compostable means the product has been lab tested and is proven to break down within three months in a commercial composting facility but certification is voluntary in Canada and that means some products labeled compostable might not be there's two things I think we need to work on first is getting stuff certified and second is making sure that for all compostable there are places where these can be composted while some institutions and commercial buildings have contracts with commercial composters most municipal curbside programs in Canada don't accept compostable plastics in green bins and they get sent to the landfill where conditions aren't typically suitable for compostable plastics this Ontario composting company is one of the few we found in Canada that processes compostable plastics a lot of these windows right now are pushing anywhere from 75 to 78 degrees Celsius the company was asked to test compostable products for the National Art Center it took one year of testing to find a product that met their standards okay so what do we see after one week so after one week you can see inside of here we've also got some traditional paper plates and things like that in here as well but here's what that green green cutlery looks like it's very fragile very breakable one of these other sets of forks that are in here no they're nice there's the knife it's not breaking down at all but that's marketed as a biodegradable product as we moved forward then a following week you can see the Green is breaking down very well again it's further just a crumble crumbles apart in your hand at this point that green cutlery is one of the products the National Art Center chose for their facility only three weeks into their eight-week compost cycle it's significantly broken down compared to the other compostable branded plastics finding the right compostable product and getting it to a facility that will process it are still big hurdles in Canada's complex waste management system to Shana Reed CBC News Kingston Ontario and here are some of the other stories making headlines tonight thousands of protesters were met with tear gas today in Venezuela as demonstrators rallied in what is expected to be the beginning of a series of escalating protests against the government of President Nicolas Maduro opposition leader Juan Y doe joined the March and led an impromptu session of the National Assembly Maduro supporters held their own separate rallies in downtown Caracas Russian President Vladimir Putin put forward political plans that would allow him to remain in power until 2036 he opened the door to constitutional changes that

second person ever to be cured of HIV has decided to go public with his identity 40 year-old Adam Castillo also known as the London patient has been free of the virus for more than two years now after stopping treatment he says he wants to be an ambassador of hope to the millions of people living with HIV Castillo received a bone-marrow transplant from an HIV resistant donor when we come back putting the handshake on hope Oh from politicians to everyday Canadians that's next thanks mom well because of the corona virus outbreak health officials have been suggesting that folks skip the handshake for a while and while not everybody's on board there are lots of people from politicians to everyday Canadians willing to get creative so we wanted to ask a few Canadians what they've come up with and that is our moment people are doing this in the air or do you do any elbow thing or they're doing like oh I'm not really shaking hands because I mean we have to be careful right in my office we've kind of been doing like a little elbow bump it's an old habit you reach out your hand when you're greeting somebody and you know if you see that they've gone Rock and you're still with the old paper I mean you just take it for what it is so we are doing namaste meetings all the time so yeah shake hands don't don't honestly think twice about it a lot of my friends and family are telling me not to it's just like I work in the business environment and that's kind of part of part of the day-to-day for the most part people I know I've been hugging them I don't know but I find some people also say ask before you approach I see everybody hitting Purell left right and center and once I see that then I'm more than willing to give my handshake with British courtesy would definitely shake your on see yeah so let me just say this I I understand all of the reasons why we ought not to be shaking hands with a scale back a little bit I'm kind of with the last guy though I still shake hands all the time but I just think I'd I wash them after that's that's maybe the best well so here's a little tip because it's all about not touching your face ultimately right so we learned from doctors a while ago that if you really want to know how many times you touch your face try for 10 minutes not putting your hands above your shoulders I promise you he's incredibly hard I believe you that is a national for March the 10th [Music] you [Music]
