 what's going on everybody David here today we're gonna talk about Trump's press conference you just had a press conference earlier today and is he interested in any direct pain if that's what we're gonna find out but first off on this channel we talked about personal finance and traveling on a budget that sounds like something interesting to you please hit that subscribe button don't forget to the little bell notification so you can get future updates on my videos okay so Trump earlier today he had a press conference and he was talking about he was asked the question actually a reporter asked him the question about direct payments are you good with direct payments and so I thought it was interesting his response we're gonna go over his response I'm actually gonna break it up into two little parts because he talks about the direct payments and then he also talks about transitions so I wanted I want to look into both of those things I think they're very very important when it comes down this whole situation so let's go ahead and take a look what are your thoughts about a second round of direct payments to Americans that's included in the the House Democratic bill well we're talking about that with a lot of different people I want to see a payroll tax cut I want to see various things that we want I want the workers to be taken care of but we are talking about that we're negotiating with the Democrats we'll see what happens so we see him say we're talking about that with many different people and then he then he goes to his demands so we're talking about the direct payments and this is what I want so in order for you to get this this is what I want now will he get everything that he wants you starts talking about the payroll tax cuts and and all that but what's really important here is that you see he's saying yes we're talking about it but this is what I want we're talking about it but this is what I want we're talking about with this home it so it's it will be a part of the package and I said this back if you look at my video back April 23rd I put out a video about the second stimulus check will we be getting it and I said there yes we will be getting a second stimulus check there's the the way that everything is set up right now with the elections and in the the crisis that we're going through right now they can't say no president Trump knows he cannot say no to a stimulus check so because he knows he can't say no to the stimulus check he's going to try to pull in some of this other stuff he has to play the role though that he's not really into it he's not against it but he's not really - it'll be one of those things that he'll just have to grin and bear it but the reality is he really wants it he really wants it and the fact is if he gets it now you can sign his name to another check send it out - to the American people right before an election and hopefully those people will remember oh yeah it's Trump that got me the money in even though it's Congress who votes on the bill and sends it to him and then he signs on it so it's the government that's actually sending you the money it's not him but not everyone knows that and some people think okay the cheque is coming directly from the president he's trying to help us out and so that's who I'm gonna vote for so he wants it but he can't say that he wants it too much it's like when you want a car you don't let the sales person know that you really really want that car you kind of you know you play it slow you say yeah you know I could use this I don't like this I don't like that but you know maybe I ought to deal with it to get the car but you have to bring the price down so it's all a part of the negotiation so he's already told us yes I am ok with the stimulus check and another thing about Trump is he never really said he was adamantly against it so we knew he was on board Trump is he wears his heart on his sleeve so any type of situation comes up he's going to tweet about it if he's upset with Direct Payments he's gonna tweet about it so this is one of those deals where he wanted it but he couldn't he couldn't just put it out there - to everyone because then he loses that leverage he can't use that as okay well I'll I'll be okay with stimulus checks I know Democrats want similar checks I'll be okay with similar checks if you let me get payroll tax cut if you let me get this you let me get that so that was just a part of his whole plan however the good part about this is the Senate so now the Senate the Senators some of the Republicans that were really against the stimulus checks on there are a few they can now look at this and say okay you know we can be on board the president is it's pretty much saying that we're negotiating it it is a part of the negotiation so we can be on board and we can kind of relax a little bit and kind of move forward with with this bill and try to get it get what we want out of the bill and then still allow the stimulus cheques to come in now I want to play the second part of this video but as I said it's a trend and it said this is really going to be in my opinion we'll see but I think it's gonna be something that's going to be very special it's a transition to greatness and greatness is next year right from the beginning I think we're going to do fantastically well I view the third quarter as I said as a transition quarter it could be pretty good but a transition quarter toward the end of the fourth quarter you're going to see some numbers that are going to be tremendous I think and next year you're going to have potentially the kind of numbers that you saw before and maybe even better because there is that pent-up demand that is you know a lot of people wanted to do things they were ready to do things and they've had to hold back because of the virus so I think you're gonna have with that pent up demand a phenomenal year next year unless somebody messes it up by coming along and raising taxes doubling tripling quadrupling your taxes like a certain party namely the Democrats want to do you'll mess it all up you know we had the greatest in the world I presided this administration presided over it it got great for a reason and we'll do it again and we'll do it again very quickly and very easily I see that happening though right here he's in campaign mode so he's talking about the transition what I thought was important is the third quarter so he's say in a transition in third quarter it might be great but we'll have to see and basically that right there shows you that one stimulus check is not enough maybe two similar checks it might be enough but you might even see more than that only because this transition period is going to last for a while so we're still going to be going through some tough times until usually he's basically saying until the fourth quarter it will start picking up which it probably will because of the holidays because of Christmas people are going to be spending spending a little bit more money I'm thinking I'm still thinking they want to control this and not just put out a bill that says okay you're gonna get $2,000 for the the first month and then $1,000 after that for every every month after that I still think that the Democrats are probably gonna fight for that but I still think it's gonna be one of those deals where you get one solid maybe $2,000 and then renegotiate for for more money and I know deal with it's kind of tough to do that but that there as we get closer and closer to the election it's gonna be harder and harder for politicians to say no to stimulus checks so you still have that leverage so even if you do one one more stimulus check for two thousand and then in a couple months you renegotiate for another whatever whatever amount so that might still work because you're getting close to an election and so people are not gonna want to go against giving the Americans money so we'll see I don't know if they're gonna do that monthly monthly things so I think it probably will be one one installment and then look at it in a couple months to see where we are when it comes to our financial situations and then move from there that's probably what will be agreed on but then you saw that he really went in a campaign mode after that and start just talking about the the Democrats want to raise your taxes and you know that's the common talking point so what he's saying is vote for me in November because next year we're gonna be doing really well and we don't want to have to raise taxes and I'm not going to raise taxes on you but the Democrats will raise taxes on you if we elect a Democrat for president and then we have a house run by Democrats and God knows we could have a Senate run by Democrats as well so that's pretty much what he's saying there he's just that's campaign mode if you do that then you're gonna your taxes are gonna get raised so that that that I just wanted to talk about that today I just put that out there now I already like I said back April 23rd I told you the president cannot say no to this and he knows that he can't say no to it but he is trying to negotiate and try to figure out the the best options the best things that he can put in there so people can get stimulus checks as well as some of the other things you saw he said having money for workers essential workers and things like that and that's always been a push to by the Democrats so you see they're working on things and I'm hoping that the house will be able to put something together and then get that voted on by the end of this week and then hopefully get it over to the Senate so the Senate can vote on it and get it to the president and that way in June hopefully in June we'll be able to start seeing something maybe some some more stimulus checks and we still need to talk about funding for state and local governments so I'm hoping that once this all goes through the money can go out to the state and local governments so they can take care of their their problems when it comes to the crisis and then people can get their stimulus checks and then everyone can start working on getting into that transition and getting us back to to the new normal and I'm gonna call it the new normal that we're not going back to the old way of doing things things are gonna change and I know people will say oh well you know once we have a vaccine that will be fine once we have a vaccine things are still gonna change because what about kovat 20 and KO fit 22 or whatever that we're always gonna be looking at this now because this has affected the whole world so you're always gonna see this in the back of your head you're always going to be thinking okay I need to plan for this kind of stuff because we didn't plan for it before so now we're going to be planning for it we're gonna have restaurants that look different we're gonna be flying in different ways we might even have airplanes in the future that look totally different when it comes to the seating arrangements so there's a lot of things that are gonna be changing when it comes to this whole thing and that's because of the situation that we're in right now so I want to know you guys think though please let me know down below if you watch this video let me know what you think do you think
