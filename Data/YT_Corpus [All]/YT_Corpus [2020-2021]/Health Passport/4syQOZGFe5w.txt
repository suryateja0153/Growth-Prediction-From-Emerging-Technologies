 we see states start to relax stay-at-home orders and increase antibody testing the w-h-o is issuing a warning about using that testing to issue what's been called immunity passports 9 health expert dr. Powell Coley joins us right now to go over this good morning dr. Coley so first of all what is immunity passport and why would we want to issue one as the cases in the United States approach a million experts like dr. Falchi have actually said that this could be a real possibility and essentially what it is is documentation that you've had the infection that you have antibody tests and that you can presumably go back to work or relax social distancing what's the risk with an immunity passport so it makes a ton of assumptions the first assumption is that the test is accurate that you're actually getting the right result the second assumption is that the antibody actually gives you immunity which we know for a fact may not actually happen firstly you may not have the right type of antibody you need something called a neutralizing antibody second you may not have the right number of antibodies you need a threshold to really have immunity and the third we don't know how long the immunity lasts so you can imagine if you issue this passport allow these people to go back to work and potentially relax social distancing this could actually increase risk not just to them but to those that they come into contact with and in places like New York where 21% of people are testing positive in the city for the antibody this could have real implications for causing potentially another surge when people are not immune and so for this reason the WH o is actually issued a warning but having the antibody does not necessarily mean you have immunity because we have no scientific evidence and that yet yeah so much is still premature you know what do we know about immunity to Cove in 19 so far yeah so very new virus with only four to five months of data so we really have very limited knowledge we do know a few things however there was a small study that told us that about 70 percent of people actually mount a robust or strong antibody response in response to the buyer infection 25% mount a weak response and about five to six percent have no appreciable antibody response and after they get the infection we also know a little bit about the duration not so much based on this current virus but based on cousin viruses like other corona viruses and the Tsar's and the MERS virus so with other corona viruses that cause the cold we know that the antibodies can last about a year with the SARS virus we saw that it was about two years before they start to wane or go down and with MERS we thought it was about three years so putting all that together we do believe just like dr. Falchi says that the antibodies do confer some degree of protection but as you can imagine issuing people immunity immunity passports that allows them to kind of freely mingle if we're not entirely convinced that they're fully protected could really cause a huge surge yeah can be dangerous all right dr. Coley thank you so much for breaking that down
