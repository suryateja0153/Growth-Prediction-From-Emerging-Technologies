 hi everyone welcome to our presentation of espresso an entropy and shape every time series segmentation for processing heterogeneous sensor data i am shorter than daddy from rmit university today we are surrounded by a huge number of sensors collecting multivariate time series data constantly they can be used for different applications such as medical purposes human activity recognition tasks smart home electricity distribution planning and so on annotation and extracting meaningful segments from this huge amount of data is challenging expensive and sometimes infeasible that's why self-supervised and unsupervised methods are a hot topic these days segmentation will help us to extract meaningful parts from unlabeled data and make it ready for further processing we define time series segmentation as a change point detection technique which looks for changes in properties of the given time series to find the most homogeneous segments that can represent a specific state of the system existing methods can be categorized based on the features they consider to detect changes the statistical differences between time intervals have commonly been measured in many parametric and non-parametric methods some of these methods are based on assumptions on the distribution of data while others try to calculate the relative ratio of distributions of subsequent segments or focus on this information gain of segments or the dependency and correlation between segments the other category of segmentation techniques focuses on the temporal pattern and shape based features each of the mentioned methods is applicable to only one type of data sets for example shape based methods can detect changes in signals with repeating patterns while the statistical methods are able to detect sudden changes in the statistical features or distribution of adjacent segments but not gradual changes however input data can be any combination of these characteristics according to these characteristics we categorized the input data into four different types and chose seven multivariate data sets covering different types of categories we showed that our method is applicable across different types of inputs we proposed a hybrid approach and combine shape-based and statistical characteristics to make espresso applicable to a wide range of data sets first we extract the most similar patterns using matrix profile then as an enhancement to flaws as a shape-based segmentation method we find the chain of similar patterns for each subsequence based on the euclidean distance as the similarity measure the dotted arcs here show the newly added pairs in the chain next we assign a weight to each extracted pair of similar patterns based on the similarity measure and temporal distance in this picture each arc shows a pair of more similar patterns the thicker arcs show higher similarity and lower temporal distance the main idea here is that repeated patterns relate to the same class of segments and hence occur within close temporal proximity therefore we wouldn't expect to see many arcs crossing the segment boundaries time steps with less density of crossing arcs will be selected as segment boundary candidates we borrowed the idea of information gain segmentation from igts however instead of dynamic programming we use a greedy search across extracted segment boundaries to find the segment with the minimum entropy at each step we select the boundary candidates which minimize the given entropy function we compared our purpose method against four other baselines across seven multivariate data sets with different size dimensionality sensor type and applications and evaluated the result using three metrics first of all we showed that the performance of our method is less dependent on the only input parameter which is the length of subsequence here we compare sensitivity of espresso and each of the benchmarks across paymap and hand gesture data set this table shows the average value of rmse and fscore across a range of subsequence and subjects within each data set we also compared the effectiveness of each method according to the category of input here you can see flaws as a shape-based method cannot capture segments in dataset which contains not repeating patterns on the other hand statistic-based methods do not perform very well in continuous data sets with gradual changes but especially outperforms all other methods in all types of input data no matter the data include continuous changes or repeated patterns an additional study is performed to investigate the contribution of both the temporal shape and entropy based components of espresso individually across different types of time series to conclude we highlight the main contribution of our work espresso integrates temporal shape and entropy based properties of multi-dimensional time series this hybrid method enables espresso to be applicable across broad range of inputs espresso only depends on one parameter which can be selected with minimal risk an embedded channel ranking has been utilized in espresso to make segmentation more robust to noisy or 11 irrelevant channels we also explored two real world case studies to about work routine deviation and changes in emotions thank you for watching this video
