 have you ever wondered what the difference between AI and machine learning is exactly well if you have you're not alone in this video I'll be discussing those differences so that you're good to go moving forward all right before we describe the differences between AI machine learning but sure to subscribe to this channel because there's a lot more videos on the way in the last video we talked about what AI is and what AI isn't and we said that AI is essentially intelligence exhibited by machines meaning the learning understanding and using the knowledge learned to carry out one or more tasks or goals so something like a prediction or recommendation in this case the learning part is machine learning and you could consider it to be a subset of AI and you may have come across a lot of different definitions of machine learning we'll talk about some of my preferred definitions now so in this case a non-technical definition that I like to give for machine learning is that machine learning is the ability to automatically learn from data without requiring any explicit programming or any explicit domain expertise and in fact that's what gives machine learning it's magic or its secret sauce the learning is performed by different algorithms that fall under the machine learning umbrella algorithms you may have heard of like decision trees or neural networks or regression now another more technical definition of machine learning that you may have come across is that machine learning is all about learning a target or mapping function that map's input variables to output variables kind of like an equation does now in this case we're going to talk more about the non technical definition machine learning but of course put some comments below of any other definitions of machine learning that you've come across or ways you think of it now I'm oversimplifying here but the idea behind machine learning is basically you could take a machine learning algorithm handed some data that's specific to a specific domain say healthcare and then that machine learning algorithm can automatically learn without any explicit programming all the underlying relationships patterns correlations and so on that exists within the data so that it can do something like let's say make a prediction a machine learning the idea of learning from experience which you may have also heard of it's just the idea of continuously learning and improving your machine learning models over time with new data you know things change over time like due to regulations or the environment or different trends and so the underlying data change tends to change with it and without this sort of feedback loop that people tend to create to constantly take new data and retrain models and make sure they stay fresh you can wind up with what's called model drift or stale models so again AI is simply intelligence exhibited by machines and machine learning is the process by which machines learn from data in order to be able to do things like make predictions or recommendations I hope this was helpful and if you want to learn more about AI and machine learning be sure to subscribe to my newsletter get chapter one for free from my book subscribe to this channel if you haven't already and check out our other videos also if you like this video be sure to like it by clicking the like button and share it with people you know and thanks again for stopping by and I'll see you in the next video
