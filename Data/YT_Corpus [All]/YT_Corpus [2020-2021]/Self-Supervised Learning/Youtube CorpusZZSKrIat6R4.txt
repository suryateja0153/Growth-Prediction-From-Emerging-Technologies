 this is already and today i'll present towards the clustering of human activities from variables in this study we consider the problem of deep clustering with variable sensors where the goal is to develop a deep neural network that consumes raw unlabeled statements and generates claustral assignments in the outputs to tackle the problem we propose a two-stage deep clustering framework which includes free training and multitask author encoding first stage and representation refinement with a clustering objective in the second stage this is a visualization of our multi-task recurrent auto encoder it is composed of a recurrent encoder which sequentially processes the input and learns a lower dimensional embedding as well as a decoder network that takes the lower dimensional embedding and accomplishes two different self-supervised tasks reconstruction as well as future prediction these tasks together motivate the network to extract discriminative features that are not only essential to reproduce the input but also to extrapolate its future the entire network is then trained end to end by minimizing the corresponding loss functions with respect to the ground rule this concludes the first stage of our framework in the second stage we add a clustering network that is trained with cluster assignment hardening we assign we start with an initial estimate of the cluster centers omega next we adopt a student distribution to generate soft cluster assignments q this essentially uses the similarities between sensor segment representations and the cluster centers as a kernel to compute soft cluster assignments we then define a target distribution p by square by squaring the q values and normalizing them this allows high confidence assignments to guide the training process we iteratively minimize the clustering loss which is the divergence between the output and the target distributions to purify the cost for assignments the whole framework composed of the encoder decoder and the clustering network is then trained end-to-end with the aggregated loss function in order to evaluate the proposed method we experiment on diverse data sets and present comparison with classical clustering algorithms as well as state-of-the-art deep clustering method originally proposed for static image data sets the comparison results are provided in this table we report performance of clustering methods on the raw input data space the auto encoding space as well as the end-to-end cluster assignments it is evident that our method outperforms not only the traditional clustering methods but also the deep clustering baselines on the three higher benchmark datasets this highlights the effectiveness of our framework and the necessity of incorporating recurring structures in the architecture design to scatter for the sequential nature of the sequences finally we observe that two stages involved in our framework evolve the feature space from data space towards a clustering oriented space creating semantically meaningful groups of activities in conclusion in this problem we tackled an unexplored problem of end-to-end clustering of raw variable sequences with a deep neural network we demonstrated the effectiveness of our pro-cause approach across three different data sets and in the future we will investigate extension of the framework with new clustering objectives and more rigorous experimentation of unsupervised land features thank you very much
