 hi michelle could we talk again about the corona crisis specifically the quarantine sure as you can see i still have a face mask it turns out that what you write in discipline and punish reminds me a lot of what we experience right now above all i'm referring here to your notion of the city as an enclosed segmented space observed at every point in which the individuals are inserted in a fixed place in which the slightest movements are supervised and all events are recorded it's true the use of the quarantine model is not restricted to the 17th century in the second half of the 18th century it reemerged and was extended with the birth of urban medicine in france the political power of urban medicine consisted in distributing individuals side by side isolating them individualizing them observing them one by one monitoring their state of health checking to see whether they were still alive or had died and in this way maintaining society in a compartmentalized space that was closely watched and controlled by means of a painstaking record of all the events that occurred it seems this kind of medicine comes very much to the foreground these days in part in digital disguise what i'm interested in specifically is the conjunction of isolation and individualization in other words what is the coronal crisis doing to us subjects in a certain sense the very concept of quarantine speaks to this conjunction as you might recall the concept alludes to the fact that jesus after being baptized spent 30 days in the desert for meditation and prayer now the latin word for 40 is quadra ginta and the italian word is quaranta hence the english currantin perhaps you also recall that during his time in the desert jesus was heavily tempted which brings us back to our conversation about flo bear and saint anthony who was also living alone in the desert and subjected to all kinds of temptations however i don't see how this links up over the issue of individualization well it does on the one end the temptations themselves constitute a form of subjectivation they are something like the personal madness of this lonely monk on the other hand the example of saint anthony can serve us to understand what the technologies of the selves are all about since it is only through specific practices and exercises that you finally turn yourself into an individual i don't see any connection between saint anthony and the technologies of the self don't forget that he is also called the father of all monks and keep in mind that the technologies of the self are about abstinences memorizations self examinations meditations and so on but also about self-writing the letter for example helps against the dangers of solitude it exposes what one has done or thought to a possible gaze i guess i know what you mean but can we please stop writing and reading corona diaries i'm simply fed up with them i must also say that you went a little too fast jumping as it were from the early to the late for quote for the time being let's stick with discipline and punish you are perhaps alluding to saint anthony when you talk about the cell as a technique of christian monarchism and mention the monastic model that was adapted in the subsequent institutions for example schools military barracks and prisons i think i get this also when you add the disciplinary space is always basically cellular that precisely is what we live right now our apartments are transformed into cells but that has nothing to do with the care of this health or some aesthetics of existence or has it well yes in certain ways at this point you perhaps underestimate my sense of humor don't forget that at least in your language cell and self are pretty close and this then would fit with the fact that according to phlebes and anthony eventually just wants to be transformed back into a biological self are you going way too fast michelle i'm still with discipline and punish where you argue that the production of individuality is part of the disciplinary regime i can see that isolating the convicts from the external world and from one another is a positive instrument of a form of conversion what i don't see is the aesthetics in this well it's the same as with freedom the point really is that per se the individual or the subject is neither good nor bad all i'm saying is that the self is not simply given it is produced in a cell no matter if you take this to be an architectural structure or a biological form and no matter if you are a criminal or a saint okay okay then just let's say subjectivity and power are closely tied to one another but please don't give me the cliche that the corona crisis is a great opportunity for self-reflection personal insights meditation and so on the technologies of the self have nothing to do with the return of some golden past they are instruments of production and transformation they are directed towards the future and they operate against resistances which implies constant struggles here is what i say about these technologies in my lecture at the goles de france i quote we must train like an athlete the letter does not learn every possible move he does not try to perform pointless feats he practices a few movements that are necessary for him to triumph over his opponents in the fight and of course well perhaps this is useful for you guys it truly is and i know how the quotation continues like a good wrestler we should learn only what will enable us to resist possible events we must learn to let ourselves be disconcerted by them not to let ourselves be carried away by the emotions they may arouse in us thank you michelle you're welcome and take good care of yourself
