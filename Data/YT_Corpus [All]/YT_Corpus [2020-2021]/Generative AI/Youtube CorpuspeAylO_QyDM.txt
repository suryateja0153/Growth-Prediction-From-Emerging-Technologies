 Assalamualaikum and Greetings In the previous video, We look at Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its applications How powerful the evolution of AI is I think I want to make several videos on how the evolution of digital technology such as AI, automation will impact the labor market If we look at AI, we need to divide it into two stages First is the AI before the existence of super intelligence and after its existence, the AI after singularity So, I will focus on the AI before singularity We'll project based on it How do AI and automation change our future jobs? When we talk about future, it's now till the next 30 years, right Singularity is estimated to be around in 2040 or 2050 So we are talking about things that will happen 30 years from now For this video, I want to talk about it as a whole In general For the upcoming videos, I'll share the examples and the preparation that we need to do For those who follow my videos What do we understand? What will happen based on digital technology and AI? I think many of us have understood that first, repetitive and simple jobs will change to application due to digital transformation These things have been replaced and we can see them clearly now Second, by having AI and big data the data that are collected from people or Internet of Things (IoT), the sensors, right We have lots of data and we can't process them That's why we have AI AI can replicate our intelligence Our ability to object, to understand languages I think it's normal if everyone is worried about this, right? What will happen to our future, right? Can we secure jobs? Because our jobs will be replaced by robots and AI What will human do? Experts in this area are in dispute about this One says yes and another says no If we think about it on a macro level or in a scheme If robots and AI take over our jobs and we'll be less involved in the industry What will happen? If we look at this diagram, Those who say no said that this thing has happened since early 1920s, 1930s and 1940s Automation was there Previously when Industry 1.0 started, we need people We have different types of jobs We have workers to press the elevator button In the United States We have varieties of jobs The transition of Industry 1.0 to Industry 2.0 and Industry 3.0 resulted in job losses We don't have the worker in charge for the elevator anymore However, many new jobs are also created due to the transition of Industry 2.0 and Industry 3.0 Now, we are in Industry 4.0 Experts in economics say that the same thing will happen When we have a new industry, technological changes or innovation We'll have three abrupt changes Firstly, technological changes will create new job opportunities Like what we have now, AI, Big Data It creates new tech job opportunities If we look at one of MDEC postings, it states the number of jobs that will be created There will be a shift toward technology Secondly, by having technology, it will increase the productivity level and decrease cost What will happen when the cost is reduced? People can buy and consume other services and other things When there is no job, people need to do other things Their time is filled with other things These things will create services and jobs Thirdly, when cost is reduced companies can invest in other areas That means, they can expand their business for new services This will create new job opportunities for people These three factors will compensate the previous job losses If we look at the previous Industrial Revolution, it occured for 100 to 200 years Some people say no about this We'll have jobs The easiest example would be Facebook, right? How do we spend our time when there was no Facebook? Today, we create contents to impress people It is similar with TikTok How our time is spent behind the jobs It can generate income for those who went viral Technological changes will bring us to a different paradigm But we have problems for those who say yes When this thing happens, it won't happen simultaneously That means, we'll have a time gap In this diagram, we have time gap, skill gap, and geographical gap If we look at the long term, in 30 years time all over the world It will move in that direction But if we look at it carefully, if we look at our country's level Will this thing obtain an immediate positive impact? I don't think so If we look at the productivity level in the United States It gradually increases over the years But if we look at its productivity growth, it goes down since 2015 If we have advanced technology, why does the productivity drop? Perhaps when automation began, people has stopped working Productivity is being replaced by other thing So we can't use the former definition of productivity The biggest problem toward digital transformation is on wealth distribution Wealth will be accumulated at the top 1% and there's not much change for the low income It is static Although wealth increases, the top income people gain more profits the low income people will remain the same or suffer That's why if we look at Europe or the United States, there are many discussions on basic income When we have too many AI or automation and it is said that it will disrupt 47% of the job market People will have no jobs So we need to provide income to them In Alaska, the government gives oil premium to its citizens around $1200 if I'm not mistaken We need to have that kind of policy Or else, we can't help the situation Imagine the factory workers, that kind of labor will be excluded This will abruptly change the economic structure If we think about this problem on a macro-level It's not a problem whether we have jobs or not We'll have jobs, but the low-income jobs There will be two groups One group will receive extremely high income and another group with low income In the last 40 to 50 years economic model of developed nations, In order to reduce costs, they'll keep moving If we look at Japan, they came to Malaysia after Plaza Accord when their currency went up, they had to leave Japan They came to ASEAN, with cheap labors to sustain their business and bring the products to their country With cheap labors, low investment and logistics cost, their production cost is still lower than in their country The problem is when we don't need the labor cost in production, There is less labor cost dependency Because we can use robots Factory managers just make report and collect data Simple works can be replaced by AI This will change the fundamental cost in services or products What will happen? Let's think about this Although the economic experts say no about this where we'll have jobs Practically, in 30 years time I think many countries will suffer due to technological advancement including our country In terms of digital economy, most of the definitions are narrow like online shopping, content creation and virtual reality (VR) The technology like Microsoft and Google came in But these won't help our local economy in the long run In fact, we are helping the monopoly of the giant companies Like I said, most of the profits concentrate on the top level Facebook and Google generate 50% of the world advertising revenue Amazon has controlled more than 40% of cloud computing and bandwidth These giant companies accumulate wealth, asset and profit Where will we work? Because as humans we'll live at a certain period We need to do jobs where the ROI is not worth it People will invest for machines and AI to replace repetitive jobs so that they can increase 20 times of their productivity Thus, we are left with high income jobs where AI can't do them For instance, creation and low level jobs that are not worthy of investing That means we'll be paid lower The sad and tricky part is for those in the middle layer We can see that data scientiest and IR 4.0 are booming, right IoT is booming We are in need of programmers and AI planners But will this remain in the long run? Sooner or later Like I said about GPT-3 web programming will be replaced by AI Designers can instantly get the web from their designs It applies to program like Python, C language These things can be done by AI in less than 10 years What will happen to people in this profession? Like I said we need to survive with new jobs for the long term For short term, in 10, 20 or 30 years many countries will suffer especially with a large population and those normally outsource to other countries The United State or Europe source from China as well as Japan These countries will bring in sources to their countries or they might open automation factories outside their countries and bring in cheaper materials They don't really support the workers in the country If we exclude countries with resources from agriculture or rare metals that are better processed in the country We'll see a trend where people will return to their own country or in automation The countries that invest at a later time in automation or AI will be left behind in terms of cost Developed nations can produce things at a lower cost and we have to buy from them As a businessman, if things are profitable, we can't just stay still This will create an unfavourable spiral In this video, I talk about this on a macro level In the next video, we'll see some patterns on how digital transformation alters our jobs We'll meet in the upcoming video Assalamualaikum and Greetings
