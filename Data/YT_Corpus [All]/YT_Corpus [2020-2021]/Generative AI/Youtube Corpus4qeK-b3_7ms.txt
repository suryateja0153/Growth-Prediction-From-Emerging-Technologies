 [Music] this was a long road to be honest man to be tried a lot of different things we need to focus on performance and training this is a horrorcore vital focus on how we can innovate and design and develop shoes peril accessories we saw a need where a heavy weight lifting was using a certain type of shoe and we also saw the CrossFit you know were they using some sort of agile flexible training shoe but the challenges the athlete would use two different chutes they would switch them out what we do is combine that together this was the first 3d printed training launch to market we allowed two interlaced structures within each other and they had a nice build and can motion so it actually allowed for an urgent return which was really fascinating I'm passion about making things go from a napkin sketch to the product on the shelf the architect actually was inspired by two things man-made objects and natural organic shapes [Music] with 3d printing we could really innovate the future of footwear technology the general design plays a crucial role in design process to create lightweight structures and reduce weights and parts there's a lot of opportunity for that we were able to try out numerous patterns and numerous may sink of the structures to allow us to test and validate it really comes down to a correlation between simulation and mechanical testing we had over 80 athletes where the shoe had tested at over 120 hours just in that gelatin this is our first reading print shoe we've created a compelling performance training shoe hit that athlete make them foam that much better [Music]
