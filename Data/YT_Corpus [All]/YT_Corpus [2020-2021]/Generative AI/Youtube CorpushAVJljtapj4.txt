 they escaped over the wall I should like not killed unless you just let them run free Oh Oh we got a runner yeah where is he going I don't what's even targeting hey welcome to another episode of chaos craft I'm Matt was grammatical and today we're gonna be working on building stuff it's a lot of fun I talked about this a little bit last week I actually ended up with a ton of good footage on this one so it's just gonna be one segment of basically the boss building stuff it's pretty exciting before I forget our streaming schedule change I'm no longer streaming on Fridays it'll be noon eastern US time it's New York time on Tuesdays and Thursdays so feel free to join us I think Tuesday's probably a little more def heavy and Thursday I'm gonna have a nice clean showcase I'm gonna try have a nice clean showcase ready for you guys each week if you guys like neural nuts minecraft AI learning crazy inventions hit that subscribe button maybe a like button give it a share have you really interested help support us on patreon without further ado here's the bots building stuff how's it going got the clustering stuff all working this is really boring to observe this it's tough observing that okay here we go check out all the pretty colors Wow this you know what this means they must have jumped block place to get up there there's no one's on the street oh god that's amazing their jump block place him and he's trying to attack me okay wow that we just kicked this thing off strong and there's nobody on right now theoretically look at this what they're trying to escape I know is on the livestream this is insanity how wide okay I need to like lure people in here this is nuts look at this wing I almost escaped and there's no one on here look at this guy and he's dead okay I'm gonna clean up these cuz they're clearly unhooked blocks well they're doing jump placing I think did you jump you just kind of placed are they jump placing look at that they're just kind of like shooting themselves up okay that may be a bug I gotta work on well these guys are trying to escape this is interesting aww oh he's almost got out of there but he doesn't care he doesn't want to leave they died okay and they are building like crazy there there there they've developed a form of block jumping like literally in the last ten minutes where they don't actually jump it appears they just somehow use the block to shoot themselves up slightly that something's not got a colorful line around it I need to destroy it because that's from a previous reset they almost escaped they just didn't seem to have the ambition to leave they like built a bridge kind of so yeah see they're not really jumping they just kind of place it or else it's a very strategic jump but there's not really raw output so it's unlikely that that's the case yeah he's just kind of propelling himself upwards we're trying to get him to build patterns and so I reward them for building patterns of blocks basically he just kind of shoots himself up they're there all night so this is this guy's neural nut okay so we want to find an IC IT yeah his target candidate type keep a good M on screen is freaking me out [Music] no no don't pick up the spawn block that would be that would be unique yeah they're they're digging more to right now which is interesting oh I got you buddy no I don't got you okay I got you though this is interesting you so they can now this guy's got quite a quite a bit going on here that position the relative position neuron has taken over cuz there's three to the third power 27 options for every single block that they discovered how did they observe lava lava that's weird that they could see lava well let's check out what they're observed attribute are because they are evidently observing a bunch of stuff all right so we're gonna refresh this again I need to make an interface for this so the reason we're using the code inspectors because I haven't made an interface for this yet it's on my list of things to do but see what blocks they've seen before coal or stone obsidian crafting table oak log iron or brass chain block oak sign so they've got they could they have all this stuff barrier bedrock wall torch cobblestone I got all the stuff to that they can basically use right away I don't know how they observe the lava though I was pretty far away redstone wire where do we oh yeah we probably have that for a command block and that yeah ever it's the man they so they can actually see when they scan they can see all the way into the other pens so you start making the Pens slightly further apart or else oh I need to somehow barricade their vision into this pen basically I guess there's walls of lava there so if they if any of them are close enough to this I also need to blacklist like command blocks and stuff like that like allow them in the game but not allow these guys to see them I don't really want them interacting with command blocks yet well this is a unique development I did not expect this at all today things they're placing directly below themselves a lot which is interesting but I mean they also place in front of them so why why directly below themselves so much you know I think he placed that one over there as well and he just placed one over there and he died so it's not all directly below themselves what's this guy doing he's tossing and picking up dirt boss that's kind of cool they placed it around the spawn block but not directly on it oh that's fine he was navigating for a second but no he's just kidding but whooped he's almost out he just doesn't care to leave he just wants to go higher and higher we really need the navigation there on that first and also they're not switching that is a problem right now that was the problem I was tackling right before this thing and somehow I ended up doing this well no way he selected over there to target now he's back down to his feet he's probably trying to place a block right where he is at and it's just telling him no can't do it not quite jump placing but heck if they don't want to like rise up you know like they've there they've figured out a way to kind of jump place not placing it above them as much right now a couple of them could have escaped so they just kind of stand there though they don't navigate they just jump or they don't navigate they just stand there just why we need a navigation there all night or I could wire in baritone so the colors rid of those you guys knew this represent a cluster so multiple blocks placed that are their sides are touching so not diagonally like well I guess that chest you know wouldn't count so they have to actually be touching the face of it but the problem that we're running into right now is they are not changing up things in their inventory they're using the same block and they're placing like crazy right now I could not have asked for a better start to this stream I really want the item stuff to start working and it appears that they can get the neurons but it's just not doesn't happen that often because I saw this fire off I think on this run it just doesn't happen too often oh do you guys see that they were stoned they were still in place someone placed stone now that could have been because they ran out of whatever else they're placing because clearly that neuron is not firing yeah I speak of the devil here we go okay so that neuron someone got that neuron so maybe they'll become more prevalent as we go I haven't rewarded them for diversity and block placing at either which is partially the problem here no and I think I can wire baritone into I'm probably gonna do that first just to speed things up here we go say current value of one and they identified dirt lovely thing that they're already placing they are capable of jumping but there's only one area that triggers the jumping and that's typically if they've failed at their target within three seconds it chooses one of three behaviors jumping is one of them so it's it would have had to fail for three seconds and I'm not sure I mean I guess it could have failed for three seconds it could be trying to play so that's right I guess it could be trying to place it then it decides to jump because it's failing so I had a check here that checked to see once they were done placing is the block solid and it would fail if it didn't and when I remove that it just gave him a couple more milliseconds for the head to line up and for the server to sync back up I guess and this funny thing this is all done server-side so I don't know how the math is that far off because it thinks it's looking at it so and then once I did that it was like no problem we're just gonna play stuff all over the place so let's look at this guy this guy he's looking straight down yep there okay all the ones doing the block jump trick are looking straight down which is good I don't know why they're looking down so much whether they're behaving they're definitely thinking things through the ghost block bug they just keep coming back she don't even remember what this does I think it clears everything out coming to save you fuel a so yeah neato version 1.1 if you look here at our neurons right so some of these things require they have variables to them like well this one's actually from an enum so this we can generate right away so there's only two states to this so this is one that you could have right away so each time a species entered a training room it had no idea what was in the training room so it didn't have any block specific neurons so for example like this ones this one checks the type of the item right here and so it hasn't picked up any items yet or observed any items so this type of neuron wouldn't spawn with them right away same thing with is looking at is using an eye which they do have but they had no idea what blocks were in there so there's no neurons unless we said some preset neurons in there but there were things like health input they always have health so that's set to default because it doesn't require like them to have learned about it that species to have learned about it well that was inefficient in the fact that because I built bases thing off neat which you have a standard amount of inputs and outputs and they never change I think as far as I know I'm one of the only ones that's not the only one with Neto where the inputs and outputs change significantly because they learn about him the same way a player will it play the game you know we tossed my mom and he was never played minecraft into the lava maze all she needs to know is lava not lava really to solve that thing and so but you still need to observe that hey there's lava in here and there's not lava once I did that and I originally this they were at a species level so each new species we had would restart without any knowledge well I said you know the way we're doing it now that's kind of silly it would make sense in a survival type you know thing were creatures in a desert biome wouldn't need to know about the ice biome creatures as much until they wandered over there here since they're all every single creature in this experiments gonna have the same box and items at their act you know at their disposal here these guys don't really need to know about lava they actually managed to see it though which is annoying but they don't need to know about lava for this so we made it on a training room basis and so that gives every new species the advantage of having access to those neurons also we waited because the way NEET worked in my modification to it they default neurons still got more preferential treatment for getting new neurons and so you actually had to like they had to actively try and add a new input or a new output but when I said add a new dependency it would use whatever they already had so that was really weighted towards any other thing I already had and now every single possible permutation is available to add neurons for and also has the added bonus of if you look at their neural nuts in here that we we don't need to store inputs and outputs that aren't actually in use which we didn't really need to before but it's just how it was encoded so cuz because we figure out every single new one that they need every time and so right here you can see they're much smaller man we had a bunch of junk floating off over here and over here so yeah we've got oak leaves it's not really gonna help them with this experiment but whatever so we're just going to reward them for clustering at first so there was a Jen ones yeah they're not that bright yet and see we got four scores okay something's wrong with the scoring mechanism no one's got scores in there Jen one debugging on the live stream you know what I wrote this totally backwards okay there we go what's my score my scores one good go scores three that's good they put two blocks down the clusters and we're trying to dig a spawn block far for the curves of course first all right looking at the species now we've got 92 153 you know look at that they're building stuff is there any rhyme or reason to it I doubt it yet I should give them points for making like smooth surfaces - that might be something to think about oh yeah here we've got someone's tossed their wool on the ground okay that's good news because that means that someone had to choose to toss their wool otherwise they tossed everything else and just that's all they had left yeah see that's the cool structure there it's a cell and it's not quite a solid block it's still kind of cool you yeah okay there's I did see the guy running placing if they escape over the wall I should like not killed unless you just let them run free oh oh we got a runner yeah where is he going I don't what's even targeting Coco woody what are you doing targeting what do you got in Valley completed completed dirt he's just he's just he's just running off and okay well he's placing stone right now just cuz he ran out of blocks that's cool so I left for a little bit came back and they've built these interesting little mushrooms at first glance very similar there's one over here there's one over here and there's another one over here man they're all over the place but I'll give you a hint that they're directly above spawn blocks so their heads get stuck in them and they die somehow they've managed to glitch up my block removal stuff which is not super surprising and are now killing themselves in mass using mushrooms not really what I'd hope for but interesting nonetheless alright that's it thank you guys for watching and again if you guys like this you know hit subscribe support us on patreon a reminder we'll be streaming at twelve o'clock eastern US time on Tuesdays and Thursdays now so I've changed up our streaming there's no more Friday livestream it twice as much content though thank you my patrons and have a great week go out there and crush it bye I don't know why I should really not put willem dafoe there he's creepy I think the Dahlia Lau is much better to move that so it's less like there's a weird guy there never mind something definitely went wrong with my code for clustering and now the blocks are a psychedelic disco ball really cool though this guy gets it like a rave or something just need to play some Nirvana in the background
