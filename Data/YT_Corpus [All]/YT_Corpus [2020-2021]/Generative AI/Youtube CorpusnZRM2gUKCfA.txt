 [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] welcome to this afternoon spark in AI summit general session my name is lady Cabral and I lead the diversity and inclusion program at data breaks I'm proud to introduce our guest keynote speakers today and over the next few days but first I want to spend a few minutes talking about what I believe is our collective responsibility to address racial and social injustice I'm passionate about diversity and inclusion because I believe it ensures that people have the freedom and safety to be themselves I believe deeply that every individual should have that right whether at home at work or anywhere in between when people feel like they belong they're inspired and motivated to be their best however as our history reminds us and recent events have brought to the forefront the feeling of freedom and safety is still missing for millions of people around the world whether based on race gender or sexual orientation discrimination and social injustice remain deeply systemic issues that demand action over the last month in the midst of an already incredibly challenging time it has been inspiring to see people around the world coming together both in their personal and professional lives to demand justice and help drive meaningful and lasting change in the context of creating change I'm very excited about what this group will do how can we use data to learn more about and help solve the world's toughest social problems what kind of products can we build that will also help us eliminate biases how can we help cultivate and preserve a sense of belonging for everyone diversity and inclusion is everyone's job it is our collective and constant responsibility one that I hope we adhere to and hold each other accountable to in our lives on a personal I'm humbled to be part of a community that can make such a massive difference that's why I'm excited for today's guest keynotes our speakers will focus on current issues and events from racial and social justice to other issues like kovat 19 and the elections and the important role of data and AI in helping people organizations and governments better understand and solve the toughest issues around them I hope you enjoyed today's talks and that you're inspired to join us in supporting the important cause that Olli talked about earlier today to do so click on the donate Now button in your dashboard as a reminder data bricks will match all donations up to $100,000 and now for our first speaker dr. Philip atiba Goff is the president and co-founder of the Center for policing equity as a research and action think-tank Center for policing equity produces analyses identifying and reducing the causes of racial disparities in law enforcement using evidence-based approaches to social justice they use data to create levers for social cultural and policy change please welcome dr. Goff the last three weeks because of what it is that I do a lot of people have been asking me what is this how am I supposed to make sense of it when it first happened it was obvious that we'd all seen a slow-motion public lynching some for the first time and the reaction in the streets was a protest of people who were tired they were exhausted not just from staying inside from the novel coronavirus but they were exhausted from the means the accumulation of the names like a motto are Bri Brianna Taylor and obviously George Floyd in Minneapolis it had been no Jamar Clark and Toledo castile and Levin but as the days went on and the protests spread from Minneapolis to New York to Tallahassee to Texas to Idaho to Alaska to Berlin people realized that this was not just about policing or at least it felt bigger than that I remember talking to an activist in the first week of the events I was worried about him because activists get targeted by law enforcement by employers and so I asked him are you going to go back out and in his response saying he felt like he had to he said the pain I feel is too big to fit in my body and without thinking I responded I said that's because the pain that we're feeling is too big a fit to a lifetime this is generations worth of agony the way I've described it before and today and tomorrow will be it's it's we're seeing the past due notice for the unpaid debts owed to black communities for 400 plus years and the urgency of now is the interest that's accumulated on top of that and it's important to understand that as the central element of what we're seeing because if we imagine that the problem is just policing then we're gonna have solutions that are way too small even if we fixed all of policing imagining that was possible without dealing with everything else then we'd be stuck with a small chunk of what people really need and paying this debt over and over and over again so for this audience to a group of data scientists right those of us who work every day in Python and an R and in Stata if we labor in Excel sheets it can feel as if our work is so far removed from the vital live realities of what's happening every day we can manage that by taking to the streets with protesters making signs donating to our our causes but when we get back to the work in the day it can leave your mouth filling tasteless right and I'm happy to say that when you understand part of the problem the biggest part of the problem is the weight of the problem is that we haven't had an honest accounting of all that we've done although being targeted abuse and the benign neglect of black communities counting problems are problems that data nerds and justice nerds that we're actually exactly equipped for so publicly part of what I talked about is the need to strap in the need to get yourself emotionally prepared for the moment when the cameras turn away we're coming really close right I've started to see that the top of the news shows are about campaigns or about the kovat numbers all very important but they've ceased to be about the protests at the protests are even better organized bigger or less violent so it's time now to start strapping in and saying I'm not going to allow myself to be less activated about this moment just because I'm not seeing it on my screens every day but for this audience for y'all there's more that you can do you can take on small projects in your neighborhood in your city in your County in your state you can take on the job of saying all right so how many people aren't just attending force used on them how many people end up in the hospital how many times the police have contact with kids in my neighborhood in my city if the data are public you can ask and if they say no you can for it because the data belong to the people you can do these bits of accounting that other people can't that the country has it I can't overstate how important it is to just do those measurements um I know that when I was growing up my parents measured everything well not everything but they measured my height they measured you know my grades they measured they literally talked about how many friends I had as a proportion of the people I could be friends with in my grade my parents were nerds but it also was one of the ways if they cared it's one of the ways that everybody cares if you grew up in a family that's struggled with money you know that when you go to the grocery store you're counting in your head every dollar in every cent if you grew up in places where you had money probably the budget was a really important thing for your parents and for everybody who is part of and runs a business you're paying attention to the things that the company you work for or that you run values most how on earth can you live in a world where the things you care about you don't bother to measure might even love we pay attention to the amount of time that we get the kind of attention that we get all the things we care about we measure I cannot overstate how painful it is that we've neglected to measure the terror that the state does in the most vulnerable communities the United States how would it feel if the people have the power to measure every little move that you make online and every little dollar that you make in every little way didn't bother to measure the number of times that their agent sent you to the hospital and set your neighbors to the morgue so unlike what I say publicly you-all can do more than just get emotionally prepared to strap in because there will be another George Floyd and the cameras will not catch it and the story will be very different from law enforcement than what happened and we will have no way of knowing but we can start the process of having an honest accounting and you all can help and if you're looking for more ways you can log on to our website alright pleasing equity org but you all are creative I want you to be thinking about ways we haven't thought of yet ways that we can't because we're dealing with the tsunami of unprocessed data from law enforcement and I don't just want this to be a law enforcement problem so that's the first thing I want to make sure that you all knew but the second thing I want to be talking about is how do we move forward in addition to that honest accounting once we have any kind of sense of how big or how many or how long there are lots of calls right now to be doing things that are radically unimaginable to a lot of the country three weeks ago talking mostly about the calls for defunding the police which may sound kind of bananas especially in context for you think about well what happens when I I'm having my house broken into what happens when someone is committing a violent felony like surely the police there and first it's important to know defend the police means many different things to many people there's one extreme of it which is literally full abolition there's no law enforcement anymore the community can handle it themselves but what I hear most from black community is what polling says black communities are more interested in like what activists tell me when I'm sitting in meetings with them is that we have had generations of defunding black communities so look at the history of mental health hospitals in California right we had mental health hospitals we had public hospitals for folks who were mentally ill they were difficult it is not a success story of public investment there was abuse there was neglect there was a lack of regulation but what happens when you close them down is you give them a set of antipsychotic drugs you say I hope here I'm gonna take these when you're supposed to you have no home sometimes your families are scared to bring you in and instead of having public accommodations we have law enforcement we have public education which used to be part of the way in which the country created so much wealth but increasingly we've pulled back from investments in public education we've taken that out we've defunded public education allowed it to become privatized right which is why charter schools end up being such a big deal I'm not gonna delve into that debate but the idea is that why is it that those who are most vulnerable can't have the things the privatization supposed to offer lots of reasons for it and debates to be had not my thing at least not today but the point is you wouldn't have to do that we wouldn't be having that debate if we invested in public education we've taken that out the aclu estimates that there's 14 million kids going to school right now in schools that have police officers but no nurse no counselors from psychologists no therapists and in places where I've worked in the Midwest and in the South you oftentimes have to drive an hour or more to get to a grocery store that has fresh vegetables so we've defunded public education we've defunded public health we've defunded substance abuse we defunded mental health and the only public good that we put any money into in many of the most formal communities poor white communities and especially urban black communities is the police that's why in some communities you're more likely to get taken to the hospital in the back of a black and white school quad car than you are in an ambulance so in those conversations in those communities what they're talking about when they say defund the police is if we're gonna keep defunding black communities at least allowed black communities to decide with a little money to get supporting and there goes and we can take money out of law enforcement and we can put it into having 911 be able to dial on social workers and marriage counselors and school psychologists a public health advocates the idea is that safe communities public safety begins with this notion that it'd be best if we didn't have to call the cops and if we give communities the resources that allow them to do that then we're giving them the kid the resources not just to defund the police but to determine their own destiny so it's not for me to tell protesters what their slogans should be but I hope that people take that invest in black communities is the thing that everybody agrees on at this that regardless of what you mean by defunded police invest in black folks that's the thing is everybody wants folks to be in positions where they don't have to call police in the first place so I'll point out two things about what that looks like one is that if you're going to take money out of law enforcement or just invest in black communities it turns out you can't just throw money at the problem you shouldn't just drop it from a helicopter have folks fight over it and then say the problem is done yeah I don't invest smartly there's a lot of programs right now and have a ton of money but they're regulated such that the most in need don't know how to get access to it data nerds can help this is why justice nerds exist figure out how to set up the regulation so people can access the money and the resources that they need figure out what you can be investing in that has the greatest return on investment you can't do that by feel you should listen to black communities for short they will give you the best lead to begin with but even the folks who are living on the ground can't tell you the proportion that needs to go in one service versus the other that's gonna need analytics that's gonna need us the other thing that I want to point out is that even if you cut law-enforcement let's say by 50% let's say you cut the personnel of your local law enforcement by 50% what on earth is the guarantee that law enforcement that's left is going to be just the good ones that by slashing the budget you've got written of all the bad ones and if they're there and they have a few more officers which means they have less capacity they're gonna be stretched thinner that's a recipe for disaster so we can't just cut based on a field that it needs to be smaller leave the cut smart in the same way that we invest smart so who are the officers that should be sticking around I can tell you if you cut randomly or you just cut based on budget almost every union contract I've ever I mean everyone I've ever seen I'm sure almost everyone in the country says the last hired first fired which means the most junior officers who are most progressive and are most capable of engaging in culture change are the first out the door unless you you had figure out a different smarter way to do it and in the same way whenever city budgets get cut the after-school programs the ability to have law enforcement be able to take care of help clean up the park take care of the elderly those are the first ones to go those are exactly the ones that folks will call it for defunding law enforcement don't want to see gone so if we're gonna cut programs and we're gonna cut personnel and we better do that smart and it's gonna take a lot more nerds that are currently employed in law enforcement here's what I mean by that there's roughly 18,000 law enforcement agencies across the United States give or take a couple all right of those 18,000 75% of them are 25 officers are few and a thousand police departments are just one dude it's always dude then they don't have an auntie Department right they don't have a data system that keeps track of things they've got if they're lucky old Willie ol really mostly works in the basement full of mildew with a bunch of cardboard boxes that have manila folders in it that are stained with ink fingerprints nothing digital it's in the basement where it floods about once every 18 months and so mostly those pages are stuck together and are growing black mold if you wanted to do a fun natural language processing project what you could be doing is helping on Willie transfer all of those files for the last hundred plus years it is something digital that would give us an archive to let us understand what's happening in the small departments because you're twice as likely to get shot and killed by law enforcement in a small department then you are an urban department makes sense or the department sent more training when 8/3 it got better standards they're able to use so small departments need our help deeply they need the help but it's also important to get that of the 18,000 law enforcement agencies across the u.s. not one of them has the exact same data system and I shouldn't say data system because they've got at least three almost every department has it's called a CAD system that's the 911 dispatch system they've got a records management system for what comes in and IA system an internal affairs system now sometimes use of force is countering in the cad system sometimes in the rms sometimes in IA and those systems you'll be shocked to hear don't speak to each other as part of the reason why the Center for policing equity exists is to start integrating those systems auditing cleaning standardizing them so they can even be compared across systems I'll tell you that process is difficult and another fun project for anybody who's listening to this to take on is helping your local law enforcement break into the late 1800s in terms of data collection and capture right because I'll tell you we've worked in departments that have tried to digitize their data and the location information that they captured on a series of incidents just was the word cheese I assumed somebody was taking a lunch order and just wrote it down in the wrong place but I'll tell you what you're trying to get longitude and latitude data longitude latitude data for that it just gives you the state of Wisconsin which is not useful there are all of these things that are gonna be necessary for reimagining how we do Public Safety and for giving back to the most vulnerable communities the power to determine what safety is like for them and we're not going to get there just for the people who know how to write laws we're not gonna get there just for the people who know how to pass budgets we're not even gonna get there for the people who are experts in civil rights community empowerment and all enforcement we're going to need nerds to make sure this happens responsibly and I've been talking about all the things I can't overstate I can't overstate this either if we fail to do that if the nerds don't show up when we're not called in we don't do our jobs right here's what's gonna happen Minneapolis that is announced it's gonna take a year-long process to figure out how to disband their department they're gonna have a rise in crime that rising crimes can be accompanied by a couple of really high-profile homicides for sexual assaults we're both and politicians are going to take those stories and they're gonna tell mildly genuine stories of horror at all the awful things this terrible moment has led to and we're gonna see a backlash of the kind that we saw in 70s and 80s and culminating in the 90s that led to the largest rise of mass incarceration in the history of our species history moves in ABS and flows civil rights movement was followed by incredibly regressive politics and a retrenchment of restrictions on on civil rights particular on black communities if you're not a student of history you may not know that immediately after emancipation was a period known by historians as the reconstruction it is still to this day the height of black representation in elected office we gave out money tracts of land gave out a bit of recompense for the hundreds of years of slavery and still the majority of time that this country has been a country by this name and that reconstruction period was followed by what we understand by historians as the nadir the stripping of all of those protections the stripping of Rights the institution of poll taxes and then the code we now understand is Jim and Jane crow we're at a moment in history where real progress can be made where it's possible to imagine a really different world because the virus that has been stalking our species for the last several months is forcing us to think about a different kind of way it turns out right that what's behind me in your eyes is it really here the whole world is different and zoom meetings are the norm and are likely to stay with us for a while working from home as a real thing kids and pets yeah interceding on our business meetings all of that is with us for some time in the future we're already actively imagining a different world and we can be doing the same thing on equity as we're doing that on public health we have to people by the millions in the streets are calling for it but if the Nerds fail to show up in the way that we need to this period of province I'm imagining a new world beyond being forced to stay in your house it's gonna be met with the kind of scapegoating that also can come from these moments and I am not sure which path we're gonna be able to choose but I do definitely know that nerds data nerds just as nervous we're we're gonna play a big role and so now is the time to start getting ready for whatever role you want to and can play to step up and to strap in because the role we're gonna play as is often the case is not all that sexy I'm sorry folks learn to live with it it's not sexy and it's not gonna be in the front of the cameras it's not gonna be at the front of the movement but without it failure is absolutely guaranteed and the things that we all feel like we might be able to grasp for the first time maybe in our lifetimes for the first time maybe in the history of the country we're gonna be responsible for putting that firmly within reach or making another fifty to a hundred years before we can touch it again so with this moment being as big as it is I implore all of you strap in take up your pet projects do more than the people around you who are feeling like they don't know how to tap in and they don't know how to contribute figure out a way to turn your data nerd status into justice notice status and not just with our merchandise make it part of your life we can do that now where we couldn't before Thank You dr. Gough UC Berkeley has been at the forefront of educating the next generation of data science practitioners and researchers so we're honored to have Jennifer chase with us today she's the newly appointed associate provost for UC Berkeley's division of computing data science and society and she'll talk about how her division is building bridges across a diverse set of programs which fits perfectly with the theme of this summit she'll describe how the Cova 19 pandemic has accelerated the ramp up of this new division and the interdisciplinary research and collaboration at Foster's let's give a warm welcome to Jennifer Chase thanks so much for inviting me to give this talk I'm going to be talking about machine learning and data science at Cal and how we have formed a new division which we believe will transform research and education to meet societal challenges this work is done with Kathy yell ik who is the associate dean of our new division of computing data science and society so computing a data science at Cal what we have in this new division which is called computer data science and society is a core of computing and data science in addition to cross campus partnerships both for educational and for research purposes so in the new division we have a department which many of you know the eeks department at Berkeley we also have the statistics department and we have the school of information in addition to that we have something which we're calling the data science Commons which are partnerships research partnerships with faculty between the core disciplines and all the other disciplines on campus now we are the unparalleled leader in data it's education in fact that is how the division started with the data science major as of now less than two years after we started the major we have over a thousand declared majors over 6,000 students take data science classes every year we have hundreds of students teeing and helping to teach this class and between data science and CS the CS major and the EECS major we are the number one talent producer for Silicon Valley we're going to convene this new division in a building yet-to-be-built which we're calling the data hub it is going to be a huge building on a wonderful site in the northwest corner of campus we started out with a gift from an amazing anonymous tuner a gift of over a quarter of a billion dollars we're still doing more fundraising and this site will have will house and convene these partnerships so here are some of the research themes that we are going to be looking at we're going to take the core of computing and data science and statistics and information and we are going to connect across campus with various initiatives which you see here today what I'm going to do is I'm going to focus on one public health and the reason I'm focusing on this is just you know a short time after this division was formed to meet societal challenges we had one of the greatest societal challenges in a very long time this is the Kovach 19 pandemic and this really requires rapidly putting together cross-disciplinary research teams to tackle many aspects of the problem you see some of them here and you all to see some themes like security and privacy and scale so I will tell you about roughly eight or nine different research projects there are all rapid responses to Kovach 19 the first is a project by Ben Yu and her collaborators she has many external collaborators and many students working with her on this and this is to predict Hospital demand so here we were back in mid-march and we had no idea where the new hospital demands were going to arise okay we knew that there were outbreaks and unfortunately I think these outbreaks are not yet done and so what Ben wanted to do was predict demand seven days out so that we could get PPE and ventilators to the hospitals that would need it most the first thing that Ben's team did was data curation they put together about 20 different hospitals and County data sets on these they tried many different models came up with a weighted combination of five of those models that very accurately predicts Hospital demand they also built visualization so that this could be used by less technical folks one of the many things they've done is to figure out where to deliver over a million face shields worldwide okay the next project I'm going to talk about is data to help the most vulnerable Josh blumenstock who's in the School of Information at Berkeley has a longtime project to try to understand where we find pockets of poverty in the undeveloped world it's not at all obvious how you do this you know it's not like we have vote registration rolls or you know we know where people are filing taxes from like we do in the developed world so in countries like Togo for example how do we know what data sources do we have and how can we use them and so josh has put together mobile phone data these are usually not smartphones are usually pretty primitive phones and satellite data and from those he has found latent variables which predict poverty with remarkable accuracy so he takes he takes the whole country and he divides it up into two kilometer by two kilometers squares and he can point to the ones where the poverty is worst now when Kovac hit wasn't just a public health crisis due to the pandemic it's a public health crisis in many of these countries due to acute hunger and starvation an estimate that over a quarter of a billion people would suffer from acute hunger and over 30 million would die of starvation just due to Kovac 19 and so josh has worked with the government of Togo at the highest levels to figure out where to distribute micro loans to take people from acute hunger and starvation back to the you know the the just surviving side and he's doing similar work with Bangladesh with Uganda with Afghanistan okay the next project I want to talk about was done by euros Sal jack at Lawrence Berkeley Lab and also with collaborators not only at LBL but also at at hospitals in northern Italy in particular in the Bergamo and Lombardi regions of northern Italy you'll probably remember that these were some of the worst-hit region in the world at an early point in the outbreak of Koated 19 and so you know they they reported mortality based on death certificates but those numbers were just way way off they were significant under estimates so euros and his colleagues looked at mortality data in different age classes over the last five years they also combined it with data from the princess cruise ship and they corrected for the under estimate finding that more than twice as many people died as were actually recorded as tobe deaths moreover they found that the discrepancy increased with age very very dramatically it was quite close for people 40 through 49 it was many factors off almost an order of magnitude off for people 90 and above the next project is using NLP so we believe that the literature probably the medical literature probably contains a lot of information of relevance to treating coded however you know it obviously won't be labeled as such no I knew about Kovac 19 at that time so what the group consisting of people at Lawrence Berkeley Lab and UC Berkeley did was that and this was following similar work they had done in material science but here for the medical literature of relevant and the biological literature of relevance to Kovac they looked at a word embedding and from that were able to understand which previous papers might actually have relevant information on proteins genes symptoms and possible drugs that already exist so they have analyzed over 80,000 pay in Crete and patents increasing that by 1500 a week and they have over a thousand unique users per week talking about drugs how about drug design so Jennifer Alice Garden who's in the EECS department at Berkeley has been working for a number of years now on small molecule drug design she's using a machine learning set of techniques for how to invert very high dimensional spaces the problem is that there are just too many possible small molecules so Jem has developed ways of finding the most relevant ones for certain purposes here what she wants to do is use those techniques to find small molecules that prevent the binding of the Czar's kovat to virus to the human cell so you know things like the ace 2 receptor that seems to be highly implicated in in getting kovat 19 so she is looking for molecules that would prevent that binding okay we also have some studies coming out of the School of Public Health this is a really interesting study to help the Berkeley campus and other campuses figure out how to safely reopen this one is done by Mya Peterson art Reingold and their collaborators from the Department of Epidemiology and biostatistics and the Berkeley School of Public Health and so what the problem is here is the problem is that you want to take in many different sources of data at these data on symptoms exposure mobility begin base contacts talk a little more about this in in the next slide you want to talk in place-based data like looking at ear soldier data that kind of thing taking an aggregate public health data and then you want a machine learning based risk prediction model to tell you who is most likely to contract the disease most epidemiologists agree that you are not going to control an epidemic only by testing symptomatic people you must do some testing of asymptomatic but how do you do that you test everybody all the time there are models that say that people should be tested every two or three days to really control an epidemic other models say only once a month so these models really differ but how do we use the limited resource of testing and surveillance when we have so many people to test so art Maya and their collaborators are doing a test on are doing an experiment with matched cohorts there's one cohort of students in student housing about a thousand a matched cohort not in not in the dorms there is a cohort of faculty and graduate students and staff who've gone back into the labs and a demographically matched cohort who are still sheltering in place and we want to look at the incidence of disease and we want to use this machine learning based smarter way to determine which asymptomatic we should test okay coming out of the rise lab from EECS David color Joey Gonzalez and their collaborators are helping us to do digital contact tracing there are many groups across the country and across the world trying to do this often with phone based apps based either on the iPhone or the Android platform so you can have phones from many different places and there are a couple of twists that the berkeley group has so they are also looking at fixed location bluetooth bluetooth devices you could do this either where the phone or you could do this with a dongle or a bracelet there's a lot of advantage to place based devices and they also have come up with a commons that contain some although no private or health data some data so what do we need to do all of this battle okay what we have is we have data some of it quite private like health based or if we use the location-based beacons we want to do computation on that well this is really a federated learning challenge okay so as all of you know federated learning is is a method for having a lot of data coming in on edge devices like phones okay you want to perform there's some models sitting up in the cloud you want to perform some learning locally on the edge devices sharing just enough information to learn something globally and of course you want to preserve privacy in these cases okay there are many algorithms for federated learning we have faculty at Berkeley who have been working on questions of compressing data streams at the edge for their whole careers Jelani Nelson when he was in grad school had a very important paper on what is called sketching say you replace models at the edge by small mirja Bowl summaries and he had a very important paper on this in 2010 this year Martin Wainwright who is in the statistics department at Berkeley came up with a way of merging data from different edge devices this is very important because if I find the optimum on several edge devices and then I take that and I average it it might not fact odds are it will not be the minimum of the original problem and so Martin and collaborators found out with wait found out ways she's operator splitting for distributed convex minimization when you had added obstruction finally I want to mention some work coming out from the spark community from young Strika joey gonzales raluca Popa and and their collaborators and what they did was they looked at oblivious cooperative queries so co-op petition is a case in which you need to merge your data you need to cooperate but you also are competing hence coop coop petition and what they're doing is you're using hardware on place for secure distributed analytics among competing parties so for example if each Hospital had its own data in its own Hardware Enclave this is certainly happening with many hospitals how do we do a query against those without revealing information and how do we also protect from side-channel attacks on that information right through memory and network access patterns so there ocq is implemented on Apaches on an apache spark query plan or an execution engine and you may if you're a cartographer you may have said to me well why don't you just use secure perdy computation this ocq is 200 times faster this is just a small taste of the coded work the rapid response work that has occurred in computing a data science across Berkeley in the last couple of months and so our new unit is here to do computing and data science to strengthen the core and to solve societal problems the differentiators of Berkeley are that we of course have excellence at the corn and easy Alvin statistics and information we also have excellent across all other fields we do this at a scale which is almost unprecedented and finally the really special aspect of Berkeley is an incredible sense of social commitment so please do come and visit us at the division of computing data science and society at Berkeley thanks for letting me tell you about Thank You dr. chase we're truly honored to have our next speaker with us today as the founder and editor-in-chief of fivethirtyeight.com nee silver is the preeminent election forecaster in the United States with presidential elections only a few months away we're really looking forward to what he has to say after a technical talk on data analysis in the age of big data neh will answer questions on the nuts and bolts of building complex election forecasting models plus he'll give us tips for how to convey probabilities and uncertainty to the general public so please welcome Nate Silver hey everybody I am Nate Silver I am the founder and editor-in-chief of 538 and the author of this book the signal in the noise why so many predictions fail but some don't which I wrote eight years ago 2012 eight years is kind of a long time it also took four years to write the book and of course I had a lot of experience working in analytics before writing the book and collecting stories to the book through my own research for 538 and the book and projects before and after that so given that we're now in a time of such profound uncertainty or so it seems I just want to spend this presentation reviewing kind of reflecting where we stand in the field of data analytics and in fact like the themes are very true two things I talk about in the book eight years ago I'm not saying the big picture things have changed very much but in light of politics and light of coronavirus and everything else I think it's always useful to take a fresh perspective and see kind of the tension between how things look in theory and kind of have things look in reality on the ground it's not all gonna be coronavirus and politics are gonna have a few fun stories about sports and poker and things like that but I do want to increase the focus to one kind of some more pressing things that we see today one of the basic contrast really is between kind of the big promise of big data and analytics and kind of if you were in 2012 people were very excited about I would kind of come press a button and write a program then we can kind of solve all these problems right and here are a lot of systems like this is from IBM for example that 90% of the world's data at a given time has been created in the past two years that sounds like great right we're solving all these problems except if you think about what's kind of happened over the past decade or so it's been a lot of things that that were problematic or unpredictable or both right ranging from from elections to the corona virus here in the middle of the worst pandemic since the Spanish flu you also have some of the biggest protests arising the u.s. since 1968 we've also all the stuff that goes on in the background like earthquakes and the air and the recession right now and terrorist attacks and hurricanes and all that stuff um you know I would recommend by the way if you want to read the book we talk about almost all these things in some detail in the book but but the contrast between the promise that we think they get it creates and the fact that the world doesn't some of they're coming more predictable I think is something that we need to we need to confront a little bit more head-on potentially um by the way it's not just these big newsworthy events that can create tension and surprises and problems it's also in some of the most scientifically minded fields of all like medicine for example or psychology we're only about depending on which study you read only about 35 to 40 to 50 percent of scientific findings can be successfully replicated meaning that you polish a result in a journal you say it's statistically significant we have a big discovery and other research who tries to recreate the same finding and they actually fail to do that as often or more often than not so why does this occur this is a big problem for example when you read all these studies around coronavirus treatments and vaccines and things like that where they'll be some promising initial discovery whether it's about a therapy for example or it might be about if not a therapy then some hypothesis about how how the disease might spread ideas indoors and not outdoors or maybe it's aerosols or whatever else but you'll find that sometimes these findings aren't robust when people go back and look at them again so I will try in this presentation to talk about why some of that can occur so one thing I think people don't think about very much is that when you gather more data um that actually leads sometimes for more room for interpretation or disagreement right it used to be that in political now my specialty is looking at political polls forecasting elections it used to be that a 30 or 40 years ago you would have a few big national polls you'd have an NBC poll and a CBS poll and here Times poll the ABC News poll right um you would have maybe a few high quality state polls and in Ohio or Iowa or whatnot um but you didn't really have nearly as rich the amount of data that we have today which on the one hand seems like it's really disappointing right we can't have as much precision on how we look at every swing state and make these fancy map sites like 538 couldn't really work very well you barely have polling in many states right on the other hand when you have lots and lots and lots of data then there's lots of room to argue about it potentially here for example is our chart from 538 showing what the poll showed over the course of the Iowa caucus we expend a lot of effort to figure out how much you want to smooth the data and how you want to kind of literally connect the dots even so you had in Iowa at some point for different people actually led the Iowa caucus at some point in the polls that turned out you basically had two different winners to add the confusion where Bernie Sanders and people to touch each one I were depending on exactly how which metric you look at the student was three different counts of the vote to make things even more confusing so um so it certainly doesn't seem like as we get more digging it and achieve more consensus there's actually as much fighting and arguing and room for debate as there before and if we go back to 2016 the general election there was a lot of controversy over election forecasts um what is important to note though is that you actually had people taking the same information the same day they're all these forecasts are looking at polls and sometimes economic day but mostly just at polls and coming up with very different answers where our forecasts at 538 gave Trump about a 30% chance of winning the Trump campaign itself allegedly also give itself a third good chance of winning the other forecasts gave them only a 1% chance or a 2% chance and me working in probabilities a three in ten chance or one in three only for where you want to call it is very different than one in 50 or one in 100 so the kind of romantic notion hey if we get all the data that we need the next the easy part are that's the hard parts all right it's like no actually the hard parts in the actual analysis the hard part is in the modeling often the hard part is in how you account for uncertainty right we can all look at the polls and say a certain candidate is ahead by three points but how big is that margin of error is that margin of error symmetrical or are there funny shapes to it and whatever else how are different states related you know Wisconsin then and Michigan in Pennsylvania for example those all went through Trump at 2016 well those states are all really correlated as we call it because you've the same types of white working-class voters in each state so surprised that if one Domino falls at the other to fall as well so a big reason why our forecasts when Trump campaigns forecasts gave him higher odds and others was because we understood how these states are not independent you do not actually have 50 separate states voting at once you have people voting all across degree and 50 men at the stations of that in different parts of the country of course like I said there is a lot of second-guessing as we're having you election 2020 coming up soon in fact I'm kind of working on my 2020 model right now it's kind of what I'm spending most of my time on as we speak but there was kind of the real real shift in perception before and after we were before the election people were surprised that we had from so high of course a few people thought well why don't you have Trump winning there's a lot of second guessing if you've ever been of course as most of you are practitioners in analytics people are really kind of results oriented and not process oriented I think thinking more about your process is more important if it's me more about probability is important that if you have any forecasts saying something should happen 30 percent of time it actually should happen 310 times like a flush draw and poker or something that's supposed to happen some portion of time but I won't dwell too much on on 2016 we have so much other news to cover on you also see though when it comes to coronavirus a lot of debates over how to interpret different data and it does remind me a lot of polling where one of the things about election polling is that you have 50 different states and then you might each have five or six different polls per week you can look at different versions of those polls rights there's lots of room to kinda cherry-pick your way toward any narrative that you want within within some degree of reason and likewise here you see for example you see lots of tweets like this at Florida's positive rate is on the trajectory you know to me I'm not sure if it's clear or not here are some graphs in their times looks like deaths in Florida and reported cases in Florida as of now a few weeks ago if you're watching this in real time but the point is that like we're just trying to find more and more ways to argue I am NOT a postmodern melt Avista or something I am NOT saying that there's no absolute truth what I'm saying is that motivated reasoning is a big issue where we have things that confirm our priors from their partisan tires or whatever else and that can make us less inclined to accept more nuance and uncertainty less inclined to understand when you know finally part of being pro science understanding behavioral science and how we are people who love to find things that that tell us a story that we want to hear that confirmation bias is really quite powerful and kind of a longer I've been involved in covering politics and making forecasts and looking at data in a very very public facing way the more I think people are getting worse and worse about having their beliefs and their priors confirmed and not realizing that they - no matter how smart you are that stuff an expert some are people who are more prone toward creative interpreted a that might fit their their beliefs you have to be really really careful a rigorous um issue number two is the way in which complexity tends to increase as you increase the amount of data in the world so if you imagine that you have just five variables for example you're trying to look at the relationship between say inflation and GDP growth well there are ten two-way combinations of variables that could run tests on for example but but what happens when the universe of data begins to expand since an fie variables you instead have ten when you start to see a geometric increase in the complexity of relationships it's a bit like a a meeting or I guess a zoom call right where if you go from having five participants to ten the amount of chaos increases kind of an exponential rate potentially the amount of tension 22 people or the amount that people want to share things becomes a lot more complex but it's kind of keeps going up where he looked at the economic data for example the Federal Reserve now publishes about five hundred and sixty six thousand economics disks they update in real time every day so to look at all possible combinations of those you would have three hundred and thirteen billion five hundred and ninety nine million four hundred and forty thousand possible tests that you can run and the problem here is that when you have kind of infinite or almost different amounts of data then you can find something which is which is a one in 1 million coincident you actually find quite a few of those in datasets that are this large so it sounds like a little bit abstract but this gets back to why when I talked about before about replication crisis why do only 35 or 40 percent of findings replicate well people will explore so many possible ideas that they will get very excited about things that happen because of chance alone or because of bad data or because frankly sometimes of bad research design and so there are all kinds of ways to prove yourself I'm gonna give one more sort of abstract example here but it's pertinent in epidemiology and it's pertinent in research in a lot of other areas but so imagine that we're looking for four signals and by signal I mean something which provides useful information about a relationship maybe for example trying to find coronavirus cases for example maybe we're trying to find if we're in investment trying to find research strategy that actually worked in all the busts over long term so this depiction imagine you have you see ten red circles these are signals and the ten black circles are our noise basically they are false hypotheses so okay but let's say that we are smart and we have an algorithm we have our judgment whatever else and so we we are able to filter out 80% of the false signals mean why are we over like capture a percent of the true signals that seems pretty good right we've made a lot of improvement from this kind of very signal for environment initially the promise of Yuri combine these because the initial signal was still was still so poor you still actually have more false findings the black ones and true findings the red ones and again this is pertinent in areas like like diagnosing disease where if for example you give mammograms to women who are in their 40s fortunately women in their 40s are fairly unlikely have a low base rate of breast cancer for example so it turns out that an initial mammogram if you're in your forties a woman and it comes up positive actually majority those cases are false positives the first time so you have to do is go through that filtering process a second time and a third time and maybe a fourth time and then by then you finally filter out enough false positives and different types of tests where you have a more reliable signal but but this is why you know for example in clinical trials for some new vaccine for four kovin you're gonna read lots and lots of very enthusiastic reports about stage one trials or initial promising results from therapies and the fact is that probably the majority of these may be the vast majority of these will will not pan out you'll sail out some phase or another now the good news is that there are so many attempts at doing this where you are kind of playing a numbers game and odds are also that of these many possibilities that some actually will work you'll learn from the failures as well but this is important to keep in mind when you're kind of we have a brand new disease kind of taking over the world someone literally unfortunately learning a lot more about it but like but we are kind of starting from an environment where there's a lot we need to learn and discover the final problem is what happens when you get in environments that are competitive where you have one interpretation of the data and you might have a different interpretation of the same evidence so an example I like to give is back from back from pre Cova days when I was giving a talk in person at the Guggenheim Museum in Manhattan you see here where my apartment is a Manhattan and how do you get from point for me well it would seem like it's pretty simple right of course there's a lot of traffic so it's a slow drive but basically you just take a left on mass and Avenue when you drive north furred for 30 minutes or so and then it's pretty straight forward so it's how you would look at Google Maps how did they would get the point A to point B by contrast this is the actual route that my uber driver took that day so we crossed through Central Park three times the loop-d-loop it's a new second suite or so it finally got to the Guggenheim about 45 minutes late so the question is why was this driver taking this route so it's not a very efficient route whatsoever you were thinking with all these people in Manhattan you know this is not the way most people would go well it turns out that the driver or the GPS to a diverse ball it was a GPS s fault the routing software I should say was very intrigued by this road that cuts north through south through Central Park called East Drive so East Drive is a real road most of time it is reserved for people who are biking and jogging but at certain times a day it's open for through traffic the problem is that with GPS thought that East Drive was open at 2 p.m. where it wasn't a Tuesday when in fact that's what time so it's close and so it was trying to take advantage of this signal that turned out to be basically a bad data point right so of course the driver was like okay if I can get on this there's no traffic there it's a shortcut I will save lots and lots of time but very often when you kind of find something is too good to be true then it actually is this kind of applies almost no whatever you're doing right if you are making an investment and taking one side of the trade and then okay why are the people taking the other side of the trade they have about the same information that you have right here so wants to sit down in a poker game and play you they seem very eager to invite you into the game you should maybe ask yourself okay um you know am I on the sucker here potentially any gonna I'm not someone who says that markets are always right I think it's a lot more complicated than that I think we didn't have people who tried to beat markets the markets actually wouldn't be any good but a competitive environment is a lot different than once the only person out there looking for intelligence and for cygnets okay so I want to move now into the more I guess optimistic part of this to start to suggest some some jurist expand go about doing better analysis and none of these are terribly technical right you see here a sign depicting Bayes theorem that I'm sure a lot of you are familiar with the Bayes theorem is a a very old algebraic formula it just tells you how to weigh new information and how much to update your bully just give him what you know already you know if you are in a media you probably are familiar with the concepts where we kind of walk in and you're very uh maybe you're zooming now right you don't really know very many people you're very naive and you kind of refine your views as you get more information some ways to very intuitive process but it does involve some things that there are important to keep in mind when when we're doing the analysis so three things these all kind of stem from Bayes theorem I didn't remember one think probabilistically ID number two no way you're coming from an ID number three is try and air so I'm going to explain each one of these in a little bit of detail here so if you know anything about about 538 I know anything about my work then we are kind of obsessed with probabilistic forecasts instead of deterministic ones right so but it's trumping a twenty nine percent chance of winning or I don't know the Toronto Raptors having a fifty one percent chance when the NBA Finals or something as the Warriors last year you know we've always kind of been obsessed with trying to measure uncertainty and add value in that way and there's a reason for that which is that there's a long history people being who were about communicating uncertainty and actually confusing people and misleading people as a result so I want to get an example here from from weather forecasting so imagine sevens kind of very ugly powerpoints like you're looking at that I'm actually looking mean a blue a beautiful river in North Dakota called the red river of the north and what happens there is that is that there's a lot of snow obviously up in North Dakota so roughly speaking every March that still begins and if that snow melts pretty fast and you had the risk of flooding in the rivers in North Dakota um so one year in AK 97 there was a particularly large risk of flooding one Service issued a forecast saying hey look we have done the math this is not my current Katrina this is fun is happening or this water is melting slowly but but predictably and kind of intuitively but it's a we've done the math and look on the worst day we take the floor the flood waters will crest at 49 feet so people in Grand Forks North Dakota said okay well that's okay 49 feet is a little scary but we have flood walls I go up to 51 feet so we can do the math here 51 he is greater than 49 so what's the big problem well the big problem was was this that the margin of error on the forecast made weeks in advance was plus or minus 9 feet so in fact it was almost a 35% chance the levees would be toppled by the water in fact that's of course what happened what is actually pressed in at 53 feet on the worst day the flood so you're actually well within the margin of error it's a good forecast in that sense but it's a binary outcome where all of a sudden now almost all the town is flooded people did get out with their lives on the loss of a lot not a lot not a lot of loss of life but you did have um fairly severe flooding and a lot of uninsured property damage that could have been avoided people that actually looked at the margin of error the problem was of The Weather Service really de-emphasized the margin of error in their communications about the flood um they were afraid that if you convey uncertainty that people think that hey you don't know what you're doing I think we need to really reverse that perception all the time in society right um to me if I am and I owning say a job candidate at 5:38 and they come in with a model and they say hey look I can predict with a hundred percent accuracy who's gonna win the next election I would tell them politely to get out right because you can't have a model that is that accurate that means you've done something wrong probably overfit would be one way to do it or kind of P hack your way minimize uncertainty instead we want to measure this and quantify doesn't try to calibrate us that when we actually say there's a 30% chance actually does happen about third to the time and not more or not less and again when it comes to Kovac you'll sometimes see kind of public health agencies talk about uncertain really odd ways right with masks for example where most the evidence kind of now points toward masks potentially being very helpful to where we're at well at first the WHL CDC the place we like well it's not proven that masks work therefore maybe you shouldn't wear them right well you know that's actually not very helpful if you're trying to deal with problems in real time and having the near preponderance of evidence saying hey that's probably work it might not be proven but like actually it's probably still a good relatively low-cost way to prevent and lower the risk of spread would have been having one kind of wear masks not just starting in April and May but back in March it might have been a lot better that way frankly so you know encourage people to to include probability to include complexity and explanations and that kind of shutting them down when it seems like they have a more nuanced answer I think is really really important by the way I don't mean to make too much fun of weather forecasters in fact if you read the signal the noise are kind of the heroes of the book weather forecasts have gotten an awful lot better over the course of the past 30 or 40 years you see for example have accurate the forecast was for hurricane Irma when hit Florida a couple of years ago and yeah but the track shifts a little bit people sometimes think it's overly precise in terms of the exact county or city but basically these things are improving a lot so for example about 30 years ago if you had a hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico on average there was about a three and a 50-mile error between the four custom where that and where that hurricane actually hit so three days in advance if I have a hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico it would hit anywhere between half the time between Houston and Tallahassee Florida roughly the other half would be similar somewhere else in Thailand Mexico will curl up and hit North Carolina or whatever else right that's like not very useful and actionable intelligence nowadays forecasts are within about 100 miles an average two days and events you can see on the map that a 100 mile radius is actually very actionable where you can evacuate on the jersey shore or evacuate Houston or New Orleans or a place like that and although we have not found a way to stop hurricane to prevent property damage there is much less so like now from most hurricanes because we have a better forecast and more advanced warning and that has led to leave some bounce with an improvement in terms of saving people's lives from these storms by the way before we go two months further I want to secretly I am NOT gonna talk in these prepared remarks about the 2020 election I'm gonna say that instead for the qat we're happy to take questions that's for a lot of reasons maybe first and foremost is that we do not officially have our model ready yet so we have no kind of authoritative take on the election yet but of course I have lots of insights I have been working on the model so I'll have some clues about what it might say of course a very momentous election but I want to kind of say the election talk for more on interactive format and focused more on some the kind of abstract principles and examples from other parts of the news in other parts of my life here uncertainty of course is also very important when it comes to looking at infectious disease for example where this is a forecast from of coronavirus from guy who actually who actually formerly was a hockey analytics guy at MIT he has what is so far the best coronavirus model is machine learning it's very sophisticated and smart but it's another example where actually his model has really wide confidence band so if you project out for example until August well it could be that we have as many as twenty five hundred people a day or as she was a hundred forty people a day dying per day from coronavirus but about a thousand for example in late May and early June so you know people can get freshmen so we're trying to give like you know you're trying to give such a wide range you're kind of covering your ass right well the fact is that experience tells us that's actually about as well as people can do given we don't know very much about people's behavior we don't know that much about the disease itself you don't know for example how much will transmission be lowered in the summer we're just learning more about how for example protests might spread color is how Memorial Day barbecues might whatever else people have been doing the may in June that stuff makes it kind of hard to forecast and again there is no prize to be won from false certainty you may feel good about it at the time it may make it easier to catch on TV or thing about like but we know for many years of experience that being able to build accurate confidence intervals and account for uncertainty is kind of where the actual skill comes in so if you look for a Kobe projection the wider those ranges are the more the person probably actually knows what what he or she is doing um ID number two is what I want to call it know where you're coming from so it means being aware that we each have a subjective point of view again does not mean that there is no objective world but we're all trying to grope at it with with our own kind of jaded perspective and so what are things you can do as a person there as an organization maybe more importantly to to give yourself a better chance at actually perceiving what the objective world actually is well I would recommend edition of my book reading James here wookies book the wisdom of crowds he is a mentor a writer at The New Yorker and he talks about what characteristics tend to make crowds or groups wise which is what things make them dumb can lead to groupthink for example so so what do you have in a wise crowd number one you actually have diversity diversity can mean having people from different ethnic and racial backgrounds and different genders and different income classes and whatever else to some parts the country of the world I think that definitely phelps was important but diversity also means often relate to that having different modes of thought different skill sets different strengths and weaknesses different tolerances for risk or whatever else look if you take a hundred smart people and put them in a room together they may be really but they all are smart in the same ways and you may as well have just one person right so the whole notion of having a diverse crowd is having different skill sets of perspective that are brought to bear try it - peace out with the real world actually looks like number two is independence where people have to be empowered to actually articulate their view of the evidence if people are not empowered to that then you are gonna have think over almost for sure so I'm having organizations where you're allowed to to question your boss right you know I kind of people's boss now at 5:38 it's actually pretty hard to make sure that people are able to give you feedback and aren't fearful of the results and consequences of that right I think I'm pretty good at that but it can be intimidating sometimes to people making sure in governments for example that people aren't all trying to crew up to impress the governor or the mayor or the president for example and have a group think that way so um having real incentives for independent thinking is important uh and if their characteristic is decentralization so if you can really pick up a local inflammation and now I'll John the ground it's almost is very much related to diversity and that seems to help a lot too you can actually add net information to the problem that's going to regurgitate the same data then that can add value as well of course when we're in very polarized times politically then people could take very different views the same underlying facts right so right now for example if you look at okay what were abused initially of the protests as they were unfolding in early June it was literally almost 52 who saw them as protests primarily on the one hand people who saw them as a violent even riots on either hand again it's not a surprise we followed American politics that polarization is increasing but I think it's important to keep in mind that when you are looking at something from your point of view and we're now on social media all the time we're now in the environments we were able to easily kind of share our points of view both kind of filtered together are what we consume and the media that we read and get affirmation or confrontation whatever else that way it's pretty important not to get in what you might call a filter bubble where we only kind of see things that tell some certain side of the story if you look at the Democratic primary for example I'm Joe Biden one that surprised a lot of people even though especially on Twitter on social media even though Biden had been ahead in the polls for all of last year he didn't fall behind after Iowa and New Hampshire in the battle but he had been one of the frontrunners all year long it was not a huge slack that he won but you don't encounter very many Biden supporters I tend to be older and poorer less digitally sabatons to the primary and so you know people need to understand that like when you might experience in your peer group not see the group is wrong right you probably pick them carefully you you believe in their values like their diets they probably have good values right let's still be able to look at the girl from different perspectives being that will say okay look I understand that I might be a smart person but I have certain biases and certain beliefs and certain priors so you have to kind of actually listen when someone approaches the world in different ways not just assume that they are misinformed or evil or corrupt or whatever else sometimes they are right but but not a good default assumption um the last thing here I want to finally focus on a few more like hard exams before gets back talking about politics and so forth in the QA but trial and error is really important having spent a lot of time now the holding model to loosen them to the public I know that you know very often you can whiteboard things you can scenario plan as much as you want until you actually have a product tested by actual users by actual people then you can be very surprised about taking example here from from poker instead so way back in the day I had a job before stepping out of college was being a transfer pricing consultant I will knock in these transfer pricing means but it's roughly speaking as as boring as it sounds this came at a time when there was something called the poker boom around the country where because of ESPN and hands like this one that you see depicted here poker is coming a very big thing in the United States well this is a hand is from a screencap from ESPN where Chris Moneymaker actually played Chris Moneymaker actually recently a charity poker tournament a smart and skilled player and a nice guy but this is a hand where he is bluffing against Sam Farha old kind of grizzled pro Chris moneymakers draw a Miss he goes all-in Sam Farha folds and Chris Moneymaker wins upon he wound up actually winning the World Series poker that year so he went from having a job like - consultant paid 20 bucks to enter an online qualifying tournament putting two million dollars first projects the main event at the World Series of Poker the thinking about poker though is that it's usually not that easy for one thing unlike the slide you see here in the real world you don't actually have to see what your opponent's cards are until after the hand right so you're watching on TV it's as though you're clairvoyant much harder the real world when their cards are face down in fact when I played poker actually collected a lot of data on how different people were faring at the poker table first of all no surprise but but most players are losing players and the worst players can lose a lot of money potentially so if you go and some data taken from us now defunct site lose still defunct maybe it's resurrected in some form called called Full Tilt Poker and looking at if you rank from the worst player in the best they're a 10 person table how much money is each player making or losing over the long run so it turns out that first of all it's way easier to lose a lot of money than to make money where the worst player is losing more than 400 bucks per an hour the best player is only making 100 bucks per hour part of that is because the house takes a cut call the rake and so the average person will lose money kind of by definition but still also reflects kind of the learning curve when it comes to the complex data phenomenon or generally speaking when you're trying to learn a new task and especially when it comes to something involving analytics or you trying to build a model then you gain a lot in the first initial twenty percent of effort this is an 80/20 curve which is for example in sales and so aids in your price 22m your customers and so forth again this also applies to when you're building a model very often for example where you know if you're looking at elections right then accounting for major stuff like incumbency and how the economy is doing what the polls say that will get you most of the way there and the rest of that is so nuanced on top of that right if you're playing poker then getting the basics right saying okay look I'm gonna fold my bad hands call with my good hands and raise with my very good hands right that's the right play eight to the time or so right you have to bluff a little bit more you have to slow play and trick people that's kind of the more advanced stuff you'll actually be a lot less bad by getting their first twenty percent right one more example of this from from baseball if you guys have read the book heard of the book Moneyball the story of Billy Beane and the Oakland A's as Michael Lewis great author by the way tells the story Billy Beane takes over as GM of the Oakland A's he understands that on-base percentage is undervalued in the baseball community can get on base we draw rocks to get hit by pitches for example that correlates very well with run scoring scoring runs correlates with winning games winning games brings you in the World Series there we did that but you get the point right so this is kind of the story of Moneyball where we're really being takes over the A's OBP jumps way up what you don't hear in Moneyball is the aftermath where all of a sudden the A's OBP kind of you have too many balls right begins to begins to plummet down toward river toward the mean so what's happening there well well number one when you see like a big bunch of low-hanging fruit someone's gonna pick that off before too long it was going to copycat that behavior so it may be true that that now and then there is a big undiscovered obvious liability or error that people are making but it usually doesn't last for very long so in the case of the AC or like hey actually you know what Billy Beane is right that focusing on OBP is a great way to build up in a baseball team but hey we're in the New York Yankees the Boston Red Sox Chicago Cubs not the Tigers unfortunately as much but we have lots and lots of money and we can copy the A's analytics and if we're gonna have down'n teams that won 105 games every year where the a's go back to being a small-market team instead i'll so they rely said hey look if you're a pitcher you don't want to give up LOX it's a valuable intuition as well and so the market adapts and evolves you don't always get to be on that on the early part where the learning and the growth is very steep with that said there is a lot to be said for improving incrementally along the margin and making marginal gains 1% of time or open once at a time every year when we build our election model you know what I've been working over the past few weeks right we could have just taking our 2016 model off the shelf and applied it we're actually very proud of that model I think you did a good job to give Trump a better chance and then you mentioned what cast it but still I like to rebuild my models every time we do them but you're learning a little bit at a time and I believe that you know hey look we are getting the big stuff right we think but like making a little improvement about how you analyze certain types of polls what happens when you have polls that seem to contradict one another right how do you measure the economy during the time of coronavirus all those marginal improvements are often we're in a competitive environment that you really differentiate yourself from again it's great when you're an early adapter you have maybe that no one else is really being able to apply at scale unfortunate might only happen a couple of times in your career your company's lifespan you and said have to make continuous improvement around the margin so again I'm saying that like making small marginal incremental improvements is often the name of the game as are things that you should you should be mindful of one thing about Bayes there and by the way is that there's never actually an endpoint in Bayes theorem you start out with a belief you collect evidence you refine and revise that belief you get a little bit better over time and it's a process of continued improvement so I'll kind of sum up with this poem I guess it is from Pia time it was Danish scientist and author who expresses what I think is a good attitude to take in the age of analytics the road to wisdom well it's plain to Express air and air an Arian but less and less and less so thank you in the prepared remarks now I'm now open to take your questions I'm sure there will be some stuff about 2020 also
