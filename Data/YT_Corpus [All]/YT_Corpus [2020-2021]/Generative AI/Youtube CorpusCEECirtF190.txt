 [MUSIC]  My name is Julianna Barwick and I make music. I was asked to make some music for the new Sister City hotel. So we're using Microsoft AI, and it's triggering the music that I've made to create a generative lobby score that's ever-changing. There's a camera perched on the roof and it's reading events, so their planes that go by, bright sunshine, clouds, whatever it may be, and the AI detects those events, and then it triggers the sounds that I made in the lobby. This is my first time working with AI. I think of it more as a sound installation that's ever-changing.  Julianna as an artist uses all the available technology at her means whether it's synthesizers or looping technology, but the result is always something that feels very organic and very natural. We wanted it to connect with the feeling of recipe that you get in the hotel.  What I'm looking for in hotels, it's just a sanctuary, a place where I can totally decompress. I would love to be able to inspire that kind of thing with the sounds that I make, and also a sense of calm, but maybe also delight too. I just think it's going to inspire people to wonder and to be excited, and curious as to what the different sounds mean. [MUSIC]
