 hello and welcome my name is Professor McGrath and I am research leader at uol's creative computing Institute I'm here today to tell you about our new course in data science and AI for the creative industries technology has always been key to the creative industries new tools approaches and technologies have the power to influence and challenge the ways we choose to communicate express and reflect the world around us new data-driven technologies including artificial intelligence and machine learning have become a critical part of how we produce consume discuss and understand creativity from recommendation engines to voice controlled apps to videos sounds and experience design applications artificial intelligence and machine learning continues to transform how creative people work in today's industries artificial intelligence and data science make entirely new kinds of creative work possible including in areas such as film music photography communications and journalism and we have the ability to understand people's creative needs like never before and suggesting they might want to enjoy we can also create entirely new forms of media including augmented images sounds entirely new types of video and graphics and even whole films using data science AI and machine learning but there's also a downside this same technology also enables deep fakes fake news targeted misinformation and facilitates the creation of sometimes mediocre content generated through low quality and sometimes poorly engineered algorithms and so this is where you come in wouldn't it be great if people who were already skilled in the creative arts and industries were able to understand and control these types of technologies better what kind of future might that bring and not just for you but for the entire industry this might sound great but also how can someone with a strong creative background develop the necessary skills to become future leaders in developing creative economies and technologies MSC data science and artificial intelligence for the creative industries offers BA arts and humanities graduates the opportunity to reorient their studies to an applied stem discipline in a creative industries context the course gives you the opportunity to learn computing and data science skills from the ground up and it allows you to do this in ways that are relevant for how the creative industries are changing in response to the challenges and opportunities made available by AI and machine learning they also introduces you to practical approaches to AI and machine learning that you might not have thought you could do before the program trains you to use and control the key technologies required to develop a highly practical understanding of data science and AI for the creative industries and also for the creative arts and media the course will give you a solid grounding in core mathematics statistics algorithms and programming delivered by a AI and machine learning experts who work in the creative industries all the time that creative computing Institute our staff have decades of experience using data science and AI in the creative industries and also in training creative people to develop real-world computer science and engineering competencies so what will the course do for you well the course enables you to transform your educational experience by providing you with stem training relevant to your existing expertise in creative arts and industries they will equip you with a range of advanced computational approaches to the exploration of data science questions it will also give you an advanced grounding in data science AI and machine learning technologies text systems image making systems sounds and other forms of media it will improve your critical awareness as well and your ability to think creatively and critically about the ethics that are impacting our industry as we adopt these new technologies the course will prepare you to become a professional data scientist an AI expert who can work within the creative industries to transform what is possible in the future of media so what exactly will you be studying if you choose to take a course in data science and AI for the creative industries at the creative computing Institute I'm going to give you a quick overview of each of the units that you'll be doing and give you a bit more detailed information the unit's I'm going to be covering are stem for creatives introduction to data science natural language processing for the creative industries artificial intelligence for media data science for the creative industries personalization and machine learning and the final thesis project these are the units that make up the entire program for MSC data science and AI for the creative industries so the first unit I'm going to talk about is stem for creatives stem for creatives is an introductory stem conversion bootcamp for arts and humanities graduates stem stands for science technology engineering and maths and this part of the course introduces core science engineering maths principles techniques and methods required to undertake the stem data science courses later in the program the unit is taught by STEM academics who have worked in the creative industries including film music TV fashion advertising and journalism so if these are the kinds of backgrounds where you've been working you know that the person who's going to be teaching you understands what exact stem approaches are more relevant for your chosen area of study in addition this isn't just a course to turn you from a creative into a scientist and its author not intended to tell you everything there is to know about science what it is is a boot camp it's a way for you to slowly begin to understand the kinds of approaches which are essential for doing stem style work in your chosen field following that we have an introduction to data science the introduction to data science unit uses programming approaches in languages such as Python to deliver introductory training the sorts of topics were covering in this course include statistics structuring data which includes acquiring data and cleaning data and organizing it into databases analyzing data using algorithms in particular with large data sets what we call big data you'll also be introduced to the idea of topic modeling which is often used to analyze large amounts of text for example social media sites but most importantly this course gives you a thorough introduction to data ethics data handling and general data protection regulation which is some of the most important material you can begin to understand when embarking on a course of this kind following this you'll be learning natural language processing for the creative industries this course introduces ways in which natural language processing or NLP is used in the creative industries through a critical exploration of NLP practices in contexts including customer service customer insights data journalism and communications you will use Python and JavaScript to develop approaches for text analysis text generation chat bot creation and other conversational interfaces developing an understanding of how these approaches are used in real-world contexts the course helps students develop an understanding of how to create and use chatbots text analysis systems text generators and simple conversational interfaces whilst also introducing simple and practical techniques including web scraping web spidering word counting keyword extraction auto summarization and a range of other interesting techniques one of the most exciting courses in the program is artificial intelligence for media this class introduces students to practical artificial intelligence tools such as tensorflow and pi torch for signal processing classification regression and creative approaches such as style transfer image generation and video generation using neural networks you will explore machine learning techniques including the use of convolutional neural networks autoencoders generative adversarial networks or ganz picks to pick systems and video to video systems including other media specific approaches for example for audio generation speech generation and other types of media you will benefit from training from senior CCI researchers with experience working across industrial product teams including at places like Google brain but also in other areas of the creative industries such as the music industry and the film and video industries television broadcast and radio the data science in the creative industries program is about your relationship with industry partners the unit is taught in partnership with industry partners directly from the creative industries in particular those who make use of data science and AI approaches as part of their everyday work this includes people in advertising people in music technology in broadcast partners present industry case studies to you in data science approaches to product development and applied approaches to campaign insight customer interfaces media analysis and generation and this might include the creation of large scale exhibition design approaches including for experiences in museums and galleries and collections or large-scale public experiences and viral videos the course provides students with a strong real-world understanding of how data science and AI is impacting on the creative industries by situating data science and AI approaches in that context by professionals through describing what they actually do this part of the course is assessed through si so you'll write a critical essay on the work that you've experienced and through discussion with creative industries partners another very exciting unit that you do on this course is personalization and machine learning through the use of relevant industry standard languages including Python and JavaScript this computing experience enables you to build and deploy systems for recommendation and personalization based on a range of approaches the course introduces core concepts in information retrieval including feature representations feature extraction data sets of features similarity and distance metrics in multi-dimensional space search and ranking now this is a hugely problematic area and it really requires a lot of thought I think we've all experienced what we might call poor recommendations so that means it's a wide-open area and a great place for people in the creative industries to expand develop and improve you will learn common programming approaches to the design of recommender systems including content-based filtering and collaborative filtering you will learn to understand core techniques including audience analysis via data-driven methods including clustering and regression and examining the impact of interdisciplinary approaches to data science via psychological constructs finally you will undertake a thesis project in data science and AI for the creative industries you can do more or less anything you want in a thesis project but here are some ideas of some things you might choose to do you might choose to build your own artificial intelligence system to make films media music or artworks you might choose to challenge contemporary thinking about how data science and AI can be used in the creative industries and beyond you might choose to shed light on ethical issues around personalization data rights surveillance consumerism and social justice from a more powerful and more informed perspective you might bring insights to the debate around augmentation versus automation for developing new approaches to creative working environments and you might choose to consider how you can change the way data and machine learning impacts culture and society in order to shed more light on all of these areas and to give you a better idea of the kinds of people who you'd be learning with I've interviewed dr. Rebecca fee brink who is reader at ul creative computing Institute Rebeca fee bring great to see you great to see you Mick Pearson thanks for agreeing to talk it's going to be exciting chat about data science and artificial intelligence in the creative industries there's lots and lots of things that we could talk about but specifically I thought it'd be great to get your view on the kinds of work that people are doing in the quick of industries in different areas and what those problems might be and also you know the kinds of problems of those people are tackling and and how that might change in the future that's so that's correct what I thought the conversation could be about I thought it would be great to start by saying you know what kind of changes might AI endanger science have on how music is made in the future great I'm glad glad you asked that so I think I'll start out by saying that a lot of the popular conversation in this space has been around how AI and machine learning in particular are becoming better and better at generating new music or generating other forms of art for that matter and the conversation then tends to get steered toward this this very specific view of the future where it's machines who are being creative and it's humans who are doing the consuming of this creative content and that's sort of the end of the story and that's you know I see that as a very not just dystopian but rather uninteresting kind of future that isn't to say there isn't interesting work being done I think the the recent it's a jukebox example aig box from open AI shows some really interesting things that you can do with automated composition methods and yes machines are in fact getting better and better at the problem of learning from a large set of music and then generating new music that sounds like music and that set for instance but I want to back away from that a little bit and share how I think about this space which is really you know AI and machine learning have become you fill in so many domains because they're essentially just a set of tools for for making sense of data and doing new types of things more quickly with data and we can think about them as tools for learning about patterns and data and then seeing patterns that allow them to make predictions about what might happen in the future or we can look at them as tools for learning about patterns and data and then generating new data with those same patterns or several other things and so you know yes it's true that we could look at music itself as a bunch of data and we could generate new music that looks similar to something that we have in a data set but that's just one of hundreds thousands of different things that you could do with data and machine learning in music that are really interesting I think there's you know there's certainly a big space for technology to change leap of the ways that people make music and listen to music and do all sorts of other peripheral tasks related to music when we think about all the different kinds of data that might be involved so for instance you know we have in recording of music we have different tracks that have been recorded those could you know we could think about those as data and manipulate those in certain ways we have the way that people edit Mixmaster tracks that itself those human actions are data that we might collect and then for instance use prediction to predict how someone white might mix or master a new set of tracks or we might use data from individual instruments to quickly identify what what instruments are present in a new recording and automatically you know use that to inform the way that you know that that mixing or editing is happening and so isotope has had some tools in this space for a few years now that essentially say hey we've got these opportunities to make some aspects of the music Korea in process either easier and faster for for experts or give novices the ability to start doing useful work in that space on these tasks where there's maybe a steep learning curve and we can look at similar tasks all throughout the the composition and creation process whether it's you know say hey I want to play a riff into my computer and have it come up with a bass line or a drum track for that riff there's all sorts of other I think even more interesting ways that we can use machine learning to support exploratory actions in music not just saying well machine learning can make you do the right thing better and you know more quickly but to help machine learning machine learning to help people say hey what's what's in this space of creative possibilities that I haven't found yet so for instance we already have machine learning algorithms that allow you to play a little bit of melody or you know play a bass or a drum track and then say you know how might this be continued or what other content might go with this and maybe you never use that right maybe you're not you know using the AI to literally finish your composition for you but you could use it as a way to say hey you know what I am now listening to my own material in a slightly different way I'm now thinking about other directions that I could move this content in and again there have been tools that do that for a few years now that are really easy to use magenta studio is one of them that anybody can go download and use with Ableton or use with MIDI and then for instance in my own work I do a totally different set of things with machine learning where we might want to model how somebody is moving when they play music as a performer or model how a dancer is moving in a performance or model how the sound of an instrument is changing over time and then use that not to you know literally generate more of the same type of data but to build a machine system that makes decisions based on that content or Maps to a different domain so for instance I could use machine learning to move in a certain way as a performer and trade a computer to produce certain types of sounds in response to certain movements or to produce certain lighting changes in response to a dancer or produce certain you know choreography in response to an acoustic musician or any number of other other things so there's a huge space here and once you realize that lots of different things can be thought of as data then you really see there's a lot of possible there's a lot of things there but I think the couple of really exciting things that you said already thought about very often and in relation to data science and AI in particular the notion that music and media and all kinds of things that you think of as ordinary creative outputs that's data right so doing any kind of scientific operation on any kind of media you experience that's data science right massive amounts of audio data massive amounts of video data all over the Internet and that's not something people normally think about right right the other thing there is you know the notion that you're we're talking about entirely new types of creative possibilities entirely new ways of making art that people haven't considered before that aren't just about getting a machine to automatically generate stuff it's actually about creating a completely different slant a different perspective so yeah that's super exciting I wanted to ask you another question about this but more to do with how we listen to music and other forms of media how we enjoy that media you know so how is that working at the moment and you know what's actually going on behind the scenes in terms of how people's listening and entertainment habits are changing because of AI in data science yeah so one simple way to think about it again is realizing that there are all sorts of streams of data that a company like you know Google on you within YouTube or a company like Spotify has access to and and can use to try to make predictions about what you might enjoy listening to and so a really simple way of framing this problem is to say well I've listened to these things in the past maybe I've used these search terms and the prediction problem here is to predict white you know what might I want to listen to next in this playlist at this moment or what might I enjoy discovering at some point in the near future and we've got that data this you know listening and search histories from millions of people and from that we can find some patterns about you know what people have listened to what you've listened to and you know if if you like artists artists X Y Zed and you know a million other people like artists X Y Z and ay then you know predicting that you might enjoy listening to a is is maybe a safe bet right so frame that way it's actually I think pretty simple to understand and of course there's all sorts of ways that researchers at these types of companies are thinking about how to make that even better right more suited to your individual moment in which you are listening taking into account other factors that might be predictive of what you might enjoy it seems to me that there are what you're saying is really exciting where there's loads of really great ways that we could use customization personalization recommendation to help us find new forms of entertainment and the creative industries have to do this and they're doing it well but what sort of problems exists in that space where isn't it working I think there's been a very productive attention drawn in the last few years to YouTube in particular the way that you might start out watching a particular genre video on YouTube and then within a few steps you might be pulled into a black hole of you know something that you didn't exactly sign up for whether that's you know extremist political propaganda or you know just really bad music obviously the the first is is a bigger social problem than the second but they're both manifestations of the same underlying principle and that when you use these automated algorithms it is fundamentally different than you know talking to your friend and say hey you know I've been listening to this band lately I know you like them what else should I listen to an algorithm might give you a really great nish answer and tell you a band that your friend has never heard of or they might you know might give you a really bring you to a dark place and we don't have human oversight most of the time there isn't somebody at Spotify saying oh well you know mix mix recommendations this week includes you know this this whatever right-wing propaganda you know polka maybe he won't like that we'll cross that off the list and at the same time many of the the algorithms being designed aren't necessarily designed to make it easy for people to retrospective we look at them and say you know where did this algorithm itself go wrong or how might we tune the algorithm to to make this less likely not to say there isn't a whole lot that people have the ability to do to fix these types of problems but you know it's there are some open research challenges here yeah so there's kind of a lot of scope for making these systems backside basically absolutely I do think people with good domain knowledge if people really understand the arts and the humanities if people really understand media please well do you think the kind of work that they will do in in the data science industry particularly around you know recommendations do you think it would be improved oh I absolutely think it would be improved I think and you know that's one of the reasons that I'm really excited about the new program that we are offering because you know I I'm trained as a computer scientist I'm a musician as well but you know most of my computer science training was very conventional and when you take a machine learning course or an information retrieval course as a computer science student you're thinking very algorithmically you're thinking about the elegance of the algorithms the the really exciting ability to suddenly you know see the world as data as I mentioned and take these powerful tools and apply them to new Prague and that's intellectually incredibly satisfying but it's also fundamentally removed from you know what does that data mean what is the the social context of that data what is the cultural context of that data who is the user of your system and even within computer science there's often a gap between the people developing machine learning algorithms and studying you know data science applications of those algorithms and people in what I would call my field of human-computer interaction who think about usability who think about social impact who think about the consequences of how these technologies are designed and how they're deployed and you know if somebody is coming into this domain with already an understanding of you know of music or of other content or of you know the social and creative goals that they you know may have then suddenly they're not going to be pulled as easily into that tunnel vision of saying well this is just about the algorithm and it's just about the data and that opens up I think new ideas for how these algorithms can be deployed but as well as new ways of thinking about solutions when things you know might go wrong you know saying all right we don't necessarily need a new algorithm to fix this we don't need to wait for computer science researchers to do 10 more years of work in this area we can you know use our understanding of the domain and our understanding of the users and make something that works better right now because it's that's the right thing to do and that's an amazing opportunity for people who have a good background in creative industries and then are coming to this this subject with all about knowledge already in place which is the knowledge that industry actually needs to get these problems right that's fantastic um I want to kind of change topic a little bit and talk about journalism as kind of as an application area for AI in data science and I was wondering how important you feel ai and data science are to field such as journalism and what kind of impacts it's likely to have on journalism in the future that's a great question I think that I have a skeptical way of looking at this and maybe a more optimistic way of looking at it a number of people have have been quite vocal about how social media and the sort of data fication of journalism can lead to very strange changes to incentive structures when you think about the data that's collected oh sorry yes so 50 years ago if you were a journalist and you wrote an article for a newspaper that article would get you know mailed out to people in the newspaper and peopled by that newspaper and you had a very weak feedback signal about you know how that article may have impacted the public you know most of the time either you know sales of the newspaper went up or down you got maybe some personal feedback from your boss and your colleagues but you didn't know how many people read that article you didn't know whether they liked it or hated it or got a friend to read it and so on whereas now you could you know even be writing for a fairly conventional newspaper or magazine or similar outlet but writing online and metrics are being collected about every single way that somebody interacts with that piece of content you know who reads it do they share it do they tweet or you know write about it and that's a very strong feedback signal and you know at the surface that may seem like a really good thing you could say well hey I can find out you know what responds with my readers and I can do more of that there's a lot of dangers here though that that intersect with the dangers of social media more generally people like Jaron Lanier for instance have talked about how people are more likely to interact with content online when it provokes strong emotions and in particular strong negative emotions so if you're writing work that just you know gets people agitated about some particular thing even if it's not necessarily enriching their worldview or in encouraging them to consider an issue in a more nuanced way you may see that you get much more Attraction and so that again is giving a strong feedback signal and and likewise incentives in the ad revenue that you're likely to get by sticking ads on pages that are read more frequently that you know that is you know goes back to not only the publication itself but may may go back to the person who wrote that piece so it's it's a it's a strange landscape of incentives that don't necessarily align with what a journalist might you know deep down want to achieve or what their readership might want from that from that journalism so there's a kind of a capacity for AI and data science to pull the industry away from its real core it's call reason for existing you know it's and as a result that may be you know that could lead to an entirely different well tip to the to the industry suffering as a result the information content for example might reduce and the incentives might not match readers requirements and so people might just stop reading or certain kinds of wieners would just leave what that content stream all together and then you might lose influence of a certain type and there's all sorts interactions right and I think there are analogs to this in in other types of media where we are able to measure things like engagement and then again people who aren't necessarily keeping an eye on what they're their ultimate goals are for you know for that content or for that relationship with consumers of that content it's it's very easy to then just become narrowly focused on the things that are easy to measure and that can lead you into strange places right so that's interesting and so in a way having people who are passionate and who care deeply about communication and specific aspects of communication in what we might think of as a traditional kind of creative industries fashion could be really super useful for improving the quality in the overall delivery of information in the digital age with data science and they are absolutely and you know I see the role they're in in a few different ways one is just you know people who are you know bringing reflective and strongly held values to the table are going to make a difference in this space people who know the limitations of the metrics that are used and don't necessarily assume that the metrics aligned with those values also you know bring something important but furthermore people who have been trained to understand these algorithmic techniques more deeply and even have the ability to to change them to build on them to imagine hey what else might we measure with this data that opens up a very exciting new space right because all it takes is for one or two small but significant changes to be made to those algorithms and those incentive structures and then the industry might shift again in a different direction and so that's why it becomes exciting to explore these areas because it's a really wide open Wild West scenario with an opportunity to change we're sure and again the change I don't think that change is going to come from just waiting for computer scientists to develop new algorithms it's absolutely going to come from people who are working on the ground in these industries and saying what is it that we really want to achieve with the data science that we're using so it's really clear that the creative industries stand to benefit greatly from having people with really strong domain knowledge in creative industries working in data science and AI in those businesses but what about the advantages for those people like if you're a creative industries person if you are a fine artist or sculptor or maybe you did journalism or maybe you as a big music or filmmaking what are the advantages for you going into a career in data science for the creative industries I think there's a there's a few knits gonna be different for different people but you know for me what I would say is number one I find a lot of the algorithmic work the analysis of data fundamentally interesting it's really interesting to take this different perspective on on media that we're intimately familiar with and say what you know what new possibilities does this suggest for how we might interact with this content how we might create this content but then you know beyond there's just you know finding it intellectually fascinating there's a new toolbox that begins to open up even with just a little bit of understanding of the algorithms and you know some practice in programming especially with you know some toolkits that are out there to allow you know people to start playing with data it begins to be possible not only to become a better and better critic of these algorithms more able to offer substitute substantive useful critique of what they are doing and how they're you doing it and proposing alternatives but also this brings the ability to start appropriating these algorithms and applying them in ways that computer scientists maybe didn't intend them to be applied in ways that they're not conventionally used in data science to start doing really creative things whether that's you know exploring new ways of making art with them exploring new ways of getting data about you know about people who are impacted by by something that you want to engage with as a journalist by communicating about data in ways that are maybe more accessible to your audiences and bringing you know bringing data out beyond just an internal tool that you use to optimize your own processes or create your own content but bringing that out as something that that other people engage with alongside you there's all sorts of empowering possibilities that come with a bit of knowledge and skill yeah so gaining that new knowledge and gaining those new skills give you power right it gives you power to go in and transform industry and change what it does so if you're sitting at home thinking you know what none of this is the way I think it should be or it sounds really exciting and I want to be part of that change then it seems like it seems like an opportunity right that's fantastic well I think that's a really great set of answers to some really interesting and stimulating questions and problems thanks very much Rebecca and yeah it's great to know that you al CCI there'll be people like you teaching this kind of work I'm looking forward to it thanks Vic hello everyone thank for watching my name is Dylan the creative learning producer and just wanted to say thank you make first a different reduction about the course it was great to hear from you of units and hear from Rebecca well now it's the time for the Q&A so I would encourage everyone watching to just drop us any any question you might have any doubt if you want some guidance on maybe the application or you want to know more about how the course is gonna it's gonna work now's your chance so while we wait for people to reach out to us I thought we could go through a few questions here that hopefully are gonna be useful for students to hear if that sounds good for you make we're gonna go ahead with that I am yes could you share with what kind of background in programming do students need in order to apply to this course yeah that's a good question I think a lot of people when they think about doing a course like this I mean it's a conversion course right so we're we're sort of saying you don't need any background in programming you know if you rock up and you've not had a chance to really explore programming before but you want to and you think you're ready then the course is structured to support you specifically to get you into that process it's a conversion so we do that with you we hold your hand right from the very beginning and we've designed the course so that it will get you into that way of thinking as quickly as possible into that mode of computational thinking so yeah we I would say that we you don't need to have any however if you've had a bit of experience programming that's definitely going to be useful and you know there's all kinds of ways you can do that it doesn't have to be extensive but if you've done a bit of webpage design or if you've worked on you know with some CSS a bit of JavaScript or if you've had a little play with some Python before yes that helps because any kind of any preparatory what we can do beforehand you know that that's going to that will make it easier for you in some ways but yeah if you came and you didn't have any idea you'd be fine amazing thanks for that make we've got a question from Jason Reed on the chat that says are there any plans to offer the course to students on a part-time basis yes there are we ul has the ability to offer courses at masters level on a part-time basis and we would support students particularly if if you've got I mean there are really good reasons for studying part-time if you have a job already and you want to keep that if your employer wants to wants you to skill up and willing to help me pay as well that's also good we don't want people to have to leave their job in order to study on that note we are also hoping to make some of these units available for people wanting to do continuous professional development in particular we already have a future loan course live and we're going to make a new feature loan course in the next few weeks which is just a you know a taster of the first few weeks to give you an idea of what it would be like so I think what we want to do really is yeah sure we want to support part-time and we also want to support people with different backgrounds and different commitments so they can study at their own pace and we're working hard to make sure we can do that lovely week thanks for that it would also be useful to know how important will it be for students to have access to a high end computer whilst undertaking the course that's an excellent question and I think it's um fundamentally the way that I think one way to think about this is yes sure you know when you start a course it's always good to think to make sure you have the materials but you know some people might say oh yeah but it's AI and data science and you've got a crunch a lot of numbers and that's true however the CCI has servers specifically for students which allow you access so if you have a computer which is which is okay you know you can access the Internet then we'll have a provision which will allow you to get access to a more powerful machinery and you know perhaps even remotely so you'd be able to log in and use or high-powered machinery as part of the learning process so that's an aim for us we want to be able to support people without them having to shell out thousands of pounds on new hardware and particularly you know in the kinds of contexts we're in now that's something which is really important for us so the answer is of course you know the more powerful your own home computer is the easier it is for you to welcome home but if you can't then an ordinary computer would be fine and we will provide you with even remote tools which allow you to undertake the course even in a way which requires high-performance computer that's good to know thanks meek um is anything students can do to prepare Priya for starting the course yeah that's a good question too as I was saying you know you don't have to have any programming skills necessarily when you start but one it might be a good idea to maybe spend some time having a look at some introductory programming tutorials and we can definitely forward some to you so if you're interested in doing some more preparation work then get in touch with us we can point you to some of the tutorials and some of the learning materials that we've made freely available for people in particular we have a JavaScript crash course which is entirely free and that we've launched alongside our future learn courses and you can just take that anyone can take that doesn't cost you anything you can just go straight to our platform and if you want to know how to get started then you can just do that but also we can give you a list of other resources that might be very useful if you've never done anything like this before and you just want to kind of gauge how much you how difficult you think it's gonna be so yeah like I said we've got we have got the future loan programs which you can use and you can try and they're going to be rolling out there'll be more of those but also if you you can do our online courses that we've made available for free just on our own platforms and if you need even more stuff get in touch with us and we'll give you we can give you some good materials amazing thank you meek um thinking about what happens after finishing the course it would be very useful to hear more about what kind of job Unity's good students half after after world becoming graduates right so I think I mean I do have some statistics about the job opportunities and without wanting to bore everyone it's you know I think it would it's worthwhile saying that the government's own figures show that there's a two hundred thousand employees shortfall in skills but these precise skills for precisely these areas right so there's two hundred thousand people in the UK that we need for these jobs and they're not available according to the Department of Culture Media and Sport that was so that reports a few years old now but that was their prediction there's not well there has been a massive investment to try to encourage and develop people to have skills in these areas but it's not been massively successful I think there's much more to do what that means is is there's a lot of work there's a mass amount of work and its strategic importance for the UK I think what's more important is that in the creative industries people in advertising in television and film and in music and in journalism they're crying out for these skills they really need people who understand how to talk machine learning and that's kind of I think what I think the difficulty there is finding a course which is really relevant to people who are working in those fields or who are already trained in those fields and that's all we've been working on you know how can we there's jobs available right ad agencies need those jobs need people who can do that work film companies and designers and all these different you know not just in London but across the UK people working in creative industries they need staff who can you understand art understands creativity but also understand you know data mining and so yeah we've worked hard to try and put that together that's our offer and yeah I think particularly if you come and we'll show you with us there's an opportunity for you to spread your wings a bit and find a place in the future quite of industries right here amazing week thank you so talking about the project is that students will have the chance to develop during the course for example good students make machine learning artworks as part of their final project yeah yeah yeah they could I mean I think we we want we want to people to be as free as possible in their final project to explore areas that are important to them and support them in doing so and the people on the on the staff team got a lot of experience in different areas including in computational installation art you know recommendation engines for music and film companies you know image processing and audio processing natural language processing for journalism and so we can support work in all of those fields and we want to do that but we don't want to dictate what it is that you choose to do because I think that's part of the problem is like Rebecca was saying in the interview you know if you if you see things in just one way it's very easy to become very narrow what the industry needs is people with very different approaches people who see things differently to diversify the workforce and make it more relevant to more people and that's really important for us so part of that is allowing people to do whatever it is they want and supporting them to do whatever it is they think is important it's the cultural aspects and the societal aspects that are missing from people from data science and artificial intelligence it's that's what you know that's where there are so many problems and yeah so yeah you could make a film you can make make music you could just produce a series of portraits put on an exhibition make a vr AR system you could also choose to write something write a data science thesis and construct a piece of research around misinformation campaigns or the way that for example image analytically uses the notion of creatives to to build misinformation campaigns all of these things are interesting areas to explore and I think need to be explored by people who have a new way of seeing the world amazing thanks for for your words make also on a more practical level could you maybe talk a bit how the course is gonna be assessed oh yeah so this I mean if there's good news and bad news here depending on your point of view so the assessment of I mean I think I mentioned in the slides that there's one unit which is assessed by RSA and that's the one where there's much more influence from the industry right where you you're kind of talking to people who are working in AI in industry in the creative industries and then writing about what they have done critically and thinking about what it means so there's an opportunity for that but also I think yeah there are there is a mixture on top of that for most of the unit's 50% exam 50% practical so the practical outputs are I think massively important you know you need to be able to build things so an awful lot of work that you'll do in most of the units will be projects right you build something even if it's just a toy right it's just something which it doesn't have to be perfect but it's just a way to demonstrate what you've learned and will hold your hand there we'll give you examples and sometimes you'll be able to construct things from different components that we give you and that will be the assessment on top of that I think it's important that you do understand the theoretical scientific and data science underpinnings that we've taught you and so we will have exams for some units to test that so - mixture right you've got there's so many say work there's definitely the final project which is all just written and maybe you know some tools that you've built then there's a lot of practical work a large amount of practical work so the majority of it is critical writing and practical work but there are also some exams just to make sure that you're meeting that threshold and to find out to make sure we can support you so you can meet the group requirements of the program lovely Mick thank you we've got a question on the chat that says does mathematics and statistics come in prayer because it skills for the course you mean before you rejoin no like of course it's good if you've got a background in maths and it's good as you got a background sistex and that will help you but the stem for creatives unit is designed to help bring you up to speed I mean I can tell you a personal story here my background was in the arts and humanities and my my GCSE maths was a grade C and it was very difficult for me to get up to speed with the maths and stats when I started my PhD but I did that you know and and it's just required a shift in my thinking and so a lot of people who'll be teaching you they'll have Bella they'll be aware of that shift in thinking and what's required to do it so much of its just about the application right so it's not a it's not a prerequisite and we know how to help people who have not thought about things that way before learn that material and in really useful meaningful ways which is why there's so much practical work that you'll be doing on the course so it's not a prerequisite of course if you already have that background it's going to be massively helpful but then you might find that you're really good at maths but you struggle to think about the you know the creative possibilities when you're doing project work so you know it's a balance right it's a balance of skills amazing Thank You meek I think we're almost done with this session today I just wanted to clarify how long is the course gonna be yet so the course itself our masters programs are a bit longer than other masters programs so normally a master's program would be 12 months but ours is 15 months and the reason for that is it allows you to do a really substantial project alongside other masters students who are coming in in that so you kind of you come in September and then if you're full-time you do the whole year and then you do another September to December and you'd have other masters students who are new and fresh and green working with you and also staff who are working on research projects supporting you whilst you're there often I mean we think that's better because often the final project is over the summer when you and you're on your own where's the way we do it you're wither cohort even at that point way of finalizing your project work so the course is a bit longer than usual which is better value for money actually and also you get much more much more attention in the farm stages of year of your project amazing make thanks so much I think that's all for today we haven't received any more questions so I think we'll call it a session now thanks thanks so much Mike for your contribution today just a reminder that this session is gonna be available to watch or we watch anytime on our youtube channel subscribe you you haven't done it yet to receive notifications on future events and future sessions we're running we've got an MSc internet equality's session coming up tomorrow so you can sign up on our Eventbrite or just guarantee fiction on YouTube and yeah we're running a lot of after-school sessions open to everyone so just feel free to join any of these online activities we're doing and yeah if you have any question about the course we're always available at CCI at arts dot dot uk' so we're always there too yet to answer any doubts you might have so yeah I think that's all for today thanks everyone for watching and thank you Mike for your contribution and yeah we'll see you in the Internet
