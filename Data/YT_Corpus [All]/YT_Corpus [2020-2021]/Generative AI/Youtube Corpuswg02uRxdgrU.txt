 what a crazy here too much great work to sum up in one video let's dive in and see what happened in the field of artificial intelligence in 2019 the exponential growth of AI made this year full of hype and excitement, big player like Google Amazon open AI Nvidia and Microsoft have blown our minds with many breathtaking projects like this one you must have heard about alpha star from google deepmind we have to mention that Starcraft has been a big challenge for artificial intelligence but at the beginning of 2019 deepmind announced that alpha star is the first artificial intelligence to defeat a top professional Starcraft player but they don't stop here and in last October alpha star reached Grandmaster level in the game using the same game maps and conditions as human players including viewing the world through a camera and stronger limits on the frequency of its actions a fantastic game from alpha star separte it looks like you know the game to look very strong but this this game overall it was like not exactly human clava a lot of respect fantastic control on the unit's, still in the gaming field with open AI after its defeat in 2018 open AI 5 kept training and playing against itself for over $10,000 DOTA 2 matches with large-scale deep reinforcement learning and in April it became the first artificial intelligence to beat the world champions in an eSports game after winning two games against the world champion dota 2 teams in 2019 artificial-intelligence managed to bring pictures to life we have seen a lot of stuff around deep fakes and generative adversarial networks but to blow our minds in Maine 2019 Samsung created an artificial intelligence system that can transform facial images into video sequences by using the generative adversarial networks to create deep fake videos just by taking one picture as an input researchers from Samsung used high fidelity natural image synthesis to enable machine learning models to create realistic human expressions but we didn't finish yet we're a team of researchers from Stanford University Max Planck Institute and Adobe Research created an algorithm for editing talking head videos by only editing text of the video by adding and deleting words I love the smell of napalm in the morning I love the smell of french toast in the morning so now we are creating very realistic deep fakes but how can we differentiate the real from the unreal again we use artificial intelligence we use deep fake detector algorithms which are getting better every day and we'll have a great breakthrough in the near future due to the deep fake detecting challenge from Facebook Amazon and Microsoft one of the great steps in our quest towards artificial intelligence is the commercial availability of quantum computers with the introduction of Amazon BRAKET which is a fully managed service that enables developers to build test and run quantum computing algorithms and one of the biggest enhancements from Google that auto machine learning vision edge is now able to detect objects it can now perform object detection as well as image classification all directly on the edge device another breakthrough from open AI as the GPT2 model which has a language model that can generate natural language texts similar to that created by humans the GPT2 can generate sentences and paragraphs that are indistinguishable from human generated content and again from open AI and achieving dexterity of movement by solving Rubik's Cube using a single robotic hand by using automatic domain randomization to simulate the complex environment of the real world with all physical factors such as elasticity and friction it really changes the way we think about training in general-purpose robots moving from thinking too much about the actual arguments and start thinking about how do we create complex enough worlds where they can learn artificial intelligence playing hide-and-seek and also learning to use objects where artificial intelligence agent competed against each other and the game of hide-and-seek and after massive number of games they learned astonishing strategies such as using objects and manipulating the digital environment in this world they learn to construct their own shelter from scratch requiring that they arrange multiple objects into precise structures creating a high quality beautiful landscapes based on just some lines this one really blew my mind out of my head look how artistic and beautiful the final paintings are 3d human post-detection using artificial intelligence with self supervised learning also detecting the pose of a human being behind the wall and in robotics we saw a tossing robot that learned to throw objects in a targeted spot and character scene interactions and animation using a data-driven framework motivate characters to achieve gold driving actions with precise scene interactions such as sitting on a chair carrying a small box or interacting with obstacles and it's a must to mention the great robotic advancements from Boston Dynamics and the big shout out here to that hilarious CGI video from corridor I almost forgot to mention the autonomy race between google waymoTesla uber and other self-driving car companies I think we are waiting for the first fully autonomous car in 2020 we must also honor the winners of the Turing award Geoffrey Hinton the father of deep learning Yann LeCun the cheif artificial intelligence scientist at Facebook Yoshua Bengio the co-founder of artificial intelligence company element AI inc and we must say thank you to the great artificial intelligence YouTube channels two minute papers where the complexity is simplified dear fellow scholars this is two minute papers with károly on IIFA here singularity prosperity with the best videos out there on artificial intelligence Lex Friedman and his awesome podcast Robert miles the artificial intelligence ethics and safety expert it was a mind-blowing year I'm sure I missed a lot of important events and great research papers but anyway thank you for watching and have a nice day oh and don't forget to subscribe to watch new videos in the future
