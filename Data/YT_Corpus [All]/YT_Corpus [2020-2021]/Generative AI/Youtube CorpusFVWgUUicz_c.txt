 hi thank you for attention to our this work of trying to localize actions in a video without simple annotation we find that traditional methods tend to confuse action and context frames noticing that action and context are different on the representation level we turn the MFE object into the optimization on most classification level and reputation level specifically we use a conditional variational or the encoder to model the reputation of different frames and contact training in another way on Thomas 14 we have an improvement of two points and m-80s 0.5 if you are interested please check our paper and our code on github thank you
